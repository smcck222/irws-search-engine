FT  09 JAN 92 / Japanese banks change strategy: Institute Of Geographers
Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE BANKS in the UK are behaving increasingly like other foreign and
British banks in Britain, the Institute of British Geographers' Conference
in Swansea was told yesterday.
Their lending patterns are starting to resemble those of other banks, said
Mr Adam Tickell, a researcher at Leeds University.
By late last year there were nine Japanese banks with offices outside London
with a total of 26 employees, and 53 banks in the capital with almost 4,000
employees. Japanese banks make up the second-largest concentration of
foreign banks in the UK after those from the US.
The banks moved into the regions in response to lower rents, because of a
desire to make contact with customers outside London, and to follow the
growing importance of regional centres with strong banking presences. The
banks typically said that 50 per cent of their loans went to Japanese
businesses in the UK.
When the banks started in the UK in the mid-1980s, they focused on loans to
the distribution sector, where there was a Japanese presence. However, the
balance of their portfolios now closely resembles lending by other banks.
About 40 per cent of outstanding loans last August were to financial
services companies, with 18 per cent to distribution companies and 18 per
cent to construction and property companies.
Lending by Japanese banks represents 7.5 per cent of all UK resident
lending, defined as lending to domestic organisations.
If London's role as an international financial centre declines and the
Japanese banks move abroad, it could have a fundamental impact on British
business, he said.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Chemicals output set to lift 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS manufacturing will grow by 2 per cent this year. But Mr Richard
Freeman, Imperial Chemical Industries' chief economist warned that
investment will continue to decline sharply, falling 6 per cent compared
with 15 per cent last year.
Any improvement in output will come after a stagnant 1991 and, with most of
the gain expected in the second half of this year, is in line with the
forecasts for much of the rest of British manufacturing.
The demand for chemicals will rise a little faster than GDP, accompanied by
a 3 1/2 per cent growth in imports, compared with 1 per cent last year.
Export growth will slow slightly from 3 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent, said Mr
Freeman at the annual business outlook conference of the UK Chemical
Industries Association.
The UK's performance will be in line with that of the chemicals industry in
the rest of Europe, in spite of a halving of demand for chemicals products
in Germany.
The association warned that some of the government statistics used were
unreliable, and any revisions would probably be downward.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Stress 'not just bosses' disease'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB STRESS is at least as high among blue-collar workers as it is among
executives, the annual occupational psychology conference of the British
Psychological Society was told yesterday.
A study of stress and sickness absence among managers and shopfloor workers
at Scottish and Newcastle Breweries in Edinburgh showed that job stress was
not just a 'bosses' disease', Dr Rosalind Bramwell and Professor Cary Cooper
from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology told
the conference.
Prof Cooper said that companies were often mistakenly concentrating on
white-collar groups when it came to measures to reduce stress. Failure to
recognise stress among manual groups 'must be costing British industry a
fortune in lost working days', he said.
The study found that shopfloor workers were taking 2 1/2 times as many days
off sick compared as their managerial colleagues. Much of the time off could
be linked to stress arising from a sense of being poorly valued, said the
researchers.
Questionnaires were sent to more than 600 employees, from directors to
clerical workers and draymen. Rates of sickness absence were taken from the
brewery's records.
A warning to companies to beware of 'cowboy' publishers of personality and
aptitude tests was made at the conference by Dr Rob Feltham, director of
test publishers ASE.
Tests at the 'cheap and dirty end' of the market ran the risk of being
biased against, for example, Asian and Afro-Caribbean job applicants, he
said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Designers and operators of shopping centres need to respond to the leisure
interests of their customers if they want to retain business, the Institute
of Geographers Conference in Swansea was told.
Shoppers are bored with the 'functional' aspects of shopping and feel that
the pleasure element has been stripped out of it, Mr Peter Newby of
Middlesex Polytechnic said.
A survey of 24 shopping centres opened since 1988 found that all were
offering some form of entertainment in order to create a 'circus in the
mall'. Nearly 90 per cent offered live music and 72 per cent variety acts.
Mr Newby said Sunday trading provided special opportunities for centres to
create leisure activities and a 'carnival atmosphere'.
Centre managers needed to plan annual entertainment strategies and be given
training in how to provide entertainment, he said.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Government quits arbitration agreement
for civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day angered the Civil Service unions by announcing
that it was withdrawing from a 66-year-old Civil Service arbitration
agreement and sending details of the continuing negotiations over pay
restructuring direct to the 500,000 civil servants who will be affected.
Withdrawal from the agreement will make little practical difference as the
government has not participated in the voluntary system since 1982.
But Mr Peter Jones, secretary of the Council of Civil Service Unions, said
the decision was 'part of a piece' with the government's more aggressive
stance on making Civil Service pay more flexible.
'The government appears determined to remove any element of fairness from
the settlement of Civil Service pay and other matters which have
traditionally been settled against the background of access to arbitration
being available,' he said.
Negotiations over increasing the performance element in Civil Service pay
and delegating pay bargaining to departments or executive agencies were not
proceeding well, he added. Unions were 'very annoyed' at the Treasury's
decision to release their 'confidential proposals' to civil servants.
The most controversial aspect of the proposals is abolition of the current
system of automatic progression up a pay scale with progress based on
performance. 'The principal change in these proposals will be to create a
regular and direct link between your performance and your pay,' the briefing
note to civil servants says. 'For those of you with management
responsibilities your judgment of your staff's performance will have a
direct impact on their pay in every case.'
There are also plans to dismantle the system of grading, and introduce more
pay bands. This will be 'an administrative nightmare', according to Mr Bill
Brett, general secretary of of the IPMS specialist Civil Service union.
The briefing says that for professional, scientific and technical grades,
the current pay 'spine' would remain, but the scale and range of each grade
would be replaced by a pay band. It continues: 'Each band would have a
number of steps usually equal to a quarter of a spine point. Annual
increments up to the scale maximum and progression beyond and up to the
current range maximum would be replaced by performance-related progression
throughout the pay band.'
For executive and clerical grades, the present automatic progression up a
pay scale followed by access to 'range points' for those who had reached the
maximum would be replaced by progression dependent on performance within a
range for the grade.
The move would not mean that civil servants who had not been performing well
would receive no annual pay rise, but they would not automatically move into
new pay bands.
But the note adds: 'In addition to performance-related pay, provision is
being made for departments and agencies to seek approval to develop their
own pay and grading systems. Such new systems, in addition to central
approval, will have to be negotiated with the unions concerned.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Power chief makes concessions on price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BAKER, chief executive of National Power, yesterday offered an olive
branch to his opponents in the argument about electricity prices.
At a meeting of the Major Energy Users Council (Meuc), which has lobbied
fiercely for lower electricity prices, Mr Baker defended National Power's
pricing, but said that he recognised the problems that large consumers
faced.
He put forward specific proposals for keeping prices down:
Large consumers should refuse to subsidise coal through the electricity
price, and should be vigilant about the nuclear levy, which typically added
11 per cent to bills.
They should watch how much they were charged by regional electricity
companies for using electricity wires, since rates of return in that
business were far higher than anything generators earned.
They should also press for cuts in metering charges, which form a big chunk
of their bill. Mr Baker said it was important to deregulate the market as
quickly as possible, and to axe existing limits on how much power generators
could sell, so customers could shop around more, he said.
Consumers should also press for a more open market in electricity contracts,
he advised. Most electricity is sold on contract, but so far the pool or
wholesale market has been the focus of attention.
He said that customers should also think hard about why so many new
gas-fired power stations were being built, forcing out cheaper coal-fired
stations. Because these new stations have contracts which allow them to pass
costs on to captive domestic consumers, he implied, they can force out coal
stations, pushing up prices for larger consumers.
Mr Baker pointed out that most industrialists complained that high UK
electricity prices made them uncompetitive in Europe. If this was so, he
said, they should challenge subsidised European prices in Brussels.
'But I detect a note of reluctance from many of you who are recipients of
these prices in Europe,' he said.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Pressure for changes to accountancy institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS are pressing their main professional body to change
fundamentally the way it operates by dividing in two.
A group of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales is calling for a separate body to represent members' interests,
alongside the institute's role of upholding professional standards.
A paper has been circulated to district societies and members of the
institute's council, its ruling body. It argues that the institute cannot
fulfil both functions and calls on it to establish a new organisation with
salaried directors to offer commercial services such as indemnity insurance,
and to lobby on behalf of the profession. The council's annual conference
begins today.
The charter of the institute, the paper says, restricts its activities to
advancing the profession rather than the interests of its members. These do
not coincide and raise questions of a conflict of interest.
Mr John Butcher, a sole practitioner and a supporter of the campaign for
change, said: 'There is growing concern that the institute has difficulty in
fulfilling both roles. The question is whether there can be reform without
generating bad feeling. But we are not prepared to be ignored.'
A more detailed paper on the subject will be submitted to the council by the
start of next month. If there was no sign of change by April, Mr Butcher
said there might be a move to 'make our views known at a special meeting'.
He said the ideas covered a 'broad cross-section of the profession,
including people in positions of influence'.
The move comes after more than a year of discussions over the future of the
institute since some of its regulatory functions were transferred to the
independent Accounting Standards Board.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Going Dutch in Brazil's heartland -
Christina Lamb visits a bulb and seedling export business based in a former
jungle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE town, with its small bungalows set on clipped lawns and its ruddy-faced,
blue-eyed residents on their bicycles, is typical of a Dutch
flower-producing region, exporting its blooms all over the world. Except
that it is in the heartland of Brazil.
Founded after the Second World War when Brazil was open to large numbers of
immigrants, the town of Holambra, in Sao Paulo state, Brazil's economic hub,
has overcome countless adversities to become Brazil's biggest flower
producer with exports of more than Dollars 2m a year. Its rose and gladioli
bulbs and seedlings are sold mainly to Europe, including the Netherlands.
Largely due to the efforts of Holambra's growers Brazil's total floral
exports rose from Dollars 3m in 1987 to more than Dollars 5m last year.
Holambra's first arrivals in April 1948 found the land - bought by the
American and Dutch governments - 'was nothing but jungle inhabited by wolves
and jaguars', says 77-year-old Mr Wim Weil.
In June 1948 the Holambra co-operative was created and its 5,000 hectares
divided into lots. Many of the immigrants had been flower growers but it
seemed hopeless to try to grow flowers in such heat for such a huge a
country and no tradition of flower buying.
Mr Weil says: 'The first 10 years were really hard. We had to construct a
city as well as a company and we had no idea what would grow.'
The photo museum he now runs charts their not always successful efforts at
growing rice, beans, peanuts, oranges, corn, soya and cotton and raising
pigs and chickens. Cows sent out from time to time by the Dutch government
died of tropical diseases.
Many settlers left for other parts of Brazil or went back to the Netherlands
and the co-operative was on the verge of bankruptcy in the early 1960s. It
was bailed out by the Dutch government which provided credit that allowed
them to buy a truck they needed badly.
Holambra turned to flower-growing with the arrival in 1961 of Mr Henricus
Schoenmaker who brought with him three generations of expertise and
technology, setting up protected houses in which seedlings could be
nurtured. His son Cornelius says: 'It was a real struggle as there was no
market. In the Netherlands every house has a vase of fresh flowers but here
people used money to buy food not flowers. Only really in the last eight
years has it taken off.'
Today of the co-operative's 320 members, 110 are flower growers and last
year 25 per cent of total earnings of Dollars 100m came from flowers. The
co-operative grows more than 800 species of flowers and 1,000 tropical
plants and has a third of the Brazilian market.
While Brazil's third year of recession is sending Italian and Japanese
immigrants back to their native countries, many young Dutch people are
arriving, attracted by cheap land, a growing market and lack of competition.
Mr Renato Opitz, production manager of Holambra, says: 'They can earn here
in 10 years what would take a lifetime in Holland.'
The constant influx of new people keeps the town on its toes, he says. 'The
older Dutch people have to adopt the new ideas to survive and send their
children to the Netherlands to learn as Brazilian institutions do not have
the technology.'
Despite Brazil's economic woes, the country's Dollars 75m a year flower
market is increasing. Mr Opitz explains: 'People in the A and B
(socio-economic) groups always buy flowers even in a crisis and when there
is less money available those in the C and D groups also buy as a cheap
alternative to presents.'
Brazil's average flower consumption is 25 times less than that of Europe. To
augment this Holambra has launched a newspaper, a weekly TV programme on
flower care, and every September hosts a flower show that attracts 200,000.
However, the bigger growers such as the Schoenmakers are concentrating on
exports and joint ventures with Dutch companies. Mr Schoenmaker who is
hoping to expand on the 50m gladioli bulbs and cuttings he sells to the
Netherlands, explains: 'Although I think the Brazilian market has huge
potential I don't want to depend on it because of the instability of
government economic policy.' After the Collor Plan in March 1990, for
example, under which 80 per cent of the nations assets were frozen, for
weeks growers had to throw away their flowers.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Washington urged to act on global warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US POLICY-MAKERS have seriously underestimated the economic costs of global
warming and should support an 'aggressive programme of international
abatement.'
The warning was delivered by Mr William Cline, a senior fellow at the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank, at the
annual meeting of the American Economics Association in New Orleans last
weekend.
Most analyses of global warming have focused on the effects of a doubling of
carbon dioxide concentrations, which on unchanged policies is expected by
2025. The consensus among scientists is that this would raise average global
temperatures by between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade, with a 'best guess'
of 2.5 degrees.
Many economists believe this much warming would cause only limited economic
damage, equivalent to perhaps 1 per cent of gross national product. The
World Bank, for example, is expected to play down the economic risks of
warming in the World Development Report this year, which will be devoted to
the environment.
At the conference, Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, said
global warming, even on 'very pessimistic assumptions', would offset 'less
than six months' GNP growth over the next 40 years.' It would not be
'civilisation-threatening.'
Mr Cline, soon to publish a book on global warming, says the conventional
benchmark of a doubling of carbon dioxide levels by 2025 is misleading:
'Because global warming is cumulative and irreversible, a much longer time
horizon should be considered.' Warming is set to continue at least until
2300.
He calculates that global emissions of carbon could rise from 6bn tonnes
today to 20bn tonnes by 2100 and more than 50bn late in the 23rd century.
This would cause global temperatures to rise by a central estimate of 10
degrees centigrade and perhaps as much as 18 degrees.
Over this longer time horizon, the damage from warming could amount to 6 per
cent of GNP, or six times the conventional estimate. But the effects are not
easily predicted. With 10 degrees of warming, for example, the western
Antartic ice sheet could disintegrate, causing a substantial rise in the
sea-level.
Mr Cline analyses the costs of cutting carbon emissions to Dollars 4bn
tonnes annually and holding there for three centuries. Abatement costs would
peak at about 3.5 per cent of GNP by about 2040 and stay thereafter at 2.5
per cent. Assuming that policy-makers should be risk-averse (assigning
higher probabilities to bad rather than to good outcomes), he estimates the
benefits from reducing carbon emissions would outweigh the abatement costs.
The implication of his analysis is that the Bush administration's passive
attitude to global warming is economically mistaken. The US, unlike most
European countries and Japan, has not yet even agreed targets for carbon
emissions, on grounds of 'scientific uncertainty.'
Mr Cline says the US should support an international carbon tax, with mild
initial rates, some of the revenue being channelled to developing countries
so as to back environmentally friendly policies. Over the longer term, the
risks from warming are great enough to justify international carbon quotas,
backed if necessary by trade sanctions.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan's car makers 'discourage set-up of
European parts plants'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's car makers are discouraging Japanese component manufacturers from
setting up in Europe 'as a matter of policy', according to a new study of
the European motor components industry by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
As a consequence, the prospect of an influx of Japanese components groups
seriously threatening the welfare of Europe's indigenous components industry
 -as happened in the case of the US - can be 'largely discounted', the
report* concludes.
Even with the absence of a Japanese threat, however, the West European
components industry will be the subject of further 'drastic' restructuring
in the near future, with the likelihood of a spate of acquisitions and
mergers as vehicle manufacturers come to rely increasingly on suppliers
which have a global capability, the report warns.
It earmarks south-east Asia and the Pacific rim as providing the greatest
growth opportunities in vehicle and components manufacture, and says that
'it is now essential for European companies to establish bridgeheads in
these regions' if business is not to be lost irrevocably, overwhelmingly to
the Japanese components industry.
Between them, western Europe's component makers have the chance to dominate
the motor industry's rebirth in Eastern Europe, the report concludes.
So far, however, it identifies Germany's components industry as making the
running, with nine manufacturing operations or joint ventures already under
way, with several more forecast to follow.

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday warned the US it would impose retaliatory duties on US
imports worth Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 641m) if Washington carries out its
threat of trade sanctions against Beijing.
The warning comes on the eve of the sixth and final round of trade talks
between the two countries on the protection of copyright and patents, due to
open in Washington tomorrow. The talks are scheduled to last two days.
The US has announced it will impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent on a wide
range of Chinese exports valued at Dollars 1.5bn if agreement cannot be
reached on the protection of US intellectual property.
It has set a deadline date of January 16, extended from November 26 last
year, for a resolution of the dispute. If none is reached it will invoke the
punitive sanctions allowed under the 301 Section of the US Trade Act.
Washington says China's laws provide inadequate protection for copyright and
patents. It accuses China of being the single largest pirate worldwide of US
intellectual property, causing losses amounting to Dollars 430m annually.
US officials say China's law leaves almost all films, plays, books, computer
software and music recordings unprotected.
Trade talks between the two countries have so far failed and the likelihood
of sanctions is growing. Chinese exports at risk include beer, silk
clothing, shoes, pharmaceuticals, jewellery and raw materials.

AIRBUS INDUSTRIE said aircraft orders fell to around 100 in 1991, well below
the 404 of 1990 and the group's earlier 1991 forecast of 145, Reuter reports
from Paris.
An Airbus spokesman also said the group delivered slightly fewer than the
170 jets it forecast for 1991. It delivered only 95 aircraft in 1990 because
of a strike at one of its partners.
All of the civil aircraft makers expected orders to plunge in 1991 because
of losses suffered by most world airlines and a natural pause after the
buying binge in the late 1980s.
The airlines have been hit by economic downturns in the US and much of
western Europe and by the Gulf crisis of late 1990 and early 1991, which
slashed world airline traffic.
Airbus is a consortium made up of France's Aerospatiale British Aerospace L,
Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus unit of
Germany's Daimler-Benz

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: UK signs Pounds 500m accord for Kuwait
export credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday signed an agreement making available Pounds 500m in export
credits for Kuwait, writes Anthony McDermott.
The medium-term credit, signed by Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK trade minister
(left), and Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, the managing-director of the Kuwait
Investment Authority, is to be managed by the Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD), and should provide welcome backing for UK companies in
winning contracts for the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.7bn) effort to rebuild
Kuwait after Iraq's invasion in 1990.
Since Kuwait's liberation last February, UK companies have won deals worth
Pounds 491.6m, amounting to about 20 per cent of contracts on offer.
This deal follows similar agreements that Kuwait has concluded with such
countries as the US, which has won the cream of the contracts, Canada,
Japan, and other countries in the EC.
On returning from a visit to Kuwait last November, Mr Sainsbury said that
while building contracts were not as substantial as first thought, many
re-supplying orders were available in telecommunications, electronic
equipment and vehicles. This re-stocking could take three to five years.
Financing should not be a problem with Kuwaiti oil production reaching
pre-invasion levels of 1.5m barrels a day by the end of this year.

Gatt

<TEXT>
US and EC trade officials this week have been struggling to devise a
strategy for the Uruguay Round negotiations with the objective of producing
a final package this spring. This would allow Congress to vote on the
package before the November presidential and Congressional elections.
Both sides, however, have difficulties with the draft agreement submitted by
Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), on December 20. Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC vice president
in charge of trade, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US Trade Representative, met on
Tuesday in Washington to discuss procedures and 'liked what each other had
to say,' an EC spokesman said.
An important stumbling block could be the meeting of the EC foreign, trade
and farm ministers in Brussels on January 10-11. EC trade and farm ministers
already sent a chill through the negotiating effort on December 23 in
rejecting the Dunkel agriculture plan.
The US difficulty is as much with agriculture as it is with the other
sectors. The assumption in Washington has always been that the US would have
to make concessions on the protected farm sectors and textiles in order to
get the strong rules business groups want for intellectual property rights,
services, investment, and market access. Many companies see the Dunkel paper
as flawed and the developing countries as having gained too much.
With the US recession continuing, neither Congress nor its business
constituents are keen to support yielding of US trade sovereignty. But
business groups have replied to Mrs Hills' request for suggestions on
improvements to the Dunkel paper. The MTN Coalition, a group of companies in
favour of the round, yesterday released a statement calling the Dunkel paper
'a basis for continuing intensive negotiations.' It urged Mrs Hills and the
Bush Administration 'to continue the administration's relentless pursuit of
a broadened strong agreement.'
The International Intellectual Property Alliance issued a statement warning
that 'critical improvements' need to be made in the text to protect US
copyright owners. It listed as a 'critical defect ..the inclusion of an
unreasonably long - and unnecessary - five-year transition period before
less-developed countries would be be required to comply with the copyright
provisions.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: Poor image works against American 'gas
guzzlers' - Why the Japanese steer clear of imported cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's car sales pitch in Japan this week has apparently
had an impact. At Chrysler's largest showroom in downtown Tokyo, the number
of potential customers walking through the automatic doors has doubled since
the US president landed - from a meagre five a day to a Bush-inspired 10.
'People have become more curious, but American cars still have a poor image
among Japanese,' a Chrysler salesman explained. 'They ask me whether the
lights are faulty and they worry about fuel consumption. Some models don't
have enough gadgets to keep drivers happy. We Japanese love gadgets.'
The presence of Mr Bush and his entourage of executives from the Big Three
US manufacturers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - has generated much publicity for
the US industry, but it remains unclear whether the visit will prompt an
increase in sales of US cars.
About 12,350 vehicles made by the three US companies were sold in the the
first 11 months of last year. For the whole year, the Japan Automobile
Dealers' Association (Jada) reported sales of 5.74m units, including 199,920
imported vehicles, sales of which were down 10.7 per cent on 1990.
The travelling US executives argue the domestic market has been a
'sanctuary' for Japanese producers, who have ploughed domestic earnings into
aggressively building market share in the US and Europe. But the executives
have identified few reasons for Japanese consumers' continuing reluctance to
buy their product.
At Chrysler, which has four showrooms in Japan, a salesman suggested that
Japanese consumers have failed to recognise the advances made by US makers
in recent years, although the makers still export over-large cars which
don't fit the market or Japanese streets.
Unfortunately for the US companies, some of their best customers over the
past two decades have been the yakuza, Japanese gangsters, who have a
well-known fondness for cars such as GM's Cadillac. Chrysler sales staff are
encouraged to be cool in dealing with gangsters, who apparently like the
company's Imperial model, which is 5.165 metres long and costs Y6.2m (Pounds
26,700) before taxes.
'If we know that a customer is a gangster, perhaps we will not provide them
with the finance to buy the car. We are very conscious of the image of our
company,' an official said.
US manufacturers have not always had such a tiny portion of the Japanese
market.
Foreign makers, with Ford and GM leading the pack, held a 95 per cent share
in the early 1930s, a figure which fell sharply after the government
introduced a law in 1936 torestrict imports and the assembly of foreign
companies' vehicles in Japan.
By 1939, foreign makers were squeezed out completely, though they returned
at the end of the war in 1945, and imports accounted for 44.6 per cent of
the market in 1951. The introduction of steep tariffs and the gradual
development of the Japanese industry, assisted by foreign technology
transfers and government funding, reduced the share to 8.9 per cent in 1955
and to 0.4 per cent in 1969.
Foreign investment in the Japanese industry was effectively prohibited until
1970 and the government inconveniently insisted, until 1983, that each
imported car be inspected by customs officers.
Meanwhile, the quality of the domestic product had improved significantly,
and exports grew from 194,000 in 1965 to 6.1m in 1984.
US manufacturers suggest that access to the Japanese market is still
restricted, but Japanese companies insist the quality and price
competitiveness of their vehicles are behind the marginal gains made by
foreign vehicles in the past decade.
Jada says its members, most of whom have direct links to Japanese
manufacturers, are ready to sell US vehicles, but that these cars are not
tailored to Japanese taste.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: Plan to bolster world economy - Joint
Communique
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS the text of a joint statement issued yesterday by US President
George Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister.
President Bush and Prime Minister Miyazawa today announced a strategy for
world growth designed to strengthen the world economy. The president and the
prime minister expressed concern that the growth of the world economy in
1991 slowed to the lowest level in nearly a decade. They recognised that the
outlook for growth of the world economy this year is weaker than previously
expected.
This situation could adversely affect prospects for income and jobs,
undermine the efforts of newly emerging democracies and developing countries
to implement sound market-oriented economic reforms, and raise the spectre
of renewed protectionism.
The US and Japan are the two largest countries in the world economy,
together accounting for nearly 40 per cent of total global production and
more than 20 per cent of world trade.
The president and the prime minister, aware of a special responsibility
placed on their countries by their position, recognise that each country
needs to pursue responsible economic policies that strengthen the
international economy and global trading system.
They have decided to undertake domestic policies to improve growth
prospects, as a part of a co-operative effort which contributes to the
attainment of sustainable growth with price stability and the promotion of
global economic recovery.
Prime Minister Miyazawa, with these considerations in mind, stated that the
government of Japan will submit to the Diet (parliament) the fiscal 1992
budget and the fiscal investment and loan programme aimed at strengthening
domestic demand by increased public investment through the central
government and local government, and contributing to the world through its
official development assistance (ODA) and other measures, despite tight
fiscal conditions.
Prime Minister Miyazawa stated that the government of Japan will monitor the
progress of the above measures to ensure the expected effects are realised.
The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to reduce interest rates is also
intended to maintain sustainable growth with price stability.
Toward the same end, President Bush also stated that he would be submitting
to Congress a comprehensive programme to strengthen US growth and
competitiveness. The details of the programme will be contained in the
president's State of the Union message and his budget proposals for fiscal
1993, to be announced later this month. The president noted that the recent
reduction in interest rates reflected the determination by the Federal
Reserve to facilitate US economic recovery and growth.
The president also reaffirmed his commitment to achieving a substantial
reduction of the US budget deficit over the medium term.
The president and prime minister reviewed developments in financial markets
and agreed that recent exchange rate movements were consistent with current
economic developments.
They expressed confidence that the above measures and developments will
contribute to a correction of external imbalances.
President Bush and Prime Minister Miyazawa expressed their continued support
for ongoing economic policy co-ordination among G7 countries as essential
for achieving their common objectives as expressed in this statement.
They stressed the importance of continued co-operative efforts and called on
other industrial countries to join with them.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: America wakes up to a stricken commander -
Collapse at banquet in Tokyo renews doubts over president's health and
stamina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE pictures from Tokyo of a stricken President George Bush, his face ashen
and his mouth agape, will remain embedded in the US popular memory for a
long time.
Millions of Americans woke up yesterday morning to watch the jarring images
replayed again and again on breakfast television. Many wondered if there was
more than met the eye in the White House explanation that the
Commander-in-Chief had fallen victim to a severe bout of stomach flu.
This was, after all, not the first time that Mr Bush had fallen sick on the
job. Just seven months ago, the president was taken to hospital after
suffering 'atrial fibrillations' - a rapid heart-beat which doctors later
diagnosed as a symptom of a thyroid ailment. Then, as now, questions have
arisen about the quality of Mr Bush's potential successor, Vice-President
Dan Quayle.
In the short term, it was Mrs Barbara Bush who probably saved the day. Soon
after her husband had collapsed, the First Lady recovered her composure,
remained at the state dinner hosted by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, and proceeded to make light of the incident.
'I can't explain what happened to George because it never happened before,
but I'm beginning to think it's the ambassador's fault,' said Mrs Bush,
pausing for laughter and applause. She went on to explain that the president
had played tennis with Mr Michael Armacost, US ambassador, for two hours
against the Emperor and Crown Prince of Japan, and had been soundly
thrashed. 'We Bushes aren't used to that.'
Despite Mrs Bush's best efforts, the Tokyo tummy bug incident - if that is
all it is - means that Mr Bush's health will become a factor in the
presidential electoral campaign this year, as it threatened to do after Mr
Bush had suffered his irregular heart-beat last May 4 while jogging at Camp
David.
In the coming months Mr Bush, who is aged 67, will face a travel schedule
almost as rigorous as the 12-day, 26,000-mile trade mission which has taken
him through 10 time zones to Australia, Singapore, South Korea and now
Japan.
Comparisons will be drawn between the White House incumbent and the
ruddy-faced Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, 46 years old and the early
Democratic front-runner. The experience factor can easily be turned into the
'age' factor - though neither will be enough to determine the outcome of the
election.
Mrs Bush's tennis anecdote is telling because it pinpoints both a great
strength and weakness in her husband's approach to his job.
The president makes few concessions to high office when it comes to physical
activity. Having watched earlier White House occupants, such as Richard
Nixon and Jimmy Carter, weighed down by the terrible burden of office, Mr
Bush uses exercise as a mental escape, in much the same way as his hero
President Theodore Roosevelt did at the turn of the last century.
Last year Mr Bush lost almost a stone in weight after taking drugs for his
thyroid complaint, but soon afterwards he was inviting reporters half his
age to go jogging. 'He loves it,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House
press secretary. 'What can you do?'
Mr Fitzwater repeated the message yesterday. After declaring sombrely that
'nothing extraordinary has occurred' one hour after Mr Bush's collapse, the
spokesman said: 'The president's schedule is one that he has maintained for
three years and one that he enjoys. He is a very physical and vigorous man,
and I don't expect any changes.'
In recent months, however, Mr Bush has been more 'hyper' than usual. Some
attribute the activity to an effort to compensate for his slump in the
polls. This stems from a slide in public confidence in an early economic
recovery, although Mr Bush has had plenty of other serious concerns such as
the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fate of more than 27,000 nuclear
warheads on Soviet soil and - the single most important political issue in
the US today - the future of the US economy.
Mr Bush has tried many a public gimmick to restore confidence. 'Activity,'
says one critic, 'has replaced thought'.
The decision to take 21 US business leaders on the trip to Tokyo may be the
most unfortunate gimmick of all. Mr Bush faces criticism - in Japan and in
the US - for having invited corporate executives such as Mr Lee Iacocca,
Chrysler chairman, to berate his hosts. Five years ago Mr Iacocca was a
corporate hero; these days he is often dismissed as overpaid and too
inclined to shift blame on to foreigners.
These presidential failings may reflect the sheer pressure of a non-stop
job, but they are more likely the result of political misjudgments. The
question is whether Mr Bush's political advisers will counsel him to slow
down a little, if only better to collect his thoughts and conserve his
energies for the strains of the campaign.
Just before he collapsed at the state dinner, Mr Bush told a US reporter
that he would not run for re-election if his health were in doubt. He added
quickly, however, that he felt in good shape, though 'a little tired
sometimes'.
If Mrs Bush has her way, her husband will slow his pace - but it will be
difficult for a man who has always prided himself in his stamina,
athleticism and ruddy health. Having had one warning last year, will Mr Bush
take heed this time round?

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: Mulford seeks support for growth strategy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, was
yesterday seeking support among European members of the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries for the US-Japanese growth strategy unveiled in
Tokyo by US President George Bush and the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa.
After visiting Paris on Tuesday and Bonn yesterday morning, Mr Mulford
arrived in London for a meeting with Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor
of the exchequer. Mr Mulford will visit Rome tomorrow before returning to
Germany at the weekend for the first in a series of meetings of senior
officials to prepare this year's world economic summit in Munich in July.
Speaking just after arriving in London, Mr Mulford said his tour of European
capitals was to seek the four governments' views about the state of the
world economy and to establish whether and how they would be prepared to
take part in a global growth strategy.
However, there was little sign yesterday that European countries would be
inclined to change existing policies in response to US pressure.
Mr Mulford underlined that he was consulting America's European G7 partners
rather than asking them to join an already prepared plan. The statement
issued yesterday in Tokyo was a joint US-Japanese initiative to strengthen
the world's two biggest economies.
He said his trip to Europe was 'beginning a process' which he hoped would
lead to new commitments similar to those announced in Japan.
The US Treasury tried last year to encourage European countries to adopt
more expansionary economic policies but met resistance from treasuries and
central banks that preferred to give priority to combating inflation.
Mr Mulford said yesterday he believed there was now greater concern in
Europe about the sustainability of global growth that was not apparent six
or nine months ago. However, in Britain, France and Germany there was little
to suggest that governments were prepared to rethink existing policies.
Yesterday, at a meeting of the National Economic Development Council, Mr
Lamont indicated that he opposed short-term fiscal action to stimulate the
economy. He recently underlined his acceptance of high UK interest rates by
repeatedly ruling out any devaluation of sterling in the European Monetary
System.
Similarly, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French finance minister, yesterday rejected
suggestions that France relax its anti-inflation policy or weaken its
commitment to a hard franc.
'As long as I shall be finance minister, there will be neither devaluation
of the franc nor a return to inflation,' he said in the Figaro newspaper.
Officials in Bonn also reacted cautiously to the US-Japanese move. They
disclosed that the US had given several weeks' notice of Mr Bush's economic
initiative to the German government in a series of meetings.
Ministers had been briefed, and welcomed 'any global actions' which might
aid recovery. But possibly mindful of strong criticism of German policies by
Washington last year, they said it was important that no single country
should be singled out for special treatment.

THE 'godfather' and backroom-fixer of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, Mr Shin Kanemaru, has agreed to take the post of party
vice-president, in an apparent attempt to bolster the shaky leadership of Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister
Mr Kanemaru, chairman of the party's largest faction, is credited with
having ensured Mr Miyazawa's selection as leader. He said yesterday he had a
'responsibility' to support the prime minister and party president.
But Mr Kanemaru, 77, has taken two months to accept Mr Miyazawa's invitation
to take the number two position. Some of Mr Kanemaru's colleagues had
advised him not to be too closely associated with a prime minister whose
reign could be short.
Mr Miyazawa is generally thought to have made a poor start as prime
minister, having failed to win parliamentary approval for a bill authorising
Japanese troops to take part in UN peace-keeping operations. He has also
been hurt by a fresh scandal involving alleged donations to a senior member
of his own faction.
In accepting the offer, Mr Kanemaru, to be formally appointed later this
month, made clear he was responsible for Mr Miyazawa's elevation: 'When you
choose a man to become leader, you must do your best to support him.'

KENYA'S second opposition party was formally launched in Nairobi yesterday.
The Democratic Party (DP) promised to end what it called President Daniel
arap Moi's dictatorship and to usher in democracy, good governance,
accountability and transparency.
Mr Mwai Kibaki, a veteran politician and former vice-president who resigned
from Mr Moi's government on Christmas Day, said his party was also committed
to free enterprise and to racial, sexual and religious equality.
The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) was the first substantial
opposition party to be launched. Multi-party elections are due this year.
In a lengthy policy manifesto, Mr Kibaki, a prominent political figure from
the large and wealthy Kikuyu tribe, also set out the first detailed
opposition social and economic programme.
Political observers said yesterday, Mr Kibaki had failed to attract
sufficient broad-based support among Kenya's tribes to make the new party a
serious contender against the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy as the
main opposition party. DP leaders are mostly Kikuyu and former members of
the government.
Political analysts say the DP may further alienate the Kikuyu inhabitants of
the populous Central Province, away from the ruling party.

Kadiejevic's resignation could undermine peace efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE resignation last night of General Veljko Kadiejevic, the Yugoslav
defence minister, could undermine efforts by the United Nations and European
Community diplomats to seek a lasting ceasefire in Croatia.
Moreover, western diplomats believe that any attempt to bring the federal
army under political control following the shooting down of an EC monitoring
helicopter has been made more difficult.
General Kadiejevic was a career officer, half Croat and half Serb, who was
wedded until recently to the idea of maintaining the Yugoslav federation.
'He was a Titoist, and a Yugoslav, which is why he opposed the independence
moves by the republics of Croatia and Slovenia last June,' a western
diplomat said.
In recent weeks, however, he adopted a more pragmatic stance, and ended up
supporting UN plans to implement not only a ceasefire in Croatia, but to
deploy peace-keeping troops.
It was a gamble not only for Gen Kadiejevic, but also for Serbia's
nationalist president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic.
For the former, the presence of UN troops would formally and finally end any
pretence that the army could maintain the territorial integrity of the
Yugoslav federation.
For Mr Milosevic, it was a risk because, under the UN agreement, the federal
army would withdraw completely from Croatia, thus depriving Serb
nationalists in the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina, in southern
Croatia, of vital support. It would have the effect of turning Serb
militants in Croatia against Mr Milosevic, who promoted them in the first
place.
The UN agreement enraged Mr Milan Babic, head of the Krajina republic, and
other Serb nationalists, who smelt betrayal of their cause - an independent
Serb republic in Croatia - by both the army and Serbia. It probably led
nationalist forces in the army to shoot down the helicopter.
That tragedy yesterday prompted diplomats in Belgrade to attempt to place
the army under political control. But it may be too late.
Factions now at the helm of the military include hardline Serb nationalists
led by General Blagoje Adzic, the new defence minister and former chief of
staff. His outlook is conditioned by history - his family was killed by the
Nazi-backed Croat Ustashas during the second world war.
As a Serb nationalist determined to seek redress for historical grievances,
Gen Adzic has forged close links with the Serb nationalists in Krajina,
eastern Slavonia, in eastern Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
This tacit alliance not only opposes the deploying UN peace-keeping forces
by Gen Kadiejevic and Mr Milosevic; it had also widened the rift among the
army's top officer corps and Serbia's leadership.
Yesterday, Mr Babic, who was catapulted into power by Mr Milosevic, with the
backing of the federal army, blamed Gen Kadiejevic for the attack on the
helicopter. He implied that the general's acceptance of the UN ceasefire
terms did not have the consent of the entire army, nor of Serb nationalists
in Croatia who feel the army is no longer protecting them.
Behind the scenes lurk other factions. These include Mr Branko Mamula, the
former federal defence minister, and now head of the revamped Communist
Party of Yugoslavia. Ideologically committed to Yugoslavia, Mr Mamula has
extensive networks throughout the army and is visited regularly by Mr
Milosevic. But his colleagues say he is acutely aware that the federal army
needs a home, some financial assurances for the future, and a
post-Yugoslavia role.
General Marko Negovanovic, the former federal head of counter-intelligence,
and now defence minister of Serbia, continues to play a pivotal role. Once
opposed to the break-up of he federation, he is now trying to salvage a
smaller Serb-dominated rump Yugoslavia in which the arm could play a
prominent role.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Veljko Kadiejevic, Yugoslav defence minister in charge of the
federal army, resigned yesterday, the day after a Yugoslav jet shot down a
helicopter carrying European Community monitors.
Gen Kadiejevic, citing his deteriorating health, said he had formalised an
earlier decision to step down, but western diplomats says his resignation
signals an open feud between factions within the federal army.
The Defence Ministry in Belgrade, quoted by Tanjug, said army
chief-of-staff, Gen Blagoje Adzic, a Serb nationalist and hardliner, would
take over until a permanent replacement was found.
The resignation of Gen Kadiejevic comes at a critical juncture in peace
negotiations being conducted by the United Nations and the European
Community, and just over 24 hours after federal army jets shot down the the
EC helicopter, killing all five passengers.
Gen Kadiejevic had been expected to attend the EC-sponsored peace conference
on Yugoslavia which reconvenes in Brussels today. It is unclear who will now
represent the army. A career officer committed to the idea of retaining the
Yugoslav federation, he had in recent weeks become more pragmatic and
accommodating towards the deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in Croatia.
But Gen Adzic is likely to be far less compromising. He is likely to shift
the federal Defence Ministry much more towards the nationalist and
anti-Croat wing.
This could increase the pressure on Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of
Serbia, who faces a rift among Serbs in Croatia who want the federal army to
remain there and protect them. Under the terms of the UN-forged ceasefire,
the federal army agreed to pull out of Croatia, denying the Serb nationalist
minority military support.
The UN Security Council last night unanimously approved a resolution to send
50 UN military observers to Yugoslavia 'to promote maintenance of the
ceasefire'. If the truce continues to hold, the Council is expected to
follow up with the despatch of a 10,000-member peacekeeping force.
The advance team, the first UN peacekeepers to be deployed in continental
Europe, are expected to be deployed before the end of the week.
Meanwhile, the Yugoslav military has set up an inquiry into the downing of
the EC helicopter. Colonel Zvonka Jurjevic, head of the air force, and a
Croat, was suspended after the incident. EC monitors have asked to take part
in the inquiry and the 170 EC monitors have temporarily suspended activities
until they obtain guarantees of security. The move means that a trilateral
meeting scheduled for today in Hungary, and aimed at shoring up the
ceasefire, has been postponed.

<TEXT>
A SUMMIT of European Community states could be called in April to discuss
the Community's financial plans, Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president, said in Lisbon yesterday.
Speaking after the first meeting between the Portuguese government and the
EC Commission to discuss priorities for the Portuguese EC presidency, Mr
Delors said proposals for a financial package would be presented for
discussion by mid-February.
This would outline the Community's budgetary and financial commitments for
the period 1993-97. He hoped 'an extraordinary summit in April would make it
possible' to agree on the package.
He said it would include proposals designed to create a 'favourable
environment (to strengthen) the competitiveness of European industries'.
This was all the more important as the world faced the challenge of
important industrial restructuring and big changes in the international
division of labour.
He said the Commission would outline proposals on competition, on
co-operation in research and suggest measures to accompany industrial
restructuring, especially with regards to its social implications and on
training policies.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, was more circumspect
on prospects of holding the summit in April, saying it would depend on the
'positive' outcome of discussions after the presentation of the new package.
Mr Cavaco Silva also emphasised Portugal's determination to help find a
compromise in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks which are threatened by
disagreements between the EC and the US.
He said the presidency would also strive to ensure that social policies
would be seen to be an important element in the development of the
Community. 'We want to ensure that the social dimension is a reality in the
Community,' he said.
Mr Delors said enlargement would have to be discussed during the six-month
Portuguese presidency but that it was too early to talk of a timetable.

POLAND'S 2m-strong Solidarity trade union yesterday called a one-hour
national strike for Monday to protest against energy price rises brought in
on January 1. The larger, left-wing OPZZ unions have threatened token
stoppages on Thursday.
This is the most serious challenge from the unions a Polish government has
faced since economic reforms began in autumn 1989. The new government has
threatened to quit if faced by a protracted national stoppage. It says the
energy price rises are an integral part of an interim three-month budget now
being debated in parliament which foresees a Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m)
deficit.
Mr Jerzy Kropiwnicki, labour minister, told the union leadership the
government would not rescind the rises, which double the cost of home
central heating, increase the price of gas by 70 per cent and electricity by
a fifth. 'If we were to suspend the rises, economic anarchy would ensue,' he
said in Gdansk.

MR TENGIZ SIGUA, Georgia's acting prime minister, said yesterday that
medical certificates had been located diagnosing Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the
former president, who fled the country on Monday, as mentally ill.
He also claimed that Mr Gamsakhurdia had seized Rbs200m (Pounds 1m) of state
funds before his flight and embezzled more than Rbs1bn during his
presidency.
The president and 80 supporters were yesterday in a mountain retreat in
Getokhobit in Armenia.
He himself appeared on Armenian television in defiant mood, declaring he was
still president of Georgia.
Mr Sigua said that a Georgian delegation sent to hold tripartite
negotiations with Mr Gamsakhurdia and an Armenian delegation had been
refused access.
He added that Georgia was prepared to allow Mr Gamsakhurdia to be granted
political asylum by Armenia provided he was barred from leaving the country.
He also said that Mr Gamsakhurdia's diagnosis as mentally ill might preclude
his being brought back to Georgia to face criminal charges.
While he admitted that Mr Gamsakhurdia had been a dissident, and that
dissidents in the Soviet era had frequently been declared mentally ill, he
said that five of the six doctors involved were still alive and prepared to
certify the diagnoses were genuine.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Key Bonn adviser warns of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE differences at the heart of the German economic establishment over both
policy and prospects for the economy have been underlined with a warning of
impending recession from a leading government economic adviser.
In today's Handelsblatt, the business newspaper, Professor Hans-Karl
Schneider, one of the government's so-called 'five wise men', criticises the
recent decision of the Bundesbank to raise interest rates by a half point.
He says that interest rates are already 'very, very high' and are not
appropriate for the current economic situation, in which the boom associated
with German unification has slowed to a virtual standstill in the past six
months.
Prof Schneider, whose report in November sharply criticised the level of the
public spending deficit, warns that a failure by the government to restrain
spending, and by the trade unions to accept moderate wage increases, could
tip the economy into a recession.
His comments underline a concern in the highest levels of the government
that the Bundesbank may have gone too far in raising the Lombard rate by
half a point to 9.75 per cent, and the discount rate from 7.5 to 8 per cent.
The government is torn over its attitude to wage negotiations. Several trade
unions are seeking wage rises in double figures. Mr Jurgen Mollemann,
economics minister, has called for a limit of 5 per cent on pay rises, and
has been criticised by his colleagues for interfering in the wage round.
The cabinet, and the coalition partners, yesterday issued statements
insisting that they would not interfere in the 'constitutionally protected'
wage negotiations. However, Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said
unjustified pay rises, including those in the public sector, could cause
grave problems.
Negotiations on steel industry pay resumed in Dusseldorf yesterday, with IG
Metall, the steelworkers' union, calling for a rise of 10.5 per cent, and
the employers offering 3.4 per cent. The union is already making
preparations for a strike ballot among its members. Germany's four leading
political parties have agreed to draw up a common proposal for a new asylum
law, intended to accelerate the processing of asylum applications from 12
months to six weeks.
The agreement emerged from cross-party talks yesterday, in spite of grave
doubts that the acceleration plan will work, and against criticism that the
streamlined procedure will limit the fundamental rights of asylum-seekers.
The idea is to speed up processing of asylum applications, which last year
exceeded 256,000, an increase of almost 33 per cent, in order to stem the
flow and send economic migrants swiftly home.
However, there is a fundamental difference between the parties. The
Christian Democrats, senior partners in the ruling coalition, believe that
the liberal German constitution should be changed to limit the right of
political asylum. Their coalition partners, the Free Democrats (FDP), and
the Social Democrats (SPD) in opposition, reject any constitutional change,
and say that the influx can be contained through improved procedures.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan yesterday launched an initiative to encourage economic
growth and urged other industrialised nations, particularly Germany, to do
the same.
The plan, entitled A Strategy for World Growth, is apparently aimed at
getting interest rates down in an effort to kick-start the world economy.
The Bundesbank, which views inflation as a bigger enemy than slow growth,
raised interest rates as recently as last month.
President Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa agreed on the plan during their summit
meeting in Tokyo when they also discussed US demands for Japanese trade
concessions.
US officials are visiting Europe to explain the initiative to Germany and
the other Group of Seven industrialised countries. They intend to present it
to a forthcoming meeting of G7 finance ministers to be held in the US,
probably on January 25.
Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
arriving in London from Bonn yesterday, was careful to say that he was
consulting with European G7 partners of the US rather than asking them to
join an already prepared strategy. The initiative includes a commitment by
Mr Bush to announce economy-boosting measures in his State of the Union
address later this month and in his budget for the 1993 financial year.
These are likely to include investment incentives and possibly tax cuts -
though Mr Bush did not give details.
Mr Miyazawa said Japan's budget for the financial year starting in April was
aimed at strengthening domestic demand through increased public investment.
The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to reduce the official discount
rate to 4.5 per cent was also intended to maintain sustainable growth with
price stability, said the statement. The rate was cut by a half-point on
December 30.
Economists said the statement referred mainly to measures which had already
been announced or, as in the case of the State of the Union address, widely
expected.
Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank,
said the statement would have little impact on persuading the Bundesbank to
cut German interest rates, a move likely to help the European economy.
He said the statement was an 'exercise in rhetoric' which highlighted the
problems of getting all the G7 countries to agree on joint strategies for
promoting world growth.
But speaking in Tokyo, Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury secretary,
rebuffed criticism that the two leaders had promised nothing new. 'The thing
that's different is that the president of the US and the prime minister of
Japan have put their names to a growth strategy.'
Mr Brady also suggested that the declaration could help pave the way to
further cuts in interest rates. Given the recent reductions in rates,
'there's always the possibility that more could be done (in this area) if
more needs to be done'.
Mr Bush and Mr Miyazawa welcomed the recent rise in the yen against the US
dollar, saying 'recent exchange rate movements were consistent with current
economic developments.'
However, some private sector economists expressed disappointment that the
two countries did not commit themselves to pushing the dollar down more
firmly in order to promote US exports.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Ravenscraig to close with 1,200 job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL yesterday sounded the death knell for steelmaking in Scotland
by announcing it would close its Ravenscraig complex in Lanarkshire by
September with the loss of 1,200 jobs.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said he wished the company had been able
to meet a pledge it gave in 1987 to keep the plant open until 1994, while Mr
Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused the government of walking away from
the people of Lanarkshire.
The plant's future has been in doubt since last year when its hot strip
rolling mill was closed with the loss of 700 jobs.
The area around the plant has been hit by almost 4,000 steel-related job
losses in the past two years and unemployment is expected to climb to almost
20 per cent.
People in nearby Motherwell and workers at the plant reacted with sombre
resignation to the news of the closure.
The government responded to the closure by announcing that it had decided to
designate Lanarkshire as a special enterprise zone and was seeking the
necessary European Commission agreement to the move. Businesses setting up
on these specified sites will avoid rates and corporation tax for a 10 year
period.
Setting up the zone will involve spending about Pounds 50m in addition to
the extra Pounds 15m the government is spending in north Lanarkshire this
year and Pounds 25m pledged for next year.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said it should secure 7,500 new jobs in
the area over 10 years.
The Ravenscraig plant has been politically controversial since 1959 when the
Conservative Macmillan government decided it should be developed to form the
hub of a manufacturing area making ships and vehicles.
Despite investment of more than Pounds 400m in the 1970s, when the complex
employed 13,000, Ravenscraig has been vulnerable to closure throughout the
past decade.
The closure is British Steel's most aggressive response yet to the UK
recession. It is likely to make a loss of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m
this year as a result of lower steel demand, increasing competition from
imports and a steep fall in prices over the past two years.
The company also disclosed that the recession had forced it to postpone
plans for a Pounds 100m investment in a continuous casting machine at its
Llanwern plant in South Wales. The plan to expand Llanwern's capacity was
one of the main justifications the company gave in 1990 for the closure of
the Ravenscraig hot strip mill.
The main steel plant left in Scotland, the Dalzell plate mill, has had a
question-mark over its future since last July when the company announced it
planned to build a new plate mill at Lackenby on Teesside, in north-east
England.
The Hunterston deep sea port will also be closed with the loss of about 50
jobs.
Mr Lang said British Steel's decision was 'hugely disappointing' though it
could not have come as a complete surprise to anyone aware of the recent
steep fall in British Steel's profits.
He said he had pressed Sir Robert Scholey, the British Steel chairman, to
make public his assessment of market conditions which justified breaking his
undertaking to keep Ravenscraig open until 1994.
Trade union leaders at the plant reacted with resignation to the closure.
'There was an inevitability about it,' said Mr Willie Twaddle, senior works
convener at the plant, 'even though we were guaranteed to 1994.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said the closure was the result
of 'British Steel's misjudgment and malice compounded by an abdication of
all responsibility by this government'.

PRESIDENT George Bush will go ahead with a second round of summit talks in
Japan today in spite of collapsing at a state banquet in Tokyo yesterday.
This morning the president was in good spirits and otherwise in 'excellent
health' after fainting during an attack of 'common 'flu', Mr Marlin
Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said.
'The president is human, he gets sick,' he said, adding that Mr Bush would
continue with most of his schedule today, including a meeting with the
Japanese premier and a joint press conference.
House described The incident - shown live on Japanese television - had
reignited fears about Mr Bush's health ahead of his campaign for re-election
this year.
The 67-year-old president keeled over before his horrified Japanese hosts
after complaining several times of feeling sick. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
Japanese prime minister, cradled Mr Bush's head briefly before US Secret
Service agents surrounded the stricken president.
After 10 minutes, Mr Bush, looking ashen-faced and shaky, got to his feet
and was wrapped in his coat. Smiling, he saluted his audience, shook hands
with Mr Miyazawa, and was taken by limousine to the Japanese prime
minister's official residence at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace.
The White House tried to play down the episode, which came during a series
of trade talks with Japan at the end of a gruelling 12-day, 26,000-mile tour
of the Pacific which began on December 30.
The president had billed the trip as a mission to bolster the struggling US
economy by creating jobs for Americans through prising open Japanese and
other east Asian markets. The president's popularity at home has slumped
amid a collapse in public confidence over economic prospects.
Mr Fitzwater said there was no connection between Mr Bush's collapse and the
thyroid problem diagnosed last year for which he was hospitalised briefly
with an irregular heart-beat. 'There's no special concern,' he said.
In Washington, Vice-President Dan Quayle, 44, was notified about Mr Bush's
collapse and went immediately to the White House. No arrangements for a
transfer of power were made, according to a spokesman for Mr Quayle.
Mr Quayle went ahead with a planned trip to New Hampshire, where next
month's primary elections will provide the first important test for Mr Bush
in the 1992 election campaign.
'There is no reason to be concerned,' said Mr Quayle yesterday. 'The
president is doing well, resting well.'
News of Mr Bush's illness had little impact on the dollar. On Wall Street,
share prices were unsettled initially but soon picked up and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed just 0.89 lower at 3,203.94.
Shortly before yesterday's banquet, Mr Bush had said in a US television
interview that he felt well. Earlier in the day, he had played tennis with
Emperor Akihito, Crown Prince Naruhito and Mr Michael Armacost, US
ambassador to Tokyo.
Mrs Barbara Bush and others in the president's entourage were evidently
relieved when Mr Bush got to his feet. Mr Fitzwater quoted the president as
saying: 'I just wanted to get a little attention.'
Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser, read Mr Bush's prepared
speech.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bank poised to step in as sterling slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England went on alert last night after sterling ended the day
within a whisker of its lowest permitted point in the European exchange rate
mechanism and at its weakest close against the D-Mark since the UK entered
the ERM 15 months ago.
Should the pound continue to fall and intervention by the Bank fail to stop
the slide, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, faces the politically damaging
option of having to raise interest rates to increase sterling's value.
Such a move would threaten the fragile UK recovery, and lead to more calls
from Conservative backbenchers and anti-ERM economists for a sterling
devaluation - an option which the government has ruled out.
After a nervous day on currency and equity markets, sterling closed in
London down a pfennig at DM2.8350, within roughly a quarter of a pfennig of
its effective ERM floor of about DM2.8325.
In late New York trading it fluctuated around the same level, at one point
falling to DM2.832.
Sterling's weakness was caused largely by a stronger D-Mark and lack of
support from investors worried by signs of a long and slow recovery from the
UK recession.
On the London stock market, share prices suffered from concern about the
world economy and reports of President Bush's collapse. However, the FT-SE
100 index of leading shares recovered from a 41-point loss to close at
2,467.0, down 15.9.
The mood on markets was one of edgy calm. 'There is a marked absence of good
news,' said Mr Mark Brett, currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a
London investment bank.
Assuming sterling opens today weaker, Mr Lamont is thought likely to
instruct the Bank to buy sterling on foreign exchange markets, rather than
risk the much more unpalatable option of increasing interest rates from
their current 10.5 per cent.
If the pound hits its ERM floor, intervention by the Bank would probably be
aided by similar moves by other European central banks to push up sterling's
value.
Also, since the pound's lower effective limit in the ERM is set by the
peseta, the strongest currency in the system, the Bank of Spain would be
called on to sell the Spanish currency, cutting its value and reducing the
pressure on the UK unit.
Should large-scale intervention be required, however, a question mark hangs
over the readiness of the other ERM members to lend wholehearted support.
Since the Bundesbank increased German interest rates just before Christmas,
all the other countries, except Britain, have increased borrowing rates
because of the strains in the mechanism. These nations might argue that the
UK should do likewise, as part of the learning process associated with
joining the ERM.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Appointments: Woolley to chair API
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
API, the packaging group buffeted by upheaval and a hostile bid last year,
is hoping for a steer into calmer waters with the appointment of Moger
Woolley (right) as non-executive chairman.
Woolley, formerly chief executive of DRG, is no stranger to acrimony in the
boardroom having spearheaded a vigorous if ultimately unsuccessful defence
of the UK paper and packaging group against Bermuda-based Pembridge
Investments in November 1989.
Since then he spent just over five months in the chair at fallen USM star
Parkway, which was swallowed by pre-press service company Wace;
then, no sooner had he been named non-executive chairman of part of Beazer
than along came Hanson. 'We think Moger will make a very credible chairman,
and he is not going to accept a string of non-executive posts,' says finance
director Dennis Holt, although he was already non-exec chairman of Dolphin
Packaging.
API, which is also currently interviewing for a managing director, has been
a bit thin in the upper management echelons since the managing director and
chairman both resigned last March - leaving Holt, who had been at the
company just 4 months, as the only executive director.
The ensuing gap encouraged rival packager NMC in its bid - which was
subsequently rejected by API's shareholders.
Until now Peter Armitage, previously deputy chairman, has been standing in
as chairman; 64-year-old Eric Holroyd, who was brought in from outside
during the bid, will continue as temporary managing director until his
replacement is selected.

Dixons, the electrical retailing group chaired by the veteran Stanley Kalms,
is to restructure its senior management team.
John Clare (above), the 41-year-old managing director of the Dixons Stores
Group, becomes managing director of the entire group, replacing Mark Souhami
who becomes deputy chairman.
Clare, who has rapidly climbed the Dixons management tree since joining from
Ladbroke Group in 1985, is credited with the successful integration of the
Dixons and Currys chains and with introducing more effective management
information systems and controls.
He will chair an eight-man team of senior managers with responsibility for
all the group's retail interests. One of their most pressing concerns will
be to stem the losses at Silo, the group's US business.
Clare says he has learned a lot of lessons about retailing from Kalms and
Souhami. 'They are masters of their trade, founders of 'the retail is
detail' school of management,' he said yesterday in what sounded like a
farewell eulogy.
But Kalms emphasised that neither he nor Souhami was about to retire. Kalms
once said he came in to business at the time of the London Olympics in 1948
and would like to retire when London next hosted the games. But given the
capital's lack of success in winning the venue, his future must be seen to
be in the lap of the gods.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent recovers after Bush
illness scare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT the US President, Mr George Bush, had been taken ill gave a scare
to continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS overcame early profit-taking to end better on a late bout of
futures-related buying. The CAC 40 index came off the day's low of 1,758.08
to end 6.91 higher at 1,785.64 in heavy volume of FFr3bn after FFr1.8bn.
Alcatel recovered from FFr536 to end FFr6 down at FFr548 with 440,160 shares
traded as the company denied rumours that it would buy a stake in ITT.
Analysts dismissed the rumour as implausible and attributed the share's
weakness to arbitrage related to Alcatel's buyout of SEL, its German
subsidiary.
Another loser yesterday was the water utility and construction company
Lyonnaise des Eaux, which fell FFr11 to FFr444 with 272,850 shares traded on
fears that it would have to make heavy provisions in its 1991 results for
its property development and construction activities.
Euro Disney continued to fall on profit-taking after its recent rise,
falling FFr4.20 or 2.8 per cent to FFr143.80.
Michelin extended its advance, up FFr5.80 or 4.4 per cent to FFr138.80 in
heavy trading of 1m shares after a provincial newspaper reported that it was
going to open a plant where tyres would be made entirely by robots.
The neglected insurance sector showed signs of life, as UAP added FFr19 to
FFr505 with 86,900 shares traded. One analyst said there were reports that
the insurers were seeking an increase in tariffs.
FRANKFURT looked abroad, seeing a drop in Tokyo and London and fearing a
setback on Wall Street. London strategists said that Germany's 1.2 per cent
gain in November industrial production cloaked general weakness in the
economy, that mechanical engineering orders had fallen by 5 per cent in the
same month and that renewed weakness was likely in the car industry.
Carmakers led again as share prices fell, the DAX index closing 13.72 lower
at 1,578.73 after a fall of 5.62 to 643.26 in the FAZ at midsession. Daimler
dropped DM12.20 to DM728.80 after a decline of DM13 on Monday and Tuesday.
Yesterday Mercedes-Benz, its automotive unit, talked of cutting its
workforce by a few thousand people by the mid-1990s as part of a five-year
cost-cutting programme. It also expected west German vehicle registrations
to fall from around 3.5m in 1991 to between 3m and 3.2m this year.
Volume rose from DM3.5bn to DM4.1bn. The day's most dramatic fall came at
AMB as the French insurer, AGF, said that it had acquired a blocking 25 per
cent minority stake; Banks came under profit-taking pressure, Deutsche Bank
losing DM7 at DM672 ahead of the news that it had fired two employees in
connection with 'irregularities' in its securities settlement department.
ZURICH also saw weakness in banks though industrials were relatively firm.
The Credit Suisse index eased 2.2 to 453.5. Sandoz topped the actives list
with its bearers SFr20 higher at SFr2,530 on talk of buy orders from US
investors; in banks, UBS bearers dropped SFr50 to SFr2,570.
MILAN finished mostly higher in quiet trading. The Comit index was not
available; turnover was estimated at not more than L60bn after Tuesday's
thin L51.1bn.
Fiat pulled the market higher as the ordinary shares rose L120 or 2.6 per
cent to L4,820, while Generali rose L120 to L28,400, though both stocks
eased a little after their official close.
Telecoms were steady with both Sip and Stet virtually unchanged, while Sirti
rose L115 to L10,800, reportedly on US interest.
MADRID took heart from the mid-morning recovery in New York, and the general
index closed up 1.70 at 248.38 in turnover steady at around Pta12bn. Repsol
rose Pta85 to Pta2,600 after a buy rating in New York from Smith Barney,
which looked for 15 per cent earnings growth.
STOCKHOLM overcame a weak opening to close fractionally higher. The
Affarsvarlden general index ended 0.1 higher at 928.4 in turnover of
SKr439m, down from Tuesday's record SKr1.26bn.
The construction company Skanska, saw its B shares fall SK5 to SKr130 after
news on Tuesday that it had cut its 1991 profit forecast by SKr700m to
around SKr1bn because of losses at the Norwegian construction company
Selmer.
Astra A rose SKr3 to SKr596 in turnover of SKr160m while Ericsson B eased
SKr2 to SKr103.
AMSTERDAM recovered from the day's lows on Wall Street's early bounce. The
CBS Tendency index ended flat at 113.4. The trading company, Hagemeyer,
continued to rise in the wake of the company's positive New Year statement,
closing Fl 4.50 higher at Fl 131.
HELSINKI rose for the third consecutive day with forest product companies
among the climbers as the Hex index closed 5.59 higher at 799.62. OSLO
complained of lower prices for North Sea oil, and profit-taking as the
all-share index fell 6.49, or 1.5 per cent to 424.46.
ISTANBUL surged above 4,500 for the first time since late November after
strong buying from banks sparked a late rally. The 75-share index jumped
some 100 points in the last 10 minutes to close at 4,580.56, up 160.52 or
3.6 per cent.

FOREIGN investment in the Mexico stock market reached a record Dollars
19.05bn in 1991, an increase of 348 per cent from 1990, according to the
Mexican stock market authorities.
The very steep rise in foreign investment reflected the Mexican stock
market's 118 per cent increase in dollar terms last year; 17 international
equity offers by Mexican companies which initially raised over Dollars 3bn -
of which Telmex accounted for Dollars 2.2bn; and new investment in existing
shares of around Dollars 6bn.
Almost three-quarters of the foreign investment - or Dollars 14.15bn - is
held in American Depositary Shares traded in New York, of which about 85 per
cent is invested in Telmex. Another Dollars 2.96bn of foreign investment is
held in non-voting 'B' shares of companies, and Dollars 1.6bn in the
Nacional Financiera trust, which allows investors to buy shares not open to
foreigners. Investment in the Mexican Fund, listed in New York, rose 82 per
cent to Dollars 500m during 1991.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe's airlines focus on cutting
costs - Daniel Green assesses the improvement in the shares of Continental
carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's announcement of rising traffic volume and capacity for December
by KLM, the Dutch airline quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange, rounds off
a year of improving prospects for many European air carriers.
This has been reflected in the share price performance of some of the
biggest carriers: KLM and Lufthansa strengthened steadily in the second half
of 1991, both in nominal terms and against their local markets.
The reason is that airline profits are cyclical. 'Historically, volume
growth has picked up strongly during economic recoveries,' says Mr Mark
Simpson, European airlines analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The business is
capital-intensive and so profits are highly geared towards volume.
This time, sector analysts believe a change in the way European airlines are
run will add impetus to the turnround. 'Airline managements have focused on
controlling costs as never before,' says Mr Simpson.
The outlook for revenues, and the extent to which costs can be cut, vary
from airline to airline. Staff cuts, for example, are easier at airlines
with lower levels of state control.
KLM is 34 per cent state owned and the shares have outperformed the local
market by 62 per cent over one year. It has embarked on a cost-cutting
strategy that aims to increase productivity by 23 per cent over three years.
Furthermore, 80 per cent of its revenues come from long-haul flights,
according to UBS. Such routes are more profitable than short-haul, have
shown faster growth over recent years and are insulated from uncertainties
over the speed and depth of European Community sponsored deregulation.
In the short term, KLM's year-on-year growth statistics will look
particularly good because the long-haul market slowed most during the Gulf
war a year ago. Some of KLM's share price strength has been a consequence of
discussions about a possible link with the UK's British Airways. Mr Tim
Coombs at County NatWest believes the shares will do well in the long term
even if the deal falls through, since KLM is likely to join forces with
another airline anyway.
Lufthansa is 51 per cent state owned; the shares have outperformed the local
market by 34 per cent over a year. As with KLM, a high dependence on
long-haul routes will lead to good year-on-year growth figures. Staff
rationalisation may be more of a problem, at least until the German
government gives up control.
Although there are plans for privatisation, political and financial
obstacles remain, such as links with the government pension scheme.
Swissair, 20 per cent government owned, is less geared towards long-haul
travel. The shares have performed in line with the local market over one
year. 'There is also uncertainty over how Switzerland will participate in
European liberalisation of air transport,' says Mr Coombs. Its relationship
with Delta, with which it has 5 per cent cross-shareholdings, has become
uncertain since Delta bought Pan Am's Frankfurt operations. 'Delta might set
up a European hub in Frankfurt which could damage Swissair's plans for
feeder routes for Delta's transatlantic flights,' adds Mr Coombs.
DDL is the Danish partner in SAS and 50 per cent held by the Danish
government. Alitalia is 85 per cent owned by the Italian government. Both
are heavily dependent on short-haul routes and management flexibility is
limited by the public sector stakes. Alitalia shares underperformed by 14
per cent over 12 months and DDL's by 10 per cent over the same period.
There is still some scope for further share price rises across the industry:
KLM, for example, is trading below its price two years ago. Much depends on
whether the cyclical recovery in volume expected for 1992 is enough to
outweigh overcapacity on some routes. If it is, that would set the scene for
fatter margins in 1993.

FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 3.6 per
cent as yen falls and rates rise
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LOWER yen and higher short-term interest rates erased most of the Nikkei's
gains accumulated since the cut in the Japanese discount rate on December
30, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
Widespread rumours regarding a fresh scandal involving a speculative
investment group and leading politicians also sent jitters through the
market. The Nikkei closed 851.39 or 3.6 per cent lower at 22,715.00 after a
day's high of 23,539.53 and a low of 22,704.68.
Volume eased from 215m to 200m shares. Declines led gains by 897 to 104,
with 104 issues unchanged, and all 36 TSE first section sectors retreated.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 53.28 to 1,693.39 but, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.52 firmer at 1,275.39.
The stock market opened higher on New York's overnight stability, but
selling flooded the floor as the government bond market lost ground and the
yen went into reverse after its recent strong gains against the dollar.
Investment trusts were among the leading sellers. Later in the day, futures
and options-linked arbitrage selling added to the losses.
'People had high expectations of almost another Plaza Accord but it is not
going to happen,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at Warburg
Securities, of hopes that Japanese and US officials would take steps to
boost the yen.
Equities also came under pressure from the Bank of Japan's tightening of
credit, which sent short-term interest rates sharply higher. After lowering
its official discount rate late last month, the central bank guided the
unsecured overnight call rate as high as 6.5 per cent yesterday.
Although declines were widespread, interest rate-sensitive issues were among
the largest losers, with Fuji Bank down Y150 to Y2,400 and Sumitomo Bank
Y120 to Y2,110. Leading electricals were also depressed, with Pioneer
shedding Y230 to Y3,360 and Sony Y220 to Y4,080.
In Osaka, the OSE average dropped 625.80 to 24,116.57 on volume of 32.9m
shares. Nintendo, the electronic game maker,fell Y400 to Y11,800.
Roundup
TOKYO'S fall unsettled most of the Pacific Rim yesterday.
TAIWAN continued its advance, the weighted index rising 53.80 or 1.1 per
cent to 4,772.61 as turnover swelled to TDollars 42.3bn from TDollars
35.1bn, the largest in six months.
Shares benefiting from the rise in the local currency included President
Enterprises, up TDollars 2 to TDollars 50, and Charoen Pok Phand
Enterprises, which rose TDollars 2.70 to TDollars 41.60.
HONG KONG gave up early gains to profit-taking. The Hang Seng index lost
10.26 to 4,337.67 in turnover of HKDollars 1.66bn, after HKDollars 1.41bn.
Trading hongs continued to attract overseas buying. Jardine Matheson held
its ground at HKDollars 40.25 while Hutchison Whampoa put on 20 cents to
HKDollars 15.10.
SEOUL tumbled on news of problems at small manufacturing companies. The
composite index fell 19.42 to 625.82 in turnover of Won337.2bn, after
Won482.8bn. Hyundai fell its daily limit on rumours that the government has
ordered state-controlled banks not to make loans to the group.
AUSTRALIA slipped in spite of the government's 11th cut in interest rates in
two years. The All Ordinaries index eased 4.3 to 1,663.4. Turnover rose to
ADollars 229m from ADollars 195m.
SINGAPORE focused on Overseas Union Bank (OUB) on renewed talk that Lien
Ying Chow, the OUB chief, was reducing his stake in the bank. OUB closed 20
cents higher at SDollars 4.90 with 2.8m shares traded. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed 6.54 down at 1,494.55. Volume eased to SDollars 135m
from SDollars 137m.
MANILA saw turnover boosted to 1.58bn pesos from 80m by the the listing of
Manila Electric Co (Meralco). Meralco A shares closed at 127 pesos, up from
an offer price of 118 pesos. Meralco B ended at 134 pesos, up from an issue
price of 121 pesos. The composite index dropped 14.09 to 1,227.39 on
profit-taking.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price hits 1988 low but
recovers on strike fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR price of copper, the world's most heavily-traded metal, dropped
to its lowest level since August 1988 on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday. However, the fall was partly reversed in late trading by news
that miners in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, might go on
strike.
Analysts suggested the metal's price had some way to fall before it
reflected the true state of supply and demand in the market.
For much of last year the price was held up in a market support operation by
Sumitomo, the Japanese trading house, but this support has now apparently
been removed.
Copper for delivery in three months touched Pounds 1,149.50 a tonne at one
point yesterday before it recovered to close at Pounds 1,153.75, down Pounds
3.50 on Tuesday's close. The price has fallen by Pounds 26.50 a tonne or 2
per cent in the past three days.
Chile's Copper Miners' Confederation is threatening to strike if the
government goes ahead with plans to speed up development of the country's
natural resources by allowing private companies to take control of some of
the ore reserves of Codelco (the state-owned Chile Copper Corporation).
Some analysts suggested the union was posturing and was unlikely to carry
out the strike threat.
Interruptions to supply have plagued the copper industry for some years but
have become a much less important consideration during the recession.
Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's
largest mining company, suggested recently that there should be enough
copper at all its stages of production to satisfy demand.
'This applies not just over the next few years but also in 1992, even when
account is taken of present and prospective supply disruptions,' he said.
Against this background, said Mr Crowson, 'copper prices will tend to equate
to the marginal cash costs of production of those mines which are sensitive
to the balance between prices and costs'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas was a dull and featureless period for the wool market. However,
with the US dollar weaker as a result of an interest rate reduction, and
sterling weaker within Europe as a result of interest rate rises there,
individual re-calculation of prices has often been necessary. Non-payment of
debts by successors of the Soviet Union is a disturbing feature in assessing
prospects in the second half of the Australian selling season, which opens
next week. South African wool prices at a sale on January 8 were around 7%
lower and there was a poor clearance to the trade, which cannot be seen as a
good omen.

RAW SUGAR futures at the London Futures and Options Exchange will revert to
floor trading on January 17.
The market moved from open-outcry trading on to the exchange's screen-based
system on January 11 last year in an attempt to reverse a worrying decline
in the number of lots being traded. The move was encouraged by the
continuing success of the screen-based white sugar contract, launched in
1987.
However, raw sugar trading failed to revive after the switch and, after
studying returns from a questionnaire distributed to members of the sugar
market, the exchange decided in September that it should return to the
floor.
Mr Michael Overlander, the chairman of the London sugar market committee,
said yesterday that five sugar trading companies and an assortment of locals
(traders operating on their own account) would staff the raw sugar floor.
Traders said the five companies were Sucden (UK), Refco Overseas, GNI,
Credit Lyonnais Rouse and Pierson ICS.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq-UN talks depress oil price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES tumbled yesterday to the lowest levels since the end of the Gulf
war last February as traders reacted to the prospect of the return of Iraqi
oil to the market. The price of North Sea Brent crude for February delivery
fell Dollars 1.12 1/2 to Dollars 17.05 a barrel.
An Iraqi delegation met officials from the United Nations yesterday in
Vienna for the first of two days of talks on a resumption of Iraqi exports,
which up to now has been blocked by a UN embargo.
The talks, which have been described as 'constructive' by a UN official, are
seeking a compromise under which Iraq could export Dollars 1.6bn-worth of
oil to raise cash for humanitarian purposes. On Monday President George Bush
was rumoured to have relaxed conditions attached to the sale.
The possibility of an Iraqi return to the international market has further
depressed an already weak market. Prices have declined by almost Dollars 6 a
barrel in the past six weeks as winter weather in the west has remained
unusually mild.
Gas oil, the traditional European heating oil, slipped by Dollars 10 a tonne
yesterday to Dollars 156 a tonne. Companies and consumers had built stocks
in anticipation of a harsh winter and a rapid decline in deliveries from the
former Soviet Union, neither of which materialised.
The collapse in oil prices has prompted calls from some smaller producers in
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for an emergency meeting
to cut production. Opec members have been producing flat-out to compensate
for the absence of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
In an interview with a government newspaper yesterday, Mr Osama al-Hiti,
Iraq's oil minister, accused Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of
flooding the market to keep prices low 'in service to the US economy'.

TRADERS WERE predicting a test of upside resistance in the aluminium market
after a strong performance at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. They
attributed the rise to a heavy bout of trade buying in the morning, and in
spite of having to absorb a profit-taking in the afternoon, the three-months
position closed Dollars 9.75 higher at Dollars 1,143.25. Zinc prices
continued their rally with the cash position adding the Dollars 9 to
Tuesday's Dollars 11 rise. Traders explained that fears of a squeeze on
supplies for February delivery, which had been easing, flared up again,
prompting a wave of short-covering. At the London bullion market the scare
about President Bush's health pushed the gold price to Dollars 351.40 a troy
ounce at one point. But as concern eased the price fell back to Dollars
350.30 an ounce, up 65 cents on the day. Dealers said gold was as
technically oversold with good physical demand underpinning the market.
Robusta coffee prices were firmer at the London Futures and Options
Exchange, with the March position closing Pounds 16 up at Pounds 548 a
tonne. However, dealers said there was disappointment at the failure to
break through Pounds 550 and described market activity as 'routine'. Cocoa
prices reached four-month lows before finishing little changed.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Business Law: The drive to greater efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHEATON and GRAHAM SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWLS OF anguish often greet the announcement of the award of a government
contract. If it goes to foreign competition, British industry claims it is
being put at risk. If it goes to a British company foreign competitors claim
it increases the cost to the British taxpayer.
The most spectacular instances usually occur in the defence sector. Recent
examples include the award to Vickers of the contract for the Army's main
battle tank, the Challenger II , against strong US competition; and the
success of the IBM-Westland consortium for the Navy's Merlin Helicopter over
GEC and British Aerospace.
Up to now, companies seeking government business have lobbied ministers,
civil servants and MPs, and tried to get their case well aired in the press.
But apart from looking at the fine print in the invitations to tender and
the contract, their lawyers have been able to offer little assistance.
This has now changed. The EC Public Procurement Directives have been given
real teeth in the UK. Companies which can show that rules in the Directives
have been broken can now go to the High Court and ask for an injunction to
stop the contract being awarded. If the contract has already been awarded,
they can claim damages.
This is the effect of two Statutory Instruments, The Public Works Contracts
Regulations 1991 and The Public Supply Contracts Regulations 1991 which came
into force on December 21 last year.
The main reason for the EC Directives is the long-standing concern of the
European Commission in Brussels about national governments buying national.
Public sector procurement expenditure in the EC is enormous, amounting to
about 15 per cent of the sum of the EC countries' GDP. Only a tiny fraction
has been awarded by national public sector purchasers to companies from
other EC countries. One estimate is that every consumer in the EC would be
Pounds 215 better off every year if open procurement rules were followed by
the utilities - water, energy, transport and telecommunications - alone.
But there are other reasons for the Directives apart from helping to create
the single market. The EC Commission argues that open competition would lead
to greater efficiency, cut costs and improve the international
competitiveness of EC industries.
The policy of the UK government is to support the directives. Speaking in
June on competition policy as the main incentive to efficiency, Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary, warned: 'We will not see the benefits
from the single market programme until we dismantle restrictive national
purchasing policies.'
The US has had legislation to compel competition in government contracting
for many years and 'bid protest litigation' is common in America.
Contractors can protest to a number of tribunals, including the General
Accounting Office, and the General Services Board of Contract Appeals, which
have to render decisions in no more than 90 and 45 working days
respectively. During last year, protesters obtained relief before the GSBCA
in some 111 cases - 42 per cent of cases filed.
In the UK the two new regulations give important rights to contractors and
suppliers. The court may grant an interim order suspending the contract
award procedure, and, if it is satisfied that there is a breach of the duty
to comply with the regulations, it may set aside any decision of the
contract awarding authority (unless the contract has been entered into) or
award damages, or do both.
There is no limit on the amount of damages which may be awarded. Clearly the
costs of preparing an unsuccessful tender could be claimed. For a big
project, these may be very substantial. It remains to be seen whether the
courts will entertain claims for loss of opportunity and profits.
The rules are complex, and differ between contracts for the supply of goods
and those for works, such as building or engineering works.
Contracts must be publicly advertised in the EC 'Official Journal'. Large
purchasers will have to give advance notice of their purchasing plans for a
year ahead. Discriminatory technical specifications are prohibited.
Rules are laid down for contract award procedures. Preference is given to
'open procedures' whereby all interested suppliers can tender, and there are
limits on the use which contracting authorities can make of 'restricted
procedures' (whereby only those invited by the authority may submit tenders)
and 'negotiated procedures' (whereby the authority negotiates only with the
contractors or suppliers of its choice).
Contracts must be awarded either to the offer with the lowest price or to
the offer which is 'the most economically advantageous' to the contracting
authority; the authority must select at the outset which basis it will use.
Criteria for determing 'the most economically advantageous' offer are laid
down.
Contracting authorities must give information about contract awards
including, in some cases, reasons for rejecting unsuccessful tenders.
Minor contracts are excluded. The rules do not apply to contracts for public
works with an estimated value of less than Ecu5m, or to supply contracts
below Ecu200,000 (there is a lower threshold for those central government
purchasing authorities which are subject to the Gatt Agreement on Government
Procurement).
The rules do not apply only to central government departments, but also to
many other public bodies such as local authorities, police, fire, education
and health authorities. From January 1, 1993, the rules will be extended in
most EC member states to the utilities.
Even though companies operating in these sectors may not be state owned,
they will still be caught if they operate on the basis of 'special or
exclusive rights'. The rules will therefore apply, for example, to the UK
electricity companies, water companies, British Gas, BAA, British Telecom,
Mercury and Racal Vodafone.
In due course the rules will also extend to contracts for services as well
as for works and supplies.
The new UK regulations implement the so-called 'review directive' adopted by
the EC Council in 1989, which required implementation by December 1, 1991.
The UK is one of the first member states to do this.
France has introduced a bill, but it has not yet been enacted. In Germany
the legislative procedure is not expected to be completed until the end of
1992. There has been criticism that the UK is opening its doors before the
others. However, other procedures (under which a number of cases have been
hears in the European Court) may still give a remedy, although these involve
the Commission bringing an action against a member state and have not been
very effective.
And, in the Francovich judgment last November, the European Court of Justice
held that a member state which has failed to implement a directive can be
sued for damages.
So will there be a flood of litigation? Only time will tell, but the stakes
are high. Although duty to comply with the rules is owed only to contractors
and suppliers which are nationals of and established in a member state,
there are many European subsidiaries of US companies which will qualify
under these criteria and whose executives will have had experience of
exercising their rights in the US under the rules there.
There is one notable exception in the rules - they do not apply to 'arms,
munitions and war material' as defined in a list drawn up by the EC
Commission under Article 223 of the Rome Treaty.
Many of the biggest government contracts will not, therefore, be covered by
these new rules. In a recent speech, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition
commissioner, expressed dissatisfaction at this: 'It has meant, in practice,
that the bulk of European defence orders are still filled by highly
protected, high cost, national producers . . . It has led to grotesque
distortions too in the sub-contracting field, because companies making
defence related bids across national frontiers have to devise so-called
'off-setting' contracts in the customers' market'.
Sir Leon recorded that the Commission has suggested the repeal of Article
223. In the meantime, it will be looking closely at any devices to protect
so-called 'dual use' production with primarily civil applications. The
Commission is showing considerable determination to impose a strict public
procurement regime, and can be expected to continue to press for it to be
extended also to all defence contracts.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Technology: Growing pains - Louise Kehoe assesses Sematech's
ambitious five-year plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can Sematech, the controversial US government-funded chip makers'
consortium, live up to its promise to 're-establish American pre-eminence in
semiconductor manufacturing technology'?
As Sematech leaders seek support for a second five-year phase of operations,
the achievements of the research consortium are coming under closer scrutiny
in both industry and government circles.
Sematech is also being closely watched as an experiment in precompetitive,
generic research and development that may provide an important model for
other sectors of the US manufacturing industry struggling to maintain or
reassert their international competitiveness.
This week's withdrawal of one of Sematech's founding member companies, LSI
Logic, has raised new questions about the effectiveness of collaborative
ventures among companies with differing technology and financial objectives.
To date, it has been difficult to assess Sematech's achievements. Many of
the consortium's research projects have been shrouded in what the group's
executives acknowledge has been 'excessive secrecy' aimed at maintaining
maximum competitive advantage for member companies.
But now Sematech is boasting about its achievements and has recently
published a summary of the results of some of its research projects. 'By the
end of 1992 we will have achieved parity with our (Japanese) competitors,'
claims William Spencer, Sematech president and chief executive.
By the end of 1992 Sematech expects to show that it can make integrated
circuits with features measuring just 0.35 microns (millionths of a metre)
in width, about half the size of today's most advanced devices. This will
put Sematech on a par with leading Japanese chip producers.
More significant is that Sematech aims to achieve this advance in chip
process production technology using all American-built equipment.
When Sematech was formed, in 1987, its member companies expected to purchase
less than 40 per cent of their production equipment for the next generation
of 'sub-micron' chips from American suppliers. Actual purchases by US chip
makers now average over 70 per cent American-made.
For Sematech this is one of the most important measures of its success to
date. Although the consortium originally planned to focus on the production
process rather than the manufacturing of equipment, the emphasis changed.
Well over half of Sematech's budget has been dedicated to R&amp;D contracts with
US semiconductor equipment companies to create new equipment or to improve
the performance of existing products.
Sematech highlights, for example, its work with GCA, a US manufacturer of
photolithography equipment, that had seen its market share dwindle in the
late 1980s. GCA's latest lithography equipment matches the performance of
the best that Japanese companies can offer.
Not all of Sematech's member companies were pleased with the shift of
emphasis. 'Preserving the US equipment industry is a laudable goal, but it
was not Sematech's charter,' complains Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI
Logic.
Sematech has prepared a lengthy summary of its technical accomplishments,
detailing improvements in the performance of US-built semiconductor
production equipment as well as programs designed to standardise equipment
testing and establish standards for equipment interfaces.
But Sematech's most important achievements, according to industry
executives, are intangible changes in the relationships between US chip
makers and production equipment suppliers - from adversaries to partners.
Sematech cannot prove that it is responsible for an improvement in the
competitiveness of the US chip industry, or of US production equipment
suppliers. While both segments of the industry have achieved some success in
world markets, these results can be explained by external factors.
US chip makers, for example, reversed their declining share of the world
semiconductor market in 1991. This is largely explained, however, by a sharp
decline in the price of memory chips made in Japan. Similarly, some US
semiconductor equipment producers have increased their foreign sales, but
might well have done so without Sematech's support, according to industry
analysts.
Under pressure to establish its value in order to obtain continued funding,
Sematech may be 'sugar coating' its record; glossing over the difficulties
of maintaining a consensus among companies with differing goals and
expectations.
Sematech might do better to admit that it is only now getting into its
stride. Although the industry group was incorporated in August 1987 it was
almost another year before the appointment of Robert Noyce as chief
executive.
Only in early 1989 did Sematech begin operation of its prototype chip plant
in Austin. After a significant re-evaluation of the direction of Sematech,
it began to take shape in the second half of 1989 but was still beset by
concerns over federal funding.
The sudden death of Noyce in mid-1990 left Sematech bereft of a leader.
William Spencer, the current chief executive, has had only one year at the
helm. Thus while Sematech is being judged as a five-year old it is really
little more than a toddler, still wobbly on its feet but determined to prove
its abilities.
Sematech's plans for the next five years are just as ambitious as those
mapped out for its first. They include the development of
computer-integrated manufacturing software for automated chip plants and a
new emphasis on flexible manufacturing.
Sematech aims to accelerate the development of new generations of
semiconductor technology by 25 per cent. 'Sematech's proposals are without
precedent,' Spencer claims, 'but five years ago Sematech was without
precedent.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Technology: Breast implant ban would cost Pounds 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the US Food and Drug Administration converts its moratorium on the use of
silicone breast implants to a permanent ban, it will destroy a medical
industry with a worldwide turnover estimated at Pounds 400m a year.
Breast enlargement and reconstruction is one of the largest categories of
cosmetic surgery. In the US at least 10,000 women a month receive breast
implants - about 80 per cent are cosmetic operations and the remainder are
to replace diseased breasts, usually after cancer.
The UK has 500 implant operations a month, half for cosmetic and half for
medical reasons. The operation typically costs Pounds 2,500 for a private
patient. Most of this is to cover surgical and hospital fees. A pair of
implants costs around Pounds 400, says Jim Bolland, European clinical
affairs manager for Dow Corning, the world's largest mammary implant
manufacturer.
Dow Corning, a US company owned jointly by Dow Chemical and Corning Glass,
suspended shipments worldwide following this week's FDA decision to stop the
use of silicone implants while an expert panel assesses evidence about their
safety. The implants have been linked particularly to diseases of the immune
system such as scleroderma, which causes hardening of the skin and
stiffening of the joints.
Most plastic surgeons in the UK have expressed dismay at the FDA action,
which they say is not justified by the very small incidence of side-effects
among more than 2m women worldwide who have had silicone implants over the
last 30 years. Many agreed with Gus McGrouther, professor of plastic surgery
at University College Hospital, London, who accused the FDA of
scaremongering and creating an unnecessary 'wave of international panic'
among women who have received implants.
'I shall carry on operating for as long as I can obtain the implants,' says
David Sharpe, consultant plastic surgeon at St Luke's Hospital, Bradford. He
still has stocks of American implants and if they cannot be replenished he
hopes to get replacements from Europe.
Most implants today are filled with silicone gel, which has the right amount
of chemical cross-linking to mimic the consistency of natural breast tissue.
The old type of 'saline' implant, filled with a solution of salt water,
accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of the UK market.
Saline implants are not included in the FDA moratorium but they suffer from
several disadvantages, Sharpe says. They feel less natural than silicone and
are more liable to leak or collapse.
Unfortunately the original smooth-surface silicone implants often cause
'capsular contraction'. This occurs when a hard layer of collagen (fibrous
protein) forms around the device.
One solution was to coat the silicone with polyurethane. Surgitek, a
subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US pharmaceutical group, pioneered
polyurethane-coated implants during the 1980s. They were popular with
surgeons and patients but were withdrawn from the market last year after the
FDA expressed concern that the coating could release carcinogenic chemicals
into the body.
Plastic surgeons now favour implants with a 'textured' silicone surface
which are less liable to cause capsular contraction that the original smooth
surface.
As an alternative to an artificial implant, it is possible to enlarge the
breasts of some patients by transplanting fat and muscle from their own
buttocks or abdomen. But this is a potentially complex and hazardous
operation and it could not be used on such as wide scale as silicone
implants.
Whatever one's views on the merits of purely cosmetic breast enlargement (or
augmentation as it is known in the trade), breast reconstruction has become
a medical necessity for women forced to undergo mastectomy following cancer,
Sharpe says. And the prospect of having their breasts replaced helps
patients come to terms with the disease. An unfortunate side-effect of the
FDA scare has been to frighten companies such as Bristol-Myers out of
implant manufacturing, instead of developing new and safer devices.

MORGAN Stanley, the US investment bank, has become one of only five
correspondants en valeurs du tresor (CVTs), or brokers in government bonds,
appointed by the French government.
The approval stops short of full specialiste en valeurs du tresor (SVT)
status, under which banks act as primary dealers in French government
securities.
Morgan, which has an investment banking presence in Paris, said it hoped to
set up a new separately-capitalised securities operation in the coming
months to take advantage of its new status.
The operation is expected to develop in a wide range of French securities.
The move to become a CVT is expected to be a prelude to the bank seeking
full SVT status.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: G7 companies' profits
expected to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKET analysts have cut their profits forecasts for both 1991 and
1992 for companies in the seven leading economies, according to the IBES
research service, based in New York.
The IBES survey was carried out at the end of December by adding together
thousands of individual company earnings forecasts from analysts around the
world.
In all the G7 countries except Germany, profits are forecast to fall in 1991
 -by as much as 21.9 per cent in Canada, 11.4 per cent in the US and 9.8 per
cent in the UK. German profits are forecast to rise by 1.5 per cent in 1991,
which represents a drop in real terms.
The outlook has worsened in the past three months: profits forecasts for
both 1991 and 1992 are lower than they were in September.
Forecasts for both periods have been reduced most sharply in Canada and
Italy.
In Japan, where the forecast for profits growth in 1992 is particularly weak
 -only 4 per cent - profits for the corporate year that ends in March 1993
are expected to be below the level of two years before.
In all the other countries, where the figures are based on calendar years,
1992 profits are forecast to be higher than in 1990, though often by small
amounts after allowing for inflation.
At the end of December, price-earnings ratios based on 1992 earnings were
higher in three countries - Canada, Italy and the US - than at the end of
September. A higher p/e ratio is usually taken to mean that stock prices are
more 'expensive' than they were. P/es were unchanged in Germany and the UK
and lower in Canada, Italy and Japan.

COMPASS Airlines, the grounded Australian domestic airline, has a 50 per
cent chance of flying again, Mr Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator,
said yesterday.
Compass stopped flying on December 20 after it was unable to pay fees of
about ADollars 400,000 (USDollars 303,000) to the Australian Civil Aviation
Authority. The airline lost control of its five leased aircraft when the
owners began actions for repossession.
Mr Ferrier said he hoped to avoid liquidating the airline, which has debts
of ADollars 45.2m as a going concern, but added that it would owe ADollars
171.2m if it failed to return to the skies.
He said the federal government had agreed to support a business plan under
which ADollars 35m of Compass's debts would be converted to equity, and the
airline would be provided with a standby credit facility of ADollars 10m.
The business plan provides for an increase of up to 7 per cent in average
fares, a greater effort to attract full-fare business customers, and more
efficient operations.
Mr Ferrier said there was a good chance that a large investor could be found
that would inject fresh equity into Compass before February 4, when the
Federal Court is expected to decide whether the airline can be saved.
Mr Ferrier said the government had undertaken to give serious consideration
to any proposed investment in Compass by a foreign airline. He refused to
say whether any foreign airlines had expressed interest. Compass had talks
with Air New Zealand shortly after ceasing operations, but it is thought to
have decided against rescuing the airline.
Mr Bryan Grey, the founder and chief executive of Compass, has agreed to
stand down while the company is restructured by the liquidator. Attempts by
Mr Grey to find a significant investor for Compass appear to have failed.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Olivetti to seek further 2,500
job cuts in Italy

OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computers and office equipment group,
yesterday announced it would be seeking a further 2,500 redundancies in its
Italian workforce in a further bid to reduce costs.
Olivetti, which reported a L73.7bn (Dollars 61.82m) interim loss last year,
has already won agreement for 3,500 lay-offs, shrinking its workforce to
around 47,000. Some 3,000 of the redundancies will come through a
state-backed early retirement scheme, while the remining 500 will be offered
alternative public sector employment.
However, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the group's majority shareholder, who
returned to full-time management control last November, has stressed the
need for further savings if Olivetti is to survive the current crisis in the
world information technology industry.
Mr De Benedetti has not hidden his pessimism about prospects for economic
recovery this year and has been harshly critical of Italy's declining
industrial competitiveness.
Since his return to full-time management, Olivetti has announced the
scrapping of its previous organsational structure, in existence for barely
three years, in favour of a simpler system which it is claimed could save
L400bn a year.
The latest round of redundancies presented at the start of a three-day
negotiating session with the unions may also include proposals to transfer
further manufacturing abroad. Olivetti currently has production facilities
in Singapore and Mexico, apart from its numerous plants in Italy. According
to Mr De Benedetti, costs in Singapore are around one-tenth those at home.
With Italy in an election year, political considerations may have
constrained the company's job-cutting targets. But prospects of heavy losses
for 1991 - some analysts predict L200bn - have given Mr De Benedetti a
strong bargaining counter with both unions and the government, which
Olivetti has long been pressing for more orders.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Burda forecasts record profits
on 8% sales gain

<TEXT>
THE AGGRESSIVE Burda publishing group yesterday forecast record profits and
an 8 per cent increase in sales for 1991. Turnover, which has more than
doubled in the past five years, would reach DM1.35bn, (Dollars 881m), the
company said in an informal review of the last year.
Claiming a 15 per cent share of the newly-opened magazine and newspaper
market in east Germany, the company announced a DM500m, five-year investment
programme. Half the total will be spent on expanding its five print works.
The owner, Mr Hubert Burda, traditionally ploughs back all profits -
expected to be DM75m in 1991 - into new plant and publications.
In the past year, it has bombarded easterners with a range of lurid
full-colour newspapers and magazines such as Super-Zeitung, which now sells
450,000 a day, matching the east German circulation of the long-established
Bild.
Burda opened a new print works in Berlin in a joint venture with News
International.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THYSSEN, Germany's biggest steel maker, is examining urgent economy measures
which could lead to the merger of its two main steel subsidiaries.
Following inconclusive negotiations with Krupp on co-operation in special
steel manufacture, which ended last month, the group immediately started
'intensive talks on the possibility of internal co-operation', it said
yesterday.
Group profits fell 25 per cent in 1991, the third consecutive decline,
mainly because of difficulties in international steel markets, which were
underlined yesterday by the announcement that British Steel is to close its
works in Ravenscraig, Scotland, with the loss of 1,220 jobs.
A report containing 'several different concepts' will be presented to the
Thyssen supervisory board on January 17, a spokesman said. These include
possible collaboration in marketing, manufacture and buying. Talk about
merging Thyssen Stahl and the loss-making special steels company, Thyssen
Edelstahl, was 'speculation'.
Both subsidiaries are due to publish results later this month which will
show continuing losses at Thyssen Edelstahl, which lost DM176m (Dollars
111.3m) on sales of DM3.9bn in 1990, and further deterioration at Thyssen
Stahl, where profits fell 16 per cent in the same year on turnover of
DM10.5bn.
Both have been hit by low world prices and demand, and are now feeling
increased pressure from the slowdown in the German economy, which is heavily
dependent on the metalworking industries.
Internal restructuring at Thyssen, flagship of the German steel industry,
which accounts for 25 per cent of the country's total 40m tonnes annual
output, will mark a further important step in the rapid rationalisation of
companies and capacity.
Four months ago, Krupp launched its takeover of Hoesch to create a group
with around 8m tonnes capacity. Voest Alpine, the Austrian company, said
last month it would close its only German special steelworks in Dusseldorf
by the year-end.
Mannesmann, the smallest of the country's Big Four steel groups, recently
announced a joint venture in tube manufacture with Hoesch. Thyssen Stahl,
meanwhile, is building a mini steelworks in collaboration with AFV Beltrame
in Oberhausen.
The new plant, which marks a switch from traditional, labour-intensive
integrated works, will produce 250,000 tonnes a year and employ around 475
workers.

NET PROFIT of Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano-based Swiss bank in which
Japan's Sumitomo Bank has a majority stake, rose 9.5 per cent to SFr46m
(Dollars 33m) in 1991, thanks to strong activity in foreign exchange
business, a satisfactory trend in interest margins and exceptional
contributions from recent acquisitions.
The directors proposed maintaining the 20 per cent dividend, equal to SFr20
per share or participation certificate.
Cash-flow was up 34 per cent to SFr110m. The bank was thus able to carry on
with its policy of depreciating new investments and covering exposure
towards risk countries. Provisions and depreciation allowances were up 60
per cent to SFr64m. The bank said that difficulties in the Swiss property
market had only a 'minor' impact.
Total assets rose 8 per cent to SFr7.4bn.
Despite a decline in the number of its subsidiaries, the bank estimates that
its consolidated net profit will exceed 1990's SFr51m.

Czech food group

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss-based food maker, and BSN, the French biscuit
manufacturer, are to forge an unusual joint venture in order to gain control
of Cokoladovny, Czechoslovakia's largest food producer.
The two food companies, otherwise fierce rivals in the European foods
business, will pay 2.6bn Czech crowns (Dollars 95.5m) to acquire together 43
per cent of Cokoladovny.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), making its
largest investment in Czechoslovakia so far, will acquire a further 15 per
cent of Cokoladovny for 900m Czech crowns.
The deal values the Czech company at an estimated Dollars 222.2m.
Nestle and BSN have agreed to form a partnership after the Czech company
insisted that both chocolate and biscuit manufacturing expertise were needed
to upgrade and expand its production. Other food manufacturers, such as
Phillip Morris and Jacobs Suchard, did not alone fill these requirements,
said officials in the Czech government.
The two food companies will invest a further Dollars 114.8m in the Czech
company over the next four years. Of this amount, Dollars 81.4m will go
toward increasing Nestles and BSN's equity participation, which should reach
53 per cent in 1993 and 57 per cent in 1996.
The joint venture is conditional upon a favourable ruling by the European
Commission to ensure that the monopolistic impact of the joint venture
re-exporting its products to EC member-countries is negligible.
According to Mr Alex Tyrteos, a senior banker at EBRD, Nestle and BSN will
produce very few of their brand products in Czechoslovakia, however. 'The
incremental impact of products coming back into the EC will only reach 2 to
3 per cent of these items' total production in western Europe,' he said.
Instead, Nestle and BSN will focus on upgrading existing local chocolate and
biscuit products in order to maintain the current domestic market share,
which is imminently threatened by imports due to lower tariffs. Exports to
central European, rather than western European countries, are planned for a
later stage.
Nestle and BSN will add their names to a spate of other western companies
such Mercedes and Air France which earlier this week unveiled plans to
invest in Czechoslovakia.
Nestle said yesterday that its investment in Cokoladovny was part of a
pragmatic approach to developing markets in eastern Europe.
For the moment, apart from rapid development in eastern Germany, the group
was interested only in investing in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland,
countries where it seemed possible to operate on a commercial basis.
Early last year, it bought a 97 per cent stake in Interscokolade, the second
largest chocolate producer in Hungary, and it had other projects under study
in all three countries.
Nestle said it was possible that in five or six years the joint venture
might break up, with BSN taking the biscuit business and Nestle the
confectionery side.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chrysler unveils top-range LH
vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the smallest of the big three US vehicle makers, yesterday
unveiled a new generation of large executive saloon cars, the result of a
Dollars 1.5bn development programme.
The so-called LH project is one of the most ambitious new product programmes
ever undertaken by Chrysler, and marks its first all-new car programme for
more than a decade.
The cars, to be launched in the autumn in North America, as the Chrysler
Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision, are aimed at re-establishing
Chrysler in the heartland of the US market for mid-size and full-size
executive cars, where it has lost considerable market share with its present
out-dated products.
The LH cars will play a crucial role in the company's fight for survival as
an independent carmaker in the first half of the 1990s, and are the keystone
of an ambitious new product offensive unveiled this week.
Chrysler is planning to spend around Dollars 16.6bn from 1991 to 1995 on new
product development and the modernisation of its facilities, and is aiming
to replace all of its car range by 1995.
The top-of-the-range LH cars will be vital to the company's attempt to
restore its credibility as a carmaker to match its success in the light
truck market, where it has established a leading position as a maker of
multi-purpose vehicles (minivans such as the Chrysler Voyager) and
four-wheel drive vehicles, such as the Jeep Cherokee.
It has lost ground alarmingly in the US car market, however, where it was
relegated to fifth place for the first time in 1991 behind both Honda and
Toyota of Japan.
Its share of US new car sales dropped to 8.5 per cent from 9.2 per cent a
year ago, while Honda increased its share to 9.8 per cent in 1991 from 9.1
per cent in 1990, and Toyota boosted its share to 9.0 per cent from 8.3 per
cent. Chrysler's car sales fell by 18.4 per cent to 702,518.
Production of the LH range is due to begin at Chrysler's Bramalea, Ontario,
assembly plant in June, and Mr Robert Lutz, Chrysler president, said the
company was eventually aiming at a production of more than 300,000 cars a
year.

FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shake-up planned at Woolworth
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWORTH, the large US retail group whose interests range from general
merchandise stores to speciality chains, yesterday announced a major
operational overhaul. This will involve the sale or redeployment of 900
poorly-performing stores, eliminate 10,000 jobs over the next 12 to 18
months, and produce a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 250m.
Woolworth's announcement is the latest in a series of upheavals in the
beleaguered US retail sector.
Earlier this week, Sears Roebuck announced plans to cut almost 7,000 jobs
through improved customer service facilities. Seaman's, the east coast
furniture retailer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shortly after
Christmas. Certain creditors at Zale are also attempting to put the largest
US jewellery retailer into bankruptcy.
Mr Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman, claimed that the move would 'focus
resources on (the company's) strongest store formats and locations', and
help it meet financial objectives. In the first nine months of 1991,
Woolworth saw a 55 per cent drop in net profits, to Dollars 75m. Woolworth
shares, however, greeted yesterday's announcement with a fall of Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 27.
Woolworth said the shake-up would involve discontinuing two speciality store
formats - Susie's/Sportelle womenswear boutiques, with 207 stores, and
Richman Brothers/Anderson-Little clothing chains, with 268 outlets and three
manufacturing plants. The Susie's/Sportelle locations will generally be
redeployed, while Woolworth said it was investigating the possibility of
selling Richman-Anderson-Little.
Five other chains within the Woolworth group are being pruned: the Kids
Mart/Little Folk childrenswear chains by 15 per cent, the Kinney shoe shops
by 25 per cent, and the Woolworth/Woolworth Express general merchandise
stores by eight per cent.
During the first nine months of 1991, stores involved in the overhaul had
sales of around Dollars 342m, and an operating loss of Dollars 50m. Total
operating profits for all US stores during this period were Dollars 168m.
Woolworth Corporation currently operates around 6,500 stores in the US, of
which about 5,500 are speciality stores. It has around 9,300 outlets
worldwide.
The overhaul affects around 4,700 full-time jobs and 5,300 part-time
employees. Woolworth said staff in the specialty chains which are not sold
'may be offered other jobs within the company'.
The group's total US staff comprises 38,000 full-time employees and 32,000
part-timers.
The retail group also announced a variety of management changes at senior
executive level yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDERS Holdings, the largest Ford main dealer in Scotland, finished the
year to September 30 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 701,000, compared to
Pounds 1.9m previously.
As promised at the halfway stage, the dividend is held at 1p. Earnings per
share have fallen from 3.56p to 1.18p.
Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairwoman, said the year had been characterised by
the deep recession and record bankruptcies, many in the motor sector. Group
sales fell to Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 92.7m).
However, the group continued to pursue a progressive medium term strategy.
That was evidenced by the enhancement of facilities at Edinburgh and
Kirkintilloch, and the provision of new premises at Greenock.
She said additional directors would be appointed in 1992, and that would
represent the next key phase in the business strategy and plan to optimise
profit and growth as the economy recovers.
Since almost doubling its profit to Pounds 1.73m in the year 1987-88 the
group has shown a steady increase.
The setback this year follows a Pounds 500,000 reduction at the halfway
stage.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Used cars and after sales work curb Reg
Vardy decline to 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH IN the sales of used cars and in repairs and servicing helped to
cushion Reg Vardy, the motor dealer, against the falling new car market in
the six months to October 31.
Pre-tax profit slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 2.02m (Pounds 2.1m) on a near
Pounds 2m increase in turnover to Pounds 95.6m. Interest costs rose to
Pounds 721,000 (Pounds 651,000), although debt of Pounds 4.3m was wiped out
in October by a Pounds 12.9m placing and open offer.
Nearly Pounds 2m has been invested in a Nissan dealership after Vardy won
the first franchise from the Japanese manufacturer's new distribution
company.
The Tyne and Wear-based group announced its results as the UK industry was
digesting dismal figures showing that new car sales fell by 21 per cent to
1.59m units in 1991, nearly a third less than the 2.3m record set in 1989.
Mr Peter Vardy, chairman and holder of 53 per cent of the equity, reckoned
that the new car market would start to grow again this year, gaining perhaps
10 to 12 per cent.
However, because of political uncertainty ahead of the Budget and the
general election, the recovery would not benefit the group in its current
financial year.
He also estimated that interim pre-tax profits would have been about Pounds
500,000 higher had it not been for finance companies and banks tightening up
on credit. 'We used to get 80 to 85 per cent of deals accepted by finance
companies; in this period it was 60 to 65 per cent.' He claimed the sale of
1,300 new cars had been lost.
The bulk of Vardy's customers are individuals rather than companies. Mr
Graeme Potts, managing director, said that three or four years ago, sales of
new and used cars were roughly equal, now the ratio was three to one in
favour of used vehicles in the private market.
Compared with the first half of last year, used volume car sales were 13 per
cent up, compensating for a 7 per cent fall in new car sales. Altogether the
group sold 12,365 (11,865) units from 18 outlets.
The amount of gross profit contributed by repairs and servicing went up from
44 to 49 per cent, as poorly performing dealerships bought a couple of years
ago improved.
About 60 per cent of sales and a much higher proportion of profit came from
the volume car dealerships led by Rover and Vauxhall.
The Anchor Ford division, comprising two large sites at Wolverhampton and
Reading, contributed about a third of turnover but only Pounds 300,000
operating profit - 'nothing to write home about', said Mr Vardy, but he
added that a group of Vardy's size needed to be involved with Ford.
Specialist cars, including Rolls-Royce, Jaguar and Aston Martin, sold 8 per
cent more units. Turnover totalled Pounds 17m, but margins were thin.
Earnings per share slipped to 4.22p (4.56p) with shares from the placing and
offer in for a matter of days. For the full year, the average number in
issue will go up from 31.7m to 39m.
The interim dividend is increased to 1.3p (1.2p), a rise of 8 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISYS, the computing services group, saw profits improve sharply in the half
year to November 1991, the result of a sustained attack on costs over the
past 12 months.
Profits before tax expanded from Pounds 1.52m - after exceptional costs of
Pounds 645,000 - to Pounds 3.59m, on turnover down just over 2 per cent at
Pounds 32.3m. Earnings per share rose to 7p (3.1p) and the interim dividend
is lifted from 2.16p to 2.27p.
The group, which built a reputation for growth through acquisition in the
1980s, returned to the takeover trail with the announcement of three deals
yesterday.
Its largest purchase, worth Pounds 3.55m, is Innsite, a computing services
company which provides software products for the hotel industry. The deal is
being financed by the issue of 1.8m ordinary shares at 195p.
It also spent Pounds 235,000 cash for the hardware maintenance business of
Principality Systems and bought Computer Management Systems from the
administrative receiver for Pounds 205,000 cash.
Innsite was established in 1981 by ADP, a US computing services company, and
bought out by its management and institutional investors in 1987.
With more than 100 staff, it is now one of the largest suppliers of hotel
computer systems in the UK. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
662,000 on revenues of Pounds 8m.
Poor strategy abroad, however, left it with a debt of Pounds 1.7m which
Misys intends to assume from its own resources.
Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said Innsite matched Misys' commercial profile
perfectly. It was a leader in a niche sector, profitable and resilient to
downturns in its main business, much of its revenues being derived from
software support, maintenance and training.
Misys comprises a diverse group of companies with computer services in
common. Mr Lomax said that all were trading profitably with the exception of
TIS Computing.
Cash reserves were Pounds 6.9m at the year end and Mr Lomax said he was
looking for further acquisition opportunities.

GRAND Metropolitan, the drinks, food, and retailing group, has agreed to buy
the frozen products division of McGlynn Bakeries, a leading company in the
US bakery products industry.
City estimates value the deal, which will be funded by the issue of new
GrandMet ordinary shares, at about Dollars 140m (Pounds 76.9m).
McGlynn's frozen products division manufactures and markets a line of frozen
dough, batter, and pre-baked products, and pastries and biscuits. It made
profits last year of Dollars 15m on sales of Dollars 130m.
Mr Ian Martin, GrandMet's group managing director, said the acquisition
would complement the Pillsbury baked goods business in the US. 'It provides
a prime opportunity to gain critical mass in the growing US in-store bakery
sector and it will help build the presence of Pillsbury by expanding the
product line as well as adding significant scale,' he added.
McGlynn, based in Minneapolis, is privately owned. Its frozen products
division employs more than 700 people.

<TEXT>
GOODE DURRANT, the vehicle hire and housebuilding group, maintained its
dividend in spite of interim pre-tax profits dropping more than 50 per cent,
writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr Michael Waring, chairman, said the interim dividend is being held at
2.15p - covered 1.6 times - because of the board's confidence in long-term
prospects.
However, he warned that a recovery was further off than had originally been
estimated.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 fell from Pounds 5.33m to
Pounds 2.64m on turnover down almost 27 per cent to Pounds 97.8m. Earnings
per share tumbled from 6.5p to 3.5p.
Winnedael, the hostile 25 per cent shareholder attacked the results as
abysmal.
Mr Waring stressed the improved performance on the second half of last year
when profits were Pounds 2m. He said the improvement followed reorganisation
of the small commercial vehicle hire business.
Housebuilding had had a tough six months and motor distribution almost
halved profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 714,000.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kewill shares tumble on news of problems at
German side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Kewill Systems fell 30 per cent yesterday after declining
sales at the recently acquired German subsidiaries forced the management to
issue a warning.
Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman of the Surrey-based computing services group,
said the problems would cut at least Pounds 1m from pre-tax profits this
year.
The share price, which started the day at a 12 month high of 318p, closed at
225p, a fall of 93p.
The group, which specialises in software for manufacturing industries, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.69m in the first half of the year on sales of
Pounds 21.5m; and Mr Overstall had thought both would hold up in the second
half despite market conditions which are affecting profitability at
virtually every computing services company.
Analysts are now looking for profits for the year of Pounds 2m- Pounds 3m,
depending on the extent to which the German losses are taken above the line.
The problem lies principally with Weigang MCS, a Stuttgart-based
manufacturing systems software supplier, for which Kewill paid Pounds
400,000 cash last May.
Kewill already owns the profitable HAN Dataport group in Austria and the
acquisition of Weigang was seen as a way of speeding penetration of the
European market.
Substantial rationalisation was required, however, and Weigang's staff
numbers were cut by 40 per cent, covered by a 'fair value adjustment' made
at the time of purchase.
Mr Overstall said that sales of the company's manufacturing software have
since slipped because of a combination of poor marketing and slower market
conditions in Germany.
He said the fair value adjustment would not cover Weigang's losses;
reorganisation at Kewill's German computer-aided design activities would
also take longer than planned.
Mr Overstall and Mr Richard Broad, financial director, are making weekly
visits to Germany. They intend to rebuild sales while cutting costs to match
market expectations.
Analysts said the German problems were disappointing but they retained
confidence in Kewill's management which had produced respectable profits
through the worst of the recession.
If the recession receded, minimum profits for 1992-93 could be Pounds 3.5m.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: CEI develops scheme to utilise US tax
losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMBRIDGE Electronic Industries, the medical products, control and
instrument company, has developed a scheme to allow it to use US tax losses
following its takeover last July of Tace, the environmental monitoring
group, and its sister company Goring Kerr.
CEI is also changing its name to Graseby, a name used in 50 per cent of its
sales prior to the acquisition.
Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said the company was no longer centred on
its roots in Cambridge where it demerged from Philips, the electronics
multinational, in 1981.
Mr Bob Brown, finance director, said the tax scheme should allow the company
to offset about Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.2m) of past US tax losses against
future profits made by the Andersen Group of environment monitoring
companies, which were part of Tace in the US.
He said the integration of Tace and Goring Kerr had been completed without
any significant surprises.
The source of most institutional investor criticism of the previous
management had gone with the removal of most of Tace's head office costs.
Mr Jock Mackenzie, Tace's former chairman, and Mr Dick Richardson, managing
director, had commanded combined salaries of Pounds 500,000 and the company
would be able to save Pounds 1.5m of the Pounds 1.7m head office overhead
this year.
Mr Brown said that CEI had been given considerable access to Tace's books
which meant there were few surprises other than a possible higher tax charge
relating to some acquisitions Tace made in the US.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dixons hit by rising losses in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIXONS GROUP, the electrical retailing company, yesterday confirmed it had
joined that unhappy throng of UK retailers which have invested heavily in
the US market without making a reasonable return.
Silo, its US chain acquired for Pounds 240m in 1987 and which operates 230
stores in 29 regional markets, yesterday revealed that losses had
accelerated over the past six months from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 10.9m.
In spite of the company's promise that 'determined action' would be taken to
ensure a return to profitability, it is hard to see that the position can be
quickly reversed. Dixons forecast that Silo would remain in loss in the
second half.
The severe retail recession has, of course, been the prime cause of Silo's
difficulties and although overall turnover rose from Pounds 245.3m to Pounds
288.3m sales on a same-store basis showed a 5 per cent decline.
Dixons has long promised drastic remedial action to turn Silo round but the
problem only appears to have become progressively worse.
Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman, argued yesterday that Dixons could apply the
lessons it had learned from revitalising its UK operations.
'We have battled against and overcome these problems how to manage costs and
margins when sales are flat. I have no doubt that the benefits of this
performance can be used to return to profitability in the US,' he said.
'We are basically running the same business on both sides of the Atlantic.
Silo and Currys have more in common than Currys and Dixons in the UK,' he
added.
But although the operations themselves may be similar the structure of the
markets in which they operate is clearly very different. In the UK the group
can derive great benefits from being the market leader controlling an 18 per
cent share of all electrical goods sales. In the US the position is starkly
different; Silo commands less than 2 per cent of a vast market.
Mr John Smith, retailing analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said there were
three basic problems with Silo: 'The whole US electrical market is very
weak; the company's cost base is too high, and the market is suffering from
massive overcapacity which is driving prices down.'
Although the US recovery may pick up speed in the foreseeable future and
Dixons can take action to prune the cost base, the problems resulting from
overcapacity will continue to plague many regional markets for years to
come.
In the past Mr Kalms has hinted that Silo might withdraw from the
worst-affected regions of the US market if they did not improve. Although
the company did not repeat the suggestion yesterday analysts believed it
must remain a distinct possibility.
Mr John Clare, the newly-appointed group managing director, and his retail
management group have been entrusted with the task of sorting Silo out. He
immediately hinted that support functions would be centralised and pay
structures reviewed.
And he bravely pinned his reputation on achieving such a turnround. 'I know
not many UK retailers have succeeded in the US but I would just ask you to
watch this space.'

for AmBrit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED ENERGY, the USM quoted oil and gas group, has made a recommended
offer for AmBrit International which values the oil and gas exploration
company at Pounds 7.3m and its loan stock at Pounds 1.1m.
The 9-for-32 offer values each AmBrit share at 11.1p while the 51 United
Energy for Pounds 16 nominal loan stock offer values each Pounds 1 of loan
stock at 126p.
United Energy's white knight offer comes a day before the closing date of a
hostile bid from Pittencrieff, the Scottish oil production and
communications group.
Pittencrieff now has until 5 pm today to announce whether it plans to extend
its offer period in order to make a higher bid to counter United Energy. Mr
Michael Monroe, Pittencrieff chairman, said that United Energy's offers were
'extremely generous.'
The United Energy offer includes a cash alternative of 9p per AmBrit share
and 102p per Pounds 1 nominal of AmBrit loan stock which values the whole of
the AmBrit share capital at Pounds 5.9m and the loan stock at Pounds
900,000.
AmBrit directors holding 6 per cent of the stock have agreed irrevocably to
accept the recommended offers and holders of 5.7 per cent of this stock have
agreed irrevocably to take new United Energy shares.
Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank, said the final offer compared with
Pittencrieff's final offer for each AmBrit share of 6p cash or the
equivalent of about 6.8p in new Pittencrieff ordinary shares.
Mr Alan Russett, AmBrit chairman, said the merger was 'far better for our
shareholders and employees than the hostile and inadequate offer from
Pittencrieff'.

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons seeks to acquire off-licence
chain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the drinks, food and retailing group, is negotiating to buy
the Augustus Barnett chain of almost 600 off-licences from Bass, the UK's
largest brewer, writes Philip Rawstorne.
Analysts estimate the deal to be worth about Pounds 40m.
The deal would greatly improve Allied's position in the Pounds 4.9bn
take-home drinks market, recovering much of the ground lost to Whitbread
after its Pounds 50m acquisition of GrandMet's Peter Dominic chain two
months ago.
That purchase reinforced Whitbread's market leadership, adding 667 Dominic
outlets to the 993 Thresher shops which it already owned.
Allied, which owns the near 1,000-strong Victoria Wine off-licence chain,
would again run a close second to Whitbread if it acquired Augustus Barnett.

Losses at Savills, the surveyor and estate agent, increased in the six

In 'generally hostile trading conditions', losses rose from Pounds 433,000
to Pounds 762,000 pre-tax on turnover cut to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 14.6m).
Breaking down the figures, the commercial side made operating losses of
Pounds 259,000 (profits Pounds 428,000) on turnover of Pounds 5.05m (Pounds

Pounds 849,000 to Pounds 575,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 8m).
However, costs had been cut by 17 per cent, or some Pounds 2.5m. Losses per

FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Move south lifts Sidney C Banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A move into the south of England helped Sidney C Banks, the grain and
agricultural merchant, boost both sales and profits for the six months to
October 31.
Mr Richard Banks, managing director, said the acquisition of Doltons, the
agricultural merchant, had provided most of the increase in turnover from
Pounds 98.5m to Pounds 114.7m. Before Doltons, Banks had largely operated in
the east of England.
A squeeze on margins - the result of the decline in farmers' incomes and
static market, said Mr Banks - held back the rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 1.14m).
The interim dividend is raised from 2.5p to 2.75p. Earnings per share rose
to 11p (10p).

Sales ahead 23 per cent and pre-tax profit increased by 46 per cent were
reported by Bespak for the half year to November 1. The group makes
specialised valves and other engineering components.
As earnings rose from 9.7p to 11.9p per share, the interim dividend is
stepped up from 3p to 3.5p on increased capital.
From sales of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 13.3m) operating profit grew 21 per cent
helped by revised arrangements with CMB Packaging for the exploitation of a
flow-control device, resulting in the release to revenue of Pounds 300,000
pre-paid royalties.
Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 2.04m), boosted by the virtual
elimination of interest charges following the rights issue last June.

A 20 per cent decrease in sales and exceptional charges of Pounds 214,000
hit Hadleigh Industries, the industrial group connected with transport.
It ran into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 283,000 in the half year to September

closure and redundancies.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 1.25p, a reduction of 0.95p.
Gearing rose from 44 per cent to 84 per cent mainly because of the purchase
of Truckline. It should fall in the current six months.
Sales were Pounds 14m (Pounds 17.5m) and operating profit came to Pounds
227,000 (Pounds 1.17m). Interest charges increased to Pounds 296,000 (Pounds

FT  09 JAN 92 / Wanted - good friends in the City: BAe has found it
difficult to win back favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Returning to work after a few days in the Caribbean, Mr Dick Evans, the
British Aerospace chief executive, should have been relaxed. Instead, with
other senior company executives, he has been exasperated by the reaction of
BAe shares to a renewed batch of bearish comments on his company's
prospects.
'We are on track with the strategy set out in our rights issue document last
year,' he said. Mr Dudley Eustace, BAe finance director, added: 'Our cash
position is satisfactory. Dick and I have held a host of meetings with
institutions to explain our position and plans. Nothing has changed during
the last few weeks. What more can we do to get the message through?'
BAe shares dropped sharply last week after Nomura, the Japanese securities
house, circulated a private note to clients painting a bleak picture of
BAe's prospects. The impact was all the greater because the note reported
negative comments about BAe by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of
Britain's defence procurement.
Worries were increased by doubts about BAe's negotiations over the second
phase of the Al Yamamah defence programme in Saudi Arabia worth about Pounds
2bn a year. The City had hoped for confirmation of the new contract by the
end of December. Although BAe announced other contracts involving corporate
jets, all eyes have been fixed on Al Yamamah.
'It's understandable. It's such a big event. Selling corporate jets does not
make a big difference. But confirmation of the second Al Yamamah contract
will remove a lot of doubts,' Mr Eustace explained, emphasising there was
never a December 31 deadline for the second phase of the deal.
The company remains confident of securing the new contract and senior BAe
executives are due to resume negotiations in Saudi Arabia this weekend. The
second phase of the Saudi deal is expected to include a mix of construction
and defence hardware including Tornado and Hawk aircraft and the
construction of the Al Sulayyil base.
BAe shares bounced back above the 300p level during the past two days to
close at 311p yesterday. Nomura circulated a second private note to clients
this week expressing regrets to BAe and Sir Peter for any embarrassment
caused by its first note and stating that Sir Peter had no interest in
depressing the BAe share price.
Reports that BAe was negotiating the sale of its 16 per cent stake in DAF,
the Dutch truckmaker, and expectations that one leading City broker will put
out a positive note on the company today have contributed to lifting
sentiment.
But the shares are still substantially below the 380p offer price in last
year's flopped rights issue which, coupled with the resignation of chairman
Prof Sir Roland Smith and an unexpectedly gloomy profits warning, sent
confidence in the company crashing.
Since then, BAe has sought to rebuild investor confidence by putting into
place the recovery strategy focusing the company on its core businesses
including defence; commercial aircraft; cars; and property and construction.
Mr George Simpson, chairman of BAe's Rover car group subsidiary, has been
appointed deputy chief executive to reinforce BAe's top management
structure. Mr Evans confirmed that a shortlist of candidates to take over
from Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman, had been drawn up and a
decision would be taken near the company's annual meeting in May.
The defence business has also been re-organised into a new company, while
commercial aircraft activities are being shaken up by splitting BAe's
activities in the European Airbus programme from its other civil aircraft
programmes.
However, BAe has found it harder than expected to win back favour in the
City. The fundamental circumstances facing the company have not changed
since last September's management crisis. The recession and government
defence cuts have put pressure on all BAe's main businesses. But the company
expects eventually to reap benefits from its rationalisation and
restructuring. 'We are now better positioned when the turnaround comes,' Mr
Eustace said.
Once the car market recovers, BAe expects Rover to swing quickly back into
profit.
Last year, BAe shocked the City by its failure to communicate the extent of
the difficulties and cash-flow problems facing the group. It is unlikely to
risk springing another bad surprise next month when it announces its
preliminary financial results for last year. These are expected to show a
group profit before tax and exceptional items of about Pounds 150m as
forecast in the rights document.
The exceptional items will include a Pounds 250m restructuring charge and a
further Pounds 45m charge to cover Rover's withdrawal from the US as well as
a Pounds 15m gain from the group's controversial sale of its shareholding in
the SD-Scicon computing services company.
BAe also stated in its rights issue it would maintain its final dividend.
Although there has been occasional market speculation that it may be tempted
to cut or omit the dividend, this is hardly likely. If it were, the
repercussions on the company's still shaky credibility would be enormous.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Dixons reports strong Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, the electrical retailing
company, yesterday reported a strong Christmas trading period in the UK with
sales increases in their 'mid-teens' but said it was too early to tell
whether this upturn in consumer spending would be sustained.
'I would like to think so but I do not think we can actually say so,' he
said. 'There is more consumer confidence out there than you might imagine.
Parts of the country are bouncing with enthusiasm such as Scotland and the
North East.' However, the uplift in sales fell outside the company's
first-half trading period and could not save it from reporting a sharp fall
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 17.5m.
A revitalised performance in the UK was more than offset by steepening
losses at its US Silo chain and a reduced contribution from property
development.
Nevertheless, analysts were cheered by the news of Christmas trading, and
Dixons shares rose 13p to 205p. The analysts suggested that Dixons had been
one of the first companies to feel the effects of the downturn in consumer
spending in 1987 and might be one of the first to emerge from recession.
Group sales in the 28 weeks to November 9 rose from Pounds 812.1m to Pounds
869.3m. Earnings per share fell sharply from 3.4p to 1.6p. The interim
dividend was held at 1.6p.
The UK contributed Pounds 537.5m - a 5 per cent improvement. Profits grew
markedly from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 20.5m reflecting better stock control
and management systems and the growing proportion of sales accounted for by
the Currys edge-of-town superstores which have superior cost ratios to the
Dixons high street stores.
As in the past two years, the UK profits figure included Pounds 5m released
from the surplus on its extended warranty fund. A similar sum is expected to
be released in the second half but will not be repeated next year.
Dixons' Silo business in the US suffered an escalation of losses, growing to
Pounds 10.9m from Pounds 2.3m, in the face of the severe recession.
Profits on property development were Pounds 3.1m, down from Pounds 9.8m and
interest receivable also fell from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 3.9m.
Dixons announced a management restructuring with Mr John Clare, currently
managing director of Dixons Stores Group, becoming group managing director,
and the creation of a retail team. Hosting a rare press conference, Mr
Kalms, 60, pre-empted the obvious question by saying: 'No, I am not
retiring.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / French insurance group increases stake in AMB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the powerful French state-owned
insurer, yesterday announced it had increased its stake in Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest insurer, to just over
25 cent, further complicating relations between the two.
AGF's move, which makes it the biggest shareholder in AMB, is regarded as
unfriendly by the German company and could unsettle its efforts to develop
an alliance with Fondiaria of Italy, and Royal Insurance of the UK.
In response, AMB yesterday bought Fondiaria's 25 per cent stake in
Volksfursorge, the Hamburg-based life and property insurer (in which the two
companies had shared a controlling interest), releasing funds which could
strengthen ties with the Italian insurer in other areas.
Fondiaria intends to use the DM600m (Pounds 209m) proceeds from the
transaction to help fund a new European joint venture into which Fondiaria,
AMB and Royal aim to pool their European subsidiaries.
Discussions on the formation of the joint venture are currently underway.
Analysts are speculating, however, that Fondiaria could also use some of the
money to increase its own stake in AMB. Fondiaria holds an option on an 18.8
per cent stake in AMB sold by Royal for Pounds 250m to Credit Suisse late
last year.
The French group, which has so far spent FFr3.2bn (Pounds 320m) on buying
AMB shares, said yesterday it did not plan to increase its stake, but that
it would negotiate with the German group's management to get full voting
rights for its shares.
AGF has 9 per cent of the voting rights and needs to register the rest of
its 25 per cent with the AMB board to acquire full voting rights and a board
seat.
But last year, AMB warned that it was not prepared to register the French
holding. Subsequently both Fondiaria and AMB have cold-shouldered AGF -
although Royal, which already operates a co-operation agreement with AGF in
the US - appears less hostile.
Mr Peter Matthiesen, AMB spokesman, said that AGF was merely seeking to
'obtain a foothold' in Germany for its own advantage, and the European joint
venture would be of mutual benefit to the other three parties.

<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest composite insurance company, is strengthening
its position in Scandinavia by acquiring Forenede-Gruppen, Norway's fourth
biggest life insurer, through a bid from its Danish subsidiary, Codan.
Codan's offer of NKr200 per share - valuing Forenede at NKr814m (Pounds 72m)
 -has been accepted by the board of Forenede, Sun Alliance said yesterday.
The Codan bid is a third higher than that offered by Gjensidige, a rival
Norwegian company. Sun Alliance owns 71.45 per cent of Codan, whose shares
are quoted on the Copenhagen stock exchange.
The deal is the most significant recent expansion by Sun Alliance in Europe,
reflecting its strategy of 'seeking to develop in Europe on a highly
selective basis', according to Mr Ralph Petty, managing director of the
group's overseas operations.
The acquisition is the most significant made by Sun Alliance since its
purchase of a 75 per cent stake in Swinton Insur-ance which was completed
last year.
Sun Alliance paid just over Pounds 100m for the Manchester-based broker in
three separate deals.
Forenede has not yet published accounts for 1991 but in 1990 its life
assurance premium income of NKr1.33bn - sold by a network of 500 agents and
a number of group schemes - amounted to a market share of about 10 per cent.
The company has a larger share of the market for group life and pensions
business, and its non-life premium income (NKr758m in 1990) - generated by
personal lines business sold in central Norway - is also attractive.
Sun Alliance's interest in the Scandinavian life market was signalled by an
unsuccessful bid for the Danish state-owned life insurer, Statsanstalten for
Livsforsikring, which was privatised in 1990 and the group is optimistic
about future growth prospects in the Scandinavian savings market, where
state pensions schemes have come under increasing strain in recent years.
Sun Alliance said the acquisition had been influenced by Codan's
particularly strong financial position - it counted with a solvency margin
of between 350 per and 400 per cent at the end of 1990, although the deal
could have a marginally adverse impact on the solvency position of the group
as a whole by the end of the year.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Little room for City excuses over Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire will ultimately be more
damaging to the City of London than any other scandal of modern times.
The damage should not be measured just in terms of losses suffered by his
creditors, although these are likely to be enormous - about Pounds 1.5bn for
the bank lenders alone.
Banks which lent him the money were foolhardy. Merchant banks which advised
him - and gave him public support - were negligent, on the most generous
interpretation of their behaviour. Yet again the accounting profession has
failed to protect the interests of independent shareholders in a public
company.
The UK regulatory system has shown itself wide open to abuse. Indeed, the
scandal may be as bad for the City's international standing as last year's
House of Lords decision to invalidate banks' swap transactions with local
authorities.
In the swaps case, foreign banks complained that UK law had been shown to be
inadequate in a fundamental sense for markets - financial deals, struck in
good faith, were not enforceable. Now their complaint is about the glaring
loopholes in the regulatory system.
The question they ask is germane. How could an individual, Mr Maxwell, have
been allowed such power over two substantial public companies that he was
able to plunder more than Pounds 1bn from the accounts of the public
companies and their pension funds?
In the case of the biggest public company, Maxwell Communication
Corporation, his power was unlimited. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm
acting as MCC's administrator under UK insolvency laws, has discovered that
the board of MCC had delegated all its authority to Mr Maxwell, who could do
what he liked to the company and its assets without deferring to anyone.
As for the pension funds, Mr Maxwell took full advantage of legal niceties
and his powers were almost as great.
Perhaps the banks were foolish not to have inquired more deeply into these
arrangements before lending him money. But MCC's non-executive directors and
the independent trustees of the pension funds were worse than foolish. They
were unable to fulfil their proper functions of representing the respective
interests of independent shareholders and pensioners. In those
circumstances, they should not have taken the Maxwell shilling.
Most damaging to the reputation of anyone who worked for Mr Maxwell, or lent
him money, is the fact that they had been warned of the risks. Price
Waterhouse, which has had its reputation blotted by its role as auditor to
the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, should gain some
credit for this.
In 1970, the accountants produced a report on Mr Maxwell's gross
overstatement of the profits and assets of a public company, Pergamon Press.
PW's analysis was the backbone of an inquiry by the then Board of Trade.
Bankers have been saying recently that too much has been made of Mr
Maxwell's misdemeanors in the late 1960s and the subsequent statement by the
Board of Trade that he was unfit to be the director of a public company.
Their only possible excuse for this is that they have never examined
publicly available records. Copies of PW's report are available from the
accountants' offices, but PW says no one had asked for one in 15 years until
the Financial Times did this week.
The most startling aspect of the PW report is that it could almost describe
Mr Maxwell's plundering of his public companies in recent months. Maxwell
family companies carried out vast numbers of secret transactions with
Pergamon. Then, as more recently, Mr Maxwell was adept at hiding the
beneficiaries and controllers of these companies.
The deals were dubious, to put it mildly. Pergamon sold stock and assets to
the private companies at inflated prices, in an attempt to boost profits.
But payment was not always made immediately by Pergamon. In addition,
contracts would sometimes be drawn up for Pergamon to re-acquire the stock
or assets, protecting the private companies from loss and creating future
liabilities for Pergamon.
PW identified that Pounds 1.7m - Pounds 14m at today's prices - was owed to
Pergamon by six of Mr Maxwell's private companies. It feared that most of
this would not be recoverable. Pergamon was forced to write off most of this
sum, just as MCC is expected to write off hundreds of millions in cash and
assets transferred to Maxwell private interests.
In other words, there was plenty of evidence that Mr Maxwell was not to be
trusted with other people's money, and should not have been given unfettered
control over public companies' assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds.
However, the failure of most City firms to remember the Pergamon episode is
not surprising. It is perhaps another version of short termism - their
obsession with making near-term returns on their investment and their
inability to take a long-term view of the conduct of their clients.
But the behaviour of three companies is bizarre. National Westminster Bank,
the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies today, was Pergamon's
clearing bank. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank whose subsidiaries and
affiliates provided vital support to Mr Maxwell in the 1980s, led the
campaign against him in 1969 on behalf of Leasco, the potential buyer of
Pergamon.
Finally, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte was appointed by Pergamon as its auditor
after Mr Maxwell was ousted from the company - and went on to be employed by
Mr Maxwell as his auditor at MCC.
These three have no excuses.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Letter: Industrial improvement is a matter for industry, not
policy makers, argue NEDC chairmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL JORDAN and Mr IAN GIBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article ('Engineering a solution', January 8), illustrates
vividly the dangers of superficiality in considering what must be done to
regenerate British industry.
You say that the recommendations contained in our joint paper, 'Engineering
at the Crossroads', presented to the NEDC yesterday are 'a feeble
restatement of conventional wisdom'. They are not only 'uncontroversial' but
also, horror of horrors, 'sensible'. You suggest that we should, by
contrast, be pointing out where current policy debates are too short-sighted
or closed: auditing policy (presumably you mean government policy); and
provoking the imagination of policy makers (presumably, again, within
government).
While government has an important role in providing the right macroeconomic
environment and infrastructure, industrial improvement is not ultimately a
matter for policy makers, no matter how imaginative or stimulated. It is an
unglamorous, undramatic business of day-to-day improvement within firms
which must compete to survive. It needs long-term continuity of purpose,
never-ceasing obsession with quality, continuous improvement, good
management, workers with appropriate skills for today and the future,
co-operation and team-work. That is why the NEDC engineering industry sector
group and engineering skills working party are defining the successful new
manufacturing techniques in engineering and will market them vigorously;
will identify product and technology gaps threatening the engineering supply
chain; and will define world class engineering skills and what the UK must
do to acquire them.
This will improve Britain's long-term industrial performance. They may even
help to make us as uncontroversial, sensible and successful as the Germans
and the Japanese.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Letter: Fisons states its position on small and large
commercial issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D R PETERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to read Mr R C Johnston's letter (January 6).
Considerable time has been spent by senior members of this company with him
and the board of the South Yorkshire Pension Fund on the subject of the
extraction of peat. His letter sought to criticise our investor relations by
confusing an environmental issue of small commercial significance with a
large commercial one.
The extraction of peat represents only a very small part of Fisons' business
and, while it is a high-profile public subject, it is not one which is of
sufficient financial impact to be a matter for extended investor relations
activity. We are seeking actively a solution which will be acceptable to all
responsible parties and, despite vociferous opposition to peat extraction by
a small minority of shareholders, Fisons' management continues to enjoy the
overwhelming support of most of its private and institutional shareholders
on this operational issue.
By contrast, the withdrawal from sale in the US of our products Opticrom and
Imferon is a matter which is of real interest and concern to all our
shareholders, and so we made a statement to the Stock Exchange on the
implications for the company's profitability of the problems associated with
the US regulatory authority's approval for these two products. We have
expended a considerable amount of time in keeping our shareholders fully
informed of developments on these important issues and, within the rules
laid down by the Stock Exchange, will continue to do so.
I trust your readers, who include a great many of our shareholders, will not
fall into the trap laid by Mr Johnston and will understand the very
different nature of these two issues, and the ways in which we have sought
to deal with them. Fisons recognises its responsibilities to all
shareholders to maintain an open dialogue on matters of commercial
management and business practice, and will continue to act in a responsible
manner in the best interests of all our shareholders.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Leading Article: HK governor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL be a difficult and probably thankless task to oversee the hand-over
of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Most former colonies have
emerged independent, but Hong Kong will uniquely be delivered, even if as a
Special Administrative Region protected by its own law, to well-established,
and decidedly threatening, communist masters. The governor succeeding Sir
David Wilson later this year must be carefully chosen.
Though Sir David's retirement - announced with his elevation to a peerage
last week - was not a surprise, the hiatus until a successor is announced
after Britain's general elections is unfortunate. These are uncertain,
nervous times for Hong Kong. It can do without a period of speculation in
which a series of unlikely names are bandied about.
The government should try to obtain cross-party agreement to appoint a new
governor before the elections. This could be difficult since some potential
candidates might hope for other offices in London if their party were to
win. But the future of Hong Kong is important enough to try.
No clues are being given as to whether the new governor will be a diplomat,
politician or from any other calling - with the one qualification that Hong
Kong Chinese people appear to have been ruled out. Though China, which views
the Hong Kong administration simply as an extension of the British
government, would doubtless object strongly to a local governor, that is not
a reason for rejecting the option outright. The idea has merit. But it has
to be recognised that any governor must also be able to deal with Beijing.
The governor will need to be not only an effective representative of
departing Britain, but also alert to the needs of Hong Kong people. He, or
she, must be prepared to stand up for them openly in negotiations with both
London and Beijing, which between them take the most important decisions.
Above all, the governor should not be seen as conditioned by Britain's
former imperial role. He, or she, should be a politically adept, sensitive,
robust and open chief executive, not a symbol of the Raj.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Leading Article: End set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HATS OFF to Clark. No, not the publicity-hogging Kenneth Clarke, but David
Clark, the Labour party's shadow agriculture minister. Unlike John Gummer,
self-proclaimed advocate of efficiency in a supposedly pro-market
government, Dr Clark knows interventionist nonsense when he sees it. And in
the set-aside scheme for taking land out of production he has, indeed, found
'one of the more insane aspects of the common agricultural policy'.
The objection to set-aside is not, as the Sunday Times has tried to show,
that it is vulnerable to fraud; fraud is certainly not needed to make it an
outrage. First, policy-makers pay farmers to produce surplus food; then, to
deal with the surpluses, they dump the excess on world markets, at vast cost
to EC taxpayers and less cossetted competitors; now, to limit the surpluses,
they pay farmers not to produce and the more land they agree not to produce
on, the more they will pay. The law of the conservation of absurdity applies
here: policy may change, but total absurdity remains constant.
Dr Clark's parliamentary probing has revealed that money is being paid out
in bushels. Six farmers in England and one in Scotland are being paid more
than Pounds 70,000 a year each to leave their land alone. A further 70
receive annual payments of more than Pounds 30,000. To those who have land,
it shall be given. But why should any business be paid to leave its least
productive plant idle. And why can it use the money to invest in the rest of
its plant, when the aim of the policy is to lower production?
The right way to reform the CAP is to lower prices to market clearing
levels; provide time-limited income compensation to farmers; and pay farmers
to look after the land. To the extent that the latter means more production,
as it will, internationally agreed limits will be needed. Current proposals
for CAP reform represent real progress in some areas, above all on prices.
But they must go further if they are to be accepted abroad and avoid being a
laughing stock at home.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Management: Rules posted for the junk mail merchants - Gary
Mead investigates a new code of practice which aims to bring the cowboys to
heel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has extended its reach into one
of the fastest growing areas of advertising, that of direct marketing, one
of the industry's most important, most heavily criticised and least
understood areas.
Advertising expenditure on direct mail - the cornerstone of direct marketing
 -grew by 29 per cent in 1990, reaching some Pounds 979m (out of a total of
about Pounds 1.86bn on all forms of direct marketing in the UK), a year when
other forms of advertising were static. According to Mintel, the research
organisation, the turnover of the UK's top 35 direct mail agencies grew by a
healthy 17 per cent in 1990.
But in the UK, direct mail has acquired a poor image thanks to a few
unscrupulous operators, particularly in holiday timeshares. Now the ASA has
the power to offer redress against direct mail scams. It formally launches
its new code of practice covering the industry, including list and database
management,* on January 28; the code came into force on January 1. The new
rules have a scale of sanctions against infringements, ranging from loss of
the volume discount offered by the Royal Mail to referral to the Office of
Fair Trading.
The new regulations, devised by the direct mail committee of the Advertising
Association, have the backing of the UK Direct Marketing Association (UKDMA)
 -umbrella organisation for the leading companies in the industry - and the
Royal Mail.
Alan Bigg, chairman of Brann Direct, one of the UK's six largest direct mail
agencies, believes that 'taking direct marketing under the wing of the ASA
will be excellent for both the industry and the consumer. All the consumer
research shows that people are happy to receive information from companies
when they either know the company or how the company obtained their details.
What annoys them is mail which spuriously claims an intimacy.'
Consumers who do not wish to receive direct mail are best advised to have
themselves listed on the Mailing Preference Service, which should ensure
they are removed from the commercially available database lists.
The average UK household annually receives some 40 pieces of direct mail
through its letterbox - against a US average of more than 500 items - but
less than 10 per cent of that is requested by the customer. Nevertheless,
once it has arrived, 61 per cent of it is opened and read.
Yet despite its pejorative connotations - junk mail - in 1991 more than 60
per cent of the UK population either bought goods through direct mail or
replied to a direct response advertisement.
That score rate, say direct marketeers, means that direct mail can claim to
be effective beyond other forms of advertising. They love to quote - in
their favour - Lord Leverhulme's remark that 'I know that half of my
advertising budget is wasted. The only trouble is I don't know which half'.
He should have used the mail.
But while the UK adopts greater self-regulation of the direct marketing
industry, the EC is moving in the opposite direction. According to Tony Coad
of NDL, the UK database company, and public affairs spokesman for the
Brussels-based European Direct Marketing Association, the current draft on
data protection might cripple the industry in the UK and other member
states.
Coad says that until mid-1990, the European Commission appeared to be
following a pragmatic line on harmonisation of legislation concerning direct
marketing. DG-13, the directorate responsible for communications, had been
preparing a draft law based on the relatively relaxed recommendation adopted
by the Council of Europe in October, 1985, concerning the protection of
personal data used for the purposes of direct marketing.
'Then DG-3, the directorate concerned with the single market, took over,'
says Coad. An all-German team in DG-3 drafted legislation closely resembling
that prevailing in Germany, restricting the compilation of any personal data
to that available from public sources such as electoral rolls. Were that to
become EC law, manufacturers, financial services companies, charities,
airlines and political parties could all find themselves hamstrung in their
contact with the public.
Coad sees the muddle partly as a result of cultural and historical
differences between EC member states. 'Understandably, German society, which
spends most on direct mail in Europe, is very concerned about data
protection. The Stasi used to advertise for male penfriends in the west,
simply to collect data. Yet Italy, the number two spender, seems to have no
public demand for a data protection act. Different cultures need different
forms of protection.'
'Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, wrote to me asking for
financial support. He would not be able to do that if the current EC data
protection draft becomes law, as he would not even be able to approach me to
ask if he could solicit my support,' says Coad. He adds that 'DG-13 now
seems to be back in the frame and unscrambling the mess', but that it now
looks unlikely that the draft will be ready for the European parliament's
approval before the end of 1992.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Accountancy Column: Turning over a new leaf to reveal vital
statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS still not too late for a final New Year resolution. As the festive
excesses fade, the first accountancy column of 1992 offers a chance for
certain influential readers to turn over a new leaf and respond to growing
pressure to expose one of their most vital statistics.
There is still time for action during the current year. The larger UK
accountancy firms collaborate each spring to reveal several useful and
comparable figures on their financial performance for the year to March 31,
which are published in early summer.
They show fee income, broken down by the increasingly diverse divisions
within each firm: audit, management consultancy, insolvency and so on. It is
also normally possible to gather figures for the number of partners and
salaried staff for the period.
But one crucial figure is always missing: the level of profit. Inside each
firm, few salaried staff have accurate information on the money taken home
by their partners. Outside the profession, an even smaller number can do no
more than guess.
A handful of the firms with more open attitudes do provide data for internal
consumption. Some headhunters - and staff recruiters within the different
firms - can make calculated guesses from the declared income of job seekers.
Most others, including accountants' clients and the general public, are left
in ignorance.
The absence of a profit figure makes it impossible to arrive at any
realistic estimate of financial performance for the firms, several of which
are big businesses by any standard. The highest earning firm, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte, declared fee income last year of Pounds 588m.
The potential ambiguity from fee income alone is arguably greater than ever
this year. Revenues may have continued to rise for most of the top 20 firms
during 1991 in spite of the recession. But without a profit figure, there is
no way of calculating elements like the cost of buildings and other
overheads, the contribution to income from firms that were acquired or
merged, and the amount generated by discounting on fees to win new business,
all significant factors.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, sees no justification
for disclosure. He asserts that partnerships are privately-owned bodies
which are not legally obliged to reveal profits, so there is no reason why
they should.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has no official
policy on the subject. 'It is a proprietary matter for firms themselves,'
says Mr Henry Gold, technical director.
'Some people no doubt find it a little ironic that at the same time as
accountants are championing full disclosure in their client companies, they
are not revealing their own profits,' he says. 'But the difference is easily
explained by the law.'
Yet there are moves for reform. Privately, a number of the senior partners
in accountancy firms state that they would be willing to release profit
information under certain conditions.
In the late 1970s, Arthur Andersen did produce worldwide accounts, including
figures on average partner earnings, which were even audited by a large
competitor. But the practice was discontinued within two years, partly, it
appears, because of embarrassment about the large sums earned by the
partners.
The issue remains potent for Andersen, which had more than 14 staff to each
partner in the UK last year (more than any of the other large firms) and
hence fewer people with whom to share the profits.
'Practices are very wary of letting staff know what their partners earn,'
says Mr Patrick Porter, manager of the public practice division at Robert
Half, a recruitment firm. 'Accountancy is quite well paid, but the
differential between partners' earnings and staff salaries is quite large.'
'Everybody would find it helpful if they were disclosed,' he adds. 'It would
let us know which practices are doing well and are appropriate to do
business with.' But he concedes that it might make partnerships more
vulnerable to negative publicity and even takeover fears.
The accountancy firms say that revealing profits would lead to
misinterpretation. Partnership 'profits' are deceptively large, because  -
unlike company directors' remuneration - they reflect the reward for owning
and holding unlimited liability in the business, and compensate for benefits
not offered by the firms such as pension contributions.
In consequence, most firms say they will only publish profits figures if
their competitors do the same, so that fairer comparisons can be made. Some
stretch that to include other forms of partnership, most notably surveyors
and law firms.
In fact, the American Lawyer magazine began publishing an annual table of US
law partnership revenues and profits in 1985. It is now widely accepted and
used within the profession.
Mr Steven Brill, editor and publisher, says: 'There was initial hostility,
but now firms strive to co-operate. Our biggest problem is too much
co-operation - some of the figures look fudged.'
He argues that the tables offer law firms, clients and job-hunters valuable
market information to show how to assess their rivals. He believes the
comparisons have been used extensively as a benchmark by some competing
firms which scrutinise each others' costs and profits.
'In any free market there is some good to be had from the free flow of
information,' he says. 'The firms are such large institutions, employing so
many people and consulted so widely that the value of this information is
quite high.'
In contrast, Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed International and
chairman of the technical committee of the 100 Group of finance directors of
leading companies, says he is not aware of strong calls for greater
disclosure by accountants in the UK.
'Profit per partner would not be sufficient information to judge the
performance of a firm,' he says. 'You would need to measure the ability of a
partner to come up with extra capital if required. That involves levels of
personal disclosure which we could not expect.'
Nevertheless, he does welcome the amendment to the Companies Act introduced
last year which will force publication of non-audit fees charged to a
company by its auditors. He believes reliance on an individual client is the
issue most likely to threaten the survival or independence of an accountancy
firm.
Others argue that the existing levels of fee income declared each year may
be suspect, since disclosure is voluntary and the figures are not audited.
There are fears that a single additional statistic on profits could be
equally unreliable.
'Personally I'm quite relaxed about it,' says Mr Nick Land, London managing
partner for Ernst &amp; Young. 'I don't feel defensive about my income - as long
as everyone else publishes their profits so we are not giving away
competitive advantage, and the figures are comparable.'
He acknowledges that pressure is likely to grow with the perception that the
large accountancy firms are changing from partnerships into large corporate
entities with responsibilities to reveal more information.
A final thought: If accountants were to disclose their profits this year, it
is likely that at least some would be embarrassed by partners' losses rather
than largesse. But at least they would have a low base from which to
increase profits over the coming decade.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Accountants urge institute change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS are pressuring their main professional body to change
fundamentally by halving itself.
A group of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales is calling for a separate body to represent members' interests,
alongside the institute's role of upholding professional standards.
A detailed paper has been circulated to district societies and members of
the institute's council, its ruling body. The council's annual conference
begins today in Birmingham. It argues that the institute cannot fulfil both
functions and urges it to establish a new organisation with salaried
directors to offer commercial services such as indemnity insurance, and to
lobby on behalf of the profession.
The charter of the institute, the paper says, restricts its activities to
advancing the profession rather than the interests of its members. These do
not coincide and raise questions of a conflict of interest.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Proposal on financial reinsurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL reinsurance, the policies taken out to protect financial
transactions, should be treated like conventional reinsurance in company
accounts only if there is a transfer of risk, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales has recommended in a discussion paper.
Financial reinsurance is unlike conventional reinsurance because sometimes
there is no transfer of risk, and the policy is often written so that it is
likely claims will be made within a predetermined range.
If the reinsurer assumes a proportion of exposure to the future losses of
the company taking out the policy, and the underwriting margin or deficit is
not fixed in advance, premiums should be charged against underwriting
revenue, the institute says.
Otherwise - where financial reinsurance is essentially a financing
arrangement - it should be accounted for as a cash deposit and any amounts
repayable treated as a liability.
The paper is a response to proposals that will soon be converted into a
financial reporting standard.

<TEXT>
Taking steps to lure shoppers: designers and operators of shopping centres
need to respond to the leisure interests of their customers if they want to
retain business, the conference was told.
Shoppers are bored with the 'functional' aspects of shopping and feel that
the pleasure element has been stripped out of it, said Mr Peter Newby of
Middlesex Polytechnic.
A survey of 24 shopping centres opened since 1988 found that all were
offering some form of entertainment, usually arranged by the manager of the
centre, to create a 'circus in the mall'. Nearly 90 per cent offered live
music and 72 per cent variety acts.
Mr Newby said Sunday trading provided special opportunities for centres to
create leisure activities and a 'carnival atmosphere'.
Centre managers needed to plan annual entertainment strategies and be given
training in how to provide entertainment, he said.
The developers in about a third of the centres had integrated leisure
facilities into the building plans to try and tempt customers to stay for
longer.
'Modern centres are predictable,' he said. 'They all contain the same
chains. People want variety and novelty. The major retailers were
complaining about trading volumes, but those in Camden market were not.'
Mr Newby said the design of modern centres emphasised functional
effectiveness, whereas leisure shopping lacked order and had 'texture'. This
needed to be reflected in new plans, which might recreate the medieval
street plan, with a variety of routes on offer.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Labour may punish electricity polluters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government might penalise electricity companies which fail to meet
conservation and efficiency targets in order to encourage energy saving and
help protect the environment.
Under one option companies that failed to meet such targets might be forced
to charge lower prices for their electricity or suffer restrictions on the
returns they are allowed to make.
In the shorter term, companies that did not achieve adequate results in the
specific area of home insulation might be threatened with sanctions
including the loss of their licences.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said: 'We will need to look in
great detail at how we best benefit the customers and save energy by
changing the operational and financial regime.'
Labour is studying attempts by US regulators in Wisconsin and elsewhere to
encourage energy conservation.
In 1987, state regulators offered the Wisconsin Electric Power Company an
additional return if it could cut demand by a stipulated amount over two
years. In a continuation of the programme a further return was offered in
ex-change for fresh reductions.
Wisconsin also offered consumers both rebates for purchasing energy
efficient appliances and incentives for turning in old, inefficient ones.
Labour is committed to prioritising a 'hugely in-creased' programme of
energy conservation and efficiency. It has pledged to establish new
commissions for the main utilities which will have greater powers than the
current regulatory bodies.
Scare stories about the threat of global warming could wreck moves to curb
more serious pollution risks, an academic warned yesterday.
Professor David Bowen, director of the Institute of Earth Studies at
University College of Wales, said it was unrealistic for politicians, the
public and the media to think global warming was happening now.
'Great harm had been done . . . it is regrettable that global warming was
ever identified as the key issue,' he said.
'Far more important is the pollution of the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and
countryside, about which scientists and policy makers must agree policies
urgently.'

FT  09 JAN 92 / Rise in sales of used cars on hire purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of used cars bought on hire purchase rose by more than 9 per cent
last month compared with December 1990.
Such sales are made almost wholly to private motorists, and are regarded as
a minor but useful indicator of consumer confidence.
The recovery came after a long decline in the autumn. Total credit purchases
of used cars reported last year to HPI, the credit information agency, were
1.4 per cent higher than in 1990 at 917,116.
Dr Brian Bailey, HPI chairman, said, however: 'It will nevertheless take
more than a single month of improved trading to convince used-car dealers of
an upturn in the market'. No consistent improvement in the markets for
either new or used cars could be expected 'until the economy shows a more
general recovery', he added.
Statistics on credit sales of new cars last year, to be published this
month, are expected to show a sharper drop than the total market for new
cars. That would indicate a decline in the private motorists' share.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Chemicals output set to lift 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS manufacturing will grow by 2 per cent this year but investment
will continue to decline sharply, falling 6 per cent compared with 15 per
cent last year, said Mr Richard Freeman, Imperial Chemical Industries' chief
economist, yesterday.
Any improvement in output will come after a stagnant 1991 and, with most of
the gain expected in the second half of this year, is in line with forecasts
for much of the rest of British manufacturing.
Demand for chemicals will rise a little faster than GDP, accompanied by a 3
1/2 per cent growth in imports, compared with one per cent last year. Export
growth will slow slightly from 3 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent, said Mr Freeman
at the annual business outlook conference of the UK Chemical Industries
Association.
The UK's performance will be in line with that of the chemicals industry in
the rest of Europe, in spite of a halving of demand for chemicals products
in Germany.
The star performer in the UK last year, for the second year running, was the
pharmaceuticals sector. 'Without pharmaceuticals, chemical production in
1991 would have fallen by 2 per cent,' said Mr Freeman, who chairs the
association's economic appraisal committee. Drugs output will grow by 4 per
cent this year, he forecast.
Fertiliser production will continue to fall, he said, but the forecast of a
1 per cent fall is still a sharp improvement on last year's decline of 9 per
cent.
Fertiliser production has fallen over a number of years. Sales depend on a
number of factors outside market forces such as environmental pressures and
the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.
UK production of inorganic chemicals will recover after last year's fall in
volume of more than 10 per cent. This was exaggerated by the gradual
abandonment of chlorofluorocarbons, the coolant used in refrigerators that
is blamed for damaging the ozone layer.
Production of CFC replacements had not yet taken up the shortfall and
inorganic output will recover by only 2 per cent this year.
Demand for organic chemicals was soft. Growth is expected to fall from 5 per
cent last year to 2 per cent this year as rising exports offset some of the
inroads made by imports.
The association warned that some of the government statistics used were
unreliable, and any revisions would probably be downward. It is seeking a
meeting with the Central Statistical Office to discuss the matter.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: Quayle still faces tough fight for
credibility - The past continues to dog Bush's deputy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAN QUAYLE, US vice-president, carefully set about business as usual
yesterday in the wake of President George Bush's collapse in Tokyo. He spent
a few hours in his White House office before leaving for a campaign trip to
New Hampshire, which will hold the first primary election of the year next
month.
Mr Quayle defines his role in Mr Bush's re-election team as the campaign's
pit bull terrier, assigned to confront head-on the conservative challengers
for the Republican party's nomination.
That he is allowed to campaign at all is a measure of the ground he has
regained since his disastrous showing in the days after Mr Bush picked him
to be his running mate in the 1988 election.
Successful campaigns in Indiana for election to the House of Representatives
and then the Senate had not accustomed him to hostile press questioning, and
Mr Quayle himself concedes that he lost control.
Mr Quayle thought the onslaught would die away after the election. It did
not.
The vice-president remained the butt of every satirist, building his own
legend with a new string of blunders and spawning a vast Quayle joke
industry.
Over the last year, however, the image of the vice-president as a pampered
featherbrain has undergone considerable revision. In what is widely
acknowledged as a difficult role with few defined functions, Mr Quayle has
managed to make a number of initiatives. His special field has been
deregulation, as chairman of the president's council on competitiveness.
Assessments of his success as a deregulator are mixed. Some right-wing
groups complain that the Bush administration has added new layers of red
tape. Other critics contend that his well-publicised initiatives to curb
America's litigation addiction by reforming the civil justice system or to
speed up the Food and Drug Administration's procedures for approving new
medicines have, for the most part, simply repackaged measures that were
already being implemented.
Perhaps the best testimony to his effectiveness, however, is the fierce
hostility that several congressional committees are now showing to his
competitiveness council.
At the same time, Mr Quayle is increasingly considered as a bona fide
spokesman for the right-wing of the Republican party within the
predominantly pragmatic Bush administration.
Mr Quayle's press clippings, too, have changed markedly for the better.
Mr David Broder, the Washington Post's senior political writer, and Mr
Robert Woodward, its well-known investigative reporter, are publishing this
week a seven-part reassessment of his career. They depict an ambitious
politician who, far from being plucked from obscurity, in fact conducted a
skilful, low-key campaign for the vice-presidency; and their judgments
appear for the most part to reflect favourably on Mr Quayle.
But the vice-president's problems lie less with Mr Broder and his ilk than
with Mr Jay Leno or Mr David Letterman, the late-night television comedians
whose jokes have done much to create the Quayle legend.
While Mr Quayle's stock has undoubtedly risen in Washington, it is less
clear that the rest of the country has forgotten the disastrous, if arguably
unfair, first impression he made in 1988.
A Gallup poll in November showed that three quarters of those questioned had
no greater confidence in Mr Quayle as a leader after seeing him in office
for three years. Only 37 per cent thought him qualified to be president,
against 53 per cent who found him unqualified.
Even among Republican voters, 32 per cent believed Mr Bush should choose
another running mate for the 1992 election.
Few votes are decided on the basis of the vice-presidential nominee, and a
few months ago, with President Bush coasting in the polls, the unfavourable
perception of Mr Quayle might not have mattered.
But with the president's collapse in Tokyo reawakening concerns about Mr
Bush's health, Mr Quayle has much to do to turn himself into an electoral
asset.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush in Japan: US auto makers await concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US president, who has made opening Japanese markets to foreign goods the
main purpose of his trip to Japan, yesterday secured some modest trade
concessions from the Japanese government.
But Mr George Bush failed to obtain the assurances he has sought on better
access to Japanese markets for the US auto industry.
The president, who is concerned about the US recession and Japan's large
bilateral trade surplus, regards resolving auto trade issues as crucial to
the success of his visit. While he and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese
prime minister, steered clear of trade details at their summit meeting
yesterday, their officials were locked in long negotiations.
The talks were planned to end by the evening. But officials were forced to
postpone scheduled briefings when it became apparent that the two sides were
still divided over the auto market. They hope to reach agreement today.
'It's pretty tough. But I think we could have smiles on our faces in the
end,' said one official close to the talks.
The Japanese have agreed to US demands in some areas, including the
relaxation of testing procedures for imported cars.
However, US officials are not satisfied with the pledges they have secured
for increases in purchases of foreign parts - including imports and local
procurement for overseas plants - and imports of US-made cars.
This week, leading Japanese car companies announced revised plans to
increase purchases of foreign-made parts. Under great pressure from the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) the manufacturers
increased targets announced only two months ago.
Toyota, the biggest maker, pledged to buy Dollars 5.2bn (Pounds 2.85bn)
worth of foreign components in 1994, compared with an original target of
Dollars 4.6bn and an actual figure of Dollars 2.6bn in 1990. Nissan Motor,
the second largest company, promised purchases of Dollars 3.7bn, compared
with a previous goal of Dollars 3.3bn and a 1990 total of Dollars 1.3bn.
Toyota, Nissan, Honda Motor, Mazda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, the five
biggest manufacturers, together agreed to buy parts worth Dollars 17.8bn,
compared with a previous goal of Dollars 16bn. The increased figure still
falls short of a total of about Dollars 20bn demanded by the US.
The gap is even greater in imports of finished cars.
US makers have complained that they cannot sell many cars in Japan because
the sales networks are controlled by the large Japanese manufacturers. So
Miti has pressed Japanese makers to open their networks to imports.
Yesterday, leading Japanese makers announced plans to import between 45,000
and 50,000 more US-made cars a year into Japan by 1994. The bulk, however,
will come from an increase in imports of US-made Honda cars - from 14,000 in
1991 to 27,000 - and a plan by Toyota to import 20,000 of its US-made
vehicles by 1994.
Help for US makers will be on a smaller scale - Toyota said it would
negotiate with General Motors about selling perhaps 5,000 cars a year.
Nissan plans to sell 3,000 Ford vehicles annually and Honda intends to
increase the number of Chrysler jeeps it handles from 437 to 1,200.
Mr Peter Pestillo, vice-president of Ford, said in Tokyo that the figures
were too small to solve the imbalance in the auto trade.
Mr Bush told Mr Miyazawa that while he wanted better access for US
manufacturers, Americans also had to consider why European cars sold well in
the Japanese market and US cars did not.
Meanwhile, the president got some satisfaction on a project close to his
heart - his request for a Japanese contribution to a Dollars 8.25bn
superconducting supercollider, a huge scientific research machine, under
construction in his home state of Texas. Mr Miyazawa agreed to the setting
up of a working group to study the project.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Islamic party leader claims Algerian army is deployed

   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADER of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalists, poised for election victory,
said yesterday the armed forces had been deployed in strength throughout the
country over the last 24 hours, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Mr Abdelkader Hachani, leader of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) announced
that he had 'received reports from all regions, saying that the army and
security forces have deployed in force since last night.'
There was no immediate official comment.
Diplomats said at the weekend that tanks and other units moved into
positions around the capital last Thursday, a week after the FIS took a
commanding lead in the first round of elections.
'We want to know what justification there is for this deployment. If it is
because of the second round, why have they deployed in regions where seats
were decided at the first poll?' Hachani asked.
FIS deputies took 188 seats in the first round, just 28 short of a
parliamentary majority, and are well placed for the second round on January
16, which will decide the remaining 199.
Mr Hachani said there was no sign the government was preparing for the
second round, which is only seven days away.
'There is no action which proves that the government is preparing for the
second round. The government has taken no measures to organise the
election,' he said.
'Up to today the number of candidates is not ready, the method of voting is
not clear, or how the elections will be controlled. Even the form of the
voting forms is unknown.
'We have asked the government for all this but received no reply,' he said.
Candidates have, however, been allocated time on radio and television to
broadcast their campaign messages.
Eight parties are in the run-off, dominated by the FIS and the former ruling
National Liberation Front (FLN).
Francis Ghiles adds: Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, the leader of the Front des Forces
Socialistes, the main lay opposition party, said that he found the
eventuality of a military takeover 'very difficult to believe'.
He said he thought the deployment was a cautionary move before a decision,
expected next Saturday, from the Constitutional Court on allegations of
fraud in 145 constituencies.
In spite of the troop movements and the extreme tone of some of the FIS
language - posters went up in Algiers declaring that the party would
'propagate Islamic faith at home and abroad by persuasion (Al Targhib) or by
terror (Al Tarbib) - the mood in the capital was remarkably calm.
Algiers radio and the dozen or so newspapers published every day are full of
arguments, insults and analyses - the sort of mix one would expect during a
hotly-contested campaign in many western countries.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Keating acts to shore up economy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S one percentage point cut in Australia's official interest rates
to 7.5 per cent is a result of government determination to shore up
confidence in the country's flagging economy. Short-term interest rates have
now fallen by 10.5 percentage points since peaking at 18 per cent in January
1990.
The reduction was expected following the appointment of Mr Paul Keating as
prime minister last month, after he defeated Mr Bob Hawke in a battle for
the leadership of the ruling Labor Party.
Mr Keating argued during his leadership campaign for a more relaxed monetary
policy to help the economy recover from the two years of contraction that
has pushed unemployment to a 10.5 per cent post-war record.
The size of the cut was limited by a deterioration in the balance of
payments in November, when the current account deficit jumped to ADollars
1.7bn (Pounds 700m) seasonally adjusted, from around ADollars 1.4bn in the
previous two months.
Short-term bond rates remained below the official rate last night,
indicating confidence that the government would announce a further cut of up
to one percentage point in the next few weeks.
Economists said the scope for further cuts was limited by the re-emergence
of a balance of payments constraint on growth, and the weakness of the
Australian dollar, trading at about 75.77 US cents in Sydney last night,
against over 80 cents in September.
Political pressure for a further relaxation of monetary policy is likely to
grow if unemployment figures due today show the economy is still shedding
jobs.
Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, said the interest rate cut was 'an
appropriate response to the weakness in the economy' which would 'assist in
reviving confidence'. But the government is pinning hopes on an economic
statement to be made by Mr Keating in late February or early March,
following consultations with business and trade union leaders.
Mr Dawkins said the government had some scope for a relaxation of fiscal
policy without imperiling the federal budget, expected to be about ADollars
8.5bn in deficit this year but expected to return to surplus when the
economy recovers.

Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the delegation spokeswoman - pictured above leaving

The Palestinians, together with the Jordanian half of their joint

In the second round in December, Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian
delegates spent all six days arguing in the corridors of the State

FT  09 JAN 92 / Politicians lose control of elements in army: Five EC
monitors died because of rifts within the federal forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shooting down of a European Community helicopter on Tuesday has
convinced western diplomats in Belgrade that the federal army must be
brought under political control as soon as possible.
But because Yugoslavia's federal structures have disintegrated, it remains
uncertain under whose control the army should be placed. Moreover, diplomats
believe it will be impossible to rein in the army, and have no confidence in
any permanent ceasefire until all factions are united under a single
command.
The federal army is under the nominal control of General Veljko Kadiejevic,
the defence minister. He accepted the latest ceasefire forged by the United
Nations, which envisages, among other things, the withdrawal of the federal
army from Croatia. He also agreed to the deployment of UN peace-keeping
troops in Croatia.
But the downing of the EC helicopter showed that the general cannot control
an army which is divided into several camps.
First, there is the Titoist/Yugoslav nationalist element, represented until
recently by Gen Kadiejevic. It is wedded to defending the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia, and by implication, defending the federation.
This faction was supported by Mr Ante Markovic, the former prime minister,
and by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, after June 25, when
Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. The military attack on Croatia
was aimed at preventing the republic from seceding from the federation.
Another faction consists of hardline Serb nationalists led by Gen Blagoje
Adzic, the chief of staff. His outlook is conditioned by history - his
family was killed by the Nazi-backed Croat Ustashas during the second world
war.
As a Serb nationalist determined to redress historical grievances, Gen Adzic
has forged close links with the Serb nationalists in the self-proclaimed
Serb republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, in eastern Slavonia, eastern
Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia-Hercegovina.
This tacit alliance not only opposes the acceptance by Gen Kadijevic and Mr
Milosevic of a UN peace-keeping force, but it has widened the differences
among the army's top officer corps and Serbia's leadership.
Yesterday, Mr Milan Babic, head of the Krajina Serbs, who was pushed into
power by Mr Milosevic, with the backing of the federal army, blamed Gen
Kadijevic for the helicopter tragedy. Mr Babic implied that the general's
acceptance of the UN ceasefire terms had provoked rogue elements in the
armed forces opposed to the ceasefire, particularly Serb nationalists in
Croatia who feel betrayed by an army which they say is no longer protecting
them.
Behind the scenes lurks Mr Branko Mamula, the former federal defence
minister, now head of the revamped Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and who
remains ideologically committed to Yugoslavia. Mr Mamula has extensive
contacts throughout the army and is visited regularly by Mr Milosevic.
But his colleagues say he is acutely aware that the federal army needs a
secure base, financial assurances and a new role for the future, even if
that role was confined to one republic.
Gen Marko Negovanovic, the former federal head of counter-intelligence, and
now defence minister of Serbia, continues to play a pivotal role.
Once opposed to the break-up of the federation, he is now trying to salvage
a smaller, Serb-dominated rump Yugoslavia in which the army could play a
prominent role.
Bringing all these elements together under one single command - and under
political control - is plagued with difficulties, western diplomats said.
'We also have to consider how the middle ranks of officers can be reined in.
'We cannot yet talk of any lasting peace,' a diplomat commented.

FINLAND'S centre-right coalition is to publish a document today setting out
the arguments for and against joining the European Community. However, Mr
Esko Aho, the country's prime minister, is urging his own Centre party not
to take an early public stance on whether Finland should apply. His appeal
reflects a split inside the party over the issue.
The government's document, which ministers hope will stimulate a national
public debate, is to be discussed in parliament on Monday, but the
government is not expected to make a decision until next month at the
earliest, and possibly not until the spring.
What that decision is will depend largely on the attitude of the Centre
party, which is the largest in Mr Aho's four-party coalition. Centre has won
support in urban areas but its traditional power base remains central and
northern Finland where it reflects the interests of farmers, many of whom
remain hostile to, or sceptical about, the EC.
Mr Aho had appeared in recent months to be moving towards support for an EC
application. The Conservatives - the second largest party in his coalition -
want an early government declaration in support of EC entry, as have the
main opposition Social Democrats. Finland's main employers' associations and
national trade union organisations are also backing EC membership.
Registered unemployment in Finland rose to 9.8 per cent in November, for a
total of 243,000 people. This is the highest jobless total ever recorded in
the country.

FT  09 JAN 92 / West grapples with legacy of collective farming years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELUCTANTLY, but with mounting urgency, the outside world is assuming the
task of keeping citizens of the former Soviet Union fed through the winter
and exploring longer term solutions to an agricultural and distribution
crisis of daunting complexity.
The European Community, the US and to a much lesser extent Japan, and even
Nato, are allocating ships and aircraft, opening their surplus food
warehouses and seeking ways of ensuring that aid once given ends up in the
hands of the needy rather than the mafia-like successors to the former
communist bosses.
It is already clear, however, that aid can never be more than a palliative
for a problem with roots deep in the most tragic period of Soviet history.
The emptiness of foodshops throughout the former Soviet Union may have got
worse with the political and economic disintegration of the former Soviet
Empire. But the problem stretches back at least to Stalin's forced
collectivisation of the early 1930s. He eliminated the vast majority of
peasant farmers who knew how to make a living, and condemned the rest to the
virtual re-imposition of serfdom under the guise of collective farming.
Since Stalin, successive Soviet governments have thrown billions of roubles
at the collective farms, and spent an increasing portion of oil revenues on
imported grain to build up cattle and dairy herds. But they never managed to
solve the systemic failures in the food distribution, processing and
marketing system which ensured that higher farm output translated mainly
into higher wastage.
The absence of a clearly defined owner of the agricultural produce at all
stages of the food cycle, the limitation of private farming to small plots,
centrally dictated production plans and prices, inadequate downstream
investment to keep pace with the rising urban population, the absence of
independent wholesale and retail networks all played their part in creating
the problem.
The demise of communism and the emergence of independent governments
committed to price liberalisation and free market reform policies, provides
an opportunity to sweep away the dead hand of the 'red barons' who
controlled the collective farms.
Already, in Russia alone, over 60,000 small farmers have managed to rent or
lease land and acquire basic seeds and equipment. Western companies, like
UK-based ICI which has been working with collective farms for a decade, have
recently been able to set up joint ventures.
Western agricultural experts are divided over whether the priority for
western assistance and investment should be given to raising farm
productivity and food output or reducing the enormous waste by building a
modern distribution chain from the farmgate to the consumer.
A recent survey on food pricing and distribution policy by the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, showed between 30 and 50 per cent of
many basic foodstuffs like potatoes and milk got lost or rot before reaching
the consumer. Between 1986 and 1990 for example 50 per cent of the average
annual potato crop of 72m tons was wasted. A breakdown showed that 11 per
cent was lost in harvesting, 10 per cent during seed storage, 17 per cent
while stored as food, 8 per cent during processing, 2 per cent during
transportation and only one per cent at retail trade level.
As part of its search for a valid alternative to pouring food aid down the
leaky sieve of the Soviet distribution system the UK government sent a
high-level mission of food industry experts to the Soviet Union last
October. The essence of the British approach has been to emphasise the
integrated nature of the food industry.
The government agreed to a mission recommendation to send Pounds 2m of
emergency feed grain to prevent the slaughter of expensively built up cattle
herds, but has yet to respond to the principal recommendation - the
provision of a Pounds 500m export credit line and government-backed
political risk insurance to encourage British exporters and potential
investors to play a role in constructing a modern farming and food
distribution system.
The UK Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) suspended such cover to the
then Soviet Union over a year ago.

FT  09 JAN 92 / EC observers seek part in helicopter inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community monitors want to be involved in the inquiry set up by the
Yugoslav military after federal army jets shot down an EC helicopter on
Tuesday afternoon, killing five people, diplomats said yesterday.
At the same time, the 170 EC monitors, most of them based in Zagreb, the
Croatian capital, have temporarily suspended their activities until they
obtain guarantees of security.
The suspension means that a trilateral meeting aimed at shoring up the
ceasefire in Croatia has been postponed. Today's negotiations in Pecs in
Hungary would have involved EC monitors, the Croatian government and the
federal army, the Hungarian foreign ministry said.
Mr Joao de Silva, the monitor's spokesman in Zagreb, said the mission was
waiting to hold talks with federal army representatives who failed to turn
up at a meeting scheduled for yesterday morning.
'At this meeting we want to know the exact circumstances of what happened. .
. . and obtain the necessary guarantees to let our monitors perform their
job,' he told Croatian radio. 'The activities of our monitors are
interrupted until we obtain these guarantees.'
Western diplomats in Belgrade are concerned that the federal army, led by
General Veljko Kadiejevic, the defence minister, will try to keep the
inquiry internal. They said the investigation must establish who issued the
instructions to shoot down the helicopter, and to fire the missiles.
The federal army has described the incident as 'tragic', and Colonel Zvonka
Jurjevic, head of the air force, and a Croat, was suspended.
However, an article in Polityka, the Belgrade newspaper, regarded as a
mouthpiece for the Serbian government, said the two helicopters involved in
the incident did not have clearance to fly the last leg of their journey
from the Hungarian border to Zagreb. The helicopter had been shot down
because it was operating in closed air-space.
Mr Dobrosav Veizovic, Serbia's deputy foreign minister, told the BBC that in
the past, two helicopters had been using this air corridor for 'the illegal
importation of arms to Croatia. . . . that is one of the reasons which might
be the cause (for the attack on the helicopter).'
But a senior western diplomat said: 'If the army thinks it can blame the EC
for this accident, or try to cover up in any way, it is mistaken. This
accident confirms why the army must be brought under political control as
quickly as possible.'
Italy yesterday said the attack on the helicopter pointed to a deliberate
attempt to scupper international efforts to end the fighting in Yugoslavia.
An EC peace conference on Yugoslavia is due to resume in Brussels today as
planned.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Russia backs down in row over UK beef aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW over whether Russia would accept 2,000 tonnes of UK beef aid ended
yesterday after British and European Community vets reached agreement with
the Russians that it poses no threat of 'mad cow' disease.
The deal, which makes shipments conditional on 'detailed documentation
covering production of the meat', followed a two-day visit to Moscow by Mr
Keith Meldrum, chief vet of the Ministry of Agriculture, for discussions
with his Russian counterparts. EC vets were also present.
A Russian statement said that the shipments would come from cattle less than
three years old - born after the outbreak of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) which hit Britain in 1988 - and slaughtered last year.
In Brussels, the European Commission voted unanimously to continue to
include UK beef in food aid allocations to the former Soviet republics.
Brussels has made clear it cannot eliminate UK beef from consignments
because this would risk a new consumer scare over BSE of the type which led
to the near-collapse of the EC beef market over the past two years.
It earmarked a further 1,500 tonnes of British beef for Russia, as part of
the third Ecu85m (Pounds 60m) tranche of the Ecu200m food grants. Senior
officials overrode departmental advice to avoid controversy by sending all
the UK beef to St Petersburg, deciding instead that 500 tonnes would go to
the Moscow authorities who originated the dispute.
The Russians are said by Brussels officials to have been concerned not about
the risk of humans consuming the beef, but of consignments going missing and
being reprocessed for animal feed, thereby transplanting BSE to Russia. This
is accepted in good faith in Brussels, but some senior officials remain
convinced that sharp beef traders sowed the doubt in Russian minds, in order
to position themselves for later sales, to be paid for by Ecu1.25bn in EC
food credits to the former Soviet republics.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister in charge of the Russian
economy, said yesterday that vets from the Russian Ministry of Agriculture
would visit Britain to see for themselves how meat was treated to remove the
danger of BSE contamination.
As one of the first consignments of European Community emergency aid to help
Russia through the winter, the rejection of an initial planeload of 118
tonnes of British beef provided an important test for the new Russian
government.
Mr Alexander Zhitnikov, deputy social affairs minister, said that the state
had so far prosecuted 50 people in 39 cases of theft of aid.

FT  09 JAN 92 / French Socialist high-flier keeps eyes on the top-most peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRONT ranks of the French political establishment are crowded with
glittering high-fliers, but the curriculum vitae of 45-year-old Laurent
Fabius, who will today be voted first secretary of the Socialist Party, is
considerably more brilliant than most.
Many of his rivals were groomed for their fast-track public careers at
Sciences Po' or the Ecole Nationale d'Administration; Mr Fabius not only
went to both these exclusive institutions, he also picked up an agregation
(diploma) in modern letters at the ultra-intellectual Ecole Normale
Superieure.
His brilliance carried him with preternatural speed up the ladder of
political promotion. At the age of 30 he was appointed chief private
secretary to Mr Francois Mitterrand, then head of the Socialist party. Five
years later, after Mr Mitterrand's presidential victory in the election of
1981, Mr Fabius was made budget minister. In 1984, he became the youngest
French prime minister in more than 100 years; when his government fell in
the Socialist defeat of 1986, he was still only 39.
There is now only one peak left for Laurent Fabius to conquer, and that is
the presidency. That is why he has been so determined to take control of the
party apparatus, because it should give him bargaining power to secure the
party nomination, and leverage over campaigning power thereafter.
With the warm support of President Mitterrand, who has long treated him as
his dearest dauphin, Mr Fabius formed his own party faction and in 1988
tried to capture the party leadership; but in their first open challenge to
the president's will, the party barons chose Pierre Mauroy instead. He made
another assault at the party congress two years later, but was again beaten
back, by an alliance between the factions of Mr Michel Rocard, the former
prime minister, and Mr Lionel Jospin, the education minister.
This week Mr Fabius has been third time lucky, but only because Mr Rocard
switched alliances. In the past the latter has regarded Mr Fabius as a key
rival in the presidential stakes. But right now he is even more nervous of a
challenge from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who
belongs to the Jospin faction.
The irony is that the price of Mr Fabius' long-delayed victory is a virtual
acknowledgment that it will be Mr Rocard, not he, who will be the party's
candidate in the next presidential elections. That was the quid pro quo for
the deal, but in any case he trails far behind both Mr Delors and Mr Rocard
in the opinion polls.
His lack-lustre reputation may have something to do with his image as a rich
bourgeois and a ruthless intellectual. His tenure as prime minister was
certainly tarnished by his handling of the Greenpeace scandal, when he
squirmed shamelessly to evade responsibility for the sinking by French
secret agents of the Rainbow Warrior boat.
His image may yet flourish again: he still has plenty of time, especially if
the relevant horizon is not the next presidential election, due in 1995, but
the one after that. But his immediate test is to rescue the party from its
current doldrums. All the indications point to a serious defeat for the
Socialists in next year's general election; if he can minimise that defeat,
his standing in the party will rise sharply.
Whether he has the political flair required must still be an open question.
No-one ever claimed that he was an instinctive Socialist with a burning
faith; it is hard to believe that this middle-class egg-head will ever
acquire the common touch. But if intelligence is enough to revive the French
Socialist party for the 21st century, Laurent Fabius may be the man.

FT  09 JAN 92 / Monitoring role of EC's 'ice-cream men' crucial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALLED the ice-cream men by their supporters, but lackeys of Germany by
their opponents, the white-uniformed EC observers have played a crucial role
in trying to monitor 15 ceasefires since arriving in Croatia last August.
The 170 unarmed monitors have worked indefatigably from their headquarters
in Hotel 'I' in Zagreb. Moreover, because this is the first time that the EC
has sent monitors to any country, they have had no previous experience or
standards to adopt.
Their task initially was to supervise the implementation of ceasefires
forged by the EC with the federal army, Croatia's national guard, and Serb
and Croat paramilitary units.
But, since September, the monitors have been involved in setting up
negotiations to secure the peaceful withdrawal of soldiers from federal army
garrisons in Croatia.
In addition, the monitors set up many local ceasefires to secure the safe
passage of relief and medical supplies, and some reprieve from the war for
civilians. Above all, the monitors have attempted to set up
confidence-building measures.
'It has not been easy. We have been manipulated by Croats, Serbs, and the
federal army. We have been shot at, our helicopters were fired on in the
autumn, but we feel we have made substantial progress. We must continue,'
said one Zagreb-based monitor.

<TEXT>
MR TENGIZ SIGUA, Georgia's acting prime minister, said yesterday that
medical certificates had been located diagnosing Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the
former president, who fled the country on Monday, as mentally ill.
He also claimed that Mr Gamsakhurdia had seized Rbs200m (Pounds 1m) of state
funds before his flight and embezzled more than Rbs1bn during his
presidency.
The president and 80 supporters were yesterday in a mountain retreat in
Getokhobit in Armenia. The compound was surrounded by Armenian elite Omon
troops, and Mr Gamsakhurdia's presidential Mercedes was said to be clearly
visible inside.
Mr Gamsakhurdia appeared on Armenian television in defiant mood, declaring
he was still president of Georgia.
A Georgian delegation sent to hold tripartite negotiations with Mr
Gamsakhurdia and an Armenian delegation had been refused access, Mr Sigua
said.
He said Georgia was prepared to allow Mr Gamsakhurdia to be granted
political asylum by Armenia provided he was barred from leaving the country.
He also said that Mr Gamsakhurdia's diagnosis as mentally ill might preclude
his being brought back to Georgia to face criminal charges.
The acting prime minister, who was in Mr Gamsakhurdia's government until
resigning in August last year, said he believed three diagnoses of Mr
Gamsakhurdia as mentally ill had been made in 1956, 1959 and 1978. While he
admitted that Mr Gamsakhurdia had been a dissident, and that dissidents in
the Soviet era had frequently been declared mentally ill, he said that five
of the six doctors involved were still alive and prepared to certify the
diagnoses were genuine.
The city of Tbilisi was returning to normality yesterday and the rest of
Georgia was reported to be quiet apart from disturbances in the Zugdidi
region of western Georgia, Mr Gamsakhurdia's homeland.
A crowd of around 1,000 supporters of the president again met outside
Tbilisi's central station, chanting slogans and carrying banners. Mr Jaba
Iosseliani, one of the leaders of the military council which is in control
of the republic, said the demonstration had been peaceful and there had been
no need to break it up.
In the city centre, damaged buildings around Rustaveli Avenue were being
made safe. A government commission has estimated that 10,000 sq m of the
city had been destroyed in the fighting, and reconstruction costs are likely
to be up to Rbs1bn. More than 700 people have been left homeless.

GUNMEN loyal to Georgia's new military council yesterday opened fire on
several thousand people staging a rally in support of ousted President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, agencies report from Tbilisi. Several people were believed to
have been wounded.
It was the second time gunmen had fired on peaceful pro-Gamsakhurdia
demonstrators. Last Friday, at least two people were killed and 25 wounded
when men opened fire with machine guns on a rally held in defiance of the
ban on public demonstrations.
The latest violence came as Georgian rebels seeking the extradition of Mr
Gamsakhurdia were reported to be holding talks on his fate with Armenia,
where he has taken refuge. A local journalist said the two sides began
negotiations in the Armenian border town of Idzhevan, where Mr Gamsakhurdia
fled with 120 of his supporters on Monday.
Mr Georgy Chanturia, leader of the opposition National Democratic Party,
accused Mr Gamsakhurdia's men of killing and torturing prisoners during the
two-week siege in the basement of the parliament building in central
Tbilisi.
A rebel spokesman was quoted as saying: 'Gamsakhurdia is a state criminal
and must be sent back to face charges.' However, the Georgian news agency
Yrinda quoted Georgia's acting defence minister, Mr Levan Sharashenidze, as
saying that the two sides had agreed that the fugitive former President
could remain in Armenia for the time being, but that his supporters had to
be disarmed and sent back.
The independent Interfax news agency reported that Mr Gamsakhurdia had asked
Armenia to allow him to fly to the West but gave no specific destination.
Journalists who witnessed the violence in Tbilisi said that after the
demonstrators had passed a hotel, a group of eight to ten armed men - some
wearing masks - appeared and formed a line across the street. They fired
into the air and then some fired at the crowd.
A freelance reporter working for Cable News Network said a group of armed
men cornered him and three other journalists, forcing them to surrender
their videotapes at gunpoint.
Local media put the death toll in two weeks of fighting in the republic at
up to 200 - the worst violence to hit the Soviet Union since the country
broke apart last month. A senior Soviet army officer said two soldiers had
been killed in an attack on their army car in the mountains near Tbilisi
overnight.
Mr Tengiz Sigua, acting prime minister of Georgia, said yesterday the
situation was very bad, and there was a severe shortage of money. Armed
bandits were roaming Tbilisi, and there were several shooting incidents
between bandits and National Guardsmen loyal to the opposition.
Mr Sigua, named by the rebels as a prospective prime minister in a
provisional government, called for unity. 'There should be no vendettas,' he
said in an address to the nation. 'We should unite in the process of
political reconstruction.'
The rebels' military council is due to hand over power to Mr Sigua's
provisional goverment.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Debt downgrade underlines
Chrysler finance struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVERE financial difficulties facing Chrysler, the smallest of the big
three US motor groups, was underscored yesterday when Standard and Poor's,
the credit rating agency, lowered the company's debt rating.
S&amp;P said the reasons included the weakness of the US car market and the fact
that Chrysler had not taken action to improve access to the capital markets
for its important and profitable finance arm, Chrysler Financial.
The leading credit rating agencies reduced Chrysler's debt from investment
grade to 'junk bond' status about a year ago, which made it far more
difficult for the company to raise debt capital on reasonable terms.
Yesterday's move by S&amp;P will reinforce that position.
The agency said it had cut the ratings of both Chrysler and Chrysler
Financial to single-B-plus from double-B-minus. Chrysler said it was
disappointed at the move, which was 'not warranted by the current financial
outlook'.
Chrysler, in common with Detroit rivals General Motors and Ford, is
suffering heavy losses because the US recession has cut demand for cars at a
time when the US industry faces intense competition from Japanese rivals.
S&amp;P said that Chrysler's cash reserves, saleable assets and access to bank
credit should give it adequate financial flexibility at least for 1992.
However, it added that 'negative cash flow this year due to persisting weak
auto markets would leave Chrysler ill-prepared to meet the challenges it
will face thereafter in the intensely competitive North American automobile
industry.'
Chrysler Financial, which plays a central role in supporting the sale of the
company's vehicles and has large non-auto interests, has been shut out of
the traditional credit markets because of the problems of its parent. For
much of the past year Chrysler has been considering ways of raising the
unit's ratings by distancing it from Chrysler.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: FDK to lay off 70 employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Paris stockbroker Francois Dufour Kervern (FDK) plans to lay off 70 of its
110 employees, board member Mr Jean-Loius Kervern said, Reuters reports.
Mr Kervern said his firm would shortly complete a planned merger with
Massonaud Fontenay, another broker which, like FDK, is ultimately owned by
the Dutch bank ABN-Amro.
The firm, which lost FFr5m (dollars 920,000) in 1990, is another casualty of
sluggish trading on the bourse and the growing need for expensive investment
in technology.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Honda and Toyota third and fourth in US car sales league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE car producers last year increased further their share of US car
sales, adding to mounting US-Japanese trade frictions. Their advance came as
US new car sales fell by 12 per cent to 8.2m, the fourth decline in five
years and the lowest level since 1982.
With the recession in the US car market deepening the big three US car
makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - all suffered heavy losses.
The chairmen of the big three are accompanying President George Bush on his
visit to Japan this week.
Japanese-badged cars captured 31 per cent of the US new car market last
year, compared with 28 per cent a year earlier. For the third successive
year the Honda Accord, which is produced both in the US and in Japan, was
the best selling car in America with sales of 399,297, ahead of the Ford
Taurus, with the Toyota Camry in third place.
For the first time Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, was overtaken by
two Japanese producers and was relegated to fifth place in the US new car
market.
Its share of US new car sales dropped to 8.5 per cent from 9.2 per cent a
year ago, while Honda increased its share to 9.8 per cent in 1991 from 9.1
per cent in 1990, and Toyota boosted its share to 9.0 per cent from 8.3 per
cent.
GM's share of the US new car market remained virtually unchanged at 35.4 per
cent, but Ford lost ground with its share dropping to 19.9 per cent from
20.8 per cent a year ago.
Ford's new car sales in the US fell by 15.8 per cent to 1,943,603 last year.
Price discounts to retail customers were at record levels in the face of
falling demand and excess capacity. Ford estimates that automotive capacity
in North America exceeded industry sales by more than 5m units last year.
GM's car sales in the US fell by 12.1 per cent to 3,308,983, while
Chrysler's car sales fell by 18.4 per cent to 702,518. Chrysler still sells
more vehicles in total in the US market than any Japanese producer, however,
when light trucks, such as pick-ups, four-wheel drive leisure utility
vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles (minivans) are included.
The total US market for cars and light trucks declined last year by 11.2 per
cent to 12.3m, the worst performance since 1983, from 13.9m in 1990. Only a
slow recovery is forecast by US car makers for 1992.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST Dollars 145m is needed to protect and help Kurds in Iraq over the
next six months, UN officials said yesterday, AP reports from Geneva.
'The humanitarian programme has got to go on; the guards have got to stay in
place,' said Mr Michael Stopford, spokesman for the UN relief programme in
Iraq.
Meanwhile, Iraq's health minister said that 85,942 Iraqis died in 1991 as a
result of the UN economic sanctions imposed following the invasion of
Kuwait.
Mr Omid Medhat Mubarak said 27,473 of those who died were children under
five who suffered respiratory infections, diarrhoea and other illnesses
because there were no medicines to treat them.
Mr Mubarak warned that the death rate would rise in 1992 if the trade
embargo continued, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
Imports of food and medicine are allowed under emergency measures adopted by
the UN Security Council after the Gulf War, but Iraq says it lacks the hard
currency to pay for them.
The US last week renewed its calls to Baghdad to accept Security Council
resolutions that permit a partial lifting of sanctions to allow the
government of Saddam Hussein to sell Dollars 1.6bn of oil to buy essential
humanitarian supplies.
Iraq has refused to accept the terms of the resolutions. Baghdad officials
say the amount is not enough and that proposed UN scrutiny of the sales and
food distribution would infringe its sovereignty.
Some of the Dollars 1.6bn also would pay for UN relief programmes in Iraq
and reparations to Kuwait.
In Geneva, Mr Stopford urged international donors to help Iraqi Kurds even
if they disapproved of Baghdad's policies.
'Never mind the political uncertainties, someone's got to pay for these
operations,' Mr Stopford said.
Mr Stopford said Iraqi authorities were still preventing UN efforts to aid
the Shia Moslem population in the southern Iraqi marshes near the Iranian
border.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wolfgang Berghofer, former mayor of Dresden, admitted in court yesterday
that he had falsified the results of the city's elections in May 1989 but
claimed he had been acting on direct orders from his superiors, one of whom
was to become the last communist prime minister of East Germany.
Mr Berghofer accused Mr Hans Modrow, the then Communist party leader of
Dresden district, of responsibility for the vote rigging, along with Mr
Werner Moke, the first secretary of the party in Dresden who is also on
trial.
Mr Modrow, who later became the last Communist premier of East Germany, is
now a member of parliament in Bonn for the Democratic Socialist Party (PDS)
and is to be called as a witness. The Dresden public prosecutor has launched
a separate investigation into allegations of election rigging by Mr Modrow.
The trial is seen by justice officials as a test case in assigning
responsibility for the widespread manipulation of results in East Germany's
local elections on May 7 1989.
The Communists officially reported that only 2.5 per cent of ballots cast
were against the party instead of an actual 12 per cent, while 98 per cent
of eligible voters were said to have voted instead of 90 per cent.
Mr Otto Schily, defending Mr Berghofer, argued in court that since East
German elections were by their very nature undemocratic, his client could
not be accused of 'falsifying what was false'.
Previous trials of officials accused of altering returns in other elections
have ended in light sentences.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Former MCC chief defends secrecy over company loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID SHAFFER, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication
Corporation who was last week named by a New York bankruptcy court to manage
MCC's US assets, last night defended MCC's decision not to disclose to
shareholders a series of loans between MCC and Mr Robert Maxwell's private
companies over the past three years.
Mr Shaffer said he was 'shocked' on August 2 when Mr Basil Brookes, MCC's
finance director, revealed the size of loans from MCC to Mr Maxwell's
private companies. These totalled around Pounds 350m, having not existed at
the end of MCC's financial year on March 31, 1991.
Mr Shaffer said he contacted Mr Maxwell last August and was assured that
most of the inter-company loans from MCC would be repaid by September.
'As long as I have worked here, for the past three years, there have always
been inter-company loans between MCC and private Maxwell companies. I don't
think they should have been disclosed. There was no legal obligation to do
so and they were not material,' he said.
The transfer of funds from MCC - which last month filed for protection from
creditors under US bankruptcy law - to private Maxwell companies is the
subject of an inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office. It is expected
investigators will ask Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, MCC's auditors, to
justify the decision not to disclose loans over the past three years between
MCC and private Maxwell interests.
In an interview with the Financial Times last night Mr Shaffer also said:
MCC, Macmillan Inc and affiliates owe around Dollars 189m (Pounds 105m) to
Berlitz, the language school subsidiary. Berlitz said last night it is not
paying dividends on Dollars 180m of its preferred stock held by MCC and
Macmillan because they are in default on the Dollars 189m of loans from
Berlitz.
Macmillan holds 10 per cent of the 56.5 per cent stake of Berlitz shares and
is seeking the return of the remaining Berlitz shares from five entities who
received them from the Maxwells as collateral on loans - Swiss Bank
Corporation, Swiss Volksbank, Shearson Lehman Brothers, Advest of New York
and Morgan Stanley, which is holding Berlitz stock in custody for a UK-based
affiliate of the Bishopsgate group of Maxwell fund managers.

FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Royal rallies on cash hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurance group Royal Insurance rallied towards the close on hints
that the proposed joint venture with its two European partners will bring
Royal a cash injection which could boost its solvency ratio by as much as 10
per cent.
Last year, Royal announced a European insurance joint venture with
Fondiaria, of Italy, and Aachener &amp; Munchener, of Germany. Stories
circulating yesterday indicated that Royal will inject assets into the joint
venture, called European Partners for Insurance Co-operation, or EPIC, in
return for cash.
Specialists said that to increase Royal's solvency ratio by some 10 per cent
would require more than Pounds 300m. The Royal assets being injected into
the joint venture, so the stories suggested, would involve its Dutch,
Italian and Spanish businesses. Royal ended the day 3 cheaper at 260p, after
256p.
Buyers for Glaxo
Positive comment in a US business newspaper and a raised earnings estimate
was said to be behind a rise against the trend for Glaxo yesterday. Buyers
turned round an early 10 fall and the shares closed 18 up at 863p with 3.4m
traded.
The company was highlighted in an article raising the possibility of its
rivalling Merck, the world's largest drugs company. Also, US investment bank
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette moved up its earnings estimate for Glaxo.
Donaldson analyst Mr Kent Blair increased his forecast for 1992 to Dollars
1.25 per American Depositary Receipt (ADR) from Dollars 1.15 and held his
buy rating. In early afternoon trading, in a lifeless New York market, Glaxo
ADRs were up Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 - a 52-week high - with 2.3m
traded. Each Glaxo ADR is equivalent to two shares.
Vodafone down
Vodafone, the UK's biggest cellular telecoms group, was a major casualty in
a telecoms sector that mostly escaped the general slide in share prices.
Triggering a sharp fall in the shares was a profits downgrade by UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and news that BZW, the investment bank, had removed the
stock from its buy list. At the close, Vodafone was 15 lower at 360p, having
touched 359p. Turnover was higher than usual at 2.3m shares.
UBS reduced its 1992 profits estimate from Pounds 270m to Pounds 264m and
its 1993 figure from Pounds 300m to Pounds 295m, with telecoms analyst Mr
Adam Quinton citing increased losses at Orbitel, Vodafone's joint venture
with Ericsson, the Swedish telecoms equipment manufacturing group.
BZW said it had shifted Vodafone to a 'hold' because it viewed the stock's
valuation as being 'up with events'. The investment bank spoke of
disappointing figures for new Vodafone customers during December and also
mentioned increasing concern about official regulation in the cellular radio
business. 'We are seeing the first signs of regulation in the industry,'
added BZW.
Unilever sold
Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever fell as dealers took the view
that the shares had over-reached themselves in achieving an all-time high
last week. The beginning of a turnround in one of the FT-SE 100's best
performing stocks was prompted by a number of small currency-related
forecast cuts.
A large chunk of Unilever's business lies in the US, and a weaker dollar
against sterling, as well as a weaker basket of Asian, African and Latin
American currencies against the pound, underlay the change in profits
estimates.
Although most observers remain positive on the stock, there is some concern
that there has been no pick-up in Unilever's third-quarter trading in the US
and UK.
Finally, because of the high premium of the UK-listed shares there was some
switching into Dutch-listed Unilever NV. Unilever fell 16 to 883p with 1.7m
traded.
Worries resurfaced that a holiday price war may develop after Thomson, one
of the industry leaders, trimmed some prices in its summer brochure. The
move by Thomson, with a 35 per cent share of the market, follows similar
tactics by its closest rivals, Owners Abroad and Airtours, before Christmas.
Yesterday, Airtours dropped 48 to 827p and Owners slipped 3 1/2 to 103p.
Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas said: 'There is no price war yet. But it is a
situation that is likely to get worse as Owners and Airtours battle for
second place and Thomson refuses to stand idly by.' Ms Lisa Gordon at County
NatWest was less bearish, saying that talk of a price war was overdone. 'It
has been more of a story in the press than it has been in the markets. I do
not think it will be long-lived.'
Bank shares took another pounding after James Capel, the leading agency
broker, confirmed it had downgraded the sector. NatWest shares were the
worst affected, sliding to 259p at one point before stabilising and closing
a net 7 off at 263p; turnover reached 4.1m shares. Lloyds and Midland dipped
4 each to 390p and 209p, while Barclays eased 3 to 361p.
Commercial Union tumbled 15 to 485p in a generally weak composite insurance
sector.
Hillsdown, the food manufacturing group, fell sharply, closing 10 off at
152p, after 149p, with Cazenove, the London broker, reported as having
downgraded the stock.
Boots, first of the big retailing groups to reveal details of Christmas
sales, eased 3 1/2 to 421p. Dixons, reporting today, lost 7 to 192p.
Suggestions that UBS had cut its profits estimates upset Marks and Spencer,
which settled 7 off at 274p, after 272p, and Argos, down 4 at 252p. Hints of
a profits downgrade by County NatWest saw Body Shop retreat sharply to close
15 down at 337p, after 333p. The placing of a block of over 1m shares saw WH
Smith dip 17 to 422p.
News that the new Saudi Arabian budget contained an increased defence
allocation helped lift British Aerospace 12 to 300p. BAe suffered weekend
speculation that negotiations for a Pounds 2.5bn defence contract with the
Saudis were not going well.
An Pounds 8.1m rights issue at Whessoe, the project management, engineering
services and instrumentation group, was not well received, the shares
slipping 8 to 226p.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings, which has had a dull time since the failure
of its Racal bid, gained 15 to 311p as the market bought on consideration
that the stock had become undervalued.
The substantial weakness of the leading oil issues on Monday, primarily
caused by James Capel's severe profits downgrades, continued yesterday, with
Enterprise another 16 off at 418p after more cuts in earnings forecasts. The
latest reduction was said to have been made by SG Warburg Securities.
BP slipped a further 3 to 246p on heavy turnover of 6.9m shares, while Shell
lost 6 more to 482p. The fall in the latter, which occurred in exceptionally
heavy turnover of 5.7m, came after Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said
the stock was 'poised on the edge of a cliff; there is substantial
downside'.
ICI weakened as marketmakers used a profits forecast from Hoare Govett as an
excuse to sell. Hoare is a buyer despite cutting its 1991 profits estimate
to Pounds 840m from Pounds 875m and its 1992 forecast to Pounds 1.06bn from
Pounds 1.125bn. However, the stock has risen sharply since Christmas and
some traders saw their opportunity to take profits. The shares fell 13 to
1181p.
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome continued to lose ground it had gained on
press reports that UK tests had shown the performance of Wellcome's
anti-Aids drug Retrovir was boosted when used with its anti-herpes drug
Zovirax.
The stock weakened 44 to 1018p, with analysts saying it was still
over-valued at current levels.
Despite the weakness in Wall Street and the profit-taking in the
pharmaceuticals sector, SmithKline Beecham maintained a rise of 5 to 905p.
Group chairman Mr Jan Leschly announced that the firm would be introducing
10 products over the next five years that should generate strong sales
growth.
ECC Group, the building materials concern, moved up strongly to close 7
firmer at 490p, responding to a buy note issued by Robert Fleming
Securities.

FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Downgrades slice into share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a case of 'more of the same' on the UK stock market yesterday, as the
latest round of corporate downgrades from London securities analysts cut
into the share gains achieved over Christmas.
First reports on retail trading over the festive season, together with price
competition in the UK travel industry, dealt a fresh blow to hopes that
consumer spending will lead the way out of the recession in the domestic
economy.
The market fell by nearly 28 Footsie points in early trading and a later
rally owed much to a firm opening on Wall Street. The early gain on the Dow
Industrial Average had been pared to only 4 points, however, by the time
London closed for the day.
The final reading of 2,482.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a decline of 10.3.
Trading was again two-way, with the institutions cautiously reshaping
portfolios in the light of the sharp rise in equities over the holiday.
However, with the banks and the oil shares suffering heavily from profits
downgrades by a leading UK agency broker and last month's optimism towards
retail stocks fast melting away, the equity sector lacked supporters in the
final hour of trading.
Pressure on the store and retail sector was renewed after Boots, the joint
owner with WH Smith of the Do It All group, disclosed that sales had been
below target in the quarter which closed on December 31.
Gloom deepened in the sector, which faces further tests today when Dixons,
another leading high street name, reports on trading, and it is also braced
for disturbing news this week from Ratners, the jewellery retailer.
However, the broader setback across the range of the market was fuelled by
this week's bearishness towards the banking sector. Concern over bad debts
was increased by the deepening of gloom over the retail sector and by
disclosure by a leading accounting firm that bankruptcies among UK companies
rose by 56 per cent last year. A further dip in the pound, taking it to its
lowest permitted level against the D-Mark, reinforced worries that UK base
rates may have to be raised to protect sterling inside its ERM range.
Leading oil shares also continued to feel the pressure of downgradings by UK
broking analysts, who have pointed to the bearish outlook for crude prices.
Although losses in BP and Shell were relatively modest, both shares failed
to respond to the initial upturn in the New York market.
London based analysts of the equity market continued to express a somewhat
cautious view of the outlook, in spite of the confidence displayed by share
prices over the past three weeks. At Flemings Research, the strategy team
warned of a 'hazardous route' to recovery in the second half of this year.
Flemings believes that the UK market has not yet discounted the risk of a
rise in base rates 'implicit in the government's refusal to devalue'. Nor
does it think that the market has fully discounted the possibility of a
change in government when the UK general election is held later this year.
The economics team at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant bank,
warned that the UK government may have little choice but to raise base rates
ahead of the election and that many analysts are too sanguine about this
risk.

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips consolidate gains
but indicator sets new high
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH secondary stocks powered to new highs yesterday, there was little
movement in the broader market, where share prices were mixed as investors
consolidated some of the big gains earned during the recent rally, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.70 at 3,204.83, a new
record for the blue chip indicator. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down
0.56 at 417.40, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks reached
yet another all-time peak, ending 4.39 higher at 602.29. Turnover on the New
York SE remained heavy, totalling 253m shares.
The Dow has risen almost 300 points in the past two weeks, and therefore it
came as no surprise when the rally ran out of steam in the first two days of
this week.
As for whether the impressive winning streak had been broken completely or
just interrupted, the balance of opinion among analysts was that further, if
less spectacular, gains would be made over the coming weeks. Meanwhile,
demand for secondary, growth-oriented issues showed no signs of abating.
Compaq rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 34 in active trading after the computer
group said worldwide orders for its portable 486C personal computer had
exceeded expectations. This rare piece of good news from the computer
industry lifted others in the sector, with IBM climbing Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 94 5/8 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 60 1/4 .
Sbarro jumped Dollars 5 3/8 or 14 per cent to Dollars 44 1/2 on the American
Stock Exchange after Morgan Stanley, the broking house, upgraded its rating
on the shares and put the Italian restaurant chain on its list of
recommended growth stocks.
Sears slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 after the giant stores group
announced that it was cutting 7,000 jobs from its workforce, although the
company said the plan would not involve any lay-offs.
Gap, one of the few successful retailers during the recession, fell Dollars
2 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 after Goldman Sachs was reported to have crossed a
block of 1.9m shares at a price of Dollars 56 3/4 .
On the over-the-counter market, Bioplasty declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 4
3/4 in a delayed reaction to Monday's decision by the Food and Drug
Administration to urge doctors to stop using silicone breast implants until
new information on their safety was assessed. Bioplasty is one of the main
producers of the implants, as is Mentor which, after falling sharply on
Monday, recovered Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4 .
DNA Plant Technology soared Dollars 4 to Dollars 8 1/2 on news of a venture
with Du Pont which is supplying a new form of Canola oil to the snack food
business of Anheuser-Busch.
Canada
TORONTO declined in moderate trading, with gold stocks leading the way. The
composite index ended 11.8 off at 3,512.9 and falls held an edge over rises
by 316 to 297. Volume came to 27.4m shares, up from Monday's 22m.
Ten of 14 stock groups closed lower, with the gold group down 1.6 per cent.
Placer Dome, the most heavily weighted stock in the group, dipped CDollars
1/2 to CDollars 11 1/2 . The pipelines group had the day's biggest increase,
1.6 per cent.
Silcorp 'A' jumped 50 cents to CDollars 2.50. The company said it has agreed
to sell its Quebec convenience store assets to Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc
for an undisclosed sum.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar remains under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR remained under pressure on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, stabilising against the D-Mark but falling back against the
Japanese yen before finding late support in London.
The focus on the yen/dollar exchange rate came as US President George Bush
and Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, arrived in Tokyo for talks
with Japanese ministers.
Dealers commented that the two sides may agree a controlled devaluation of
the dollar against the yen as a means of moderating the US trade deficit
with Japan. Some analysts expect the authorities to target a rate of around
Y120.
Against this background, the dollar slipped in Far Eastern trading, ending
in Tokyo at Y123 from a Y124.05 close in London on Monday. During the Tokyo
day the US currency fell below Y123 for the first time in three years.
In European trading the weak tone continued, with the dollar declining to
Y122.75. But a late bout of profit-taking pushed the Japanese currency down
and the dollar finished at Y124.35 in London, before dipping to Y123.90 in
New York.
The yen/D-Mark exchange rate also attracted significant trading volume, with
the German unit firming from Y81.68 to Y81.83 during the day.
The US currency was less volatile against the D-Mark, following a
substantial fall on Monday. In Tokyo the dollar closed at DM1.5160, from a
DM1.5190 close in London on Monday. In Europe the dollar tested technical
support at DM1.5120 before rallying to end at DM1.5195 in London. In New
York it fell to DM1.5065.
However, analysts are expecting the dollar to weaken further against the
D-Mark and other European currencies later this week if economic statistics
show the US economy to be weakening.
If weak non-farm employment figures are released on Friday and poor producer
price inflation figures tomorrow, this could prompt a further easing of US
monetary conditions and a flight of international funds out of US financial
assets.
Elsewhere, sterling slipped further against the D-Mark but remained above
its 'floor' within the European exchange rate mechanism.
From a close of DM2.85 on Monday, sterling eased overnight in Tokyo to open
at around DM2.8475 in London and then further softened to end at DM2.8450.
Analysts noted that sterling fell in line with its permitted lower limit
against the D-Mark within the ERM. The floor moved from around DM2.8470 on
Monday to DM2.8405 yesterday due to a weakening of the Spanish peseta, the
strongest currency in the ERM.
As the permitted floor moved lower, currency traders could push the pound
down without the risk of being caught by concerted central bank
intervention.
Sterling also suffered from press reports that Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
former prime minister, is in favour of a devaluation of the UK currency
within the ERM.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market interest rates were steady in London yesterday, although
liquidity remained in short supply and sterling drifted lower against the
D-Mark on the foreign exchange markets.
The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.25bn early in
the day, later revised down to Pounds 1.1bn. In an early round of
assistance, the bank purchased band 1 and band 4 bills totalling Pounds
229m. In addition it purchased Pounds 84m paper for resale to the market on
January 20 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Later in the morning session, the bank injected a further Pounds 118m,
buying band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band 3 bills at 10 7/32 per cent and
band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent.
In the afternoon, a further Pounds 303m band 1 and band 3 bills were
purchased at the same rates. Late assistance totalled Pounds 205m, leaving
total assistance for the day around Pounds 160m below the forecast liquidity
shortage.
Unsecured overnight money was traded down to 10 9/16 - 7/16 per cent, below
the 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent level on Monday. The key three months inter-bank
rate traded at 10 13/16 - per cent.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.37, against 89.32 on Monday,
implying base rates of around 10.63 per cent by the spring.
In Frankfurt, call money rates were steady at around 9.5 per cent, a level
which has held since the Bundesbank raised interest rates by  1/2 point on
December 19.
Today a Bundesbank customer repurchase pact expires, draining DM33.2bn from
the market at interest rates of between 9.20 and 9.25 per cent. However,
analysts expected this shortage to be covered by a new repurchase agreement.
In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan again demonstrated its determination to prevent
money market interest rates from falling too far following its 1/2 point cut
in key interest rates last week. The bank recalled Y200bn loans to the
banking system when over-night money rates dipped to 5 3/32 per cent from
Monday's 5 9/32 per cent.
The action forced rates back up to 5 11/32 per cent by the close, suggesting
that the authorities will keep money market interest rates above 5 per cent
for the foreseeable future. Today, analysts are expecting a liquidity
shortage of around Y340bn, which the authorities may off-set in full if
interest rates appear to be firm.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Government Bonds: Strong tap
issue demand lifts long-dated gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-DATED UK government bonds gained more than half a point, helped by
strong demand for the latest 15-year tap issue.
The Bank of England has sold a total of between Pounds 700m and Pounds 750m
of its Pounds 1bn tap issue, the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007, according to
traders. About half of the tap issue was sold yesterday.
Traders said demand for long-dated issues was strong. The benchmark 11 3/4
per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose to 115 23/32 yielding 9.42 per cent, after
opening at 115 1/16 . Short-dated gilts remained firm in spite of sterling's
decline against the D-Mark yesterday.
US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday as demand in the
underlying cash market picked up in the wake of a rally in the futures
market.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 107
7/32 , yielding 7.391 per cent.
The two-year note was also higher, up  3/16 at 100 5/8 , yielding 4.648 per
cent.
There was particularly heavy buying from retail investors, said dealers, and
securities at both the short and long end of the market were well bid,
supported by hopes that the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy one
more time.
If the Fed does cut interest rates again, it could well come after Friday's
jobs figure. The market is expecting non-farm payrolls last month to have
fallen by between 50,000 and 100,000. If payrolls prove to have declined by
substantially more than that, an easing of policy could be triggered, say
some analysts.
THE strong yen and lower interest rates helped Japanese government bond
prices to reach new highs in moderate trading yesterday.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.31 per cent and closed at 5.28
per cent in Tokyo. Prices gained further in the London trading session, with
the benchmark yielding 5.275 per cent.
Short-term money market rates fell again on yesterday, with the three-month
certificates of deposit rate slipping to 5.27 per cent from 5.4 per cent on
Monday. The Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate from 5 to 4.5
per cent at late last month, and money market rates have slipped on
subsequent trading days.
GERMAN government bonds closed little changed on the day as investors took
profits, wiping out early gains.
The Liffe bund futures contract reached a high of 88.02, breaking through
the 88.01 technical resistance level, but then fell back to close at 87.85.
Traders said a combination of industrial production figures and worries
about inflation prompted some profit-taking.
The November industrial production figures for western Germany released
yesterday were stronger than expected. Industrial output rose a seasonally
and price-adjusted 1.2 per cent in November from October and was up 2.4 per
cent on a year ago. Traders said the figures prompted some nervousness that
the German economy might not be slowing down as much as previously expected.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch bond market witnessed another strong session
helped by strong demand from foreigners. The 8 3/4 per cent Dutch bond due
January 2007 closed at 103.15, compared with Monday's close of 102.68.
Prices closed below the highs of the day, however, as some investors started
switching out of the Dutch market ahead of Friday's Consumer Price Index
announcement and on rumours that the Dutch agency may announce a further
issue.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: ASE may trade options on
index of biotech stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE American Stock Exchange (ASE) has unveiled plans to trade options on its
recently developed index of biotechnology stocks, writes Patrick Harverson.
The ASE has developed a niche offering investors opportunities to trade a
range of index-based derivative products, and yesterday it asked the SEC for
permission to trade options on its Biotechnology Index.
The index, made up of 15 established biotech companies, including Amgen,
Immunex and Centocor, was created last year to allow investors to trade a
basket of stocks in what was the best performing sector in the US equity
markets of the past year.
Biotech stocks have proved popular among speculative investors because the
companies operate in a rapidly developing industry where technological
advances can lead to dramatic increases in share prices, market value and
earnings.

<TEXT>
BARING Securities, the UK securities firm, has paid an undisclosed sum for
the Paris stock exchange seat of DG Bourse, a subsidiary of the German bank,
DG Bank.
The British firm has taken over DG Bourse's shares in the Societe des
Bourses Francaises, the market executive. From January 1, having such shares
has been the main requirement for being allowed to trade on the French stock
market.
Previously, new entrants had to buy an existing seat and the stockbroking
firm that went with it. Baring Securities is the first firm to take
advantage of the latest stage in French stock exchange reform. It has not
bought the firm DG Bourse, which will continue to run its fund management
business.
Since its arrival in Paris in July 1990, the Baring Securities office has
specialised in advice on Japanese and other Asian shares, passing orders to
its fellow subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Mr Andre Marini, director general of Baring Securities, Paris expects to
increase staff from 15 to about 20 in the next month or two and to begin
trading in French equities in two to three months.
The board of the London International Financial Futures Exchange met
yesterday to discuss the future of equity options trading after the
exchange's merger with the London Traded Options market next March, writes
Tracy Corrigan.
Liffe appears to have succeeded in persuading more firms to act as
market-makers in equity options, needed to boost liquidity in the
languishing market.
After the meeting, a Liffe official said that 'subject to confirmation from
market-makers, there will be adequate market-making capacity to proceed with
the provisional allocation of 'D' shares'.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Profits at Paramount slide 52%
to Dollars 122m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Communi-cations, the US entertainment and publishing company,
yesterday blamed its 52.8 per cent decline in last year's earnings on a poor
performance in entertainment and lower interest income.
For the fourth quarter to October 31, its profits fell 24.6 per cent to
Dollars 83.3m, or 70 cents a share, from Dollars 110.5m, or 93 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues eased slightly to Dollars 1.17bn from Dollars 1.18bn.
For the whole of 1991, Paramount had net income of Dollars 122.2m, or
Dollars 1.03 a share, against Dollars 259.1m, or Dollars 2.19. Revenues in
1991 were Dollars 3.9bn, compared with Dollars 3.87bn in 1990.
Paramount's provision for tax was Dollars 39.2m in the 1991 quarter, against
Dollars 41.9m a year ago.
Earnings for the year include an after-tax charge of Dollars 35.4m for
write-downs on some film and television development commitments and
reorganisation costs. Paramount's provision for tax in 1991 was Dollars
57.5m, against Dollars 121.9m a year earlier.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Fiscal 1991 results
were clearly disappointing. However, we are confident that the decisive
steps we have taken to strengthen management, improve our infrastructure and
sharply pare overhead costs will produce markedly better results in 1992 and
in the long term.'
The recent changes at Paramount include the surprise appointment last spring
of Mr Stanley Jaffe as president and chief operating officer. Mr Jaffe's
appointment was followed by the abrupt resignation of the head of
Paramount's entertainment division, Mr Frank Mancuso, who was replaced by Mr
Brandon Tartikoff.
Paramount said the results were in line with expectations, and shares in the
company rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 40 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Income from motion pictures was affected by a series of weak film releases,
but Paramount's publishing division had strong operating income.
Madison Square Gardens' loss in the fourth quarter and the year reflected
higher programming expenses at MSG Network, costs related to the venue's
official reopening in September, and the opening of a new 5,600-seat
theatre.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Schultze backs current value
accounting
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Walter Schultze, who was named as the new chief accountant at the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, yesterday reiterated his support for the
principle of current value accounting.
In his first speech since being selected for the job, Mr Schultze, currently
a partner with the international accountancy firm, KMPG Peat Marwick,
praised the efforts of Mr Richard Breedon, SEC chairman, to have current
value accounting introduced for certain assets held by financial
institutions.
At present, banks and thrifts carry financial products, such as stocks and
bonds, in their balance sheets at historic cost. The issue is contentious
and other agencies have argued such a move would increase the vulnerability
of financial institutions when they are already deeply troubled.
The SEC has formal responsibility for accounting standards and rules, but
delegates much of the task to the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB), an industry body. Mr Schultze was reported as saying that market
value accounting 'has to pass everyone's test of relevance', and that some
of the issues needed to be tested in practice.
'The trick will be to find the point of trade-off between the obvious
benefits and the cost of getting market value information that will be
relevant to investors.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chrysler, General Motors debt
ratings downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVERE financial pressures facing the US automobile industry were
underscored yesterday when one credit agency lowered its rating of General
Motors' debt and another downgraded Chrysler.
However, GM, the biggest of the US car manufacturers, could claim a victory
of sorts in that Moody's Investors Service, the agency which lowered its
senior debt rating, did not downgrade the short-term commercial paper issued
by General Motor Acceptance Corp (GMAC), its finance arm.
GMAC, the largest non-bank financial group in the US, relies on commercial
paper for much of its funding needs. A downgrading by Moody's or Standard &amp;
Poor's, the most influential rating agencies, would have impeded its ability
to tap this market, forcing it to pay higher interest rates.
Moody's cut its rating of GM and GMAC's senior debt from A1 to A2 but
maintained its Prime-1 rating on GMAC's commercial paper.
Fears of a downgrade were a major factor behind GM's announcement last month
of a big restructuring, including the closure of over 20 plants and 70,000
job losses over the next four years.
However, Moody's said its action was based on the fact that 'GM's long-term
competitive position may continue to weaken despite an expected improvement
in the company's cost structure and competitive efficiency'.
Standard &amp; Poor's, which has yet to comment on GM, yesterday cut its ratings
for Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers, and
Chrysler Financial, its finance arm, from double-B-minus to single-B-plus.
S&amp;P said the reasons included the weakness of the US automobile market and
the fact that Chrysler had not taken action to improve access to the capital
markets for its important and profitable finance arm, Chrysler Financial.
Chrysler said it was disappointed at the move, which was 'not warranted by
the current financial outlook'.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Air France to buy 40% stake in
Czech airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE is leading a consortium that will pay Dollars 60m for a 40 per
cent stake in Ceskeslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), the Czechoslovakian state
airline, writes Daniel Green. The deal values CSA at Dollars 150m (Pounds
82.4m) and makes Air France the first western airline to become a
shareholder in an existing eastern European carrier.
It would be one of the biggest investments yet for the London-based European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which is in the consortium.
The EBRD and Caisse des Depots et Consignation, a French financial
institution and a shareholder in Air France, were each contributing Dollars
20m in cash to the consortium, said Air France.
The EBRD said yesterday its board would finalise the level of investment
within eight weeks. The two airlines signed a memorandum of understanding in
Prague on Monday. The deal is subject to approval from the French and
Czechoslovak governments. Air France hopes this will be given by spring.
Air France's investment represents a partial privatisation of CSA. The
remaining 60 per cent will be held by the Czechoslovak state and domestic
financial institutions.
Air France said: 'We were looking for a partner in eastern Europe. Prague is
geographically located right in the centre.' The French state-owned airline
intends to make Prague a secondary European hub after Paris.
'This alliance represents an excellent platform for CSA's future development
as an airline based in the heart of Europe and for Prague as a major hub,'
said Mr Oldrich Churain, CSA director-general.
Of the Dollars 60m being paid for the CSA stake, Air France is paying about
Dollars 6m in cash.

ELF ATOCHEM, the chemicals subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil
group, is considering a worldwide joint venture in high-performance plastics
with Rohm and Haas, the US maker of Plexiglas.
The companies are planning three joint ventures, for their acrylic sheet and
powder moulding businesses, covering the US, western Europe and the rest of
the world, to reduce manufacturing costs, share research and development and
expand their product lines.
High-performance plastics are used in buildings, car components and trim,
sanitary ware, furniture and street signs, and the industry is dominated by
some of the world's largest chemicals companies.
Elf Atochem would not give the market share of its high-performance plastic,
Altuglas, but it said: 'To stay competitive in the coming decade, a company
must be present on at least two, if not on the three, main markets - Europe,
northern America and Asia. It is already a reality for other producers.'
The US joint venture will be 51 per cent controlled by Rohm and Haas; Elf
Atochem will control the European business and the company for the rest of
the world will be equally owned. Elf Atochem has annual sales of FFr50bn
(Dollars 9.6bn), of which the equivalent of Dollars 250m is in performance
plastics, about the same as Rohm and Haas, which has total sales of Dollars
2.8bn.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nadir airline grounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NOBLE AIR, the airline owned by Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly
Peck International, has suspended all flights.
The Department of Trade and Industry said the airline had stopped flying
after a strike by its pilots. A spokesman for Mr Nadir said that the airline
had not ceased trading, but that there would be a break in its operations
until mid-March when the tourism season got under way.
Noble Air, registered in Istanbul, was set up in 1988 to serve passengers
travelling between western Europe and Turkey and northern Cyprus. Its
ownership has never been entirely clear but yesterday Mr Nadir's spokesman
said that it belonged to Mr Nadir and had been pledged as security with his
creditors.
In November Mr Nadir was declared bankrupt with debts of some Pounds 80m.
Many of them were owed to security houses from which he bought Polly Peck
shares in the final weeks before the fruit and electronics group slid into
administration.
Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish Cypriot cemetery-owner and distant relative of
Mr Nadir, and who put up Pounds 1m surety for his bail in December 1990, has
been named in the Turkish press as a possible buyer for the airline. Mr
Nadir's spokesman was unable to confirm that Mr Guney had stepped in.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNION International, the troubled arm of the Vestey Group, one of Britain's
largest private companies, has appointed Mr Terry Robinson, a former
executive director of Lonrho, the international trading group, as chief
executive and a director.
The appointment comes amid mounting speculation over the future of Union,
which could face administration if it is unable to win the support of
bankers for a rescheduling of its substantial borrowings.
Union, which announced in October that it may breach its banking covenants,
is in discussions with more than 70 international banks over the
rescheduling of loans totalling about Pounds 350m.
It recently appointed Schroders as financial adviser and the appointment of
a chief executive from outside the group is part of its restructuring. Mr
Tim Vestey, who has led the group through its recent rocky period, will
remain a director of Union and general manager of Vestey Group.
Mr Robinson, 47, recently resigned from Lonrho where he has been a group
management accountant and since 1981, a director of the group. As one of
Lonrho's most outspoken directors, he has often been mentioned as a possible
candidate to succeed Mr Tiny Rowland, the group's 74-year-old chief
executive.
At Lonrho, he was instrumental in shaping the group's defence against Mr
Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur who built up a hostile stake in the
group nearly three years ago.
Mr Robinson said his appointment at Union was 'very useful in establishing a
positive relationship with the banks', and that the experience with
developing countries which he gained at Lonrho would serve him well at
Union.
Union, which is involved in businesses ranging from meat wholesaling and
retailing to property development, is burdened with unlet property
developments that are likely to lead to a write-down of more than Pounds
60m. It has also been hit by recession in its main markets and
hyper-inflation in Brazil where it has huge cattle interests.
While there was 'every chance of moving out of any of the businesses', Mr
Robinson said he believes the agro-industries would remain the rationale for
Union.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Extended welcome to Italian family: The Agnellis' increasing
investment in the French market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past five years, Italy's Agnelli family has gradually turned itself
into France's largest foreign corporate investor, in turnover terms, almost
without anybody noticing.
The Agnellis have slid into the French business establishment with patient
steps, doing their best to avoid treading on sore spots.
They have led a general increase in Italian investment, there and provide an
example of how to understand and infiltrate a foreign market, especially one
as sensitive to foreign invasion as France.
The latest advance for the Agnellis' French interests comes via Saint Louis,
the paper and sugar group in which they have a large minority stake. It has
paid FFr1.5bn (Pounds 154.3m) for 13.8 per cent of Source Perrier. This
stake, formerly held by Perrier itself, has indirectly tightened the Italian
family's grip on the world's largest mineral water group. It also brings a
powerful French shareholder into Perrier, soothing French fears that the
group was about to pass into entirely foreign hands.
Ifil, an Agnelli holding group, owns only 6.4 per cent of Saint Louis -
bought last July - but works in partnership with Worms et Cie, the French
family-controlled holding group which holds 36 per cent of Saint Louis
shares and nearly 49.5 per cent of the voting rights, so giving the pair a
clear majority.
Separately, another Agnelli holding company, Ifint, is bidding for Exor, the
wine-to-property holding group in which it had been buying shares since the
start of last year and which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. Between them,
Exor and Saint Louis control 48.8 per cent of Perrier shares.
Saint Louis would hate to be seen as a pawn in the Agnellis' latest move.
The deal has an industrial benefit for the sugar and paper group, says Mr
Bernard Dumon, Saint Louis' chairman. He told shareholders on Monday that
Saint Louis wanted to reinforce its food business and had been in contact
with Mr Jacques Vincent, Perrier's recently retired chairman, since 1987. He
did not exclude increasing Saint Louis' stake in Perrier further.
So what are the Agnellis up to in France? They may not have a very fixed
idea themselves, according to Mr Gian Luigi Gabetti, head of Ifint. 'The
Agnelli group must not be seen like some monolithic bloc. There is no
centralised programme, nor a central brain. What counts is personal
connections . . . Co-ordination at the highest level to avoid collisions in
business,' he said.
Some Agnelli-watchers in Paris say that, in the food industry at least, the
long-term prize is BSN, the leading French food group and Perrier's main
competitor in mineral water. BSN's chairman, 73-year-old Mr Antoine Riboud,
has made little apparent provision for his succession, and has become one of
Italy's biggest food operators with the Agnellis' help.
BSN and Ifil's partnership began in early 1987 when they jointly bought
Ferrarelle, an Italian mineral water producer, and exchanged small stakes in
each other later that year. Since then, they have snapped up Galbani, the
Italian cheese group, the Panzani and Agnesi pasta brands and a stake in
Peroni, Italy's largest beer group. Last month, Ifil sold full ownership of
its jointly-held Italian mineral waters to BSN, making the French company
Italy's leading supplier of mineral water.
The bargain could be that the Agnellis will support Mr Riboud's food and
drink ambitions as long as he is at the helm at BSN, on the understanding
that their interests will be well placed to succeed him, speculates an
observer. Ifil has always stressed that it will do nothing in BSN without Mr
Riboud's agreement.
Whatever the Agnellis' ultimate goal, the rules by which they play in France
are clear - to observe the sensitivities of the local establishment and to
avoid making hostile moves. Ifint, for example, briefly jarred two leading
French banks last year by offering to buy only 66 per cent of Exor, but
extended its offer to include all of the shares when it saw dissent in the
air.
Food and drink is only the latest theme to enter the Agnellis' French
interests, which represent an estimated combined turnover of FFr44bn,
slightly ahead of IBM France, the second-largest foreign investor. There is
a joint leisure venture between Ifil and Accor, the French hotel group, plus
minority stakes held by Ifint in the Club Mediterranee holiday group and a
number of other French companies.
There are also the French automotive and components businesses of Fiat, the
Italian carmaker chaired by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, with a FFr30bn annual
turnover. Fiat's French arm is headed by Mr Giorgio Frasca, who made the
first contact with Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the Alcatel Alsthom
telecommunications and engineering group, which led in 1990 to the exchange
of minority stakes between them. It is the same technique as used to seal
the BSN partnership, although in the Alcatel Alsthom deal the pair also
exchanged some businesses.
The Agnelli family's recent advances invite the question of whether France
is attracting a general inflow of Italian capital. Mr Raul Gardini is
another recent investor, with his acquisition of a stake in Sucres et
Denrees, the commodity trader.
Not all Italian investors have had a smooth ride, as shown by the losses at
Cerus, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company, following its failed
bid for control of Societe Generale de Belgique. But that has not dimmed the
perception, that with the single European market, the Italian business world
sees a profitable home for itself in France.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Orion satellite group completes financing: BAe is partner
and prime contractor to international business telecommunications service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of international companies including British Aerospace
yesterday completed the Dollars 500m (Pounds 274m) financing to establish an
international private satellite system in competition to those owned by the
world's telephone companies. The Orion system, to be launched in 1995, will
provide business telecommunication services throughout Europe and across the
Atlantic.
Orion, which has been under discussion since the mid-1980s, will compete
with Intelsat and Eutelsat, the international and European satellite
companies owned mainly by public telephone monopolies. The private US-based
Pan American Satellite has a smaller competing system.
In addition to being a partner in the venture, BAe will be the prime
contractor to supply the satellite system. It will also be a leading service
provider via satellite licences it has been awarded in recent years in the
UK, Germany and France.
The venture has been structured as a complicated partnership to overcome US
regulations which prevent foreigners owning more than 25 per cent of any
radio licence. Orion Network Systems, the US group which has been promoting
the project, is the general partner, while seven international groups are
limited partners of International Private Satellite Partners.
Apart from BAe, the six other groups are: General Dynamics, the US defence
manufacturer; Com Dev, the Canadian satellite group; Kingston
Communications, the UK local telecommunications company; Matra, the French
high technology group; Nissho Iwai, the large Japanese trading company; and
Stet, the state-owned Italian telecommunications group. Matra and General
Dynamics are sub-contractors to BAe to provide and launch the satellite
system. Services will be provided both by the partners collectively through
IPSP and individually since several of them have operating licences around
the world.
Mr Aidan Paul of Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank which has been an
adviser to the project since 1988, said Orion would concentrate on
'rooftop-to-rooftop business communications'. Businesses would be able to
place satellite dishes measuring 1.2 metres across on their roofs and so
establish their own private international communications networks.
The Dollars 500m financing consists of Dollars 90m of equity, supplied by
the partners, and Dollars 400m of debt, provided by a syndicate led by Chase
Investment Bank.

Baillie Gifford's resignation from the Unit Trust Association no doubt owes
something to Scottish thrift, saving as it does an annual subscription of
Pounds 15,000. But it also betrays friction within the industry over plans
to change the way units are priced. Coming after defections by the
Prudential and others over robust UTA criticisms of insurance company
commission structures, the latest departure further illustrates the gulf
between different parts of the retail financial services sector. It would
obviously be useful for the market if unit trusts, investment trusts and
insurers were able to present a united front against the building societies.
But that, it seems, is not the real world.

FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: European food
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's purchase by Saint Louis of a 13.8 per cent stake in Source
Perrier is another intriguing development in the Agnelli family's
pan-European food strategy. The ultimate goal may remain obscure, but the
latest deal has two immediate implications. It notably strengthens the
Italian grip on France's much-prized water company, and it underlines the
growing alliance between the Agnellis and Maison Worms.
These two families are openly acting in concert at St Louis, where they have
more than 50 per cent of the votes. By combining the new St Louis stake in
Perrier with the 35 per cent held by Exor, the quoted holding company for
which the Agnellis are currently making a full bid, they will now own 49 per
cent of Perrier. Under French takeover rules that should trigger a partial
bid for the rest, though minority shareholders should not expect any
favours. The Agnellis would not be required to pay more than the FF1,235 per
share forked out this week by St Louis, and with effective control already
in their hands they will hardly want to.
The more interesting question is whether a more substantial shake-up of food
and drink assets in France is on the cards. Notwithstanding stakes in BSN
held directly through the Agnelli vehicle Ifil (5.8 per cent) and indirectly
via St Louis (3 per cent), a full bid for the food giant is difficult to
envisage. It would be hugely expensive, would cause deep political ructions
and would simply not be the Agnelli style. The Agnellis and their French
friends are nevertheless emerging as a powerful new force in the European
food industry, ready to mount a serious challenge to the likes of Nestle and
Unilever in the 1990s.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It might be a negative indicator for US equities that the advisory panel of
the Wall Street Week television programme is more bullish than ever before.
It certainly suggests a degree of caution about the stampede into equities
since the discount rate cut on December 20. Could that simply reflect a
one-off shift of funds from money market accounts? Or have investors scented
the makings of robust recovery?
Retail investor enthusiasm for equities in an apparently overvalued market
could be interpreted as the final flowering of a bull trend that can be
traced back as far as 1974. But according to Mr Bob Farrell of Merrill
Lynch, there is a danger of over-simplification. Non-cyclical growth stocks
like biotechnology companies do look like peaking out. In contrast, the S &amp;
P capital goods index fell 12 per cent between March and mid-December. That
sector is now rebounding from an oversold position. There may thus be some
way further to go in cyclical stocks - though not necessarily
consumer-related ones like cars - even after the general buying frenzy dies
away.
All of which must be encouraging for European fund managers wondering about
adding to their US portfolio before the interest rate differential with
Germany narrows and the dollar starts to recover. There are caveats,
certainly. One is that the markets may be upset by injudicious fiscal
priming in Washington. Another is that recovery may not materialise. Mr
Farrell believes it will, though it may not last. The 1990s will see a much
more stop-go kind of economy, he says. So investors will have to become used
to trading in and out of the market.

FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Siren voices on the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,482.9 (-10.3)
Background noise about UK membership of the ERM is plainly not going away.
Yesterday brought a fresh appeal from a group of UK monetarist economists to
quit the system entirely and revert to domestic monetarist policies,
presumably along the lines of the early 1980s. Such agitation is relevant to
the markets insofar as it puts pressure on sterling. Beyond that, the
question is how far it belongs to the realm of the practical.
It is in principle self-evident that sound money is not desirable at any
price: if, for instance, it were to reduce the UK to a permanently depressed
region. But there are only four basic options. The UK can leave the ERM on
the terms suggested by the monetarists, preferably with the addition of an
independent UK central bank. But the monetarism of a decade ago remains
deeply unfashionable; as for central bank independence, it is viewed with
hostility by the Treasury. Second, the UK can revert to the older native
tradition of inflation tempered by devaluation. But the stop-go policies of
the 1970s are more unfashionable again.
This leaves only two practical options, both of which involve staying in.
The first is to tough things out at the original central rate, the logic
being that since the ERM is designed to be painful it might as well get on
with it. To devalue would be only to buy time until UK inflation brought the
pain back. The second is to devalue anyway, on the grounds that time is
worth buying until the mismatch between the UK and German economies is less
extreme.
The obvious snag about the second is that it weakens faith in sterling while
retaining the obligation to defend it, thus raising the theoretical
possibility of higher interest rates again. A possible way out would be the
perception by other ERM members that German monetary stringency is here to
stay, leading to an agreed revaluation by the D-Mark later in the year. But
that has to be a matter of genuine consensus. The practical likelihood is
that the Tories, for better or worse, will have to fight an election on the
present terms.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Japan pledges to boost US imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN yesterday greeted US president George Bush's call for freer access to
Japanese markets with a series of conciliatory announcements promising to
boost imports and support sales efforts by US companies.
The statements, from government and industry, came at the start of Mr Bush's
first official visit to Japan.
The president's agenda includes talks on global and regional issues, but the
overriding item will be the imbalance in bilateral economic ties.
Mr Bush, with one eye on the US recession and his looming election campaign,
will demand substantial concessions at summit meetings today and tomorrow
with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister.
Japan's conciliatory moves came in the form of a package of economic
measures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). The
ministry estimated that import-boosting proposals announced by 23 top
Japanese groups could result in an increase in Japanese imports of Dollars
10.2bn (Pounds 5.6bn) by 1993 compared with 1990. The companies have
promised to increase imports and local procurement for foreign factories by
50 to 100 per cent between 1990 and 1993.
Miti also promised greatly to expand a scheme begun last May in which Japan
gives export credit insurance for projects in developing countries involving
the purchase of US goods. The ministry, which has so far committed Dollars
700m to the scheme, yesterday pledged an extra Dollars 5bn over 'the next
several years'.
Among the president's contingent are Mr Robert Mosbacher, commerce
secretary, and around 20 top US executives. Mr Nicholas Brady, the treasury
secretary, unexpectedly joined the party yesterday, a measure of US concern
about the economic content of the visit.
Mr Brady met Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japanese finance minister. The two are
believed to have discussed the co-ordination of macro-economic policy,
including recent cuts in interest rates and the yen's appreciation against
the dollar to its highest level in three years.
Mr Bush's itinerary included a sightseeing trip to the ancient capital of
Kyoto, the official opening of a US retail store - Toys 'R' Us - and a
meeting with students at which he said he wanted to increase access to
Japanese markets for US goods and services.
Mr Mosbacher was presented with Miti's economic proposals, which included a
restatement of plans announced late last year to provide Japanese importers
with tax credits and other incentives.
However, Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs, said
there were limits to what the government could do, since Japan operated as a
market economy.
Yesterday's proposals contained no specific mention of the automotive
industry, the sector propelled to the top of Mr Bush's agenda after the
recent spate of redundancies among US carworkers. Officials were still
negotiating last night on US demands for Japan to increase purchases of
American cars and parts.
Japanese carmakers have recently promised to buy more foreign parts and some
companies have said they will announce moves to sell US vehicles in their
dealerships. Nissan announced yesterday it would stock Ford vehicles; Honda,
Mazda and Mitsubishi Motors have similar tie-ups with American companies.
US officials want to ensure that such proposals have a real impact. Nissan's
plan to sell Fords envisages handling just 3,000 vehicles a year. This comes
against a background which saw the US import 1.58m Japanese-made cars in the
first 11 months of 1991, compared with only 28,000 sold to Japan.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Labour moves on to offensive with six-point economic plan:
Major says tax increases 'are precisely what this country doesn't need'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR moved on to the political offensive yesterday in the increasingly
frenetic electioneering atmosphere by setting out a six-point short-term
plan to take the UK out of recession.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused the prime minister of telling
'whoppers' about Labour's tax plans: he said he detected 'almost a sense of
panic' among the Tories.
Mr Kinnock sounded confident after the last day-long meeting of Labour's
shadow cabinet before the election, which discussed campaigning and endorsed
the programme for long-term economic recovery which will be published today.
He said the Tories' negative campaigning was a sign of their desperation to
provide a distraction from the recession.
Yesterday Mr John Major and Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman,
broadened their attack on the possibility of higher taxes under Labour by
focussing on the economic harm they would do.
The prime minister said substantial tax increases across the board 'would
not only be unwelcome, they would be economically damaging. They are
precisely what this country doesn't need at the moment'. Mr Patten said they
would 'destroy hopes of an economic recovery'.
Mr Major said Labour had spent years condemning the government for
'underfunding' public services and promising to correct this. This
inevitably 'involves expenditure and that expenditure has to be paid for'.
The intense level of campaigning will continue in the coming weeks, whatever
the date chosen for the general election. Mr Major will discuss the
manifesto and campaign tactics in meetings with colleagues at Chequers
towards the end of the week. Recent opinion polls have not shown a clear
lead for either party, and a February election would mean losing the
opportunity to use the Budget to gain popularity, as well as delaying the
introduction of the council tax.
Mr Kinnock rejected Tory assertions that the increase in the top rate would
damage economic recovery, pointing out that in the period of strongest
growth in the mid-1980s the top tax rate was 60 per cent.
With Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, he reiterated that Labour's
planned top tax rate would affect only people earning 'well over Pounds
30,000', and that 88 per cent of earners would not be affected by the
removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Labour would not
spend more than the country could afford, they promised.
Labour's six-point programme includes enhanced first-year capital allowances
for new investment in manufacturing; creating a new skills fund and a job
experience programme, estimated to cost Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m; and setting
up a cash-limited enterprise investment scheme.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, joined the fray, saying the
government was not coming clean about how it would fund any tax cuts and
that Labour was not telling the whole truth about its public spending.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Invoice errors cost Whitehall Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT departments have been overcharged by millions of pounds through
invoice errors by Whitehall's main equipment supplier, including a Pounds
6,100 demand for a job that cost Pounds 61.
In a catalogue of criticisms aimed at PSA Services, the National Audit
Office complains in a report published yesterday of charging errors, a
failure to recover costs satisfactorily and weaknesses in operating a stock
control system for supplying security filing equipment to Whitehall.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor general and head of the NAO, the
main watchdog on government spending, has qualified his certification of the
1990-91 PSA Services accounts because demands for Pounds 65.6m of work
incurred have not been accepted by the agency's clients.
The NAO estimates that customers, mainly government departments, were
overcharged by up to Pounds 4.7m by PSA Services, formerly the Property
Services Agency and currently a candidate for privatisation.
Sir John said his examination of charges to customers for directly employed
labour revealed 'a high level of error' both in the number of errors found
and their scale. Two examples given are an actual charge of Pounds 61 for
replacing a cistern that was invoiced at Pounds 6,100, and an actual charge
of Pounds 20 for rewashering taps that had been invoiced at Pounds 920.
On the sample examined, the audit office found 1,100 errors valued at Pounds
1.1m. 'On this basis, I estimate the total level of error to be Pounds 2.7m
. . . but the overcharging may have ranged from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 4.7m,'
Sir John says.
PSA Services argued it would not be economic or practical to identify and
repay to customers many of the overcharges, and with Treasury agreement,
Pounds 2.7m has been surrendered to the government's consolidated fund.
The report also highlights discrepancies of Pounds 5.7m over the provision
of security furniture, such as locks, safes and filing cabinets, for
securing classified Whitehall documents.
There was no question of a security risk or unauthorised access to
classified material in sensitive departments, such as defence and the
Cabinet Office, as codes and lock combinations were not kept. However, the
stock control and financial accounting system governing the purchase,
storage, issue and charging for the equipment had severe teething problems.
An internal audit found poor management control and unreliable data, and an
inexperienced officer had virtually unlimited control of the system and was
not effectively supervised.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Stress blamed for failed mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGERS and acquisitions frequently fail to live up to financial
expectations because companies place too much importance on finance, and
spend too little time planning for the stressful effects of change on their
staff.
That is the finding of a three-year study of mergers and acquisitions being
unveiled today by occupational psychologists.
More than half of all mergers and acquisitions do not achieve their
financial potential in spite of being presented to shareholders as a
strategy for wealth creation, according to psychologists Dr Sue Cartwright
and Professor Cary Cooper from the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology.
In addition, mergers and acquisitions 'have become associated with lowered
productivity, higher labour turnover and absenteeism, worse strike records
and poorer accident rates'.
While companies examine in detail the financial considerations of taking
over or merging with another organisation, the 'people' issues are very much
of an afterthought, Dr Cartwright and Professor Cooper will tell the British
Psychological Society's annual occupational psychology conference in
Liverpool.
The consequence is that even a genuine merger between highly compatible
companies is often perceived as a takeover by the staff, the researchers
say.
Mergers are found to be more stressful because of the greater degree of
ambiguity and the frequently long periods of uncertainty while negotiations
are in progress.
Middle managers are found to be the most stressed group because they are not
close enough to the top to know exactly what is going on, but still have to
manage the fears of more junior staff.
For example, a detailed study of the mental health of 157 middle managers
after the merger of two building societies found the managers had 'adverse
mental health scores significantly higher than the normal population', and
an 'abnormally high percentage' recorded scores 'comparable with
psycho-neurotic hospital outpatients'.
Because of the secrecy surrounding acquisitions and mergers, companies do
not learn from each other's mistakes. 'Culture audits' need to be conducted
before companies combine so the best aspects of each organisation can be
brought to the new joint venture, the researchers conclude.

His press team, who have also raked up DM500 of their own, object equally to

No sooner had he arrived on a fact finding mission than Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's education secretary, found himself on the Mexican school shelf.
His main contact - Mexico's education minister - had just resigned.
The British embassy stood in a corner holding its breath. Who was going to
tutor Britain's pugnacious education supremo on Mexican lessons for
Britain's school kids? The local press delved deep into their government
textbooks and correctly predicted that Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the
budget minister would be made education minister.
Other news reports did not receive such high marks. The mayor of Mexico city
and the head of the ruling party were both tipped by high sources as the new
budget minister. Both were wrong. Mr Zedillo will not be replaced as budget
minister at all. His department will simply be subsumed into the finance
ministry.
Clarke, who has had seven ministerial jobs in 13 years, may have found the
confusion faintly familiar.

A trifling 598 years after London's merchants, the mercers, set themselves
up as the City's first livery company, the Court of Aldermen has welcomed
its 100th recruit, the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.
With green and gold livery and the motto cito (swiftly), the 316 members are
united in an appreciation of computers either as makers or users. Freemen of
the new company include Lord Weinstock, chairman of GEC, Sir Colin Marshall,
chief executive of British Airways, and Sir Brian Jenkins, the current Lord
Mayor.
More obviously, its ranks include Peter Bonfield, chairman of ICL and Hilary
Cropper, chief executive of the computing services group FI.
This year's master is Alan Benjamin, a former director of communications at
ICL.
The world of livery companies may seem anachronistic in the computer age but
the information technologists are devoting themselves to the same good works
livery company have espoused through the ages - education, training and
medical research.

If they do, and if the transgressors are at work, Veronique Neiertz,
France's state secretary for women's rights and daily life will pounce.
Penalties for sexual harassment are increasingly common throughout the
world. But the proposed French text is distinctive in one curious way. It
describes the offence as 'A word, gesture, attitude or behaviour by a
hierarchical superior with a view to compel an employee to respond to a
solicitation of a sexual nature'.
This wording seems to imply either that there is no such thing as sexual
harassment by a hierarchical equal or inferior; or that it is not an
offence. Both of these propositions must be absurd.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: Lonrho's loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Terry Robinson's move into the chief executive's seat at Union International
should be welcome news for the bankers to the Vestey empire. But what will
the shareholders in his old employer, Lonrho, make of it?
Lonrho is very much the creation of its founder Tiny Rowland and it is hard
for an outsider to judge the relative importance of the rest of the top
management team. The 47-year-old Robinson was only one of four chartered
accountants on the board and although Robinson was a well-known Lonrho hand,
he was not the finance director.
This job is shared by Philip Tarsh, chairman of the finance committee, and
Robin Whitten, the treasurer. Paul Spicer, one of two new deputy chairmen,
says that Lonrho's top management has always worked as a team, and
Robinson's responsibilities will be 'very easily absorbed' by the existing
management. Talk of Robinson being Tiny's heir-apparent was ridiculous.
The size of Robinson's share options - second only to Rowland's - suggests
he was a very important person at Lonrho. His detailed critique of Alan
Bond's empire helped bring down the Australian tycoon, and many regarded the
unprepossessing northerner as the acceptable face of Lonrho. Whatever Lonrho
says, he will be sorely missed.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Engineering a solution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE dark days for the UK engineering industry. It is beset by a
recession, the severity of which took most companies by surprise, and
frustrated that the government's mishandling of macro-economic policy is
forcing it once more to fight for its survival.
The industry also accuses the government of failing to provide a supportive
long-term framework for investment, research and training. The substance to
this charge is more difficult to judge and more central to any assessment of
whether the relationship between the public and private sectors needs
reform.
A report to be discussed today by the National Economic Development Council
should be an opportunity to float new ideas on how the government and the
industry might work together. Unfortunately it is as revealing about Nedo's
shortcomings as it is about the weaknesses of the engineering industry.
The report is good on its analysis of the industry's record: strong
increases in productivity and relative reductions in labour costs have not
been matched by improvements in profitability, investment and innovation.
The industry is still handicapped by a huge skills deficit.
But Nedo's policy prescriptions are a feeble restatement of conventional
wisdom. It presents sensible recommendations for how government and industry
might more effectively identify and promulgate world class standards of
management, training and manufacturing systems.
Consensus
This is all so uncontroversial that the government can and no doubt will
claim it is already doing much of it. Yet there is no indication that these
measures will play a critical role in enabling the industry to meet the
competitive challenge it faces from its continental and Far Eastern
competitors. It fails to exploit the way the market for ideas could be
opening up a year after Mrs Thatcher's departure.
Nedo still sees its role as creating a consensus between political parties,
employers and unions over issues such as industrial policy and training. It
was so battered by Thatcherism that it could only survive by becoming
timidly uncontroversial. It has, in a word, been marginalised.
Building consensus over policy is not the problem it was in the 1980s. The
main political parties are increasingly converging on economic policy. What
they lack is not agreement but ideas. If Nedo's reports are to be of more
value to industries such as engineering, it needs to shift focus.
Right issues
The starting point is to pick the right issues. If Nedo confines itself to
promoting consensus between political parties, employers and trade unions,
it will be limited to the terrain which the parties have chosen, for their
own reasons. Instead Nedo needs constantly to point out where current policy
debates are too short sighted or closed; a confident government would
welcome a more unruly approach. For example, the engineering report does
discuss the problem for aerospace companies of falling defence spending; but
it is mute or timid upon more controversial issues such as science policy
and standard setting.
Second, Nedo should audit the effectiveness of policy. The widespread
concern within the engineering industry over the way training has been
disrupted by the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils is not
reflected in this report. The report is bland and predictable where it
should have a critical edge.
Third, it should expand the imagination of policy makers by provoking new
ideas. In engineering this could have meant looking at the future of
innovation policy; the impact on industrial relations of the proposed merger
of the industry's two main unions, the engineering union, AEU, and the
electricians union, EETPU; the way that utility regulation and public
procurement might affect supplying industries; and the way policies on
inward investment might be developed to attract more research and design
facilities.
Nedo needs to move out of the shadow of Thatcherism. It needs to agitate the
policy debate, not send it to sleep.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Making a drama out of a movie: Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several times over the years this column has complained about the
broadcasters' habit of applying the word 'Film' to pieces of fiction which
have never had a proper cinema release. Quite often the production has had
nothing whatsoever to do with the cinema and yet it is tagged in Radio Times
with the reversed white-on-black 'Film' logo normally applied to real
movies, and in TV Times with the even more explicit black-on-white 'Film'
logo with sprocket holes down the sides which unmistakably symbolises
celluloid and, to most viewers, says 'This is a real movie'. Many newspapers
have adopted a similar device which most use not at their own discretion but
when advised to by the broadcasters.
Before going any further let us deal with that word 'movie': it has only one
meaning and everyone understands it, whereas a 'film' can be anything from
the little spool on which you take your holiday snaps to a wildlife
documentary by David Attenborough. Thus 'movie' will be the word used here
to mean a feature film made for the cinema.
But why all the fuss? There is, surely, less and less distinction between
fiction made for the cinema and for television; does anybody really care any
more? Ten years ago, as we approached the launch of Channel 4, that was
becoming a popular attitude. Channel 4 proposed to use its drama budget and
its corporate clout to destroy the differences. The chronically troubled
British cinema was to be revivified by British television (long the
repository of drama talents which in the US or France would have lived
solely in cinema) and work such as The Company Of Wolves, The Draughtsman's
Contract and My Beautiful Laundrette would be either commissioned or
co-produced by Channel 4 and shown on both large and small screens.
At the time this policy seemed not only attractive but inspired and almost
heroic. Simultaneously we were getting used to the American idea of a
pecking order for movie release, starting with metropolitan cinemas and
moving on to local cinemas, video rental outlets, satellite subscription
channels, pay cable, terrestrial television, sell-through video and local
television. There was, furthermore much talk of 'convergence', meaning the
tendency of all the mass media and information industries - film, video,
computer games, television, Reuters reports - to converge on the customer's
VDU. Under these circumstances what could it matter whether a bit of fiction
had originally been intended for the cinema or for television?
Ten years ago I would have subscribed to the convergence theory, and put
considerable faith in Channel 4's drive to dismantle the barriers. But a
decade later, having watched not only the three comparatively successful
works named above but also a succession of hybrids such as The Ploughman's
Lunch, Good And Bad At Games and Remembrance, lacking both the power of
continuity that you get with good television drama series, and the 'big
occasion' feel of real movies, I find myself once again deeply suspicious of
the claim that there are no significant differences. With the word
'convergence' slumbering again in the dictionary and Channel 4 having pretty
well abandoned its hybrid policy, the Christmas and new year holiday, with
its scores of television dramas and movies of all vintages, seemed like an
ideal occasion to do a little survey.
The result was far more definite than I would have expected. Once in a blue
moon you will find a movie which television might have produced as one of
its own dramas. Baby Boom, for instance, with Diane Keaton playing a New
York yuppie who 'inherits' a baby in a will, drops out of the rat race, and
ends up making gourmet baby food in Vermont, could perfectly well have been
made for television. Yet it would inevitably have been a series, not a
one-off, and the whole idea would have been stretched out like chewing gum,
thin and sagging in the middle. Not that the movie was any great shakes.
Even more rarely you come across a television production which could
conceivably have been created for the cinema, for example BBC1's Bernard And
The Genie, in which Lenny Henry played a cool genie making his first
appearance for a couple of millennia, and for the first time outside the
Middle East. Many of the lines were well up to the standard you would expect
from Richard Curtis, who co-wrote the Blackadder series:
'You met Jesus?'
'Of course. He helped out with the wine at my brother's wedding'.
And, 'If I could just memorise the songs of Mr Barry White I could snog
every babe from Mount Hebron to the Red Sea'.
One of the reasons this seemed so atypical of television (British
television, anyway) is that it was full of magic and special effects, and
thus non-naturalistic. The new British drama in the last fortnight, both
one-offs and series, has shown once again, as though we needed showing, that
the home industry is dedicated unwaveringly to realism, either social
realism (agonising family situations) and/or, more commonly still, surface
realism. No matter how far fetched the plots of Miss Marple or Poirot, no
matter how incongruous the accents, the sets and locations are dressed with
an obsession for surface detail which now amounts to fetish.
I cannot swear to it, but I believe I saw the handle of a 1950s Gaggia
espresso coffee machine behind David Suchet's head in the supposedly 1936
setting of 'The ABC Murders' on ITV on Sunday: that is the sort of
point-scoring to which we are being driven.
The more you watch and the more you compare, the clearer becomes the
difference between movies and television drama. With television you are
perpetually aware that the material has been officially 'approved' by some
bossyboots who sincerely believes that he knows better than you do what is
good for you. Of course cinema has had to put up with the Hays Office and
the British Board of Film Censors, yet despite such bodies there has always
been greater freedom in the cinema. Even something as simple and funny as
the free-wheeling sexuality in A Fish Called Wanda, shown on BBC1, with
Jamie Lee Curtis turned on by her lovers speaking Italian or Russian is
difficult to imagine in a television-originated fiction.
The most telling evidence, however, was in BBC1's screening of The Accused
last Thursday. This movie, with Jodie Foster playing a young woman who is
gang-raped in a bar after she has been drinking, smoking pot, and giving an
exhibition of suggestive dancing, has been criticised as 'exploitive'
because it includes an explicit depiction of the rapes. It may be legitimate
to argue that the scene should not be there at all, though to me it seems
essential since it is the viciousness of the men's behaviour - the foul
language of the hysterical onlookers as well as the brutality of the actual
rapists - which will silence those viewers who argue 'She asked for it'. No
woman ever asks for that.
What is surely not legitimate is to re-edit that scene, as the BBC did,
cutting out the swear words and deleting the painful and horrifying scenes
from the rapes, so that it all becomes that much more harmless and
acceptable. Not only does this destroy the power of the scene to silence the
apologists, it also obscures the second and perhaps even more important
message: that rape has practically nothing to do with sex and everything to
do with violence. The BBC behaved like some dim old fool taking a knife to
the private parts of all the nudes in the National Gallery to 'save' the
rest of us from 'offence': an act guaranteed to insult the artist, the
subject, and the public.
Worst of all, having bowdlerised the movie, they then had the cheek to send
out billings, to be accompanied by all those 'Film' logos, claiming to offer
'The first showing on network television of this graphic and disturbing
drama' for all the world as though they really were showing the work as
directed by Jonathan Kaplan and including the full Oscar-winning performance
of Jodie Foster.
The time has surely come for programme journals and newspapers to take it
upon themselves to explain when a movie is really a movie and when it is
something different.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: The Gigli Concert: Almeida Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is another Irish theatre triumph in London, this time at the Almeida.
Tom Murphy's The Gigli Concert, though it has a cast of only three, has
everything: wit, pathos and music. Above all, it contains superlative
acting.
The play was first performed at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, in 1983. This is
a slightly revised version which was presented at the Abbey last year. As
the British premiere, it cries out to be seen. One could be pretentious
about it and say it has a cosmic background, as a programme note claims: I
would prefer to say simply that it is deeply humane.
JPW King is an Englishman with a Tipperary grandmother who has set up in
Dublin as a dynamatologist, which means a kind of quack psychologist. He has
few, if any, patients until the appearance of the unnamed Irish Man, who
asks for help and has money to pay for it. The Irish Man claims to have been
born in Italy where he was a promising boy soprano. He has since made a
sizeable fortune out of the Irish building industry, but craves now to be
able to sing like Gigli.
Both JPW and the Irish Man are alcoholics, though in the Irish sense of
drinking steadily from morning onwards rather than being particularly
dangerous. Both ask themselves separately how they can get through the day.
The therapy is talk, vodka and listening to Gigli as the Englishman and the
Irish Man discover how much they have in common and how dependent they are
on each other.
Whereas the Irish Man has built a thousand homes, JPW claims to be devoted
to a woman called Helen who never appears. Instead he makes love to Mona,
whom he has met in a supermarket and who spreads her favours around the city
but has a special affection for JPW. The talk, being Irish, is unstopping,
going through childhood, sex and religion, and if the play has a fault, it
is that it is slightly too long. But it is also full of satire. You will
remember the acting, however, long after most of the words have been
forgotten.
All three performances are superb. Barry Foster as JPW is a big man capable
of wonderful facial changes. He can be the kind, sympathetic Englishman,
then switch to anger or ecstasy. Tony Doyle as the Irish Man has a slightly
less developed part and seldom gets out of his overcoat. Ruth McCabe's Mona
strikes me as entirely credible despite her strange life-style. She is
vulgar, loving, faithful and promiscuous all in one. The trio between them
are capable of variations of pace unusual on a London stage.
There is a thoroughly appropriate set of JPW's surgery, with the Dublin
streets outside, designed by Ashley Martin-Davis. The direction is by Karel
Reisz, more normally associated with the cinema. Here, like everyone else,
he seems in his element.

Judging from the description of today's Dispatches (9.00 C4) it seems that
the Gulf War went pretty much as the west intended: whereas the allies'
costs were minimal, with most of the Dollars 70bn being paid by Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Germany, and almost all the allied troops coming
home safely, 350,000 Iraqis were killed. Furthermore the war was good for
western business since it resulted in big contracts for repairs in Kuwait
and a major boost for the US arms trade. So that's OK. Of course Saddam
Hussein is more firmly in control in Baghdad than ever before, but you can't
have everything can you?
Survival (9.00 ITV) shows the first of an occasional series which promises
to 'look beyond Russia's political landscape to the hidden beauty of the
countryside'. Today, Siberia, land of the white fox and the snowy owl. For
the many fans of Dynasty who were upset when the daft series ended so
abruptly in 1989 there is now a 3-hour mini-series tying off the loose ends.
Part 1 is on BBC1 at 9.30 and the second part at the same time tomorrow.
Channel 4 shows the second part of Jane Campion's trilogy An Angel At My
Table telling the story of New Zealand writer Janet Frame (10.00).

FT  08 JAN 92 / Management: Why sparks are flying - The background to
tensions between Britain's largest clothes retailer and its suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the managers of a Midlands clothing company or a Yorkshire woollen mill
talk about preparing for a 'royal visit', they are less likely to be
referring to the Queen than a delegation from Marks and Spencer.
Suppliers tell how factories are repainted, new uniforms issued and
machinery scrubbed spotless in preparation for these visits. Such reverence
speaks volumes about the exacting standards that M and S demands from its
manufacturers. It also says much about the power that M and S exercises over
them.
M and S, or 'Baker Street' as its suppliers like to call it in reference to
its head office, has dominated the UK's textile and clothing companies for
decades. It is also an important customer for a string of other
manufacturing industries such as food, drink, cosmetics and furniture.
This year, M and S will buy more than Pounds 4.5bn of goods from its
suppliers with more than 80 per cent of them manufactured in the UK. Baker
Street is not only the biggest single customer of Britain's clothing
companies - buying at least a quarter of all the clothing made in the
country - it also exercises enormous influence over the whole industry's
development.
Clinton Silver, M and S's deputy chairman responsible for merchandise
procurement, even suggests the company has helped save the sector. 'If we
had a policy of buying as cheaply as we could and played harlot from
supplier to supplier abroad, there would be no British textile industry,' he
says. Many in the industry accept that this is true.
Through its network of overseas stores, M and S has also been a significant
exporter of UK goods. It accounts for 25 per cent of all UK clothing exports
and achieves the impressive feat of selling fashion goods to France and
British-made shirts to Hong Kong.
Yet some manufacturers now suggest that this unique relationship - the envy
of the retailing world - is under threat. Tensions are arising as a result
of the recession and the shortening lead times in the supply chain that have
resulted from greater use of information technology - a trend known in
industry jargon as Quick Response.
Over the years the suppliers have privately grumbled about the company and
its tough negotiating tactics. But in recent months the grumbles have become
much louder. Some suppliers - notably Steilmann, the German clothing group -
have been groaning in public.
These criticisms have been inflamed by the news of cutbacks at several
long-established suppliers such as SR Gent, fuelling speculation that M and
S has become even tougher, even too tough, with its manufacturers.
The manner of M and S's dealings has also attracted fire and its decision to
share the costs of the VAT increase between itself and its suppliers rather
than raising prices provoked considerable antagonism. The head of one big
clothing group said he was called into Baker Street and simply instructed to
comply with the decision in 'an appallingly arrogant manner'. Another
supplier described the group's behaviour as 'outrageously high-handed'.
Silver, who has been at M and S for 40 years, seems unruffled by such
criticisms although he accepts that the current recession has indeed exposed
many difficulties. 'Recession finds out a number of problems and we had a
new experience for me. A half a dozen of our suppliers went bankrupt,' he
says.
But although he greatly regrets these corporate collapses he vehemently
rejects the charge that they were in any way the fault of M and S. 'I would
say that every single one of them was tied up in imprudent financial
activity taking over companies and expanding on the basis of debts which
they were then unable to service,' he says.
M and S accepts it is 'no pussycat' when it comes to negotiating with its
suppliers but points out that many of its manufacturers have built their
businesses on the back of M and S's success. 'They have grown from little
rag trade businesses into successful public companies,' says Silver proudly.
Many of these trading relationships stretch back 25, 50 or even 100 years
and both sides have developed an intimate knowledge of each other's
businesses, he says. Senior M and S directors meet the boards of each of its
major suppliers twice a year where there are the 'the frankest of
discussions' according to Silver.
Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, says it is 'stupid'
for suppliers to blame M and S for their problems. He argues that the
company simply acts as a transmission mechanism telling the companies what
consumers are prepared to pay.
Another industry figure comments: 'M and S is a tough negotiator on price,
but so it always has been. If M and S seems tough with suppliers at present,
that is a reflection of market conditions.'
The rumpus over M and S's relations with its suppliers reflects the broader
problems confronting the clothing industry. UK clothing companies have
steadily lost share of their domestic market to lower cost producers from
Asia, and more recently, Africa. The recession has merely accelerated the
process, especially with the dollar standing where it does against sterling.
Whether it likes it or not, M and S will find it increasingly difficult to
continue to source clothing at a competitive cost in the UK. The fact that
the proportion of goods the company buys in the UK has fallen over the past
40 years from 99 per cent to 83 per cent is indicative of the trend.
Baker Street already buys some goods direct from the Far East although
mainly for the top tiers of its catalogue. 'If you want hand-embroidered
knitwear you have to go to the nimble fingers of the Far East,' Silver says.
But he adds that M and S buys the overwhelming majority of the goods from
the Far East through its existing UK suppliers, such as Courtaulds, Coats
Viyella, SR Gent and William Baird, in order to preserve quality standards
and simplify warehousing and distribution arrangements.
But M and S would still prefer to have a strong flexible supplier base close
to hand and has even encouraged overseas manufacturers to set up in the UK.
For example, Delta, an Israeli manufacturer of leisurewear and underwear,
has recently opened a factory in Scotland partly as a result of M and S's
prompting.
Silver argues that having a responsive local manufacturing base allows the
retailer to work closely with the manufacturer to develop new products. He
cites the example of machine-washable lambswool fabrics, and easy-to-iron
cotton shirts which he describes as representing 'the essence of Marks and
Spencer'.
The massive investment that the best UK clothing companies have made in
advanced manufacturing systems has also enabled them to retain a competitive
edge in terms of speed, cost and flexibility. Designs of shirts which
previously took weeks to change can now be altered in a matter of hours
using computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques.
Electronic data interchange (EDI) links have also been established between M
and S and its suppliers allowing the supply chain to be managed more
effectively. 'You do not just place a contract and wave goodbye to it. Sizes
and colours can be altered as the public expresses its interest,' Silver
says.
But although such flexibility is of great advantage to M and S, it can turn
out to be a nightmare for the supplier, which increasingly has to stock up
with raw materials in advance of orders and second-guess future levels of
demand.
Silver accepts that quick response - or fast response as he calls it - can
cause problems but argues that it has to be seen within the context of a
stable trading relationship with regular predictable bulk orders being
placed for about 80 per cent of its products. For example, in the summer M
and S knows that 60 per cent of its women's blouses will be white.
'There is no point in moaning about it,' said one supplier of womenswear.
'We have all got to meet the technological challenge whether we like it or
not and make sure that the right quantities arrive at the right quality when
they are required.'
Whatever the tensions in the relationship, there is a widespread recognition
that suppliers would rather deal with M and S than most other retailers. 'M
and S is always scrupulous in its dealings,' says Taylor of Courtaulds.
'They do not send back garments for spurious reasons. And M and S always,
always pays on time.'
M and S has indeed helped shelter the UK clothing industry from the coldest
winds of international competition. But its ability to do so, while
remaining fully competitive on the high street, will be sorely tested in the
coming months as recession persists.
The clothing industry is grimly bracing itself for another rash of
casualties.

FT  08 JAN 92 / IRA thought to be behind Ireland's biggest bank raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Provisional IRA is suspected of carrying out the biggest bank raid in
Ireland's history, in which five armed robbers made off with cash estimated
at almost IPounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.3m).
The raid on Monday was at a cash-holding centre run by Allied Irish Banks at
Waterford in the Irish Republic. The republic's Central Bank holds cash
reserves there to provide liquidity to regional banks or to absorb their
surpluses on a day-to-day basis. The centre is one of five in the Republic
operated either by Allied Irish Banks or Bank of Ireland as agents of the
Central Bank.
Police said the raid was carried out with military precision by five men
armed with an automatic rifle and handguns. They spent only five minutes in
forcing staff to open a vault, loading the cash into a stolen van and making
their getaway. They had apparently earlier broken through the cement roof of
the building.
Shots were fired, but no-one was injured. The getaway van was found
abandoned yesterday in a lane a few miles north of Waterford, where it is
thought the robbers transferred to another car with a Northern Ireland
number plate. The police said the IRA was the main suspect, although there
was 'no hard proof'.
The IRA usually keeps a low profile in the republic, and does not claim
responsibility for its actions as it does in Northern Ireland. The IRA is
not thought to have been active in armed robberies in the republic since
1990. But a security crackdown on its racketeering in Northern Ireland over
the past year is believed to have helped cut the estimated Pounds 6m raised
each year to finance IRA operations.
Irish police and banking chiefs met yesterday to review security procedures
at other cash-holding centres in the republic.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday met unionist leaders
who called for troop reinforcements for the province. Mr James Molyneaux and
the Rev Ian Paisley described the meeting at the Stormont parliament
building as 'meaningful and constructive'.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Data group merger values rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of mergers and acquisitions among UK information-services
companies rose by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 669m from Pounds 645m in
1990, compared with a peak of Pounds 1.1bn in 1988.
The number of transactions, 102, was down on both 1988 (120) and 1990 (138),
according to the figures compiled by Broadview Associates, a firm of
financial advisers.
Broadview argues that the rise in total value when the economy and the
information-services industry are in difficulties underlines the importance
of mergers and acquisitions as a vehicle for growth in the sector.
The proportion of deals financed through shares rose from 8 per cent in 1990
to 18 per cent, but cash continued to be the main instru-ment.
The four largest transactions accounted for 56 per cent of the total value
of deals: Electronic Data Systems bought SD-Scicon for Pounds 162m; First
Data Resources, an American Express subsidiary, bought Signet for Pounds
100m; a management buy-out at Thorn EMI Software created Data Sciences,
valued at Pounds 82m; ACT Group purchased Quotient for Pounds 27.4m.

Car parts groups shun 'just-in-time' production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW EUROPEAN car compo-nent suppliers have either introduced rapid delivery
'just-in-time' (JIT) production or clustered around car assembly plants
operated by Japanese investors, the Institute of British Geographers'
Conference in Sheffield was told yester-day.
Japanese car producers based in Europe are far more concerned with quality,
price and the potential for developing long-term relationships than having
suppliers close by, Professor Ray Hudson and Dr David Sadler from Durham
University's department of geography concluded.
In a survey conducted for the European Community, the researchers found that
40 per cent of component suppliers claimed to operate JIT production, which
allows very short production cycles and delivery within a few hours.
However, only 5 per cent in fact used these methods.
Many analysts have forecast that the European car industry would develop
geographically along the lines of that in the US, where many JIT producers
locate near assemblers.
But the study found little evidence of the pattern being repeated in Europe.
Dr Sadler said that the US distribution pattern resulted from the fact that
there only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of components by value come from
external suppliers.
In Europe, there is a far stronger tradition of independent suppliers,
representing about 50 per cent of components by value. In Japan, more than
70 per cent of components are sourced externally.
'Talk about clusters is very much overblown,' said Dr Sadler.
'Japanese car assemblers are sourcing from across Europe. Only a few
low-value-added or very specialist components are clustered close to the
plants.'
He said European production capacity by Japanese investors would increase
sharply by the mid 1990s, and that European companies would have to respond
to their requirements over the next two or three years or face competition
from component suppliers from Japan and eastern Europe.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Sprint makes the running in challenging telecoms policy: A
company that hopes to provide domestic and international services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS MONTH'S application by Sprint, the US telecommunication carrier, for a
licence to provide telecommunication services in the UK is a challenge to
British government policy.
The question is whether an era of cheap and competitive transatlantic
communications is about to dawn - or whether cartel practices will continue.
Since the government abolished the British Telecom/Mercury Communications
duopoly last year Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, has
been claiming that the UK telecommunications market is the most liberal in
the world.
In theory, it is open to competition. But in practice, an exception has been
made for international communications.
Last year's white paper said: 'While the duopoly policy in respect of new
international operators should be ended, (the government) is unlikely to
grant new international operating licences in the short term.'
Sprint's application tests this policy because it has asked to be allowed to
provide domestic and international services.
Mr Vincent Gargaro, a director of Sprint International UK, argues that
customers are not interested in buying long-distance domestic services from
one company if they have to use another operator for international calls.
Sprint is already the third-largest long-distance operator in the US. It
aims to become the third operator in the long-distance market from the UK
and wants to link its networks in the two countries.
The government is wary about competition for international calls. Prices
have been kept artificially high by cartel practices, but while it might be
thought that a government committed to free-market principles would want to
encourage competitors to drive prices down, it is more afraid that foreign
monopolists might take advantage of an open market without home companies
having reciprocal access abroad.
It is not only concerned about the loss to the UK of lucrative earnings  -
BT made Pounds 121m in operating profits on calls between the US and the UK
alone in 1987-88. It also fears the practice of a foreign monopolist playing
off one UK operator against another to get the best deal for calls between
the two countries.
BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, have persuaded the
government that such concerns apply not only to monopolies from other
countries, but even to companies from the US, where there is much
competition. They point out that US regulations automatically place a
heavier regulatory burden on non-US companies.
Such regulatory considerations held up C&amp;W's planned Dollars 174m
acquisition of TRT/FTC, the fourth-largest US long-distance operator, last
year. But, contrary to appearances, C&amp;W eventually pulled out of the deal
for commercial rather than regulatory reasons.
Moreover, last month the Federal Communications Commission, the US
regulatory body, proposed relaxing the regulatory burden on foreign
companies. Sprint believes that the UK should therefore agree to its licence
application and is keeping the FCC informed.
The DTI's decision will not only affect Sprint. It will set a precedent for
the whole industry. Telecommunication operators are in the process of
restructuring themselves from national monopolies into globally competitive
groups, with the Atlantic route one of the main battlegrounds.
AT&amp;T, the largest US carrier, has shown an interest in the UK market.
Meanwhile, BT has been trying to establish a global network via its US-based
Syncordia subsidiary.
New types of competitor are emerging. Resellers such as US-based World
Communications are buying up cable capacity in bulk and selling it on to
customers at a discount. Private satellite groups such as Pan American
Satellite and Orion are preparing competitive offerings.

Japanese claims questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE INVESTORS in north-east England are not as innovative as has been
assumed, two academics from Newcastle Polytechnic told the conference
yesterday.
Dr Frank Peck and Dr Ian Stone said that, while Japanese companies claimed
to have a very high incidence of modern management techniques, detailed
analysis showed that their actual practices were often markedly less
sophisticated.
Linguistic confusion and a desire to appear at the forefront of modern
production techniques meant that questions to Japanese companies were often
misunderstood or the answers exaggerated, they said.
For example, 69 per cent of all inward investors said that they had
'single-status' plants with no distinction between managers and shopfloor
workers, 49 per cent said they had workers' consultative committees, 39 per
cent 'just-in-time' production and 71 per cent team-working. For Japanese
investors, those figures were 100 per cent, 77 per cent, 62 per cent and 100
per cent respectively.
In each case, detailed interviews revealed that the techniques as generally
understood were often not applied, or they were not implemented in vital
production areas.
The survey covered 84 of the 106 inward investors of the past decade in
north-eastern manufacturing plants with more than 20 employees.

FT  08 JAN 92 / NSK extends plant shutdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHRISTMAS and new year shutdown has been extended by the European
subsidiary of NSK, the Japanese bearings manufacturer, at its plant in
Peterlee, County Durham, until Monday because of the effect of the
recession.
The 800 employees at NSK Bearings Europe's plant in Peterlee should have
resumed work on January 2, but NSK decided to postpone reopening in order to
cut stock levels.
The shutdown, the first serious UK setback for NSK in the 15 years since it
set up at Peterlee, is a response to a fall estimated at 20 per cent in
European demand for bearings in the past year.
The bearings plant, which exports 80 per cent of its output to continental
Europe, has been particularly affected by the economic slowdown in Germany,
its biggest market.
The company was yesterday reluctant to discuss the possibility of short-time
working or redundancies but Mr Bill Constance, deputy managing director for
NSK in Europe, said: 'If the current recession continues, we would have to
consider very seriously further measures to those we have already taken.'
NSK, Japan's largest bearings manufacturer - and the second biggest
worldwide after SKF of Sweden - has invested Pounds 100m at Peterlee, where
its success helped persuade Nissan to select the north-east for a car plant.
NSK's automotive components division, which employs 50 workers at Peterlee,
is not affected by the shutdown. Overtime working at the bearings plant was
ended last year in an attempt to cut costs.
Mr Constance said NSK had anticipated some improvement in market demand
early this year, but it was now clear this would not occur in the first
quarter.
Komatsu, the Japanese earth-moving equipment manufacturer, also extended the
new-year closure at its sole European production plant. Its 400 employees at
Birtley, Tyne and Wear, returned to work on Monday instead of January 2.
Last year Komatsu shed 30 jobs at Birtley, and yesterday Mr Clive Morton,
personnel director, said the plant's workload would be lower this year than
last. Komatsu has not yet decided how it will cope with lower production
volumes this year.
Mr Constance said that, contrary to popular belief, Japanese companies were
not recession-proof.
The recession has also slowed expansion plans at Fujitsu's new Pounds 200m
semiconductor plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.
Negotiations to bring a Japanese engineering business to Darlington were
halted last year because the Japanese company involved decided the recession
would last until next year.

Reluctance over Sunday work seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 75 per cent of women shopworkers would be unhappy if they were
required to work on Sundays, and 42 per cent would try to change their job,
according to a study of the effects of Sunday trading.
For more than 70 per cent of a sample of 483 retail employees, Sunday is the
only day of the week when their partner is not working, Professor David
Kirby of the Durham University Business School told the conference.
The workers questioned were employed by six retail companies with outlets
around the country. Most said they objected to the effects on their family
of working weekends.
More than half said they would want to be paid double-time to to work over
the weekend. Most women retail workers would prefer to work later on weekday
evenings or Saturdays rather than Sundays.
However, most of the workers did not have formal qualifications, and would
find it difficult to find alternative employment, the study found. Few were
members of unions, and most could not afford to become unemployed. As a
result, 'they are vulnerable to the market place', Prof Kirby said.
He said the 1950 Shops Act, which restricts Sunday trading, was introduced
mainly to protect employees from working unsociable hours, and recommended
that any changes to the law should cover these pressures.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Fullemploy training group collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULLEMPLOY, Britain's only national training organisation for ethnic
minorities, has gone into liquidation after a long struggle for additional
funds. Buchler Phillips, the financial consultants, have been appointed
liquidators and will hold meetings with creditors in the next fortnight.
The collapse which will embarrass the government, was caused mainly by a
decision by the Home Office last year to withhold its Pounds 250,000 annual
grant following an investigation by the Charity Commissioners into
unsuccessful Fullemploy expansion schemes.
Ethnic-minority unemployment remains higher than in the majority community,
and the charity's efforts to tackle the problem have been supported by many
leading organisations in the private and public sectors.
Mr David Buchler, a partner in Buchler Phillips, said last night that
Fullemploy would continue in business to allow time for talks with potential
purchasers. Grand Metropolitan Community Services Trust has offered to
indemnify him against trading losses during the next few weeks.
A total of Pounds 446,000 has been raised recently from the private sector
through cash, loans written off and new guarantees.
This came from a group of leading companies and organisations including the
Bank of England, BP, International Business Machines, Prudential, Marks and
Spencer, Commercial Union, Boots, Lloyds Bank, WH Smith and Rosehaugh. These
funds will now be returned.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): End to 'military' management urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD-STYLE military manage-ment needs to be replaced by a more 'feminine'
approach, Dr Beverly Alimo-Metcalfe, a senior psychology lecturer at Leeds
University, claimed at a British Psychological Society conference yesterday.
She said at the society's occupational psychology conference in Liverpool
that 'feminine' styles, which companies will need to adopt in order to
survive, remain discriminated against by job-selection procedures.
She added that many companies accepted that they would have to abandon
'military' organisation. 'Heroic', invariably male, company leadership would
need to be replaced by female management styles, she explained. There was,
however, evidence that selection procedures still reflected old values. For
example, women were discriminated against in group discussions which formed
part of interviews, as men dominated conversations.
Research by two other psychologists presented at the conference suggested
that women were not prepared to adopt what were seen as male patterns of
behaviour in order to win promotion.
According to Dr Catherine Cassell from Sheffield Polytechnic and Dr Susan
Walsh from Sheffield University, women were often forced into 'managing
their femaleness' to survive at work.
That meant they had to 'mother' and 'nurture' male colleagues, massage egos,
or use their sexuality by flirting with or by flattering the men around
them.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Colleges fail to claim tax relief for
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of financially troubled colleges of further education and private
providers of training are failing to register for tax relief worth more than
Pounds 20m in 1992-93.
Tax relief was announced in the last Budget on courses leading to National
Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) up to level 4 - the vocational equivalent
of a degree.
Individual trainees, according to new guidelines, would pay reduced fees
from which basic-rate tax has been deducted. But providers of training can
claim tax relief only if they register with the Inland Revenue before April
6.
The Department of Employment said yesterday that only 430 of the 7,000
providers of training who were eligible for relief had claimed it. They
included colleges of further education and private providers of training.
An estimated 250,000 people pay to study for NVQs. The government's
objective in announcing the tax relief was to encourage more people to
invest in their own training and self-development.
It estimated the cost of the tax relief at Pounds 20m in 1992-93, rising to
Pounds 40m in the mid-1990s when all NVQs are avail-able.
The Inland Revenue said it was arranging a series of seminars to explain to
trainers how the tax relief would work. These will run during February and
March.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU signals move towards white-collar
recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECRUITMENT battle for white-collar staff and technicians in the
engineering industry could erupt if the merger between the AEU engineering
union and the EETPU electricians' union goes ahead later this year.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said yesterday that the EETPU had a
'viable, successful white-collar section'. The AEU has not traditionally
recruited in the white-collar area which is dominated by the MSF general
technical union.
The merger is likely to form the basis of an AEU attempt to win recognition
rights in the white-collar area from the Engineering Employers' Federation.
The merger proposals are going to a ballot of the members of both unions
between February 17 and March 2. The result is expected on March 4.
Mr Laird also said yesterday that single-union deals between employers and
either the AEU or the EETPU will not be nullified by the merger.
'The single-union deals will remain exactly as they are, but if they need to
be renegotiated it will be with the merged union,' said Mr Laird.
Initially the two unions will remain quasi-autonomous sections, with their
own rule books. The biggest obstacle to a fuller merger is the fact that the
AEU elects officials while the EETPU appoints them. In the longer term, the
EETPU rules are likely to prevail. AEU elections for officials have recently
attracted turn outs of less than 20 per cent.
The AEU yesterday published the results of a poll of members' attitudes to
the merger. Of 3,000 members polled at random, 24 per cent responded. Those
who said they would vote for a merger made up 49 per cent, with only 12 per
cent saying they would vote against and 39 per cent undecided.
Nearly 60 per cent of respondents said they expected to be worse off this
year compared with last year.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Reluctant spenders hindering recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A FALL in personal disposable income
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and continued reluctance by consumers to spend rather than save - hindered
the recovery of consumer demand in the second half of last year, Central
Statistical Office figures showed yesterday.
Real personal disposable income fell by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter
compared with the second and by 0.6 per cent compared with the third quarter
of 1990.
The savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total
personal disposable income, dropped only marginally - from 11.2 per cent in
the second quarter to 10.9 per cent in the third.
The state of company finances provided no sign of relief for the economy,
with seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO revealing a financial deficit
of Pounds 2.5bn in the third quarter compared with Pounds 1.4bn in the
second.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities, said that in spite of
the latest increase the corporate sector's financial deficit would probably
continue to shrink - the trend in previous quarters - as companies ran down
stocks rather than invested.
Gross trading profits of the UK corporate sector, net of stock appreciation,
stayed at about Pounds 17.9bn, similar to the second quarter. The figure was
maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits. Those
increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter from Pounds
1.2bn in the second, thanks mainly to increased crude oil sales.
Non-North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits fell between the second
and third quarters from Pounds 16.7bn to Pounds 16.3bn.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in
London, said the higher savings trend in the personal and company sectors
would continue to hinder recovery.
The higher company deficits, acting as an encouragement to cut investment,
were also likely to hinder growth.
'The financial position of the corporate sector is sufficiently weak that
the emphasis is still going to be on saving, and hence on retrenching rather
than investing,' said Mr Saunders.

<TEXT>
MANY BRITONS are feckless managers of their personal finances and do not
bother to keep track of the amount of money in their bank accounts,
according to Mercantile Credit, the personal-loan company owned by Barclays
Bank.
A survey commissioned by Mercantile Credit indicates that 51 per cent of
adults do not keep track of their bank balances and that 29 per cent admit
to spending money regardless of whether they have enough in their accounts.
'Despite the financial problems caused by the recession, many people are
still failing to gather the information needed to control their finances
properly,' Ms Olivia Rossiter, communications manager of Mercantile Credit,
said yesterday.
The survey suggests that only 49 per cent of Scots always budget carefully
against 67 per cent in the east Midlands.
Southerners have the most easy-going attitude, with only 46 per cent always
knowing how much money is in their bank accounts.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Carmakers hope for a late visit from Santa: How falls in
profits and a collapse in sales made last year one the industry would rather
forget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMILIATING falls into loss and a collapse of new car sales turned last year
into one the motor industry would much rather forget.
Total new car sales plunged 20.74 per cent to 1,592,326, the lowest level
for nine years, and nearly one third down on the record 2.3m recorded only
two years previously.
Manufacturers' profits tumbled - Ford and Rover in particular suffered
substantial losses. Ford has already warned that the losses will be 'far
worse' than its 1990 pre-tax deficit of Pounds 274m.
For dealers and distributors, there was a rapidly increasing list of
receiverships and bankruptcies as a vicious re-run of the discounting wars
in the early 1980s took its toll. According to the Retail Motor Industry
Federation, by the middle of this year more than 800 franchised dealers -
more than 10 per cent of the total - will have been forced out of business
in 24 months.
There was a grim rash of job losses in all areas of the industry. The
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, whose statistics yesterday
described the miseries of last year's market in fine detail, predicts that
40,000 jobs will have gone in the year to mid-1992, adding to 25,000 already
lost since mid-1990.
The misery is not over yet. In the UK, few industry chiefs see many signs of
the revival in business confidence they say is essential to kickstart the
industry back to life.
A consensus figure for sales this year is about 1.75m, assuming - as many in
the industry do - that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will not belatedly
adopt the guise of Santa Claus in his Budget and abolish special car tax and
give other reliefs the industry has long sent pleading letters for to the
Treasury grotto.
Some production lines in the UK were kept busy by Germany and some other
continental markets, with output falling only 3.9 per cent to 1.58m in the
first 11 months of the year. Those lines are now also coming off the boil.
Worsening the uncertainty is the imminent arrival of a report by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission on allegedly high car prices in the UK,
and whether the existing system of exclusively franchised dealers works
against consumers' interests. A 'thumbs down' from the commission would add
substantially to the woes in the industry.
Yet some crumbs of comfort could be found among yesterday's statistics for
at least some of the industry.
The December market was down, but the fall of 7.26 per cent was less severe
than in previous months. In all, 58,274 cars were registered in December,
although not necessarily sold. Manufacturers will register cars without
having sold them to real buyers if their market share looks particularly
bad.
In the second half of the year, sales were more than 16 per cent below the
corresponding period a year before, compared with nearly 29 per cent in the
second quarter.
Imports were held back, although only marginally. The importers' market
share fell to 55.67 per cent for the year as a whole, compared with 56.74
per cent in 1990. It was only a token but, for the first time in years, the
UK share of the market tipped over 50 per cent  - knocking imports down to
49.69 per cent - in December.
Last night the SMMT was nursing a faint hope that the industry's balance of
trade performance might have earned it some brownie points in Whitehall.
After nearly a decade of increasing deficits, reaching Pounds 6.5bn in 1989,
the deficit fell to Pounds 1.5bn last year.
While much of the reduction is simply the result of the fall in the UK
market, Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive and departing Tory MP for
Bromsgrove, was nevertheless able to point out yesterday that 'we are still
the country's leading exporter'.
Fortunes varies for individual manufacturers. Ford, the UK market leader for
well over a decade, continued to suffer. Its market share last year fell to
24.24 per cent, down more than one percentage point on 1990 and a far cry
from the 30 per cent share it took for granted in the late 1980s.
Mr Ian McAllister, who took over as Ford of Britain's chairman on January 1,
insists that this year the rot will be reversed. Part of the reason for the
fall, he says, has been the absence of performance models such as the XR3i
version of the Escort, which has been delayed by the late arrival of new
engines. Such cars have accounted in the past for one percentage point of
Ford's market share and will do so again, he says. He also promises a new
model launch every six months over the next 2 1/2 years.
Vauxhall, in spite of expecting to remain profitable this year, could also
be counted among the year's losers in that its market share fell slightly
last year after several years of gains.
In sales terms at least, among the UK-based manufacturers both Peugeot
Talbot and Rover could count themselves as winners, with Peugeot in
particular winning an increased share of the market. Its prospects should be
further enhanced next year when a second model joins production of the
Peugeot 405 at its Ryton plant near Coventry.
Nissan, operating its own distribution system in the UK from January 1 after
its split with Mr Octav Botnar's Nissan UK, suffered badly from the fall-out
from the row. Its market share fell to just over 4 per cent - only half of
its share in the late 1980s.
Among the volume importers, the Fiat group's suffering continued, with the
combined share of Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia sinking to just under 2.5 per
cent. Were it not for Alfa's 164 flagship, still selling well and helping
Alfa to increase its own share last year, the group's figures would look
worse. Fiat is committing Pounds 100m to its UK operations in an effort to
reverse the decline.
As expected, the UK's specialist and luxury carmakers were shown to have
suffered most. Rolls-Royce and Jaguar sales were virtually halved. And
proving that the disease is not confined to UK luxury carmakers, Porsche's
sales were down by 42 per cent to 1,612.
The year's winners among importers and specialist producers, measured by an
increase in market share rather than unit sales, included BMW, which reaped
the benefit of its new 3-series model, and Lotus, which missed increasing
unit sales by a mere eight cars.
The feature of yesterday's statistics which must give the European industry
most pause for thought relates to Far Eastern producers. Every Japanese
manufacturer, with the exception of Nissan, increased its market share.
Apart from a handful of new imports from South Africa, every company which
increased both market share and unit sales was from Japan, Korea or
Malaysia. The winners were Daihatsu, Hyundai, Isuzu, Kia, Suzuki and Proton.
No European producer figured in that category.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Yarrow chairman warns on future of warship builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST one of the UK's four warship builders will be forced out of
business, Sir Robert Easton, chairman of Yarrow Shipbuilders, the Clydeside
yard, predicted yesterday.
Yarrow, part of the GEC group, is competing against the Tyneside yard Swan
Hunter, Cumbria-based VSEL and the Southampton yard Vosper Thornycroft to
build a batch of up to three Type 23 anti-submarine frigates for the Royal
Navy.
Lobbying for the order has intensified, with a decision expected next month
or in March ahead of the general election. Of the 10 Type 23 orders placed
so far, six have been won by Yarrow and the rest by Swan Hunter.
Orders in prospect would not be sufficient to sustain all four yards, Sir
Robert said in London.
'I believe that there are too many shipyards and that they won't all
survive,' he said. 'There are clear indications that three yards might
survive at a certain level, but two yards would be able to pick up what is
available in the UK.'
No other company would challenge VSEL's position as sole UK builder of
nuclear-powered submarines, Sir Robert said, because of the high
infrastructure costs involved and the lack of export opportunities. But the
same did not apply to Vosper Thornycroft's niche in mine warfare vessels
made of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).
Royal Navy plans for more GRP minehunters were shelved last year. But
Yarrow, which has an idle GRP facility, would compete 'very severely' for
the contract when it was revived, Sir Robert said.
He said that Yarrow alone would be capable of fulfilling the UK's entire
surface-ship programme, but did not expect the government to favour a
monopoly.
To spread the forthcoming Type 23 frigate order between different yards
would be 'a nonsense', Sir Robert said. Yards needed sufficient production
volume to achieve economies of scale.
Yarrow is expected to conclude a Malaysian order for two corvettes worth
about Pounds 150m within the next three months, filling an export vacuum.
Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, was 'perhaps rather premature' in
announcing an imminent deal in September, Sir Robert said. However, problems
over the choice of combat system for the vessels had now been 'more or less
resolved'.

LONDON has the fastest rising unemployment in Europe, according to figures
from the European Commission released by the Labour-dominated Association of
London Authorities.
The commission found that unemployment remained higher in many European
regions in Spain, Italy and the Ireland, but was not rising anywhere as fast
as in Greater London. It rose by more than 25 per cent between April 1990
and April 1991.
The association said the large number of redundancies in the finance sector
had raised unemployment from 6.9 per cent to 10.4 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Thomson cuts prices on 300,000 holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON, Britain's biggest holiday company, yesterday announced discounts
totalling Pounds 15m, Michael Skapinker writes.
Its decision to cut the prices of more than 300,000 holidays by an average
of Pounds 50 was a response to aggressive pricing by Airtours and Owners
Abroad, which are competing for second place in the holiday market. Owners
Abroad announced price cuts last month and said it would offer free
children's places on some holidays.
Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson managing director, said the cuts applied to one
in eight of the company's holidays. He added: 'The other two didn't allow
for the possibility that their little scrap would draw Thomson in, but I'm
not going to stand aside and let our business be carved up by them.'
The move was not yet the beginning of an all-out price war, but he warned
that if Owners Abroad and Airtours responded with further reductions his
company would react in similar fashion.
Mr George Marcall, Airtours sales director, said the Thomson move could be
good for the industry. 'I believe it will stimulate the public to go out and
buy holidays.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Scots may elect for a German influence: A growing Labour
interest in the proportional-representation option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPORTIONAL representation based on the German model is emerging as
favourite to be chosen by Labour as the basis for electing candidates to its
proposed Scottish parliament.
Such a move would not be binding on the party nationally, but would have a
strong influence on its debate on electoral reform. It would also set a
precedent for abandoning the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's constitutional spokesman, said a consensus was
developing among Scottish members in favour of an 'additional member' system
to elect assembly members.
Under this format, voters cast two votes - one for an individual
constituency candidate, as at present, and another for a party.
Labour is committed to establishing a directly elected Scottish assembly
with significant legislative and tax-raising powers 'at the earliest
possible moment'.
The preferred approach would be similar to the system that has been used in
Germany since 1948, although Mr Darling stresses that the intention is not
to import it 'in pure form'.
Labour would want to adapt it in order to meet Scotland's circumstances, he
said.
In Germany, half the parliamentary seats are filled with the
first-past-the-post winners, while the other half are allocated from party
lists, reflecting voters' party preferences.
Mr Darling said that Labour would not necessarily stick to this 50:50 ratio.
The party is veering towards the additional-member approach - and away from
the alternative-vote model which has also been considered - as it would
maintain a constituency link, Mr Darling said.
Mr Darling said Labour has 'no plans' to address what it regards as the
separate issue of Scottish representation at Westminster if the proposed
assembly is created.
As Scotland is already among the parts of the UK which are numerically
over-represented in the Commons, this appears to leave its plans vulnerable
to attack on the grounds that they would pamper an area accounting for an
important slice of the party's Westminster representation.
Labour has promised that it would grant the assembly power to adjust
expenditure levels by varying Scottish income-tax rates.
The body's other responsibilities would include the electricity industry,
the Scottish Development Agency, industrial training and the operation of
regional development policies.
The party's commission on electoral systems is due to present its
recommendations to the national executive committee at the end of this
month.
LABOUR'S CHANCES of election victory will be damaged by a fall in electoral
registration in marginal seats, according to a survey of last year's
registers by the independent Electoral Reform Society. 'The short-term
effect will be to steepen the electoral mountain facing Labour at the next
general election,' it said.
The sharpest declines were in London, with falls of more than 4,500 since
1987 in each of five constituencies. Many people are believed not to have
registered in order to avoid the community charge.
The biggest fall, at nearly 10,000, was in Putney where Mr David Mellor,
chief secretary to the Treasury, holds the seat with a majority of 6,436.
Sharp drops were also recorded in four other Tory-held London seats: Hornsey
and Wood Green (majority 1,779), Kensington (4,447), Hampstead and Highgate
(2,221) and Streatham (2,407).
The society predicted that this year's electoral register - to be released
on February 15 - would reveal a further fall.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Major hits out at pessimism over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT PESSIMISM about the economy has been 'overdone', Mr John Major, the
prime minister, said last night.
'If you listen to some of the dismal Johnnies you might never realise what
has been achieved in the last year,' he told an audience of businessmen in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
There were many encouraging developments in the economy. He pointed to the
fall in inflation, the reduction in the interest rate differential against
the D-Mark, and the slowdown in the trend rate of increase in unemployment.
Mr Major also highlighted the fact that people with annually adjusted
mortgages would only now be seeing the benefit of the cuts in interest rates
over the past year.
Expressing confidence about the UK's prospects for the 1990s, he warned that
this depended on people ignoring 'siren voices offering quack remedies' of
higher taxation and re-regulation. There was no 'magic moment, no precise
point when recession lies clearly in the past, while recovery stretches out
into a better future'.
Mr Major said economic data would show irregular patterns while the
recession was ending and the recovery beginning. He emphasised that
government could not and should not try to fine-tune the economy in response
to the latest economic statistics.
He acknowledged that the UK economy had not performed as well as had been
hoped in the last year, and attributed this to difficulties in the world
economy.
Rejecting the accusation that the government had no industrial strategy, Mr
Major said that its policies of privatisation, cutting taxes, freeing up the
labour market and above all combating inflation, were based on creating the
right framework for business. 'Our job is to provide a stable and
predictable economic framework, with responsible monetary and budgetary
policies, so that business and individuals can have the confidence to take
the right decisions.'
He contrasted this with Labour's policies of setting up a national
investment bank, introducing a minimum wage and bringing in a payroll tax to
finance a statutory training programme.
Mr Major countered Labour's charge that the government's refusal to sign up
to the social chapter at the EC summit in Maastricht was because they did
not want British workers to benefit from higher working standards.
The government had taken the stance because it believed such matters should
be settled between management and employees.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Collor calls Congress session on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor de Mello has called an emergency session
of the Brazilian Congress to discuss how to fund a 147 per cent increase in
pensions granted by the Supreme Court on Monday.
The ruling followed a two-month legal battle and came as a blow to the
government which had argued that the state pension fund was bankrupt and
that the Treasury did not have the necessary funds for the increase.
An economy ministry official said yesterday that the extra Dollars 6bn that
the government had now to pay out this year would wipe out the increases in
revenue it was expecting as a result of its recent tax reform and thus
jeopardise its planned fiscal adjustment currently under the scrutiny of the
International Monetary Fund.
Brazil is hoping for the approval of a Dollars 2bn loan from the IMF later
this month.
Mr Collor went on national television last night to announce his decision to
hold an emergency session of congress after spending the day locked in
meetings with senior economy ministry officials.
He warned that the pension increases threatened the government's battle
against inflation, currently running at 24 per cent a month.
'Any householder knows he cannot spend more than he earns,' he said. 'The
147 per cent rise means a brutal increase in our expenses for which we do
not have the money at a time when we are trying to cut costs to balance our
budget. We will not meet demands by printing more money.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Salinas to merge ministries in cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has replaced his education
minister, Mr Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who resigned on Monday night, with the
budget minister, Mr Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, writes Damian Fraser.
He also announced plans to merge the budget and finance ministries to
'strengthen fiscal and financial policy' and consolidate economic recovery.
Mr Zedillo, a 40-year-old Yale-educated economist, earned a reputation as a
tough, orthodox, penny-pinching budget minister, and won wide acclaim for
organising a programme to eradicate extreme poverty during his three-year
stay in the ministry.
He is a close ally of Mr Salinas's powerful chief of staff, Mr Jose Cordoba,
and his new post suggests that the long-heralded reforms of the education
system may soon be launched.
Mr Zedillo will not be replaced as budget minister, and instead his
department will become part of the Finance Ministry, as was the case in the
1970s. This gives Mr Pedro Aspe, the charismatic finance minister,
undisputed leadership over the handling of Mexico's economy.
Mr Aspe must now be considered one of the leading contenders to succeed Mr
Salinas in 1994, along with Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City.
Mr Bartlett, an old-style Mexican politician, unlike Mr Zedillo and Mr Aspe,
is likely to bow out of federal politics, and may well become the governor
of the state of Puebla later in the year.
Mr Bartlett had been interior minister in the previous administration, and
oversaw the fraud-tainted 1988 elections that brought Mr Salinas to power.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Hasty measures fail to lift Mexican smog: How political
costs are still outweighing environmental incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLY into Mexico City in the next few months and you will notice a thick
cloud of yellow smog over the city. Talk to the city's residents and you
will hear endless complaints of sore eyes, breathing difficulties, and
ill-health.
In 1991 the levels of ozone (a secondary pollutant formed when nitrogen
oxide and hydrocarbons mix in sunlight) reached record highs, and exceeded
approved international standards for 290 days of the year. The next few
months - the peak smog season - are likely to be worse. In the past two
years, winter levels of ozone have risen by 14 per cent and 8.4 per cent
respectively. Other pollutants, which receive less attention are as, if not
more, dangerous. The amount of particulate matter - including faecal dust -
floating in Mexico City's air, which cause breathing problems and higher
mortality rates, is over twice the legislated standard.
Mexico City has come to be known as the pollution capital of the world. Home
to 15m to 20m people, almost 3m cars, and 36,000 factories, Mexico City
emits 12,000 tonnes of pollutants a day. In winter months much of the
pollution is trapped by clouds of cold air that hang over the city.
The deteriorating air quality, has forced the government to take a series of
drastic measures. The Environmental Ministry, along with other government
departments, has prevented use of the city's 2.8m cars and trucks on one
working day each week; closed down the giant March 18 oil refinery; ordered
the replacement of 60,000 taxis and minibuses with models fitted with
catalytic converters; shut down scores of factories that fail to comply with
tough emissions standards; invested hundreds of millions of dollars in
improving public transport, the quality of gasoline, and planting trees; and
in November raised leaded gasoline prices by 55 per cent.
The total cost of Mexico City's anti-pollution programme is now put at
Dollars 4.6bn although much of that used for better public transport would
have been spent anyway.
While the measures taken have stopped the increase of some pollutants
(noticeably lead), the programme, say many environmentalists and economists,
has not beening particularly well thought out.
One problem is that with a number of different ministries responsible for
the city's environment - including the departments of health, environment,
transport, education, the Mexico City and State of Mexico governments - that
implementation of the measures has been delayed by bureaucratic in-fighting.
More important, the government has neither established the impact of
different pollutants on the health of Mexico's City's residents, nor
estimated the economic cost of reducing the levels of these pollutants.
The Mexican government has thus still yet to conclude a large
epidemiological study on the health of Mexico City residents, compared to
say the health of residents of another large city less polluted. There is no
centralised pool of data on hospital admissions that lets researchers look
at how illnesses correlate with pollution levels. Nor has any attempt been
made (publicly at least) to calculate the economic cost of different
pollutants.
One 'back-of-the-envelope' attempt to do this by the World Bank, puts total
air pollution costs in Mexico City at Dollars 1.1bn a year. By far the most
costly pollutant in terms of reducing life expectancy, increasing medical
costs, and lost work days were fine particulates of faecal and other dust
that permeate Mexico's air.
The suspended particulates are most common in north-east Mexico City, and
are caused by the heavy concentration of industry in this part of the city,
coupled with the ecological destruction of nearby lakes and trees. A simple
measure that would reduce this problem - charging industries in Mexico City
with much higher tax rates - has not been taken.
The government has only a handful of stations measuring particulate matter
against dozens measuring ozone - much too few in the opinion of Mr Luis
Manuel Guerra, director of the Autonomous Institute of Ecological Research.
The measures the government has already taken have often failed to achieve
their goals. The 'day without a car' programme, which was rushed into law,
failed to halt the increase in petrol consumption, in part because many
Mexicans bought second cars to circumvent the restriction. This year petrol
consumption has risen by about 7 per cent.
The government has shied away from using market-based schemes to reduce
pollution, which evidence from the US suggests would reduce the cost of
cutting a given amount of pollution.
Mr Fernando Menendez, Mexico City's head of environmental planning, says
that a pollution tax on companies would be too difficult. In any case, he
says, 'what I don't want is that someone pays me to pollute. That looks to
me as criminal'.
However, the government could tax the fuels (or their carbon content) used
by Mexico City-based industries. This could be a useful proxy for taxing
pollution.
Other market-based measures have been rejected in part because the political
costs seem to be too high.
The Mexican government may be afraid that tough measures would dampen
economic growth, and threaten the ruling party's political hold over the
city. But until the cost of driving a car, or operating a factory reflects
the environmental damage of the activity, Mexico's pollution problem will
only get worse.

<TEXT>
THE Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday that following a final
round of consultations with its Arab allies it would give the go-ahead for
the resumption of Middle East peace talks in Washington later this week.
The Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon had suspended their departure
for Washington in protest at Israel's decision to expel 12 Palestinians from
the occupied territories, an action that was unanimously condemned by the UN
Security Council on Monday night. The other Arab delegations said last night
they would leave for Washington in two days. Israel's delegation has been in
Washington since Monday.
'The Security Council has saved the peace process, and we can only express
our appreciation of its efforts and those of all the countries which
contributed (to the decision),' Mr Ahmed Abderrahman, the PLO spokesman,
said in Tunis.
The UN resolution condemning Israel's plans to expel 12 Palestinians drew
harsh criticism in Jerusalem. Israel said it was set to go ahead with the
expulsion plans, despite the worldwide condemnation. Mr Moshe Arens, the
defence minister, had announced the expulsions last week following the
murder of a Jewish settler in the occupied territories, the fourth to be
killed there since Middle East peace talks opened in Madrid in October.
'We are very disappointed by the unjust and one-sided decision of the
Security Council. It ignores completely the acts of murder against Israeli
citizens,' said Mr Ehud Gol, spokesman to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime
minister.
The UN security council resolution, which received full US backing, was
passed by a vote of 15-0.
The 12 Palestinians ordered expelled by Israel - most of them relatively
unknown - are suspected of activism in Palestinian nationalist
organisations. Israel has expelled 66 Arabs since the start of the
Palestinian uprising in 1987.
Mr Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labour party, hinted yesterday
that the timing of the move had been inappropriate. 'They should have
considered very carefully whether the expulsions were appropriate at this
time and whether they would in fact achieve their aims,' he said.
Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian and wounded 20 in Gaza yesterday in a
clash with hundreds of youngsters protesting at Israel's decision to expel
the 12 Palestinian activists, Palestinian sources said, Reuter writes from
Jerusalem.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Chrysler chief accuses Japan of stifling car imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, yesterday accused the Japanese of
being 'out of step with the rest of the world'.
Mr Iacocca, General Motors chairman Mr Robert Stempel, and Ford chairman Mr
Harold Poling are accompanying President Bush on his visit to Japan. Today
the chiefs of the big three US carmakers join talks with Japanese government
and business leaders on moves to reduce Tokyo's huge trade surplus.
The Chrysler chairman said that since 1985 Chrysler had sold 100,000 cars in
Europe but only 1,000 in Japan. 'There is something wrong with the system.
We're here to try to change some basic (Japanese) policies that would make
it easier for American cars to go into Japanese dealer showrooms.'
He blamed the Japanese for contributing to last year's Dollars 41bn (Pounds
22.5bn) US trade deficit with Japan, 75 per cent of which was in cars and
car parts.
Meanwhile, Ford, the second largest US car maker, announced that it is to
export Ford-badged right-hand drive vehicles to Japan and the UK, the
world's biggest right-hand-drive car markets, for the first time since the
early 1900s.
It said yesterday that a right-hand-drive version of the new generation Ford
Probe, a sporty coupe due for launch in the US in mid-1992, would be built
in the US for export from autumn 1993.
Ironically, the Ford Probe is built at the Michigan assembly plant of Mazda,
Ford's Japanese affiliate in which it holds a 25 per cent stake.
The Probe is a Ford-derived version of the Mazda MX-6 coupe.
Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's automotive operations, said that the
right-hand-drive version of the Probe would be 'merely the beginning of a
series of vehicles built in America that will be exportable to
right-hand-drive markets.'
Historically Ford and other US car makers have chosen to manufacture
vehicles locally around the world, but Mr Gilmour said that the convergence
of product concepts and technologies meant that Ford was planning to produce
in the US a 'greater variety of right-hand-drive products for Japan and the
UK.'
The introduction of the Ford Probe to the UK will be welcomed by Ford's
hard-pressed British dealers, which are suffering in part from the lack of a
sporty coupe in their range to rival the successful Vauxhall Calibra. Ford
has lacked a coupe in Europe since it stopped production of the Ford Capri
in 1987.
Japanese car producers last year increased further their share of US car
sales, adding to mounting US-Japanese trade frictions. Their advance came as
US new car sales fell by 12 per cent to 8.2m, the fourth decline in five
years and the lowest level since 1982.
With the recession in the US car market deepening the big three US car
makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - all suffered heavy losses.
Japanese-badged cars captured 31 per cent of the US new car market last
year, against 28 per cent a year earlier. For the first time Chrysler, the
smallest of the big three, was overtaken by Honda and Toyota.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Islamic party seeks wide powers in Algeria: Uncertainty over
economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which swept the poll in the first
round of the country's elections last month, has unveiled a 16-page
manifesto which affirms that the party would govern the schools, the army,
sexual morality and all facets of Algerian life if it takes over the
government, AP-DJ reports from Algiers.
'Islam is the ideological reference point embracing all aspects of life,'
the manifesto says. 'We will employ freedom of expression to defend the
Islamic identity.'
The front promises to extend Islamic law to the schools, family law,
associations between men and women, the police force, the army, factories
and farms. It calls for reforms of government at all levels.
The document says that the party, as government, would 'reinforce the faith
in women's morality' - a statement interpreted as meaning that women will be
kept largely at home and required to wear modest dress.
The FIS also intends to 'combat the depravities of libertines considered by
religion and confirmed by science to be at high risk' of Aids (acquired
immune deficiency syndrome).
Relations with the International Monetary Fund and other creditors will be
reviewed, and usury forbidden, the manifesto says.
Francis Ghiles adds from Algiers: The FIS has never provided a detailed
economic policy platform. A considerable uncertainty, therefore, lies over
what would happen were the party to form the next government - after the
second and final vote on January 16 - to Algeria's economic reforms,
launched three years ago to liberalise what for 30 years, had been a
tightly-controlled command economy.
Islam traditionally favours free trade, but as Mr Abdelhak Benhamouda, the
leader of Algeria's main trade union, Union Generale des Travailleurs
Algeriens, pointed out recently, Islam has never shown any interest in the
problems of industrial production.
The FIS has offered unsophisticated reactions to some of the economic
problems facing the country. Mr Abdelkader Hachani, its provisional leader,
has been dismissive of an Ecu400m (Pounds 283m) European Community loan made
three months ago in support of Algeria's economic recovery. The loan was a
key gesture of support for Algeria's central bank policy aimed at
refinancing the country's Dollars 25bn debt, but Mr Hachani said it was
'made by countries who are enemies of Islam'.
Mr Hachani has also denounced the new hydrocarbons law voted by the national
assembly last month as a 'transaction of shame'. Yet this policy, which aims
to associate foreign oil companies with research and exploration of existing
oil wells, could offer Algeria access to much-needed know-how and capital.
The FIS leader says he is not against privatisation on 'religious grounds'
but adds that he is nevertheless opposed to the privatisation of what he
describes as 'publicly-owned strategic industries'.
When Mr Abassi Madani, who was one of the two paramount leaders of the FIS
until his imprisonment in June, spoke on economic matters, he always did so
in a manner reassuring to foreigners. He appeared mindful of the economic
realities of Algeria's dependence on western banking and technology.
However, many of the present FIS leaders belong to the Djar'ara wing of the
party, which believes in an Algerian version of Islamic society and that the
country should pull itself out of its current crisis by its own efforts, a
nationalistic approach strikingly similar to the populist ideology so long
propagated by the ruling National Liberation Front.

THE Reserve Bank of Australia said last night it would act in the money

cent, Reuter reports from Sydney.
The bank also announced a cut in the official rediscount rate, the rate paid
by the Reserve Bank on treasury notes before maturity, to 8.0 per cent from
9.0 per cent.
It said the action followed a meeting of the bank board yesterday and
consultations with Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer.
'The latest reduction in official interest rates has been made against the
background of signs of continuing sluggishness in the domestic economy as
well as further indications of a lessening of inflationary pressures,' Mr
Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor said in a statement.

FT  08 JAN 92 / First fall for ten years in Japan's motor sales
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 3.9 PER CENT fall in motor vehicle sales last year in Japan, the first
decline in a decade, has highlighted the impact of slower domestic growth
and the difficulty faced by foreign manufacturers attempting to expand their
sales.
The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association (Jada) said 5.74m vehicles were
sold last year, 199,920 of them foreign (10.7 per cent down on a year
earlier). Car sales fell 6.5 per cent to 4.03m, trucks rose 3 per cent to
1.69m and buses were down 4.5 per cent at 23,796.
Apart from blaming slower economic growth, Jada said that tougher parking
legislation had restricted sales in large cities. Parking fines have been
increased sharply and potential purchasers must now provide more evidence
that they have a parking space before they can take delivery of a car.
The decline in sales has hurt the profits of leading Japanese makers, who,
in turn, have put extra pressure on their suppliers to cut costs. Motor
manufacturers are hoping that the recent decline in Japanese interest rates
will stimulate sales.
However, the December figures were not encouraging, with total vehicle sales
of 423,825, down 8.5 per cent on the same month in 1990. It was the eighth
consecutive month of decline. Car sales were down 10.9 per cent; those of
imported vehicles were 16.6 per cent lower.
Jada said, that Toyota sales fell 5.9 per cent to 2.35m vehicles, and those
of Nissan, the second largest manufacturer, fell 4.2 per cent to 1.34m
units. Strong demand for luxury models was shown in a 42 per cent increase
in sales of cars of above 2,001cc.
Construction orders received by domestic contractors last November fell 15.7
per cent from the same month in 1990, the Japan Federation of Construction
Contractors said yesterday. Orders from the private sector fell 24.3 per
cent, reflecting the the impact of an oversupply of apartments, while public
orders rose 13.4 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Farmers relieved as Bush takes heat off rice imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE farmers welcomed US President George Bush with an invitation to
visit the 'beautiful, pastoral side of Japan' and a warning that they remain
determined in the fight against the opening of the country's rice market.
In an unusual full-page newspaper advertisement, the Central Union of
Agricultural Co-operatives, which represents 5m farmers, expressed its
support for a 'new world order'. However, they insisted this new order
should not include rice imports by Japan.
Japanese farmers are relieved that the motor trade has become the most
important issue on the Bush agenda, having feared that they would be the
prime target of US criticism and that the Japanese government would be under
heavy pressure to make a concession on rice imports.
Instead, Japanese car makers have been pressed to increase purchases of
foreign parts and to remove obstacles to the sale of foreign cars in Japan,
while concern over opening the rice market has eased.
Several Japanese politicians have suggested that the rice market should be
opened, but Tokyo is now confident that the issue will be settled in the
longer-term through the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Before Mr Bush's arrival, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, proposed
that Japan examine the possibility of replacing the import ban with a tariff
regime, but gave no pledge on this politically sensitive issue.
Japanese negotiators, who want to convince the domestic audience that they
are resisting foreign pressure, intend to wait until the US and EC reach
agreement on farm trade before making a concession. This is, in part,
because farmers' groups say they will vote against the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party at an Upper House election this summer if the government
allows imports.
In spite of the farmers' threats, Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister
and an LDP faction head, has insisted that Japan introduce tariffs, but
suggests that it could effectively limit the opening to 5 per cent of the
10m-tonne market by imposing a 700 per cent tariff on imported rice.
The shift in US attention to the Japanese car industry is particularly
welcomed by the farmers' groups, which have argued that they are threatened
by imports because the aggressiveness of Japanese manufacturers has created
a huge trade surplus.
The advertisement described the 'farming regions of the US Midwest' and the
rice paddies of Japan as the 'heartland' of each country.
'We may be able to import automobiles from your country, but farmlands of
such immeasurable value just cannot be imported.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Australia backs Gatt compromise package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA's Labor government yesterday approved the compromise package
proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to bring the Uruguay Round to an end, Kevin Brown
reports from Sydney.
Mr John Kerin, Australian trade minister, said the cabinet had accepted his
recommendation that the package provided an acceptable basis for concluding
the Round.
Mr Kerin said the package fell short of the demands for liberalisation of
agricultural trade put forward by the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural
exporting nations, which is chaired by Australia. But he said it contained
'elements of a positive nature,' including provisions for an agreement on
trade in services, and protection for intellectual property rights.
The Dunkel package was designed to break a deadlock on agricultural trade
between the European Community (EC) and the US, which was broadly supported
by the Cairns Group. The Cairns group sought cuts of 90 per cent in EC
export subsidies and 75 per cent in internal support, both over 10 years.
Under the compromise package, export subsidies will fall by 36 per cent and
internal support by 20 per cent, both over six years. Also, most barriers to
trade in agricultural goods will be converted to tariffs, and most
signatories to Gatt will have to open at least 3 per cent of domestic market
sectors to imports, rising to 5 per cent after six years.
The cabinet decided to support the package in spite of disappointment over
the size of proposed reductions in EC subsidies and the smallness of
improvements in access to protected markets in the EC, the US and Japan.
Ministers said the package was the best obtainable in the face of continued
EC opposition to more significant changes to the Community's Common
Agricultural Policy. Australia and other Cairns Group members had earlier
threatened to refuse to accept a deal unless substantial progress was made
in liberalising agricultural trade.
Mr Alexander Downer, Australia's shadow trade minister, said the
conservative opposition parties would support the deal in the Senate, where
the government is in a minority. However, Mr Downer said the package would
not prevent the extension of EC and US export subsidies to new markets, and
would allow Japan to use tariffs to exclude Australian rice exports.
'The Dunkel proposals do not amount to a major breakthrough for our farmers,
although importantly, the proposals do establish for the first time ever the
mechanisms to transform international agricultural trade over the long
term,' he said.
Australia's reluctant acceptance of the Dunkel proposals follows the
government's failure to persuade the US to reduce its Export Enhancement
Programme for agricultural products.
Australian farmers claim the programme has reduced global grain prices and
forced them out of traditional markets, especially in the Middle East.
President Bush sympathised with the farmers during a visit to Australia last
week, but offered no changes to the programme.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA has asked for a dispute settlement panel to be set up under the
US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA) to adjudicate a disagreement over the
local content of Japanese cars assembled in North America, Bernard Simon
reports from Toronto.
The row follows a US Customs inquiry into the North American content of
Honda Civic cars assembled at a factory near Toronto, then exported to the
US.
The US is concerned that Honda may be violating FTA provisions requiring 50
per cent North American content to qualify for duty-free cross-border
shipment.
Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said the dispute centred on what
interest charges qualified as local content. 'Despite efforts to win a
settlement, the US contends that only interest paid with respect to a
mortgage can be included as 'territorial content' under FTA rules of origin.
Our position is that 'territorial content' includes any interest paid in
relation to land, equipment and buildings used in making goods.'
Ottawa has tended to favour more generous local content rules than the US,
in an effort to woo investment by Japanese and other foreign car makers in
Canada. The binational panels are likely to be a model for other regional
trade arrangements. About two dozen panels have been formed since the FTA
took effect three years ago.

CLOTHING exporters in Central America and the Caribbean say they will be
damaged if proposals for new rules governing the textile and clothing trade
are implemented, Canute James reports from Kingston.
The producers, which ship mainly to the US, say their industries will be
damaged if quotas are phased out over 10 years, as proposed in the current
negotiating text for the industry in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The
producers say their fears have been compounded by the conclusions of a
report prepared by the Fiber, Fabric and Apparel Coalition for Trade, a
combination of US textile and clothing groups.
'The report projects severe damage to the US industry, which would decline
by 40-60 per cent in the face of unfettered competition by Asian economies,
including China,' the producers said in letters sent to the White House and
US congressmen. This would occur by the year 2002 if quotas were phased out
over the 10-year period proposed in the text tabled by the chairman of the
negotiating group on textiles and clothing.
Much of the region's clothes trade with the US is based on bilateral
treaties where clothes are assembled and re-exported. Producers say proposed
changes could cut jobs in the US industry from 1.74m to 780,000.

LOT, Poland's state-owned airline, has sold its seven long-range IL-62s
along with 10 short-range AN-24 aircraft to Avialinie, the Ukraine's
newly-established airline, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw.
Delivery is to be completed by February.
LOT has been seeking a buyer for its IL-62s since last autumn. The Polish
airline has two Boeing 767s for its transatlantic route, another is soon to
be delivered, and the purchase of two or three more is being considered.
LOT yesterday refused to confirm that the Ukraine had agreed to pay Dollars
15m (Pounds 8.2m) for the aircraft. Last year, it signed a Dollars 300m
contract to buy nine Boeing 737s for use on its European routes. The
mid-1990s should see it with 20 aircraft, all made in the west.

SCHINDLER, the Swiss lifts and escalators group, has seen the first pay-off
from its decision three years ago to step up its presence in the Japanese
market, Ian Rodger reports from Zurich.
It has won a SFr6.6m (Pounds 2.59m) contract to supply escalators and
elevators for the new Kansai international airport near Osaka.
Schindler acquired a Japanese lifts company, Nippon Elevator, in 1988. 'It
was important to get in to the Japanese market, because the Jap-anese
companies Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi are our major competitors in
Asia-Pacific markets,' the Swiss company said.
Schindler, in a joint venture with Marubeni of Japan, was the only
non-Japanese supplier to share in the lifts deal.

the Portuguese EC presidency, he said agriculture was a 'particularly
difficult issue for Europe', but that a successful outcome to the talks
'must involve compromise.
"We are realists, we know the difficulties, but we also know the dangers for
world trade, therefore for the world economy if these negotiations are
allowed to drag on indefinitely,' he declared. He was encouraged by the
determination the Portuguese presidency was showing in keeping these matters

Round

<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday appeared to be hardening its position on
the farm subsidies row, threatening to sink the Uruguay Round world trade
talks, as EC-US bilateral talks failed to resolve the impasse.
The EC has reiterated to the US that there can be no agreement on farm trade
within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) talks unless the
direct payments to farmers for the Community's planned subsidy cuts are put
in the Gatt 'green box'.
This is for subventions allowable under Gatt rules because they do not
distort trade, and would allow Brussels to make the deep cuts in its farm
price support system through which it could meet the Uruguay Round targets
for dismantling subsidies.
When the US and EC failed to agree on farm subsidies just before Christmas,
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, surprised Brussels by writing into
the 'final act' of the Uruguay Round that the EC's compensation payments
would not qualify for the 'green box'.
'It is now in the hands of Dunkel to redraft the proposal. Nothing can
happen bilaterally (with the US) until he moves,' a Commission official said
yesterday.
The Commission insists that the payments, which like any subsidy cannot be
'totally decoupled' from production as Gatt insists, are nevertheless
designed to restrain both production and subsidised exports.
'The Dunkel paper was therefore asking us to crucify our farmers for
absolutely no benefit at all to the world market for farm produce,' an
official stressed.
On December 23, the Twelve told Mr Dunkel his proposal was 'not acceptable
and therefore has to be modified'. Foreign, trade and agriculture ministers
of the Twelve meet on Friday and Saturday to agree a formal position before
the 108 countries involved in the Uruguay Round respond to the Dunkel
proposals on Monday in Geneva.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, on Monday told Mr Ed Madigan,
US agriculture secretary, that the EC 'position was likely to strengthen
rather than weaken,' a Commission official said.
Senior officials say that the Gatt impasse could jeopardise political
progress in persuading the Twelve to reform radically the Common
Agricultural Policy, the engine for escalating farm subsidies.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, was yesterday meeting
Mrs Carla Hills, US special trade representative, in Washington, in a
further attempt to generate movement on the trade talks.

Uruguay Round grows

<TEXT>
THE US pharmaceutical industry yesterday denounced the latest proposals for
ending the Gatt Uruguay Round talks as 'an enormous break for the biggest
pirates in the world', Nancy Dunne reports from Washington.
The industry's trade association joined a growing list of groups and
companies opposed to proposals made by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
director-general, on December 20 last year.
The 10-year grace period on intellectual property rights provided for
developing countries such as India and Thailand was 'an unacceptable
proposition,' Dr Harvey Bale, senior vice-president of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, said.
Industry support for settling the Round is seen as the key to getting
congressional approval for it. Like other opponents of the Dunkel text, Dr
Bale seemed unwilling to lose all hope for the Round and said he would seek
changes in the proposed text.
Gatt was the subject of meetings all over Washington yesterday as groups
sought to stake out their positions.
US and EC textile leaders also denounced the Dunkel text. No US groups
appear willing to accept it as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Mrs Hills
has said she will seek changes.
Other US officials are having trouble summoning enthusiasm; one senior trade
official said that if the text was unalterable, he would rather 'leave it'.
Mr Abe Katz, head of the US Council for International Business, said it
would be 'misleading' to assert that US business was totally negative,
because the Dunkel paper had many positive proposals.
'We are trying to limit the number and extent of changes necessary' to keep
the whole agreement from unravelling,' he declared.
The MTN Coalition, a group of multinational companies and groups backing the
Round, was also in conference yesterday. Its executive director, Mr Harry
Freeman, said: 'There is no way we can take a position until we see what
happens on tariffs and services liberalisation.
'We're saying: 'Run ahead with these negotiations as fast as possible;
otherwise the nay-sayers can work the (Capitol) Hill for a number of months
and create a hostile atmosphere there'.'
Chief among the 'nay-sayers' were the the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute (ATMI), the American Apparel Manufacturers Association and a
number of EC apparel and textile groups who flew to Washington to express
their opposition.
'Countries which have cavalierly disregarded the most fundamental rules of
international trade, are notorious dumpers, subsidisers and polluters and
have built insurmountable tariff protections, will be the main beneficiaries
of this plan,' Mr Neil Hightower, ATMI president, said.
The groups sought a 15-year phase-out of the Multifibre Arrangement, against
the 10 years in the Dunkel proposals, and said all countries should set up
strong verification procedures to ensure pacts to open markets were
honoured.
Central to US industry objections is the proposed new multilateral dumping
code. Mr Michael Coursey, a Washington lawyer advising the US Chamber of
Commerce, said the proposed code was unacceptable to US business.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK officials try to persuade Russians that beef is safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH and Russian officials in Moscow yesterday sought to settle an
embarrassing row over Russia's reluctance to accept UK beef aid because of
claims that it could bring 'mad cow' disease to Russia.
Veterinary surgeons from the UK and the European Commission were also
meeting their Russian counterparts in an attempt to persuade them that the
beef is safe.
Mrs Lynda Chalker, the minister for overseas development, is scheduled to
fly to St Petersburg tomorrow, when she will seek to defuse the row.
Her visit, to discuss the distribution of Pounds 20m of animal feed grain
sent by the government, was planned before the beef dispute broke out.
The announcement of her visit came as an exasperated British government said
delivery of 2,000 tonnes of frozen beef had been suspended while steps were
taken to persuade the Russian authorities that the beef was free of the 'mad
cow' disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
The beef rejected by Moscow officials at the weekend was the first tranche
of the EC's food aid programme for Russia. It was finally accepted by the
northern Russian city of Murmansk, which has different regulations from
those of Moscow and where no cattle are reared.
The rest of Britain's meat aid consignment - accumulated by the UK under the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy - has been put back into cold storage
pending the return from Moscow later this week of Mr Keith Meldrum, the UK's
chief veterinary officer.
Mr Meldrum, who flew to Moscow on Monday, will hold further talks with the
Russian authorities today.
The Ministry of Agriculture in London confirmed that the beef had come from
UK herds which might have been infected by BSE. But under EC regulations,
the infected parts - mainly bones and offal - could be removed and the meat
safely consumed.
The meat could not be certified in the normal way, however. Only meat from
herds which had been free of the disease for two years could be certified as
BSE-free.
Sir Rodric Braithwaite, the British ambassador in Moscow, said Russian vets
had sought assurances that none of the beef came from farms which had
suffered outbreaks of the disease, but this was impossible to do. The
Russian government was anxious to settle the row quickly, he said. 'They do
want (the aid) and they need it.'
BSE is a brain disorder which has devastated British herds for the past five
years, and has soured trade relations.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, yesterday proposed a radical
overhaul of the state-funded Aufschwung Ost economic recovery programme for
the country's five new states.
He called for changes in the law to break the log-jam of claims to land and
property from people dispossessed following the setting up of the former GDR
in 1949, and demanded an extra DM2bn (Pounds 600m) immediately for
investment incentives to encourage entrepreneurs.
He proposed that the duration of state-aided job creation schemes should be
cut from a year to six months, and called for improved export credit
guarantees for companies hit by the collapse of their traditional markets in
east Europe.
He also suggested the two-year DM24bn Aufschwung Ost project - mainly
devoted to rebuilding town centres, hospitals, schools and roads, and due to
end in December - should be extended for 12 months and boosted with a
further DM12bn government grant.
Mr Mollemann, who plans to present his scheme to the cabinet soon, came
under attack immediately from Mr Norbert Blum, labour minister, and Mr
Manfred Carstens, state secretary in the Finance Ministry.
German industrial production rose 1.2 per cent in November, due mainly to a
1.5 per cent increase in the manufacturing sector and rises of 4 to 5 per
cent in output from the gas and electricity industries.
However, underlying difficulties showed up in continued weaknesses in plant
and engineering companies' order books.

He has won the appointment largely because of the decisive support of Mr

Between them the two men command the support of more than half the votes in

The deal, hammered out by party barons, significantly strengthens Mr

presidential election.
Mr Mauroy yesterday described him as 'the virtual candidate' of the party.

FT  08 JAN 92 / EC employers warn on social policy dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN social policy threatens to become 'a two-headed monster', which
could damage EC business, as a result of last month's Maastricht summit,
European employers said yesterday.
The UK agreed to the Maastricht treaty on European Union only after its 11
partners consented to keep existing social clauses and pursue their more
ambitious aims in labour law through an unprecedented protocol, allowing
them to legislate through the Community and exempting Britain.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary-general of Unice, the Europe-wide
employers' organisation, said this was the worst of both worlds.
First, the retained social chapter - which will still be the basis for laws
applying to all 12 member states - should have been tightened. This would
have prevented the European Commission from introducing laws like the
controversial directive limiting the working week to 48 hours by using
health and safety rules, which require only a qualified majority vote rather
than unanimity.
Second, the protocol on social policy was full of legal holes. It left
unclear, for instance, whether measures passed by the 11 become part of the
body of EC law (the acquis communautaire).
If they do, as France and Germany insist, then the diluted form of majority
voting envisaged for the protocol could mean six countries legislating not
only for all the EC, except the UK, but also for the seven European Free
Trade Association countries which will fall into line with EC law once the
European Economic Area is set up in 1993.
Mr Tyszkiewicz also pointed out contradictions between the protocol - which
allows positive discrimination in favour of women, for example - and the
treaty, which does not. The protocol excludes 'pay' from EC competence, but
does not define exactly what it includes.
This, he suggested, might lead to loopholes, such as that which led the
European Court to rule that pensions for men and women had to be equalised
retroactively - the so-called Barber case, the financial costs of which
Maastricht also diluted through a protocol.
Moreover, Mr Tyszkiewicz underlined, Unice and the European Trades Union
Confederation, empowered by the protocol to negotiate agreements instead of
the Commission bringing forward laws, were almost certain to negotiate as
12, not 11.
Patrick Blum adds from Lisbon: Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary,
said yesterday that Britain was 'not closing with a bang' the idea of a
social dimension in the community.
'We believe there is a considerable range of measures which could and should
be pressed ahead under the Portuguese and British presidencies,' he said in
Lisbon, where he had talks with the current Portuguese presidency of the EC.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Brussels launches probe into cement industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S cement industry is facing a long battle over its trading practices
with the launch of a European Commission inquiry into alleged illegal
cartels operated in the 1980s, writes Andrew Baxter.
Brussels has written to 76 European cement producers and organisations
claiming breaches of competition law.
The industry is likely to contest the issue fiercely. Mr Ian McKenzie, chief
executive of Blue Circle Cement, said the investigation was based on
'entirely circumstantial evidence' applying to what Brussels believed had
been happening in the 1980s.
European cement-makers meet regularly within Cembureau to discuss issues
surrounding the use of cement and concrete. Said Mr McKenzie: 'The EC are
saying that people who met for perfectly legitimate matters were doing
things of which they disapprove.'
The investigation has particularly incensed the British industry, which
operated a legally-approved 'common price and marketing agreement' until the
system was abandoned voluntarily in February 1987.
British companies had advised the EC in 1973 that the system, designed to
protect cement supplies and hold up prices, was in operation. 'It has taken
them 18 years to come back and say they don't like it,' said Mr McKenzie.

VIOLENCE prompted by soaring food prices and fresh rumblings in the armed

an official holiday since the Bolshevik Revolution, writes Leyla Boulton in
Moscow.
Tass news agency said people in the southern town of Stavropol smashed shop

seven decades of price controls last week. Shops in the agricultural centre
were forced to reduce their newly-liberated prices for meat and sausage.
In Ukraine, the deputy chief of the Black Sea Fleet said the 300-ship force
could not go along with an oath of allegiance demanded by the Ukrainian
government.
Admiral Ivan Kapitanets explained the fleet was part of the strategic forces

Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, has given servicemen until
January 20 to decide whether to take the oath or go back to Russia.
Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: Germany and Russia signed an agreement
yesterday to allow up to 11,000 Russian contract workers to find jobs on the
German labour market every year, as well as offering training for a further

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday applied for full membership of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank, the first step towards winning financial support for
its transition from a centralised to a free-market economy, writes Lionel
Barber in Washington.
The request follows President Boris Yeltsin's scrapping of price controls in
the former Soviet republic last week.
The US and other western allies have said they will support Fund and Bank
membership for Russia and other reformist Soviet republics, allowing them
access to development loans once they adopt an IMF reform programme.
Until recently, western countries had vigorously opposed full IMF membership
on the grounds that the Soviet leadership was not prepared to embrace
serious economic reform. The Bush administration now recognises that the IMF
is best placed to assume the burden of direct financial aid and offering
expert advice.
Russia's application came amid US preparations for an international
conference in Washington this month to co-ordinate food and medical aid for
the former Soviet republics.
Up to 60 countries could attend the conference on January 22 and 23, the
State Department said. The meeting will be held at foreign ministers level
and will involve international financial institutions, including the IMF,
World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, State Department chief spokeswoman, said the aim was
to organise a division of labour to meet 'drastically increasing
humanitarian needs'.
Russia is likely to have to wait at least six months for its request to be
processed, along with an earlier one from Ukraine and Azerbaijan's
yesterday. One reason is the lack of adequate economic data.
The United Nations Security Council looks set to meet on January 30 to
discuss the break-up of the Soviet Union and the role of the UN in the
post-Cold War era. The meeting is partly intended to allay western concerns
about command and control of nuclear weapons and proliferation risks. A
broader aim, however, is to reinforce the authority of Mr Boutros Ghali, the
new secretary-general.

GUNMEN in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, opened fire on crowds demonstrating
yesterday in support of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who fled the country
on Monday. Two people were reported wounded.
The opposition military council, which has taken control of the republic,
said it gave the order to disperse the 3,000-strong gathering. Last week, at
least two people were killed when masked gunmen fired into another
pro-Gamsakhurdia crowd.
The ousted president is believed to be in Ichevan, Armenia. Mr Tengiz Sigua,
Georgia's acting prime minister, said he had spoken by telephone to Mr Levon
Ter-Petrosyan, the Armenian president, and they had agreed Mr Gamsakhurdia
and his family could remain temporarily in the country, but would not be
allowed to leave.
About 100 supporters who fled with the president, many of them armed, were
to be sent back to Georgia.
Yesterday's shooting incident was another blow for the military council,
which is attempting to establish control in the republic. But Mr Jaba
Iosseliani, one of the council's two leaders, was unrepentant. 'I gave the
order for the crowd to be dispersed, and I will do the same tomorrow and the
day after if necessary.'
He said the council had imposed the 'absolute minimum' of restrictions on
Tbilisi residents, asking only that a curfew and a ban on public meetings be
observed.
Mr Iosseliani, who denied anyone had been hurt in the incident, said his men
had fired blanks.
But in an apparent indication of disagreement between himself and the
council, Mr Sigua said the identity of the gunmen was unknown. He insisted
the use of firearms to disperse demonstrations had been prohibited.
He also contradicted the assertions of the council that the rest of Georgia
had been reports of groups of Gamsakhurdia supporters seizing sections of
railway line in western Georgia, and tearing down a television tower in
Abkhazia, in the north-west.
Regional prefects appointed by Mr Gamsakhurdia were being replaced by men
from the council, Mr Sigua said, and were attempting to confiscate weapons
and maintain order in the republic.
There were unconfirmed reports of meetings elsewhere in the country in
support of the former president. Travellers arriving in Tbilisi said they
had heard shooting around the town of Kutaisi, 200km from the capital.
Mr Sigua said he was appealing to the council to annul its order last
Thursday to dissolve the Georgian parliament, which he hoped would meet
again by January 15.
Law and order agencies, including the Interior Ministry, the militia, and
the Georgian KGB, were yesterday being run by the council, while a temporary
government of 10 ministers appointed by Mr Sigua was said to be supervising
economic and other matters.
The military council has said it will hand over all its powers to the
provisional government as soon as the situation stabilises.
NATO yesterday agreed to establish formal links with the newly independent
republics of the former Soviet Union by inviting them to join the east-west
North Atlantic Co-operation Council set up in Brussels last month, writes
Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor.
Nato foreign ministers are expected to hold a special meeting with their
opposite numbers from the Commonwealth of Independent States and east
European nations in Prague at the end of this month to endorse the new
relationship with the former Soviet republics.

suspended - Defence Ministry plans urgent inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YUGOSLAVIA last night suspended the commander of its air force after the
federal army admitted shooting down a European Community helicopter, killing
five peace monitors.
The European Commission roundly condemned the incident, in which four
Italian soldiers and a French officer died, and called for a full inquiry.
However, EC officials said international efforts to end the fighting would
be stepped up.
In a short, but unusually frank, statement issued through Tanjug, the
Belgrade-based news agency, the Defence Ministry said one of its aircraft
had shot down one EC monitoring helicopter and damaged a second.
The federal secretariat of national defence expressed 'deep regret' over 'an
unwanted and tragic event'. It promised an urgent inquiry and said it would
take legal measures against those responsible.
Western diplomats said that the move by the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav
presidency to suspend Colonel Zvonko Jurjevic, the air force commander,
might be an attempt to bring the armed forces under political control.
Diplomats were surprised by the Defence Ministry admission. One said: 'The
fact that the army admitted to it . . . quickly, and promised a full
inquiry, makes me cautiously optimistic that the peace process can
continue.'
Previous army statements have tended to be sharply critical of independence
moves by the republics of Slovenia and Croatia, which are expecting
recognition by most EC countries on January 15.
The incident happened early yesterday as EC officials and monitors were
being flown from Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, via Hungary, to
Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
The five dead, the first casualties among EC monitors in the Yugoslav civil
war, included the Italian pilot and co-pilot of the helicopter, which
exploded in mid-air. The second helicopter, carrying four Italians and a
Belgian, crashlanded safely.
The EC said it was 'appalled and dismayed' by the incident but Britain and
Portugal, current EC president, said it would not be allowed to damage the
chances of peace.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'The tragedy is bound to
influence people's attitudes, but I think it will have the effect of
redoubling efforts to achieve peace rather than weakening them.'
Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace talks which are due to
resume in Brussels tomorrow, described it as a 'tragic incident' and hoped
it would not scupper peace hopes.
The UN Security Council continued with its peace plans. It is asking 21
countries to provide two to three military observers.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Industry and unions urge initiatives as car sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS, ANDREW BAXTER and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in the UK dropped to a nine-year low in 1991, motor industry
figures confirmed yesterday.
The 20.74 per cent drop to 1.59m units, described as 'extremely serious' by
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, prompted opposition and union calls for urgent government action to
stimulate the economy.
With SMMT statistics showing the commercial vehicle industry to have been
even harder hit - sales fell 28.78 per cent, to 209,021, compared with 1990
 -Mr Gordon Brown, shadow industry secretary, called for 'a new
manufacturing investment incentive and direct action on training and jobs to
bring about economic recovery.'
His call came on the eve of an ambitious attempt to address the long-term
problems of the engineering industry through initiatives backed by
companies, institutions, unions and government. It will be launched today by
the National Economic Development Council.
The initiative - led by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEU engineering
union, and Mr Ian Gibson, chairman of Nissan UK - aims to tackle factors
which have contributed to the poor performance of UK engineering over the
past decade.
A report to today's NEDC meeting, chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, says a 'vigorous marketing exercise is needed to ensure that all
firms in the industry are aware of the best manufacturing technologies and
how the apply them'.
It recommends drawing on the experience of a small number of UK engineering
companies which have made the transition to new manufacturing methods.
The report adds that defence contractors need help to move into new markets.
The NEDC Engineering Sector Group will launch a project to identify product
and technology gaps in the supply chains of the three lead sectors of motor
vehicles, defence/aerospace and capital plant.
The report sees a need to 'close the skills gap and to improve the supply
infrastructure which serves the whole industry.'
It says too many of the 130,000 managers in the industry lack the skills and
understanding necessary to compete in world markets, and points to deficient
education and training among foremen and supervisors.

FT  08 JAN 92 / InterCity links threatened by sell-off, BR report says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOZENS OF towns and cities in the UK will lose their InterCity rail links
under the government's plans for the privatisation of British Rail,
according to a confidential BR document.
They include every InterCity destination in Scotland north of Glasgow and
Edinburgh; every InterCity destination in Wales except Newport and Cardiff;
and a score of English towns and cities such as Blackpool, Bradford, Hull,
Lincoln, Worcester, Hereford and Penzance.
The document, seen by Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's Scottish transport
spokesman, threatens to provoke strong opposition to the privatisation plans
from MPs representing the constituencies affected - many of them
Conservative.
But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, yesterday dismissed it as
'scaremongering'.
Although the document is likely to be seen as an attempt by BR employees to
undermine the privatisation plans, it presents a plausible analysis of the
likely consequences of selling InterCity to the private sector.
It says that the government's insistence that InterCity should deliver a
rate of return on its assets of 2.5 per cent a year has led to a steady
erosion of services since 1982. A private sector owner, however, would
require a far higher rate of return than this, the document says, leading to
sharp cuts in peripheral services.
It concludes that the lightly used sections of the InterCity network would
be ruthlessly pruned, leaving them as branch lines with connecting services
into the mainline network. Victims would almost certainly include the
Aberdeen and Inverness lines in Scotland, points west of Cardiff in south
Wales, and the Crewe-Holyhead line in north Wales.
In England, it would mean the probable loss of InterCity links for points
west of Plymouth in the south-west, for Worcester and Hereford in the West
Midlands, and for branches off the main InterCity network to places such as
Blackpool in the north-west and Hull, Lincoln and Grimsby in the north-east.
The paper also questions whether a private sector owner would have the
resources to fund BR's planned Pounds 750m upgrading of the west coast main
line from London Euston to the West Midlands, the north and Scotland.
Mr Rifkind is expected to produce his white paper on the privatisation of BR
later this month, although the date may slip into February.
Yesterday he said in an interview on BBC Radio Scotland: 'British Rail is a
monopoly and some of its staff, possibly including the person who wrote this
report, would like to keep it as a monopoly and not allow anybody else to
run rail services. That's not my approach.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Ravenscraig complex set for closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is today expected to announce the closure of the its
steelmaking complex at Ravenscraig in Scotland.
Last night the Labour party reacted with fury to the disclosure that British
Steel is to close the last blast furnace at the plant, near Motherwell,
Strathclyde, in nine months' time with the loss of 1,250 jobs.
The plant has been progressively run down over the past year, following the
closure of its hot strip rolling mill. Since then Ravenscraig has only made
steel slabs to sell on the open market and supply to other British Steel
plants. The closure comes as part of a cost-cutting drive at the company,
which has suffered steep falls in profits in the face of increasing
competition from imports in a declining UK market.
In November, British Steel reported half-yearly profits down from Pounds
307m to Pounds 19m.
Closure of the plant would mean the virtual end of steelmaking in Scotland,
leaving British Steel with little more than the plate mill at Dalzell which
is adjacent to Ravenscraig.
The company said last year it hoped to replace Dalzell in the next few years
with a new plant on Teesside.
The closure of Ravenscraig would provoke a furious political row involving
the government and in particular Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary.
Last night Labour politicians were accusing British Steel of reneging on a
commitment it gave before its privatisation in 1987 that it would continue
steelmaking at Ravenscraig until 1994.
The pledge was, however, 'subject to commercial considerations.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said early closure would be a
'betrayal' by the company and the government.
The shutdown of Ravenscraig would suggest that British Steel's trading
position and market prospects are worse than had been thought.
It also suggests that it believes it can satisfy demand from the Port Talbot
and Llanwern plants.
With the pledge to retain steelmaking at Ravenscraig, British Steel said
that if it were to close the steelmaking facilities it 'would consider, on a
commercial basis, any wholly private sector offer for those facilities as an
alternative to closure'.
Politicians are now likely to insist that the company honours that pledge.
Mr Bill Miller, chairman of Strathclyde region's economic development
committee and a leading campaigner for Ravenscraig, said that Mr Lang now
had no option but to resign.
British Steel confirmed yesterday that 219 jobs would be cut at the Shotton
steel finishing plant in Clwyd by the end of the year. Another 139 jobs are
being axed at Port Talbot steel works.

FT  08 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHOPPY, volatile trading continued in the derivative markets early
yesterday, but there were signs that the large premium in Footsie futures
was being eroded, writes Peter John.
The March contract was marked down to 2,512 at the opening to take into
account the softer opening in the underlying market. However, it was soon
appreciated that a number of traders were needing to buy, and when cash
rallied March was squeezed up some 26 points to take advantage of the short
positions.
The rally was overdone and the contract was sold down, from its high of
2,528 to 2,506. As the premium to cash narrowed the arbitrageurs moved in.
Although March was still about 8 points above its estimated fair value, it
was substantially lower than it had been and they were able to buy the
future and sell stock. At the official close, March was at 2,522, 12 points
above fair value with 5,900 contracts traded.
On the LTOM, there were just over 26,000 contracts dealt. British steel was
the top option after one house sold 1,400 April 70s and bought 700 April
80s. Store concerns Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher were among the most
actively traded companies.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Appointments: Bowthorpe's third man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Do ex-financial journalists make good company chairmen? Anthony Vice, who
spent 18 years as a city scribbler before moving into merchant banking, is
about to find out. He has been appointed non-executive chairman of BOWTHORPE
Holdings, the 55-year-old electronics group.
The 60-year-old Vice, who has written a number of books,including Bid for
Power and Financier at Sea, has taken over from Raymond Parsons who retired
as executive chairman at the end of the year.
The 81-year-old Parsons, who was only the second chairman - after founder
Jack Bowthorpe himself - in the company's history, has been made life
president and remains a non-executive director.
John Westhead, Bowthorpe's group managing director since 1980, has been
promoted to chief executive.
After Oxford, Vice joined the Financial Times in 1953, moved to the Daily
Telegraph in 1958 and the Sunday Times six years later. He helped found the
Times Business News in 1967, and in 1971 joined N M Rothschild.
Vice says that his switch into merchant banking at a relatively elderly 39
followed a celebrated lunch where Jacob Rothschild asked him if he would
like to play the game rather than just write about it.
He stepped down as a director of N M Rothschild, Bowthorpe's financial
advisers, at the end of 1991.
*****
Sir Derek Alun-Jones, the former chairman of Ferranti International who
resigned in the wake of extensive fraud at its US subsidiary, has been named
chairman of STRAKER, a small contract stationery company based in Mitcham,
Surrey. The chairmanship of Straker, a company with a turnover of less than
Pounds 10m, had previously revolved between directors at successive board
meetings.
Jonathan Straker, one of the directors, says he has known Sir Derek since
their army days, and approached an old friend 'knowing he had time on his
hands'.
Sir Derek is unlikely to have accepted the post for its financial rewards -
the size of his Ferranti pay-off caused many raised eyebrows at the time.
Perhaps he harbours some nostalgia for stationery: back in the 1960s he was
finance director of Henry C Stephens, a big name in the ink business in
those days.
*****
Frank Tomes is appointed product chief executive of T&amp;N's industrial
products and materials, part of its bearings and industrial division. Tomes
is also md of BIP Chemicals which has been reorganised into two divisions:
the moulding materials division, for which the md is Greville Hampshire, and
the resins division, for which the md is John Heaton.
*****
In a separate move, T&amp;N has appointed David Mcllalieu md of Ferodo, Brian
Lindsay md of Ferodo Caernarfon, and Richard Newson md of Brake Linings.

Roderick Sears-Black is appointed production director of TAVENERS.

On the retirement of Gordon Dunlop, Simon Miller is appointed chairman of

Leslie Silver has resigned from KALON Group after nearly 45 years at the
head of the paint business, which he founded after leaving the RAF with
Pounds 250 savings.
His retirement, at 67, will leave him to devote most of his energy to Leeds
United Football Club, top of the English Football League, of which he is
chairman. He also chairs the board of governors at Leeds Polytechnic.
Silver built up the paint business as the privately owned Silver Paint and
Lacquer Company, which in the 1950s was one of the first producers of
emulsion paint. In the 1970s it started supplying own label paint to
supermarkets and DIY chains and joined the stock market in 1985 by reversing
into Leyland Paint and Wallpaper. The Silver family holdings are now down to
to less than 29 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris eases back in light
continental volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER remained light on the Continent as investors considered their
options for 1992, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS ran into profit-taking after its Christmas rally but ended off the
day's lowest level. The CAC 40 index went as low as 1,771.83 before closing
8.84 down at 1,778.73. Turnover was estimated at FFr1.65bn after Monday's
FFr1.75bn. Foreigners were conspicuous by their absence.
Euro Disney was one of the day's most active stocks, falling FFr3 to FFr148
with 625,100 shares traded, on active profit-taking after its recent rise.
However, brokers were still positive on the stock. SG Warburg has issued a
'buy' note on the Euro Disney convertible.
Oil and engineering shares were also lower, with Total losing FFr25 to 1,017
and Alcatel down FFr11 to FFr554.
FRANKFURT again found itself with nothing to bite on and the DAX index fell
10.87 to 1,592.45 after a 3.72 decline to 648.88 in the FAZ at midsession.
Volume rose from DM3bn to DM3.5bn.
Dealers said that after a limited acknowledgment of the spurt on Wall
Street, which helped holders of German shares adjust to year-end capital
gains tax positions, the market was reverting to normal - which, said one,
would mean it would follow the Dow on the downgrade much more comfortably
than it had done in the recent rally.
There was price movement in carmakers where Daimler fell DM9 to DM741 and
Porsche put on DM8.50 to DM576 on the recent weakness of the dollar. VW
dropped another DM6 to DM292, leaving it DM14.60 lower over the last three
sessions. Most of the decline has followed the weekend revelation that
output of VW's Golf model is likely to have fallen by 100,000 units last
year, due to the change-over to a new design.
MILAN saw some interest in banking and telecommunications stocks but trading
was thin despite the return of traders and fund managers from holiday. The
Comit index rose 6.48 to 514.29 in turnover estimated at not more than
Friday's L46.2bn. The bourse was closed yesterday.
Trading was hampered by the teething problems of the new trading houses or
Sims which came into operation at the start of this year. Italian investment
fund data for December were hardly encouraging, with both equity and mixed
funds continuing to suffer from redemptions.
Mediobanca, which has been recommended as a 'buy' by Goldman Sachs, rose
L460 to L14,200. The broker expects the bank's earnings to grow by 23 per
cent in 1992 after a 5 per cent decline in 1991. Among telecoms, Stet rose
L70 to L2,170.
AMSTERDAM ended a dull session mixed to easier. The CBS Tendency index
closed at 113.4, down 0.2 on the day.
The trading company Hagemeyer added Fl 3 to Fl 126.50 in response to the
company's New Year message that there would be a big rise in 1991 earnings
per share from 1990's Fl 12.59. Wessanen added Fl 1.50 to Fl 82.50 after the
company said that 1991 earnings per share are likely to be 16 per cent
higher than in 1990.
ZURICH ended above its lows as the Credit Suisse index fell 3.9 to 455.7,
and turnover to pre-holiday levels. Industrials stayed in focus with the
watchmaker, SMH, bucking the trend, its certificates closing SFr20 better at
SFr700.
MADRID saw the general index 3.03 higher at 246.68. Banks and utilities led
the uptrend in volume of around Pta12bn against Pta8bn last Friday.
STOCKHOLM produced a spike in turnover, which rocketed from SKr251m to an
all-time high of SKr1.26bn. This was attributed to Sandvik's sale of its
entire 10.1 per cent stake in Investment AB Bahco to the holding company
Industrivarden.
The Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.8 higher at 928.3. Bahco
unrestricted B shares closed at SKr275, in line with the sweetened bid made
by Industrivarden for all outstanding Bahco Bs.
COPENHAGEN continued its modest, but consistent uptrend with the CSE index
1.32 higher at 358.66 and the biotech favourite, Novo Nordisk, among the
leaders with a DKr8 rise to DKr558.
OSLO slid on profit-taking, the all-share index closing 1.92 lower at

bargains after the sustained decline in the latter part of 1991. The ATX
index jumped 20.72 or 2.3 per cent to 922.36.
BRUSSELS continued to focus on retailers. GIB rose BFr30 to BFr1,232 with a
heavy 68,800 shares traded following the sale of its 50 per cent stake in a
chain of pizza restaurants in Belgium and Holland. Delhaize eased BFr20 to
BFr8,630. The Bel-20 index closed 1.48 higher at 1,106.01 in turnover of

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking causes
Nikkei to retreat in quiet trading

<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING pushed the Nikkei average back in quiet trading yesterday
after Monday's 3.6 per cent gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 234.79 off at 23,566.39, after a high in the morning of
23,901.89 and a low of 23,514.28. Volume came to 220m shares, against 180m
in Monday's half-day session.
Declines led rises by 631 to 306, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks lost 16.76 to 1,746.67 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.39 to 1,322.35.
A stronger yen and lower bond yields failed to encourage investors. Hopes
that the fall in short-term interest rates would prompt domestic
institutions to shift funds into the stock market were not realised.
A fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life said most institutional investors would find
it hard to increase their equity holdings before they closed their books in
March.
However, Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said last
month's discount rate cut by the Bank of Japan had triggered a significant
change in the interest rate structure. 'The decline in rates on postal
deposits, the sharp fall in the overnight call rate and the bond market
rally will prompt a gradual shift of funds into stocks,' he added.
Interest rate-sensitive issues, which had gained ground during the past two
trading days, receded on profit-taking. Tokyo Electric Power lost Y70 to
Y3,630 on institutional selling.
Speculative stocks were higher on short-term trading by dealers. Nippon
Carbon surged Y230 to Y1,890 on short-covering. The stock has plunged
recently on margin selling, falling over 50 per cent from its record high of
Y3,450 set in mid-December. Toyo Ink gained Y50 to Y890.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 144.90 to 24,742.37 in 8.5m share volume.
Export related issues fell on small-lot selling. Shimano, the bicycle parts
maker, lost Y70 to Y2,020.
Roundup
TOKYO'S fall on profit-taking encouraged investors to do likewise in the
Pacific Rim, though Hong Kong managed to close at a new high.
HONG KONG resumed its record-breaking advance after Monday's pause, in spite
of a wave of selling which brought prices off their afternoon peaks. The
Hang Seng index registered a closing all-time high of 4,347.93, up 40.96.
Turnover expanded to HKDollars 1.41bn from HKDollars 1.22bn.
Jardine Matheson Holdings rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 40.25, while
Hutchison Whampoa gained 40 cents to HKDollars 14.90 on rumours that it
might float its telecommunications division.
AUSTRALIA was disappointed when the central bank did not ease interest
rates. The All Ordinaries index ended down 7.5 at 1,667.6 in steady turnover
of ADollars 195m. BHP, which rose on oil exploration speculation on Monday,
slipped 10 cents to ADollars 13.90.
NEW ZEALAND declined in thin trading as a jump in the local dollar prompted
profit-taking. The NZSE-40 index ended 29.34 or 1.9 per cent lower at
1,506.52. Turnover fell to NZDollars 13.7m from NZDollars 25.5m.
TAIWAN continued to rise on hopes of lower interest rates. The weighted
index gained 26.64 to 4,718.81. Turnover was TDollars 35.13bn (TDollars
33.88bn).
MANILA rebounded after some intraday profit-taking. The composite index rose
10.24 to 1,241.48, the highest since November 1989, as turnover fell to 80m
pesos from 93m.
The listing of the electric distribution monopoly, the Manila Electric Co,
is due today.
SEOUL ended weaker on profit-taking in securities and large manufacturing
shares. The composite index was down 4.83 to 645.27 in turnover of
Won482.8bn, after Won440.2bn.
BANGKOK sold banks after Monday's gains, and turned to construction blue
chips. Siam Cement hit its 10 per cent ceiling on foreign buying, closing
Bt54 higher at Bt632. The SET index ended 9.43 up at 728.93 in turnover of
Bt4.78bn.

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Merrill sees Dow 1992 peak of 3,400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S momentum is so great, said Merrill Lynch's chief market
analyst Mr Robert Farrell yesterday, that the current phase of 'urgent
buying' may well last until early February, even though the US market is
overvalued, writes Peter Martin.
Mr Farrell, speaking in London, said that one interpretation of the current
'stampede' is that it is a 'classic blow-off' to a 15-year bull market. If
that is so, the market might go up a lot but could lead to a bear market in
1993-94 rather like that seen in 1973-74.
From March to November last year, the US market saw a continued strong
performance from growth companies such as the biotechnology industry, which
offset weakness in cyclical capital goods and technology companies.
The market's recent rise has been across the board. However, Mr Farrell said
that the economic conditions which favour growth stocks do not favour
cyclicals, and vice versa, so 'it seems safe to assume that both groups
cannot do well together in 1992 once the present stampede ends'.
Changing economic conditions could lead to a better relative, and perhaps
absolute, performance by cyclical stocks, he added. Such a scenario would
limit the market's upside in 1992, to perhaps 3,400 on the Dow, with greater
volatility than last year.

FT  08 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Asset allocators explore the bond
markets - US and Japanese interest rate cuts have led to second thoughts,
says Richard Waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers returning to work this week have been presented with a
conundrum. Traditionally, the new year prompts a reassessment of investment
weightings. It is a time when asset allocators come into their own,
determining the relative weightings of equities, bonds, property and other
investments in their portfolios.
With the US and Japan lowering short-term interest rates at the tail-end of
the old year, however, many of the strategy reviews undertaken in the
closing weeks of 1991 already look out of date. In particular, the rise in
share prices has already removed some of the attraction from equity markets
which may have seemed cheap in historic terms.
That 'cheapness' is most commonly expressed in terms of the ratio of bond
yields to those on equities. For most major economies, that ratio was close
to or below its average for the last decade as 1991 drew to a close,
appearing to suggest that there was room for share prices to rise, according
to research from Smith New Court, the UK securities house.
After the severe volatility in the US and the UK in 1987, which had seen
yield ratios climb way out of line with historic norms before plunging
sharply in the stock market crash, the ratio had continued to move lower in
the following years. The UK, in particular, with a ratio below 2.0, looked
undervalued compared to recent years. Similar sharp falls had been seen in
Japan and Germany since early 1990, as interest rates moved up in
anticipation of the inflationary threat in both countries.
But recent historic parallels may be of little relevance in the years ahead.
Most investors are betting on the fact that inflation has been licked in the
major economies for the time being, and is set to fall in the coming 12
months. That view holds particularly for the European Community, where
Germany's pre-Christmas rate rise seems to have set the tone for a
low-growth, low-inflation period ahead. Against that background, yield
ratios could be set to fall to a new range.
The chart, showing the bond/equity yield ratio for the UK, illustrates how
the ratio moved into a new range in the 1970s as inflation took hold and the
Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system broke down (being based on year-end
figures, it does not show the sharp rise and fall during 1987). If investors
believe in low inflation ahead, the ratio could fall back to pre-1970
levels, suggesting a return to a greater degree of fixed income investment,
argues Mr Peter Lyon of Smith New Court.
That argument, expressed in different forms, has been the dominant theme in
many recent investment analyses. The strongest opponent of this theory is Mr
Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs, who argues that the yield ratio does not
generally move with inflation, in spite of the 1970s experience.
This is a minority view, however, and the consensus points to a greater
interest in bond markets - although investment managers are not arguing that
the rules of the game have changed fundamentally.
As Mr Mike Sandland, chief investment manager of Norwich Union, the UK
insurer which has caused a stir in recent weeks with its declared switching
into bonds, says: 'We would still accept that, over the longer term,
equities must outperform fixed-income investments.'
Norwich Union's rebalancing of its portfolio to correct an under-investment
in fixed income assets has been made on the assumption that the equity
returns of the 1980s will not be repeated. 'It is too simplistic to talk
about the 1990s against the 1980s,' says Mr Sandland. 'But by the end of the
century, the 1980s will be seen as an eccentric decade for equity returns.'
He adds: 'Our view is that over the next couple of years or so, returns on
bonds and equities are likely to be roughly similar.'
Investment houses sold on the attraction of equities agree that bond markets
are set for a sustained rally. As Warburg Securities points out, falling
inflation, adequate fiscal discipline and the scope for falls in real bond
yields, particularly in Europe later in the year, all point to good returns.
But Warburg adds: 'To bet against equities is taking a very serious bet
against history.' Even in the low-growth, low-inflation late 1950s, equities
outperformed bonds comfortably. It would take a severe change of
circumstances to shift many fund managers from this view.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals producers prepare for a
grim year - The Soviet collapse is likely to help keep prices depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALS producers are bracing themselves for another punishing year in 1992.
Recovery in the US is faltering at a time when economic activity in the two
remaining generators of growth - Germany and Japan - is slowing.
'The outlook for the traded metals is looking gruesome,' says Mr Stephen
Briggs, analyst with the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy
group.
'Very little industrial growth can be expected in 1992 and a second year of
depressed prices does not bode well for metals producers', he adds.
'In 1991 they could to some extent live off the fat from the previous three
years of high prices. Now that fat has gone.'
Base metals producers have so far seen London Metal Exchange prices drop by
at least 39 per cent (for copper) and as much as 63 per cent (for nickel)
from the peaks reached in 1989-90.
Producers once believed they were in good shape to weather the expected
recession. They had used windfall profits gathered in 1988-89 to repair
damaged balance sheets.
Metal stocks in western markets were low, whereas in the two previous
recessions there was a great deal of excess metal. That took years to absorb
after the economic recoveries began.
In isolation, the present downturn would have been rough enough. The two
industries that use huge quantities of non-ferrous metals - automotive and
construction - had an awful 1991 and remain in deep recession.
Car sales in the ten largest national markets fell by nearly 7 per cent in
the first nine months of 1991; the equivalent figure for commercial vehicles
was nearly 8.5 per cent. Meanwhile, construction activity in the 24
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries dropped by
4.5 per cent year-on-year in the first half of last year and the downturn
has since become more widely based.
Nevertheless, production and consumption of most of the traded metals would
have been roughly in balance in 1991 if it had not been for the unexpectedly
fast dissolution of the Soviet Union and its eastern bloc satellites, and
the unforeseen impact that had on metals markets.
Eastern European imports of lead, tin and zinc dried up while the region's
exports of aluminium, copper and nickel to the west grew at a frightening
rate.
This swing in east-west trade was almost entirely responsible for depressing
metals prices, particularly as so much of the eastern European material
ended up by being highly visible in London Metal Exchange stocks.
Could or should the western producers have reacted more quickly by cutting
output?
Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals
and industrial group, points out that it would have been extremely difficult
for producers to have moved any faster because of the lack of statistics
available from the eastern bloc countries. 'Their foreign trade figures are
incomplete and their production and consumption statistics in part
unobtainable. This applies especially to the former Soviet Union,' he says.
For example, even though the Soviet Union was a member of the United Nations
Study Group on lead and zinc, it never gave production figures.
There have been widespread complaints that the Soviets have been dumping
metals in the west. These cannot be substantiated, suggests Mr Baack,
because London Metal Exchange prices are binding for almost all
transactions, whether west-west or east-west, with only minor variations.
'However, it is true that supplies from the Soviet Union are not based on
domestic cost calculations but solely on the need to earn foreign currency,'
he adds.
So perhaps the most important issue for metals producers in 1992 is: what
can be expected from the former Soviet Union?
Mr Briggs at MMRS points out that the accelerating political break-up of the
region makes forecasting well nigh impossible.
'But most of the same factors which led to the massive exports of the past
two years, namely domestic demand collapsing faster than production and the
desperate need for foreign exchange, will remain in place.
'Neither is metals consumption in eastern Europe likely to pick up in the
short term. East-west trade flows will therefore almost certainly remain a
bearish influence (on metals prices) in 1992.'
Mr Baack is more optimistic. He suggests that the new republics cannot allow
their domestic economies to continue to fall further into disrepair. Moves
already are afoot in Russia to limit the export of some raw materials so
that its own processing industries have enough to maintain production.
In addition, the Soviet energy situation is ever more precarious and
reductions in energy-intensive production processes, such as the extraction
of raw materials, cannot be ruled out, says Mr Baack.
'This would probably lead to a cut in production of non-ferrous metals. It
would also signify that the metal glut from the east had passed its peak.'
East-west trade will not be the only factor affecting metals prices this
year. Extremely low prices last year forced producers to make output cuts -
all the traded metals but copper have been affected so far - and the full
impact will be felt in 1992.
However, Mr Briggs of MMRS suggests that more production cuts will be needed
in the coming months. 'The onus will be on western producers to rein back
their output in order to prevent stocks rising considerably further,' he
says.
Much also depends on the US economy. Economists remain generally confident
that it should recover enough this year to stimulate demand for metals,
particularly because consumer stocks are very low.
Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's
largest mining company, points out, however, that although the US government
will do its best in an election year to kick-start the economy, the impact
will not be felt until the second half of 1992. He says: 'It is difficult to
see any movement (in base metals prices) except downwards or sideways'.
Mr Crowson adds the usual rider about the upheavals in the former Soviet
Union, and also suggests 'we should not forget China' - formerly a big
importer of metals from the west.
'China might come back in a big way as a metals buyer,' he says, recalling
market rumours that the recent buoyancy in copper prices was based on
Chinese purchases.
While China's growing industrialisation offers metals producers a glimmer of
hope for 1992, Metallgesellschaft's Mr Baack offers another. He suggests:
'In view of the unpredictability of developments in the former Soviet Union,
even a complete halt to supplies from this region is a possibility. And a
halt to Soviet metal exports could unleash a price explosion.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar estimate cut, but by less
than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR output in the 1991-92 crop year is forecast to reach 113.1m
tonnes, raw value, according to FO Licht, the influential German statistics
agency, in its second production estimate, reports Reuter.
This compares with a previous forecast for 1991 - 92 of 114.06m tonnes made
last October and a revised 1990-91 output estimate of 113.76m tonnes.
All the figures are based on national crop years.
The announcement pushed world sugar futures prices down in New York because
the production forecast was higher than traders had expected.
'The estimate was down by almost 1m tonnes but we were looking for a
downward revision of up to 2m tonnes,' one analyst said. 'The drop in the
Cuban output numbers (that) we expected apparently didn't come through.'
At the London Futures and Options Exchange, the May raw sugar position was
down Dollars 2 at Dollars 186 a tonne in late afternoon trading.

MOST London Metal Exchange contracts reversed direction yesterday, with
zinc, aluminium and tin regaining some of their recent losses and nickel
surrendering some of its recent advance. Zinc had got off to a shaky start,
after the announcement of another rise in LME warehouse stocks, but a
subsequent rally was underpinned by trade buying. The cash position closed
at Dollars 1,128 a tonne, up Dollars 11 on the day, after losing some of its
rise in view of the continued erosion of supply tightness for February
delivery. Nickel's setback, which took the cash position Dollars 45 lower to
Dollars 7,290 a tonne, followed the announcement of a substantial stocks
rise but dealers said the selling was a reaction against recent gains. They
added that the likelihood of overhead resistance above Dollars 7,400 (for
three months delivery metal) had inhibited an early advance, triggered by
Canadian producer Falconbridge's recent statement that it was considering
further output cuts. The copper market continued its recent downtrend,
though more slowly, with cash metal ending Dollars 3.50 down at Dollars
1,130.50 a tonne. Dealers said the market was depressed by the three months
position's failure to hold above Dollars 2,150 a tonne.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME turnover up 25% in 1991
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange, the world's largest terminal market for physical
metal, increased turnover by 25 per cent last year compared with 1990. Its
financial strength enabled the exchange to return some contract levy money
to members.
Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, said yesterday the
results showed 'growing metals industry confidence' in the LME and that its
services were valued just as much in recessionary times as when prices were
rising.
The strength of the increase in metals markets turnover, from 12.62m to
15.84m lots, showed there was an underlying real increase in physical
business as well as that which came in recessionary times from traders
rolling over stock in LME warehouses, he pointed out.
Mr Abbott said that booming LME business did not necessarily mean that its
members were doing well.
Their commission incomes were based on the gross value of contracts, so they
suffered when metals prices were low - as they have been for the past year.
The LME gave back to members 40 per cent of the money paid to the exchange
in contract levies during the first nine months of 1991.
Mr Abbott said the LME's cash reserves were high enough to meet statutory
requirements 'and there is no particular reason that the market should
declare a profit and pay taxes on it. It makes more sense to push the money
back to the members so that they can pay the tax'.
Of the six metals traded on the LME, only tin, the most recently-introduced
contract, showed a fall in turnover last year. Turnover fell by 0.5 per cent
from 361,196 lots (of five tonnes each) to 359,436 lots.
Zinc showed the biggest gain, up 39 per cent from 1.42m lots (of 25 tonnes
each) to 1.93m, followed by aluminium, up 34 per cent from 3.99m lots (of 25
tonnes each) to 5.34m.
Turnover of the LME's 'flagship' contract, copper, was up 20 per cent, from
5.67m lots (of 25 tonnes) to 6.8m.
Lead turnover improved by 15 per cent, from 610,351 lots (of 25 tonnes) to
703,944 while nickel was up by 25 per cent, from 572,970 lots (of six tonnes
each) to 715,555.
Trading volume on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry reached a record
14,949,199 lots last year, surpassing the previous high of 14,839,666 set in
1990, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The cumulative volume of platinum futures in 1991 reached 5,403,596 lots, up
65.3 per cent from 1990, and silver futures rose 109.7 per cent to
1,057,598. Volume of gold futures, meanwhile, totalled 4,567,630 lots, down
33.5 per cent.
Trading of rubber futures totalled 2,167,293 lots, down 6.2 per cent, and
wool futures reached 145,854, more than seven times higher than the previous
year.
'The Tocom's precious metal complex showed wild volatility last year, in the
face of market-moving news such as the Gulf War in January and the coup
attempt in the former Soviet Union in August,' an exchange official said.
'Platinum futures, in particular, attracted panic selling from local
investors in May, following the report that Nissan had developed a
platinum-free auto catalyst.
'These motivated local investors and trade houses to trade actively.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush aide warns EC over
objections to Gatt text
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OXFORD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FARMERS will not easily be convinced that the so-called Dunkel text for
the Uruguay Round of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade is sufficient for reforms to go ahead, the Oxford farming conference
was told yesterday.
If Europe persisted in its objections to the text - proposed by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, Gatt director-general, as a way out of the present deadlock - the
round could end in failure, said Mr Gary Blumenthal, special assistant to
President George Bush for agricultural trade and food assistance. 'If Europe
says 'too far', I fear for the whole round.'
Referring to Mr Dunkel's deadline of January 13 for country responses to his
proposals, made on December 20, Mr Blumenthal said the US would 'not let a
time-frame drive the agreement.' However, it would like an agreement this
year.
In a strong attack on the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy,
he suggested that 'poverty through dominance' was a more fitting theme for
the conference than 'prosperity through excellence'.
'Prosperity through excellence is thematically incomplete without
substantial reform of government policies which reward the inefficient,
pacify or misdirect the industrious and punish the ineligible,' he said.
Pointing out that the EC was spending, directly and indirectly, Dollars
160bn a year on agriculture, he said that government-supported prosperity
for European farmers had meant impoverishment for farmers elsewhere in the
world.
He said it was inexplicable to Americans that Europeans tolerated such high
taxes to support the CAP. EC consumers had to spend 21.6 per cent of their
incomes on food, compared with 12 per cent in the US.
'EC wheat prices are 60 per cent higher than the world price, barley and
beef prices are nearly double and milk prices are nearly triple the world
price,' he said.
Not only did the EC block the admission of goods, it then used export
subsidies to dump surpluses on the world market. This cost the US Dollars
8bn in 1989 and led to global losses of Dollars 27bn in agricultural trade,
he said.
After Gatt reforms, EC farmers would capture their fair share of a free
world market. The conference had been far too inward looking. 'I strongly
urge you to look at the world market, not just the home market.'
However, if the Gatt talks failed, 'I won't say I blame Europe but it is
hard to accept that the blame lies on both sides of the Atlantic'.
Mr Blumenthal rejected accusations that the US said one thing and did
another, and that US subsidies were comparable to those in the EC.
He said US farmers had been enthusiastic about the Gatt talks in the early
stages, but only a 'quality' agreement under which they could be seen to
benefit would rekindle their enthusiasm now.
Mr David Harvey, of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Food
Marketing at Newcastle University, said that volatile prices for world
agricultural commodities could be put down mainly to the fact that 90 per
cent of world trade was not free. This destabilised both the world market
and the EC budget.
He urged farmers to take on board the clear message that market forces were
here to stay in the agricultural industry.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Warm reception for new issues in dollar
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENT-UP demand for dollar securities, following the strong rally in the US
bond market over the Christmas period, ensured a positive reception for
Dollars 1.25bn worth of new issues in the dollar sector yesterday.
Although few swap opportunities are available, many borrowers are keen to
lock in fixed-rate funds at historically low rates, and dealers are
predicting a wave of dollar deals.
The Canadian province of Ontario launched a Dollars 1bn seven-year deal via
Merrill Lynch, which was considered fairly priced, offering an initial yield
spread of 56 basis points above the comparable US Treasury.
The success of the deal, boosted by strong Japanese demand, should help pave
the way for further issues by Ontario, which is expected to have a hefty
borrowing programme again this year.
Demand for fresh paper is exaggerated by the lack of current-coupon paper
trading below par, even in the US Treasury market, after the recent rally.
Bullish sentiment is skewing demand towards the longer end.
However, a Dollars 250m five-year deal for Toyota Motor Credit Corporation
also met strong demand. The triple-A rated issue, priced to yield 43 basis
points above the curve, attracted both institutional and retail buying.
Meanwhile, the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year issue due to be launched
today has already met strong buying interest, and is expected to be
oversubscribed.
Demand in the Ecu bond market has been boosted by lack of supply and bullish
sentiment on European markets generally. Uncertainty about the Ecu's future
has abated since the Maastricht summit.
Dealers said interest is focused strongly on the longer end of the market.
Short-dated paper, mainly swap-driven, is proving difficult to sell, as
rates at the short end of the yield curve are not attractive compared with
short-term deposit rates.
Investors are keen to buy longer-dated paper which would benefit more from
any rally in the market.
The Council of Europe yesterday launched the first sizeable Ecu transaction
since the run up to the Maastricht conference.
The Ecu500m issue, fungible with an outstanding Ecu500m deal with nine years
to run, met strong demand, despite its premium issue price. The deal was bid
at 103.05, above its reoffer price of 103.
A two-year deal for General Electric Capital Corporation met little demand,
according to dealers, but the lead manager, IBJ International, said that
Swiss retail investors are expected to buy the deal.
In the French market, Credit Foncier launched a FFr500m eight-year deal with
redemption linked to the CAC-40 French stock index. The structure of the
deal ensures that the investor cannot lose any principal, but benefits each
time the index exceeds a predetermined threshold.
Elsewhere, a DM200m five-year deal for Fiat Finance &amp; Trade was considered
fairly priced and met firm, mainly domestic, demand.
But some investors were deterred from buying a DM500m deal for Austria,
despite the strength of the credit, because the bonds can be redeemed early
at the option of the borrower.
In the Swiss market, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
raised SFr50m through an issue of loan certificates via Swiss Volksbank. The
paper will not be actively traded.
The Bank of Greece plans to launch a Dollars 250m offering of five-year
bonds which will be sold in Europe, the Far East, and also in the US under
the provisions of the SEC's Rule 144A. The deal, Greece's first in the
straight dollar bond market, is designed to diversify the investor base of a
borrower which has in the past relied largely on bank financing.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe hopes to boost equity
options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the London International Financial Futures Exchange met
yesterday to discuss the future of equity options trading after the
exchange's merger with the London Traded Options market next March.
Liffe appears to have succeeded in persuading more firms to act as
market-makers in equity options, needed to boost liquidity in the
languishing market.
After the meeting, a Liffe official said that 'subject to confirmation from
market-makers, there will be adequate market-making capacity to proceed with
the provisional allocation of 'D' shares'.
In November, about 300 firms applied for 'D' shares which will entitle
holders to trade equity and equity index options on the new exchange.
The merger was due to take place later this month, but was postponed because
of technical problems.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: GPA raises Dollars 100m in
preference shares deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the aircraft leasing company, has raised Dollars 100m through a private
placement of convertible preference shares in the US in the latest round of
capital-raising which has seen it secure more than Dollars 2bn in the past
year.
The terms of the preference stock, convertible up to 2002 at Dollars 34 a
share, anticipate a recovery in the group's value.
While GPA was able to place Dollars 185m of ordinary shares in July 1990 at
Dollars 32.50 a share, the downturn in the airline business has seen shares
in the unquoted group changing hands at Dollars 24 recently. GPA announced
some months ago that it intended to seek a listing, but is still waiting for
the right market conditions.
The convertible cumulative preference shares, which pay a 7 per cent
dividend, have been placed with the Public School Employees' Retirement
System of Pennsylvania. On a fully diluted basis, the stake would give the
holder a 2.5 per cent share of the group if converted.

JAVELIN, one of the handful of specialist soft commission brokers, has this
week reached agreement on its sale to Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers, part

The broker, formed about two years ago, had previously been 52 per cent
owned by Pinestreet, an investment division of American International Group,
the US insurer.
However, the decision by AIG to wind down Pinestreet left the broker in need
of a new parent to inject extra capital, Javelin said.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: OBU assets rise 1.1% in third
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL assets for Bahrain's Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) rose marginally in
the third quarter of last year, but were more than 10 per cent down on the
same period in 1990 - a measure of the limited revival of confidence in the
Gulf's banking centre since the Gulf war.
Figures released by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA), the Emirate's central
bank, show assets to have risen 1.1 per cent cent in the third quarter to
Dollars 51.578bn, compared with the second quarter. But total footings were
10.7 per cent down on the same period in 1990.
The BMA reported that total assets of OBUs in June 1991 stood at Dollars
51.007bn. However, the preceding June assets stood at nearer Dollars 71.2bn
before the shock to confidence caused by the Gulf war, which led to a flight
of both capital and expatriate bankers from the island.
OBU assets fell to their lowest level, Dollars 48.986bn, in May 1991. The
BMA bulletin showed there were 47 offshore banks operating on the island,
down from 56 before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, the US telecoms group, expects to post a 1991 year-end loss.
It blames the loss on a Dollars 1.55bn accounting change charge that will be
retroactive to the first 1991 quarter, Reuter reports.
The company, which plans to restate results for the first three quarters of
1991, said the charge related to its adoption of Financial Accounting
Standard Number 106, which affects its accounting of retiree health and life
insurance benefits.
In 1990, Bell Atlantic earned Dollars 1.31bn, or Dollars 3.38 a share, on
revenues of Dollars 12.30bn.
Excluding the charge, the company said its earnings from operations were on
track to meet analysts' expectations.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and NEC start advanced chip
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T of the US and NEC of Japan are strengthening their collaboration in
semiconductor technology to develop a high-performance memory chip which
does not require continual electronic refreshment.
The companies said they intended to work together to design and manufacture
fast static random access memory chips (S-RAMs) able to store up to 4m bits
of information. The project will involve further co-operation between NEC
and AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories.
S-RAM chips are used in a wide range of electronic circuitry where they can
have power-saving advantages over D-RAMs, the most common kind of electronic
memory.
The S-RAM chips will be manufactured by NEC and sold by both companies.
The agreement is a step towards the establishment of manufacturing
technologies for the next generation of semiconductors.
AT&amp;T and NEC agreed last April to work on developing technology for advanced
chips with memories four times more dense than current methods allow.
The agreement is one of several between Japanese and US semiconductor
companies aimed at easing trade friction between the two countries. Other
examples include an agreement between Hitachi and Texas Instruments.
Separately, International Business Machines of the US and Siemens of West
Germany are collaborating on advanced memory design.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: LSI Logic pulls out of US
semiconductor consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEMATECH, the US semiconductor consortium set up some five years ago to
develop world-beating chip manufacturing technology and stem Japanese
competition, has lost one of its founding member-companies.
LSI Logic has withdrawn from the consortium, marking the first defection
from the industry group since Sematech was formed.
LSI's executives said they disagreed with the direction that Sematech had
taken and disapproved of Sematech's increased emphasis on supporting US
semiconductor production equipment manufacturers.
Two more of Sematech's original 14 member-companies are believed to be
considering pulling out. However, Sematech's future is not in doubt. The
consortium has strong support from its leading members, including
International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Motorola and Texas
Instruments.
LSI Logic's departure 'leaves a dent, but not a serious one,' said Mr
William Spencer, Sematech chief executive. Its departure comes as the
industry group is asking for extended government funding for the next five
years.
Sematech receives half of its annual Dollars 200m budget from the US
Department of Defence and the remainder from member-companies. Sematech
officials remain confident of continued government support, noting that the
group has strong congressional backing for its efforts to increase the
international competitiveness of the US semiconductor industry.
However, LSI Logic's withdrawal from Sematech demonstrates the difficulties
of collaboration among competing US chip-makers.
'Sematech has significantly shifted its direction since the consortium was
formed,' said Mr George Wells, LSI Logic president and chief operating
officer. The group's current programme is 'not what we signed up for', he
complained.
'Shoring up the US semiconductor production equipment industry may well be a
good idea but it is not where we wanted to see Sematech put its funds.'
LSI, the leading manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuits
chips that are tailored to meet the needs of individual customers, said the
technology requirements of its specialised products have diverged
significantly from those of mass production commodity chips over the past
few years.

VASP, the Brazilian airline, is cutting its workforce by 5.5 per cent in the
face of a nation-wide recession which threw the company into losses of up to
Dollars 60m for 1991.
Although Vasp won some market share from domestic competitors last year its
ticket sales fell by 8 per cent as the recession in the Brazilian airline
industry began to bite. Some 560 employees will be laid off out of a
workforce of 11,000.
Mr Wagner Canhedo, the president and leading shareholder, launched an
aggressive expansion campaign for the airline after the group's
privatisation in 1990. The company expanded into the international market
and has routes to the west coast of the US, Argentina and Aruba.
Mr Carlos Brighi, a company spokesman, said the Vasp's troubles would not
alter its plans. He said it intended to invest about Dollars 2.5bn in the
future and hoped to win routes to Miami, Brussels and Seoul.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Skanska to cut forecast of
profits by SKr700m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANSKA, the largest construction and real estate company in Scandinavia,
has scaled down its profits forecast for last year by SKr700m to around
SKr1bn (Dollars 180m). It made a profit of SKr2.37bn in 1990.
Skanska said the main reason for its latest gloomy profits prognosis stemmed
from the financial troubles incurred by Selmer, Norway's biggest building
company, in which Skanska has a one-third interest.
Selmer's other main shareholders are the troubled Norwegian banks,
Christiania and den Norske, who joined Skanska in 1990 in a rescue of the
company.
Skanska also blamed the 'turbulence in the exchange and money markets during
the autumn' as well as falling property values for the further revision in
its profits forecast.
Selmer is estimated to have incurred a loss of SKr750m in 1991 because of
difficulty in selling apartments in Oslo and in Spain as well as problems
with its energy projects.
At a special shareholders' meeting held by Selmer on January 3, it was
decided to write down the value of the Norwegian company's capital to zero.
This meant a write-off of SKr297m for Skanksa. It was also agreed to make a
new share issue in Selmer worth NKr350m, though Skanska has still not made
up its mind whether it will participate.
Skanska had earlier proposed a financial reconstruction for Selmer based on
the provision of further credit for it from the Norwegian banks. However,
the banks opposed this and made a counter-offer suggesting that Skanska
should guarantee the further credit provisions for Selmer, something that
Skanska in turn rejected.
Last October, Skanska reported profits (after financial items) for the first
eight months of 1991 of SKr1.19bn, against SKr1.71bn. At that time it said
it expected a profit for the year of around SKr1.7bn after estimated
write-downs of SKr900m.

FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Gardini looks to fresh horizons
 -William Dawkins examines an expanding food processing alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAUL Gardini, former chief of Italy's Ferruzzi agro-industrial and
chemicals group is branching out on his own, and adding to the pace of
Italian expansion into the world food processing business.
It was early December when Mr Gardini and his French business associate Mr
Jean-Marc Vernes, paid FFr1.65bn (Dollars 318m) for a large slice of
France's commodities industry.
They went on to attract help from an international consortium of some of the
biggest players in the world sugar, grain and starch industries, creating a
large and potentially very influential alliance, with tentacles in the US,
across Europe and in the territories of the former Soviet Union.
The deal gave Mr Gardini and his allies majority control of Cacao Barry, the
world's largest cocoa bean processor, and Sogeviandes and Vital, France's
largest meat trader and processor, plus a stake in their former owner,
loss-making Sucres et Denrees (Sucden), France's top commodity dealer.
It makes Mr Gardini a potential competitor to Beghin Say, the French sugar
group chaired by Mr Vernes, which is controlled by Ferruzzi. Mr Gardini said
he would try to avoid competing against Eridiana, Ferruzzi's sugar division,
'but if we can't avoid it, we can't,' he added.
Mr Gardini, chairman of Gardini e Associati (GEA), the holding group which
controls the former Sucden companies, will spend much of this month visiting
managers before settling on firm plans.
The establishment of food processing businesses in eastern Europe, where
demand can only grow and where 'the exporter must become an investor', may
become a priority, said Mr Gardini. 'One can set up in a market that needs
imports, but if possible, one must also get established in the country.
Currently, neither Cacao Barry nor Sogeviandes are in the countries of
eastern Europe. We will have to reflect on this,' he said.
He wants wider co-operation with his partners, Archer Daniel Midland (ADM),
the large US grain processing company, Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK and CIP, the
Luxembourg-based holding group which controls extensive European starch
interests. Each have a 5 per cent stake in GEA. Tate &amp; Lyle admitted just
after the deal that GEA was more interesting as a 'convenient vehicle' for
pooling the partners' world contacts and industry insights, than as an
investment in the Sucden businesses.
It is too early to go into details. 'The knowledge that each partner has of
international affairs could lead to joint projects. Our territory is the
experience that each one of us has. Rather than fighting between us on
certain projects, we will be able to realise them together,' said Mr
Gardini.
He dismissed any suggestion that his new partners would hold the whip hand
over GEA, by virtue of their market power and the close links that exist
between them.
'This is a natural and simple association between people from the same
profession,' insisted Mr Gardini, pointing out they have all agreed that he
should be 'president director general of the group in the French sense of
the term', meaning that he has wider powers than an Anglo-Saxon chairman or
chief executive. He added that it was he who asked them if they would like
to join, rather than the other way round.
Mr Gardini said he had an 'intellectual affinity' with Mr Dwayne Andreas,
the 73-year-old head of ADM, who has extensive and very highly placed
contacts in the former Soviet Union.
Mr Pierre Callebaut, chairman of CIP and Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp;
Lyle are 'old acquaintances,' added Mr Gardini, though senior French sugar
industry executives said they thought the Englishman and Mr Gardini were
fierce competitors.
The close ties between Mr Gardini's new allies are not surprising, given the
clubbish traditions of the world sugar industry. ADM, for example, is Tate &amp;
Lyle's largest single shareholder, while CIP's Mr Callebaut has been on the
UK company's board since 1988 and is said to be a close ally of Mr Andreas.
Tate &amp; Lyle and CIP jointly own CST, a leading European starch and sweetener
group.
Mr Gardini, Mr Jean-Marc Vernes and the Societe Centrale d'Investissement
(SCI), a French investment company which they jointly control, have 85 per
cent of GEA between them, with the rest in the hands of their allies. 'We
have not thrown out the idea of having other associates so long as there are
no conflicts of interests. This will permit us to enlarge our horizons,'
said Mr Gardini.
The progress of the alliance will be watched with the keenest interest by
the French commodities industry.
Rival food industry executives do not believe that Mr Gardini's arrival can
be seen as a guarantee of survival for the troubled Sucden, which has made
heavy job cuts and raised a FFr1.1bn bridging loan from its banks since
losing FFr476m in 1990.
The French government seems to have taken on the role of defender of
Sucden's fortunes, after its controversial decision in November to allot to
Sucden and Interagra, another French food group, a Dollars 405m,
food-for-oil barter deal with the Soviet Union.
This move raised a chorus of protest from French commodity group
competitors, which claimed they were not asked to tender for this important
contract.
However, the arrival of Mr Gardini does give Sogeviandes and Cacao Barry an
ambitious and cash-rich parent, in place of a deeply indebted one.

SEARS, Roebuck one of the largest retailers in the US, yesterday announced
plans to eliminate about 7,000 jobs through a Dollars 60m investment
programme in automated customer service facilities.
The Chicago-based company, whose management has faced criticism from
shareholders recently and where retailing profits fell in the third quarter,
said that it hoped to achieve annual cost savings of about Dollars 50m,
beginning in 1992.
The investment will purchase 28,000 new point-of-sale terminals, and 6,000
automated customer service 'mini-kiosks'. Installation of the equipment
should be completed by the end of the first quarter. Sears said the cash
register side of the investment programme should add about 5,000 terminals
to the sales floor.
About 1,000 full-time non-sales jobs would be eliminated, together with some
5,900 part-time clerical positions, the company said. About 676,000 sq ft of
back office space would be converted to sales usage.
Sears said that employees affected by the moves would be offered the
opportunity to switch to other store positions.
The company said that it planned to test different delivery options for its
catalogue merchandise. The aim was to increase the number of direct home
deliveries, reducing the amount of catalogue merchandise which was held at
store pick-up areas.
The US retailer has been under considerable pressure recently; the
merchandise group, which covers the stores, catalogue business and the Sears
credit card, reported a 60 per cent fall in after-tax profits in 1990, to
Dollars 257.4m.

<TEXT>
PORSCHE, the German luxury sports car company whose earnings have suffered
as a result of weakness in world markets, yesterday said sales in the US had
slumped from 9,100 to 4,400 last year, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. In
December, they totalled 270 cars against 800 the year before.
The steep decline in what used to be its dominant market - it sold nearly 70
per cent of output in the US before business was hit by the 1987 stock
market crash and dollar weakness - was generally expected in view of the
recession in the US and the problems of the motor sector in North America.
Porsche will next week spell out details of its performance at its annual
press conference near Stuttgart. It has already said that net profits in its
financial year to July 31 1991 fell to less than DM60m (Dollars 39m) from
DM68.4m.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Co-operating on a voyage into uncharted
territory - The complexities of the transatlantic administration of Maxwell
Communication Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S legal rulings on the control of Maxwell Communication
Corporation mark an unprecedented attempt at transatlantic co-operation in
insolvency practice - but one that represents, at best, the end of the
beginning.
The courts have approved an interim order which allows MCC to be run under
both UK administration and US Chapter 11 proceedings. Three partners in
Price Waterhouse have been given authority to take over from the directors
and run the holding company while developing a strategy for its future, in
co-operation with a US court-appointed examiner.
MCC's creditors have the chance to object to the arrangement in the US
courts on January 15. Even if the order is extended, the administrators face
uncharted territory with every subsequent step they take.
'We've done all this work and now we've reached the beginning,' says Mr
Colin Bird, one of the joint administrators, who can now start turning his
attention to issues other than legal ones.
A draft agreement was hammered out at the start of last week and backed by
the High Court in London. It was approved by Judge Tina Brozman in the US
bankruptcy court in New York on Friday.
At its heart is the concept of 'mutual recognition'. Mr Mark Homan, Mr Colin
Bird and Mr Jonathon Phillips of PW are allowed to operate as administrators
to MCC much as they would under UK insolvency law, but they are also
recognised by the US court.
At the same time, Mr Richard Gitlin, a partner with Hebb and Gitlin, a
Connecticut law firm, is the examiner, appointed under US bankruptcy law. He
acts as an officer of the US court, and is also recognised in the UK courts.
The administrators are recognised as the 'corporate governance' of MCC, and
are effectively empowered to run the company. They are generally allowed to
make disposals and obtain loans up to a value of Pounds 7m without further
approval.
They may also investigate the financial dealings of the subsidiaries and
dismiss or reduce the powers given to executives within the group.
However, to make disposals or arrange loans worth more than Pounds 7m they
must seek the approval of the examiner. For disposals or loans of above
Pounds 25m they must go directly to the US court for approval.
Within the MCC group, Macmillan and Official Airline Guides, and 15
subsidiaries held by these two companies, are granted special status within
the court order, where they are called the 'M&amp;O Group'.
The order states that Mr David Shaffer, chairman of both companies, should
continue in his role overseeing M&amp;O, but should make no disposals or
bankruptcy petitions without the approval of the administrators and the
examiner. If the administrators in turn want to place parts of the M&amp;O group
into UK insolvency proceedings, they must give reasonable notice to the
examiner, and place these companies into parallel Chapter 11 proceedings
where relevant.
They must also seek the examiner's approval if they have other plans for the
M&amp;O companies such as requesting any of them to borrow funds or pledge any
assets or reducing Mr Shaffer's powers.
Separately, the order states that the examiner or the administrators are
also empowered to employ an investment banker if they see the need, and the
examiner can delegate some investigations functions to PW where there is no
conflict of interest.
Mr Bird says there will be frequent meetings with the examiner, and progress
reports probably every week. 'I don't mind these arrangements as long as it
helps things to go smoothly,' he says.
Mr Evan Flaschen, a partner in Hebb and Gitlin, admits that the examiner has
been given considerable powers, while more normally the function is confined
to investigating allegations made to the US courts. 'It's a hard role to
understand,' he says.
He stresses that the examiner, while appointed by the court, cannot take on
the court's powers. For example, the administrators can still appeal to the
US court if they disagree with the examiner's decision. 'The examiner is
more a form of quasi-management,' he says.
While MCC is a UK-registered company, he says that the US courts claim
jurisdiction when there are directly-owned assets or substantial receivables
in the country. Although there are often clashes between the US and other
national courts over jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases, particularly with
Canada, he says: 'This is the first consensual approach I am aware of.'
MCC's creditors meet in London tomorrow to determine their reaction.
If they accept, the administrators could sell businesses during the coming
weeks. If they try to keep the group, or parts of it, together, they have
three months under UK insolvency law to draft a plan for approval by
creditors. Under US bankruptcy law they have 120 days to propose an 'exit
strategy' to the courts.
'The same commercial plan will result, but the mechanics will be different
in the two jurisdictions,' says Mr Bird. 'I hope we can take it that if we
get the right commercial plan we can find the mechanics to get it approved -
although it won't be easy.'
In the meantime, Chapter 11 requires regular formal meetings with creditors.
While these are not required in the UK, Mr Bird says most successful
administrations have regular informal creditors' meetings to win their
approval, so the process will involve little extra work. 'We will try to
dovetail the two,' he says.
Mr Flaschen adds: 'What strikes me is that with all the legal differences
this is a business solution. So far we have been able to persuade the two
courts that it makes sense even though it is not normally done. There are so
many issues to grapple with in the short term. But our focus now is January
15.'

Conrad Ritblat, the property surveying partnership headed by Mr John
Ritblat, has announced plans to incorporate into a limited partnership at
the start of February.
The move is intended to give the company a more streamlined management
structure and help it grow through acquisitions.
Mr David Pickard, chief executive, said there would be an internal market
for the shares which would allow senior staff to take money out of the
business when they retired. The shares would be distributed among the 33
partners.
Chesterton, one of the UK's largest surveyors, has merged with De Groot
Collis, a long-established London surveying firm.
Chesterton has issued De Groot Collis with 3.78m new ordinary shares,
representing 10 per cent of its increased share capital.

<TEXT>
HIGHER RENTAL income and dealing profits enabled Property Security
Investment Trust to more than double pre-tax profits in the six months to
end-September - from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 3m.
Net property and investment income rose from Pounds 7.62m to Pounds 8.84m,
while there were dealing profits of Pounds 43,000 compared to losses of
Pounds 887,000.
All interest in respect of investment properties continued to be charged to
revenue. As from April 1 this year all interest in respect of dealing
activities will be treated similarly, instead of being capitalised.
Sales of investments in property and securities, amounting to Pounds 639,000
(Pounds 1.43m), were taken as extraordinary credits. Including those,
earnings came to 2.27p (2.08p) and the interim dividend is stepped up from a
scrip-adjusted 1.25p to 1.5p.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sale of operating subsidiaries could take
place soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, said
yesterday that the sale of operating subsidiaries could take place soon
following approval of its administration plan by a New York court last
Friday, writes Richard Gourlay.
Mr Jonathan Phillips, a joint administrator, said it would be only a matter
of weeks before the first subsidiary could be sold.
An early candidate for sale was Macdonald, the UK publisher with imprints
that include Sphere and Futura.
At least three groups were interested in Macdonald, all led by former
employees of the publisher. The three were Simon &amp; Shuster, the Paramount
publishing company, a company called Headline, led by Mr Tim
Healey-Hutchinson, and Orion, formed by Mr Anthony Cheetham, formerly of
Random Century, with Lord Weidenfeld.
Mr Phillips said the administrators had had 70 enquiries about sales of
subsidiaries but that he could not say how many were serious.
The administration plan approved by judge Tina Brozman of the US bankruptcy
court would lead to creditors holding a controlling majority of the equity
in the reorganised company.
It would be formed around the core businesses of Macmillan, the school
publishing company, and Official Airline Guides, MCC's main assets, Mr
Phillips said.
Mr Peter Laister, who became chairman of MCC after Mr Kevin Maxwell resigned
in order to avoid conflicts of interest, had gone 'off salary', Mr Phillips
said. He was, however, remaining to help look after the interests of
pensioners who have been badly hit by the unauthorised transfer of cash from
their pension funds to private Maxwell companies.
He said Price Waterhouse 'had a handle' on where the main amounts of cash
missing from MCC went. In particular, they were still trying to trace the
shares of Berlitz, the languages and education company.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Boots' sales fall 'someway short' of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the chemists chain and retailing group, yesterday reported that sales
in the final quarter of 1991 had fallen 'someway short' of target.
The news prompted a 3 1/2 p fall in its share price to 421p and a shaving of
analysts' profits forecasts.
Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, also confirmed the
impression that Christmas had been slow for retailers.
Although it did not issue a formal trading statement, the company said it
had achieved single-figure sales increases in a 'difficult' December.
Ladieswear and foods performed well although menswear continued to be slack
apart from gift products, such as socks and pants.
However, M and S said food sales had held up well in the face of Sunday
opening by the big supermarket groups. 'There was no measurable effect from
our opposition being open on Sundays. We beat our estimates,' it said.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, described the company's
performance as a good result 'taking into account the tough economic climate
and the very heavy discounting in the retail market place'.
Sales from comparable space at the Boots the Chemists chain rose by 4.5 per
cent during the period. Personal care products and food were said to have
sold well although demand for electrical household goods and cosmetics was
weak.
In the retail division, Childrens World registered the strongest sales gains
with a 13.6 per cent increase in like-for-like sales while Boots Opticians
showed a 6.6 per cent improvement.
Although continuing depression in the car market made trade difficult for
Halfords, the car parts chain reported a 'very substantial' increase in
sales of car alarms.
'People may not be buying cars at the moment but they want to hang on to
what they've got,' the company said. Overall sales showed a 6.1 per cent
increase.
Boots' interests in the DIY market, which include Do-it-all - jointly owned
with WH Smith - and Fads, suffered in a highly competitive market. Sales at
AG Stanley, which takes in Fads, fell by 4.1 per cent while Do-it-all was 13
per cent down.
Do-it-all lost sales by not participating in a price war being waged before
Christmas between Texas Homecare and B&amp;Q. But Do-it-all has since started
discounting, producing a noticeable uplift in sales.
Analysts are now estimating annual profits from Boots to come in at about
the Pounds 365m mark.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: SG Warburg supported BT price with 22.5m
share buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG Securities, the global co-ordinator for the flotation in December
of the second tranche of British Telecommunications yesterday said that it
had bought 22.5m shares from the Treasury as part of measures designed to
help stabilise the share price.
The announcement could imply that Warburg has bought up to 96m shares in the
stock market since the December 9 float, which could have made it a profit
of about Pounds 1.5m.
The terms of the offer allowed Warburg to over-allot up to 7.5 per cent of
the tranche, up to 118m shares, and to cover that position by buying in the
market or from the Treasury if the price fell below the flotation price of
125p.
The measure was intended to help support the share price if necessary.
Given the strong demand at the float - institutions applied for nearly
double the allocated shares - it has been assumed that Warburg over-allotted
the full 7.5 per cent.
Yesterday's statement would then imply that it had bought up to 96m shares
in the market.
The new partly-paid shares slumped after the float to a low of 120 1/4 p on
December 23, but have since recovered to 125 1/2 p.
To make a profit from buying shares in the market, Warburg would have had to
buy at below about 122 1/2 p, given its commission costs.
If it had exercised the full over-allotment facility and had bought 96m
shares in the market at about the lowest price, it could have made Pounds
1.5m to Pounds 2m profit.
However, Warburg paid the Treasury 125p less commission costs for the 22.5m
shares and so would not have made a significant profit on those.
Including that purchase by Warburg, the total number of shares sold by the
Treasury is now nearly 1.6bn.
The government still owns 22 per cent of British Telecom.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBRIT International, the oil and gas exploration company, has resumed talks
with a possible white knight just two days before the hostile bid offer by
Pittencrief, the Scottish oil production and communications group, is due to
close.
AmBrit said it was in discussions about a recommended offer with United
Energy, a USM-quoted oil and gas group with which talks have already been
terminated once before.
Mr Alan Russett, chairman of AmBrit, said that although discussions had been
terminated just before Christmas due to the tight schedule, United had
approached the group again.
Although it was up to United to make any offer, AmBrit had to make an
announcement yesterday as its shares rose 10 per cent from 7p to 8p on the
day.
A recommended offer by United would be equivalent to at least 9p cash per
AmBrit ordinary, against Pittencrief's revised offer of 6p cash for every
AmBrit share or one new Pittencrief share for every 28 AmBrit shares.
'It is not a final offer and until it is a final offer there is only one
offer on the table,' said Mr Michael Munro, Pittencrief chairman.
The announcement comes as Pittencrief raised its holding in its target to
39.9 per cent with the acceptance by Martin Currie - AmBrit's largest
institutional shareholder, with a 9 per cent stake - of Pittencrief's all
share offer.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ratners faces downgrading by US credit
rating agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS, the ailing jewellery group, was dealt a further blow yesterday as
both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, announced
they were to review its debt for possible downgrading in anticipation of
poor trading results on both sides of the Atlantic.
S&amp;P will meet the company's management in the coming days to review the
group's current trading results, plans and projections. But it placed the
BBB rating on Ratners' variable-term preferred American depository shares on
credit-watch with negative implications. Moody's also placed the BAA2
preferred stock rating of Ratners under review for possible downgrade.
In London, the move caused little surprise and was not thought likely to add
significantly to the company's cost of borrowings given the low prevailing
interest rates in the US.
Ratners shares marked time yesterday as the market awaited further trading
information from the company later this week. They closed  1/2 p down at
21p.
The company, which has been looking to strengthen the board for many months,
is also believed to be close to appointing a non-executive chairman,
although any announcement will not necessarily coincide with the company's
trading statement due out on Friday.
Reports that Mr Gerald Ratner might be removed from the company altogether
were played down by some analysts. 'It is hard to imagine a Ratners without
a Ratner there,' said one.
Chase Manhattan yesterday emerged as the custodial owner of 5.1 per cent of
Ratners shares. This nominally makes it the second biggest shareholder
behind Schroders Investment Management, which at the end of November
controlled 9.9 per cent.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Whessoe calls for Pounds 8m to help finance
US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHESSOE is making a Dollars 21m (Pounds 11.2m) acquisition in the US and
raising Pounds 8.1m in a rights issue to help pay for it.
The engineering and pipework group said it needed the 1-for-4 issue, priced
at 185p, even though it had more than Pounds 10m in the bank last month.
Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said part of its cash was advance
payments from customers and so not free. The group also needed the capacity
to meet bonding requirements on large contracts.
Whessoe's recent expansion, including acquisitions in Italy and the US,
could push up its turnover to between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m this year,
compared with Pounds 57.9m in the year to September. This would considerably
increase working capital demands.
The purchase announced yesterday is of Varec, a California-based maker and
distributor of tank gauges and vapour control products. It is being bought
from Rosemount, part of Emerson Electric.
Mr Fleetwood said the deal continued the policy of reducing Whessoe's
dependence on the UK power industry. Varec would become part of the
instrumentation and control division, which last year contributed just over
a quarter of group turnover. Piping systems accounted for more than half,
with the rest in project engineering.
The group has so far proved resilient to the UK recession, pushing up
pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.4m last year. Mr Fleetwood said
it was helped by the 60 per cent of sales that lay overseas, by long-term
contracts and by its cash holdings.
The rights issue price of 185p compares with yesterday's close of 226p, down
8p after the announcement. The underwriters are Schroders and Hoare Govett
are the brokers.

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Rationalisation costs hit Aberdeen Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN TRUST, the financial services group which secured a Stock Exchange
listing last year, suffered a fall of more than 55 per cent in pre-tax
profits in the year to September 30 1991 because of exceptional items
related to rationalisation.
While operating profit was down by 6 per cent at Pounds 2.58m (Pounds
2.75m), exceptional items totalling Pounds 1.36m cut pre-tax profit to
Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 2.75m).
During the year Aberdeen Trust disposed of the insurance broking, life and
pensions and membership activities of the Country Gentlemen's Association,
acquired in 1989. This entailed redundancy provisions and costs relating to
vacant properties. There was also a net extraordinary loss of Pounds 76,000
(loss of Pounds 417,000) comprising net profits of Pounds 224,000 from the
sale of the CGA, and Pounds 300,000 flotation costs.
Aberdeen's turnover fell from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 10.8m, largely
reflecting the change in its activities with the sale of CGA. During the
year it acquired investment management responsibilities from Argosy Asset
Management which added Pounds 125m to funds under management.
It also bought Saltire Insurance Investments, an investment trust
specialising in insurance. This brought a 47 per cent stake in Cheval Asset
Management which manages fixed interest funds for Lloyd's syndicates. After
the year end it bought the remaining 53 per cent of Cheval, adding Pounds
300m to funds under management.
Aberdeen Trust now derives about 70 per cent of its turnover from fund
management and the rest from providing accountancy services to CGA members.
Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said that the quality of the company's
profits had improved with more from recurring management fees and less from
dealing.
The company said that 1992 should be clear of exceptional costs, but warned
that the outlook was uncertain because of political and economic worries.
A final dividend of 1.5p is proposed for an unchanged 2.5p total out of
earnings per share of 3.06p (4.43p).

FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem may sue in order to obtain Pounds
12.25m award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM, the construction group, said an arbitrator had awarded it
Pounds 12.25m, plus costs, in the latest round of its dispute with Carlton
Gate Development Company, a London development concern which went into
receivership in November.
Mowlem claims that Eagle Star, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies,
has a 50 per cent stake in CGDC and put the company into receivership to
avoid its financial obligations.
Mr John Marshall, joint managing director of Mowlem, said his company would
seek to obtain the sum awarded, plus costs, by suing Eagle Star and the
banking consortium - led by Security Pacific EuroFinance - which owns the
rest of CGDC.
He also intended to pursue the behaviour of the insurance company and the
banks with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of England.
Eagle Star said it continued to dispute Mowlem's claims and would strongly
defend any court action.
It considered the result of the arbitration was largely meaningless, because
CGDC was in receivership at the time of the hearings and so its criticisms
of Mowlem were not presented.
CGDC was set up to build luxury flats on the site of the old St Mary's
Hospital near the Regent's Canal on the edge of Maida Vale.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You refer ('Turkey in dumping move against Pakistan', December 12), to
the EC anti-subsidy proceeding against Turkish polyester fibres and yarns.
The reference is incorrect and incomplete.
First, the definitive resolution of the matter was in September 1991, so
your reference to provisional duties in June 1991 was outdated. Secondly, of
the 11 schemes investigated (and without prejudice to whether they all
qualified as countervailable subsidies, which we deny), the Commission
eventually identified only three - not eight - schemes requiring possible
countervailing action.
Third, many of these schemes had either been abolished during the
investigation period or during the course of the proceeding, or did not
apply to exports to the EC among others.
This was done within the context of Turkey's general programme of modifying
its industrial incentive schemes and phasing out those measures not
consistent with its international obligations. Consequently, the case was
settled by an undertaking between the Turkish government and the Commission.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Personal View: Tax reforms - from the absurd to the
ridiculous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DILNOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that Labour would raise
the basic rate of income tax to 35 per cent is absurd. Mr Lamont's team
tried to identify and cost all the public service aims of the Labour party,
and came up with Pounds 35bn. The Treasury team then estimated that Labour
could raise Pounds 10bn from a new top rate of income tax of 50p and the
abolition of the National Insurance ceiling. That left a Pounds 25bn gap to
be filled by a 10 per cent increase in the basic rate of income tax.
It may be that Pounds 35bn is what Labour's additional desired spending
would cost, but there is no suggestion that they would increase spending by
that amount immediately. The shadow chancellor John Smith and his team have
repeatedly said they would only spend as the economy grew and provided
additional resources.
The Tories' own desires look quite expensive: they want to spend Pounds 20bn
on cutting public sector borrowing to zero, and a further Pounds 12.5bn on
cutting the basic rate of income tax to 20 per cent. The Tory wish list adds
up to Pounds 32.5bn, not much less than Pounds 35bn.
Labour would not raise the basic rate by 10p, but neither could the party
deliver enormous increases in public spending. The Conservatives could not
cut taxes and borrowing in the short term. The speed with which either party
could achieve its aim depends almost entirely on the rate at which the
economy grows.
Coming closer to sensible debate, Labour has made some spending commitments
for the first year of a new parliament, to increase child benefit and the
state retirement pension. These increases would cost about Pounds 4bn a
year. To pay for these benefit changes, Labour proposes the abolition of the
National Insurance ceiling, and the new 50 per cent top-rate tax. The
abolition of the NI ceiling would hit everyone earning more than Pounds
20,280. As yet, Labour has been vague about where the new 50 per cent tax
rate will be imposed, but gross earnings of about Pounds 40,000 a year seem
a reasonable assumption.
The table illustrates the impact of these tax changes at various income
levels.
The clearest point to emerge is that the National Insurance change is far
more important than the new top income tax rate. Almost 4m people would lose
from the National Insurance reform; only about 750,000 from the new income
tax rate. And even at an income of Pounds 100,000 a year the loss from the
NI rise exceeds that from the additional income tax.
Far too much attention has been paid to income tax, and too little to the NI
proposals. These two changes are of radically different types: the income
tax increase is a simple piece of redistributive taxation, the NI proposal a
long overdue reform of an anomalous and unfair tax.
But the NI structure has become so anomalous and unfair that to remove the
ceiling in one Budget may be not only politically risky, but also
objectively too rapid a change. By the middle of 1991-92, average full-time
male non-manual earnings had reached the NI ceiling of Pounds 20,280. We now
have a system where the tax rate on those earning below this level is higher
at 34 per cent (combined income tax of 25 per cent and NI of 9 per cent)
than on those above-average earnings facing 25 per cent tax plus a smaller
NI percentage.
The NI system is a disgrace of which the government should be ashamed.
Labour should be congratulated for recognising the problem, and being
prepared to tackle it. But the immediate abolition of the ceiling would
impose losses of poll tax and higher proportions on 4m voters. If Labour did
not need the money to pay for its benefit promises, it would make more sense
to phase in this reform. Even now, it might be possible to move to such a
proposal, retaining the credit for equitable and efficient tax reform
without imposing such large losses on voters near the middle of the income
distribution.
Taxation may be a vital part of the pre-election debate, but thus far the
main parties have contributed little to that debate. The Conservatives try
to hide the increase in the tax burden since 1979 - and their lack of any
strategy for the tax system as a whole - behind cuts in income tax rates.
They also make silly accusations about what would happen to the basic rate
of tax if Labour were elected.
Although the Pounds 35bn accusation is ridiculous, Labour does seem to have
too many 'priorities', given its limited intentions for raising more money.
Its proposals on income tax continue to be vague, and it still tries to pass
off its laudable NI reform as one which will only hit those on very high
incomes.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Foreign Affairs: Suitable subjects for reform - A small,
international force would help extend the United Nations' peace-enforcement
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt,
is taking over an organisation which has recently seen a great boost to its
authority and prestige, but which still has a long way to go to attain its
founders' ambitious goals. The difficult task the world's top civil servant
faces is to capitalise on the UN's new scope for action resulting from the
end of the Cold War, by extending its role as a peace-maker and peace-keeper
to the civil and ethnic conflicts which are likely to dominate the world
scene until the turn of the century.
If, for the greater part of its 46-year life, the UN has had more detractors
than admirers, superpower rivalry must take much of the blame. Though member
nations never ceased to pay lip-service during the Cold War years to the
UN's idealistic objectives, the maintenance of international peace and
security, the organisation became little more than a forum for confrontation
between the great powers.
The ending of the Cold War changed all that. The new spirit of co-operation
between the US and the former Soviet Union was exemplified by the Security
Council's endorsement of the US-led military operation against Iraq, one of
the most effective joint actions in the UN's history. But with the break-up
of the Soviet Union into several independent republics, the cosy new
relationship built up between Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union and the
west risks being transformed once again.
Russia, it has been agreed, will take over the Soviet Union's permanent
Security Council seat. Plainly, it will not, given its present state of
economic chaos and the prospect of more political upheavals, want to cross
the US and its western allies or play too active a role on the international
stage for some years. That might be seen as a benefit by some western
governments. But Russia's very weakness, and the risk that growing internal
social and economic tensions could lead to further violent upheavals in the
states of the former Soviet Union, is posing an entirely new problem for the
UN. Instead of a balance of power, the international organisation is now
likely to suffer from an imbalance of power.
The checks and balances within the Security Council which existed even
during the declining years of the Soviet Union, could disappear altogether,
leading to what even Washington's friends might consider an unduly dominant
position for the US. That is an unhealthy situation in the longer term and
it raises a question which most members of the Security Council, the
permanent five in particular, have been unwilling to answer: has the moment
arrived to increase the permanent membership of the council?
That two of the world's leading economic powers, Germany and Japan, the
world's second most populous state, India, and South America's leading
nation, Brazil, should continue to be excluded from the UN's core
institution is an anachronism which takes no account of international
developments since the Second World War. Neither membership of the nuclear
club nor being one of the Second World War victors should continue to be the
main criterion for permanent Security Council membership at a time when
economic factors arguably play a much greater role than military power in
preserving or undermining international security.
No doubt, any suggestion that the number of permanent Security Council
members should be increased would open a Pandora's box of problems. If
Brazil, why not Nigeria? If Germany, why not Italy? Should the European
Community be given a permanent seat instead of the separate seats held by
Britain and France? All these and many other questions are as valid as they
are complex. But the difficulty of finding solutions cannot be a permanent
pretext for failing to tackle a problem which is fundamental to the
organisation's credibility.
If the composition of the Security Council is a suitable subject for reform,
a revision of the limitations the UN has hitherto set on the kind of
military actions it can undertake is also required to meet entirely new
situations. The break-up of previously unified states such as Yugoslavia in
an atmosphere of civil strife and bloodshed often has much wider than purely
domestic implications. Because of regional ethnic dimensions it could set
alight much of the Balkans, and therefore clearly comes under the heading of
a situation that could threaten international peace and security.
So far, the UN has restricted itself to two kinds of military actions. The
first are peace-keeping operations, strictly circumscribed by a number of
criteria under which UN forces can be deployed only with the consent of all
parties, after a ceasefire is in place, and on condition that their arms are
used only in self-defence.
The other main military option open to member countries is the kind of
large-scale operation which can be authorised by the Security Council under
Chapter VII of the UN Charter, such as the one undertaken to counter North
Korea's attack on South Korea in 1950 and to reverse Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1991. In both cases an ad hoc multilateral force was assembled
under US command. Yet in spite of his official designation as commander of
UN forces in Korea, US General Douglas MacArthur never reported directly to
the Security Council and the US decision to cross the 38th parallel dividing
North and South Korea did not receive the advance approval of the other
Council members. In short, the Security Council had no control over the
military operations undertaken on its behalf.
In the case of the Gulf conflict, a UN joint command was not even formally
established and it long remained unclear whether US war aims would lead
American forces to take Baghdad in an attempt to overthrow President Saddam
Hussein. This was certainly not an objective spelt out in any of the
Security Council resolutions on the subject.
A growing body of opinion considers that contemporary 'internal' conflicts
such as the ones in Yugoslavia and Somalia and the earlier civil conflict in
Liberia, require operations 'somewhere between peace-keeping and peace
enforcement,' in the words of Sir Brian Urquhart, a former UN
Under-Secretary-General. The big sledge-hammer used in the Gulf is clearly
not appropriate for use in such circumstances. But a genuine alternative
solution is offered by article 43 of the UN Charter, under which all members
would undertake to make armed forces available to the Security Council by
special agreements 'for the purpose of maintaining international peace and
security'.
Such a relatively small international force could be assembled quite
quickly, since it would be made up of units previously earmarked by member
states for contingencies of this kind. Placed under a UN commander directly
responsible to the Security Council, it would be clearly identified with the
UN from the start, instead of with the country providing the largest
military contribution, as in the Gulf conflict.
The imprimatur of impartiality given by a genuine UN force would be of great
political advantage in a situation such as the one in Yugoslavia, where the
respective factions are particularly prone to accuse outsiders of bias in
favour of one ethnic nationality or another. Moreover, nobody else,
certainly not the European Community or the US, is likely to do the job
required in Yugoslavia. Mr Boutros Ghali and the member states should not
miss the best opportunity that they have had for decades to put the UN's
peace-keeping and peace-enforcement capacity on a permanent footing.

Sir, as a member of the Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education
(CATE), I rather object to the claim in your leading article that Mr Kenneth
Clarke's proposal to move part of teacher training from colleges to schools
demonstrates a failure on his part to 'consult widely' or to 'consider
expert opinion'. As he stated in his speech at Southport, the secretary of
state has worked closely with CATE on the new proposals and has certainly
listened to what CATE has had to say. Moreover, the current proposals are
even now being put out for consultation.
Furthermore, far from there being no consensus about the shift in teacher
training, as you claim, both the inspectorate and most of the teacher
unions, at least, consider it to be sound in principle. The period of
consultation now upon us will doubtless refine the practicability of the
scheme.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on Kenneth Clarke's plans to change the teacher training
system in the UK ('Education and the election', January 6) rightly refers to
them as 'panicky electioneering'.
In the subject I represent, mathematics, there is little support for yet
more change in the schools and on the cheap. Already Mr Clarke's policies
have guaranteed that we will be short of mathematics teachers for the
foreseeable future. He has ensured that those mathematics teachers who are
still teaching will be so overworked, overburdened with bureaucracy, and
stressed, that they will have little time, energy or enthusiasm left to take
on other responsibilities. His new plans are unlikely to stem the flow of
experienced teachers out of school and will not attract more newcomers into
mathematics teaching.
What these plans will do is change Britain from a country which has many of
the best-trained maths teachers in Europe to one having many of the
worst-trained. Teacher trainers come from all countries to study and learn
from our methods and our professional approaches are admired worldwide.
Some politicians do recognise the complex nature of learning to teach
successfully a subject like mathematics to all children. Mr Clarke clearly
doesn't, and his ideological actions should be questioned by all who
understand the nature of professional responsibility.

<TEXT>
Sir, As an Englishman living in Germany I feel obliged to take issue with
John Willman's ('With Friends like Germans', January 4) intemperate
comments.
Certainly the Bundesbank increased interest rates recently. It did so solely
to correct an overheated domestic economy and, in fact, followed the Bank of
England's example of 12 to 18 months ago. Moreover, the German Bundesbank is
wholly independent of German government control and it is therefore
incorrect to imply that it was part of a Teutonic plot to dominate Europe.
Second, what is wrong with Germany recognising the independence of Croatia
and Slovenia? Almost every British newspaper and periodical that I have read
has been sympathetic to these new states and certainly the Foreign Office's
apparent indifference to the situation has not improved matters one iota.
Finally, Social Charter. The Germans did not impose this on Europe. All EC
members supported it with the exception of the UK government, which will
conceivably lose the next general election as a result.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article, 'Dividends in recession' (January 4), highlighted
one of the most worrying features of British industry - the low level of
investment in new plant and technology. You showed that a large proportion
of my shareholders, the pension funds, only pay an effective rate of 13 1/3
per cent tax on the dividends we distribute. If we choose to retain some of
this money in order to invest in plant and equipment, the same shareholders
would effectively pay tax on those funds at a rate of 35 per cent, less the
capital allowances - say a net 25 per cent.
Institutions have been pressing companies to maintain dividends, even if
profits are reducing. There is an obvious tax reason for this. Some rights
issue proceeds may even have been used to maintain dividend payments.
Meanwhile, our German competitors, under no such pressures, retain far more
of their profits within their businesses, creating new technology and
manufacturing capacity to enable them to increase their share of the British
consumer markets.
Should not Mr Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Smith, the shadow chancellor,
be addressing this absurd situation?

FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Commitment to better quality statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT MARKLESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Smith is quite correct when he suggests that the government's
economic decision-making has been affected detrimentally by the
deteriorating quality of official statistics.
His criticisms echo those of many of us who for years have been concerned
about the quality of statistics provided by government, not only in
economics but in all fields of social policy. Indeed, I have yet to meet
anyone outside the government and the Government Statistical Service (GSS)
who does not believe that there is a problem.
John Smith's proposed solution, whereby an independent statistical service
is set up, may well be a long-term answer and should be the subject of
further public debate. Such a radical change, however, would cause a great
deal of upheaval and could take time to become established.
Any government seriously wishing to restore public confidence in official
statistics would do well in the short term to set up an independent national
statistics council to act as a watchdog, as we in the Social Science Forum
have consistently argued. For such a body to be effective, it would have to
be independent of government, reporting directly to parliament, as the
National Audit Office does. It would have the responsibility of providing a
mechanism through which interested parties could contribute to decisions
about the content of official statistics and of adjudicating where
accusations of political abuse were made.

Sir, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, makes some arguably valid points
in his Personal View ('How to make the Budget a real budget', January 6) and
in particular that relating to the need to ensure the independence of the
Government Statistical Service. But he fails to make any commitment to
introduce these reforms should he find himself the actual chancellor.
This leaves one with the feeling that he wishes to keep his options open in
the event of electoral success. Does he wish to be selective about the
statistics he would present, and avoid full public debate on fiscal policy?
Such an evasion is something for which he criticises the present government
by innuendo.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Brave new world of electronics: Technology is changing at a
rapid pace, but companies are still not sure where the developments are
leading

Do you long for the day when you can toss out the remote control on your
video machine and, when you leave for work in the morning, tell it in plain
English to record your favourite afternoon soap opera? Or perhaps you would
enjoy flipping up a screen on your CD player, while travelling on the 7:58
train from Sevenoaks, and watching a movie on the way to work.
Better still, why not stay at home and work via a machine that fits in the
palm of your hand, sending and receiving sound, text and crystal clear
pictures by means of an inbuilt digital communicator? When work is done, you
could relax by donning the video goggles, earphones and electronic sensors,
and enjoying a computer-generated fantasy of your choice.
The technology for these devices, and many more, is developing at startling
speed. Electronic gadgets that may still pass for implausible science
fiction are suddenly looking like realistic, if expensive and risky,
business propositions for high-technology companies. Indeed, technology is
advancing so rapidly that the business strategy for consumer electronics
companies is shifting fundamentally.
These companies, in Japan and elsewhere, have been working for years to
develop technology to improve the performance of products we know and love,
from televisions to stereos. Now they are faced with a simultaneous
explosion of different technologies that have created almost limitless
possibilities for the design of electronic goods. The question is: what are
they going to do with them?
The pace of change, including the rapid advance of digital processing, has
torn down the barriers between separate categories of goods, such as
televisions, telephones, stereos and computers, and is leading to new types
of products - many in the broad category of multi-media devices that perform
multiple functions.
It has also prompted a budding strategic alliance between Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics company, and Apple Computer, the US personal computer
maker, two of the most innovative companies in their respective fields.
Companies' success in developing new products will determine whether they
are able to maintain the rapid growth that has characterised the electronics
industry for several decades. The growth products of the 1980s, such as
video recorders, personal computers, or Walkman-type cassette players, are
approaching market saturation and new products are needed to sustain the
momentum. The electronics companies will also be keen to get a decent return
from their research spending, which for Matsushita and Sony last year came
to about 10 per cent of sales.
Hints of the brave new world in consumer electronics can be seen in products
coming to market now:
Video displays: Sharp, the Osaka-based electronics company, took the lead in
offering compact and portable video displays last year when it offered for
sale an 8.6-inch colour television that hangs flat on a wall. The television
uses liquid crystal display (LCD) technology that eliminates the need for
the traditional bulky, heavy picture tube. Improvements in manufacturing
technology in the coming years should steadily reduce the price below the
current Y550,000 (Pounds 2,350), and allow for larger flat-screen TVs that
can be moved about easily and consume little electricity.
Already, in Japan, a 5.6-inch colour LCD television that should keep the
kids quiet in the back seat of the car is available for about Pounds 400.
For big screens, more popular in Japan and the US than Europe, the quality
has improved steadily, both for large picture tubes and projection
televisions, in which the image is projected on to a flat screen bigger than
the 40-inch technical limit for glass tubes. The gradual increase in picture
quality for traditional broadcast standards will continue as digital
processing and other small improvements are introduced.
High-quality TV projection on to these large screens, up to 100 inches and
more, will require high-definition television (HDTV). Otherwise the flaws in
older broadcast standards are simply magnified. HDTV is only available in
Japan today, but should become available in Europe by the middle of the
decade.
Digital music: digital music on compact disc has already virtually put
traditional long-playing records out of business. The technology is now
being developed further: this year Sony is launching its MiniDisc, a compact
disc (CD) player that, after a few years of miniaturisation, should be
little bigger than a small matchbox. Meanwhile, Philips and Matsushita are
launching the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), which will play a digital tape
about the same size as traditional (analog) cassette tapes.
Both the MiniDisc and DCC achieve miniaturisation by using new technology to
compress digital data, although sound quality is compromised to some extent
compared with a full-sized CD.
Sony's MiniDisc, which can record as well as play music, will be smaller,
giving it the edge on portability, and will contain circuits to prevent it
skipping tracks when knocked about. This is a problem with portable CD
players on the market today.
DCC machines have the advantage of being able to play old-style analog
cassettes, as well as play and record digital tapes. But they will never be
smaller than the most minute Walkman-type tape players, and it remains to be
seen whether digital tape audio quality will be significantly better than
for analog tapes, which have seen quality steadily improve.
Compact discs: the little CD read by a laser currently used for music is
becoming an ever more capable performer. The digital information that it
stores can be used for other functions, from text to moving colour images.
Within a few years, most personal computers may come with a CD drive.
Sony has tapped just a small part of the CD's potential with its Data
Discman, which will be available in the UK from this spring and which can
display reference books stored on a small 8cm CD. The latest model displays
simple illustrations and produces sound - actually pronouncing the
dictionary entries.
Philips and Sony have jointly developed the compact disc interactive format
(CD-I), a full-sized CD that can display moving pictures and text, and play
music. It could, for example, display the score of an opera while playing
it. Sony is planning to use the CD-I to publish comic books in Japan, where
they are extremely popular.
The storage capacity of CDs is also being improved. Pioneer Electronic and
Sony are both working on technologies to increase capacity by between four
and 20 times. If a CD could store an entire feature film, it could undermine
the less portable and less flexible videotape business.
Yet the latest products using CDs, such as the CD-I, are taking electronics
companies into unknown territory because they go far beyond the scope of
traditional forms of entertainment. While no one could predict with
certainty that video recorders would be so successful, there was at least a
body of popular films and television material that could be used on the
machines. Similarly, an improved stereo system, like the compact disc player
launched in 1982, had an obvious appeal to music lovers and a ready library
of 'software' - ie, popular music - to be recorded on CD.
It is far less obvious what to do with the CD-I. So far there is little
software in the form of prepared compact discs to go with the new machines.
This has become a general problem: advanced technology has vastly broadened
the scope for what machines can potentially do, but the software has lagged
far behind.
Mr Nobuyuki Idei, a Sony director, explains the dilemma: 'In the past the
hardware and software were separate businesses. The software was (freely
available). Now we cannot think about hardware without software.'
Electronics companies are aware of the need to keep the supply of 'software'
growing, by gaining, for example, access to film libraries. Two years ago
Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.86bn) for Columbia Pictures and, in 1988,
Dollars 2bn for CBS Records, while last December Matsushita made a Dollars
6.1bn (Pounds 3.35bn) acquisition of MCA, the US entertainment group that
includes Universal Studios.
At least two new concepts under development are moving electronics companies
on to uncertain ground:
Virtual reality: the interactive computer simulation of visual, audio and
tactile reality, triggered by body movements detected by electronic sensors,
is still primitive.
Computers can generate the visual and auditory sensation of pushing a ball
around in space in response to finger movements and will eventually be able
to simulate the sights and sounds of much more complex environments -
everything from tropical islands to space machines. Virtual reality machines
put the participants into these environments, and allow them to manipulate
them. An orchestra may respond to the beat of a simulated baton, or the
world blow up at the touch of an imagined button.
Sony has set a team of scientists to work on the concept in the full
knowledge that developing a successful mass market for virtual reality
machines is beyond the company's traditional strengths in making the
hardware. Mr Idei says: 'For virtual reality we have to depend entirely on
new artists. We need a lot of people like Steven Spielberg.'
Multi-media: this is the buzzword for a new generation of computers, still
at the drawing board stage, with sophisticated video and audio capabilities.
They could be, for example, small interactive machines that play CD-quality
music, receive and display moving and still pictures, send and receive data,
and perform computing functions. They could have applications in education,
but the consumer market potential is uncertain.
'The possibilities for multi-media are very big,' says Mr Masaharu Noyori,
head of technology planning at Matsushita Electric Industrial. Yet, who
needs it? In spite of the vast technological possibilities, Mr Noyori admits
that the biggest problem facing Matsushita is working out what people want.
The dangers of spending millions on developing machines that flop in the
market are huge. Market research is not necessarily a help because consumers
themselves are unlikely to know what they want until machines hit store
shelves.
Sony is teaming up with Apple Computer and Motorola to develop multi-media
products. The details of their co-operation have not been announced, but
Sony's expertise in audio-visual technology will be combined with Apple's
experience in personal computing and Motorola's capabilities in digital
cellular phone technology. Mr Idei says: 'This is the merger of the computer
and audio-visual industries. It will take 10 years, but it will come.'
This is brave talk. From a technical standpoint, less and less separates the
many branches of the consumer electronics family. Yet creative genius, as
much as engineering and manufacturing prowess, will be required to turn all
this technology into products that succeed.
The necessity of tapping into the artistically 'creative' side of the
business has been recognised not only by Sony and Matsushita, but also by
Pioneer, Toshiba and JVC, all of which have formed close links with American
entertainment companies. Such has been the pace of their technological
innovation of late that Japanese companies are having to make big new
efforts to broaden their horizons, in order to exploit ideas developing
elsewhere.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Hurry home, Mr Bush
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SADLY, Japan-bashing has now become a presidential activity, to the world's
regret and Mr Bush's shame. The ostensible purpose to his current visit to
Japan is to secure better access for US products in Japanese markets. But
the real reason is to divert responsibility for the US's current - and
deep-seated - economic ills away from his administration.
To blame any one president for America's relative economic decline would be
absurd. But Mr Bush can, and should, be roundly condemned for descending to
the depths of xenophobic, economic nationalism reached by so many of his
Congressional opponents. US elections should not be fought at the expense of
relations between the world's most important economic powers.
One depressingly familiar sign of the Bush administration's desperate slide
towards mercantilism is its obsession with the size of Japan's trade
surplus. The fact that Japan exports more to the rest of the world than the
rest of the world exports to Japan does not mean that Japan's markets are
not open to foreign producers.
Japanese trade policy is neither depressing US manufacturing output nor
cutting American jobs, as Mr Bush well knows. Japan has a trade surplus
because, as a nation, it saves more than it invests. The US has a trade
deficit because it invests more than it saves, largely because the fiscal
deficit is such a drain on American savings.
Bullying
Even less relevant as proof of unfair trade practices is the bilateral US
deficit with Japan, which has, in any case, remained roughly constant over
the past year. There may well be non-tariff barriers against exports to
Japan. But the Gatt is the forum in which to seek redress for
anti-competitive trade distortions. Bilateral bullying for specific and
self-serving trade concessions is not the right way.
Yet bullying the Japanese serves a particular, political purpose for Mr
Bush. The US public remains worried by the lack of economic growth, in spite
of repeated cuts in interest rates, and the failure of US companies to stand
up to foreign competition. The electorate is looking for a scapegoat, and Mr
Bush would do anything to avoid its being him.
So the Japanese are to get the blame. Hence Mr Bush's decision to take 21
professional scapegoat hunters with him. The inclusion of the chief
executives of the US's failing big three car manufacturers is particularly
pertinent. Few have been more shrill than Chrysler's Mr Lee Iacocca in their
demands for state subsidies and protectionism. His lectures to the Japanese
on the need for free and fair trade will have a certain irony.
Marked contrast
The CEOs of the US car industry, in fact, embody many failings of US
corporate, capitalist culture. Over the years they have paid themselves too
much, collaborated with trade unions in short-term thinking which failed to
create a well-trained and flexible workforce and underestimated the
importance of product quality.
Not merely in these respects, but, above all, in the relatively poor
performances of their companies, do they stand in marked contrast to their
Japanese counterparts. The fact that the average US CEO earns 125 times the
annual remuneration of a manufacturing worker, compared to just 16 times in
Japan, is one indication of the contrast. The failure of the US corporate
culture is just one part of America's structural impediments to efficiency.
Add the poor record of US education, and the low savings rate, and the
causes of the US's relative decline begin to emerge.
It would be naive to suggest that Mr Bush can solve any of these problems.
But he should go home determined to look for ways to address them, rather
than try to paint as the devil the very nation from which the US has most to
learn. In so doing he risks shifting the parameters of next year's
presidential campaign from whether the US should embrace protectionism to
how tight the embrace should be. Mr Bush, once an ardent free-trader, knows
how dangerous that would be, not just for the US but for the world.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Dog in a Manger - Cockpit Theatre, NW8
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have seen only five plays by the Spanish master Lope de Vega (1562-1635) -
he wrote at least 500, possibly 800 - but what staggers me about these few
is the way he shows love and jealousy as subversive forces. Here is another
superb work, which, though here receiving its first professional production
in Britain, is, according to the advance blurb, perhaps the most enduringly
popular of them all.
The eponymous dog in a manger is a countess, Diana. No sooner does she find
that her secretary Teodoro is paying clandestine attentions to her
lady-in-waiting Marcela that she realises she loves him herself. Which
should rule - love or social propriety? She vacillates: she wins his love,
she rejects it, she punishes Marcela, she sends him away, she keeps him at
court. She treats him, as Marcela remarks, like a bucket in a well - raising
him only to empty him, lowering him only to desire him.
Dog in a Manger is a comedy. That is, Lope makes it richly funny and gives
it a happy ending, sort of. Yet its central situation is so real and
disturbing that until the last minute we don't know how it will end. Or even
how we want it to end. There is a wonderful ambiguity about both Diana and
Teodoro. How much is her love really just possessive jealousy? And how much
is his love sheer ambition? Lope never quite makes them that transparent to
us, but he makes them wonderfully intense. In the most burning scene of
confused emotions, Diana boxes Teodoro's nose and makes him bleed; but he,
amid his shock, longs to 'stroke the hand that struck.'
De Musset treated a similar subject in Don't Play With Love, recently
broadcast on BBC radio, though the twists and turns of his plot culminate in
a bitter conclusion. The thrill of Lope's play lies in its tragicomic shifts
of tone; and its floods of oxymorons and imagery. Teodoro compares the
Countess to the sun, and himself to Icarus, sure to fall for flying so near
the heat; but later he likens her to a mere sunflower, turning her head this
way and that. The Countess reminds him that her name is Diana, the moon, and
that he may ascend into the moonlight without scorching. At her next
rejection, therefore, he sees himself to a wolf howling for the moon. And so
the language blooms in quick accord with the plot.
The translation, by John Farndon, indulges in expletives and terms of abuse
that, though funny, are out of character. It is, however, fresh and fluent
and often uses rhyming quatrameters with surprising success. The staging,
which Martin Lloyd-Evans directs and which was seen on the 1991 Edinburgh
Fringe, is not for refined connoisseurs of verse-speaking or gesture - and
yet I have known more experienced actors turn Spanish baroque drama into
something far more flat, repressed and unlyrical. Jane Hillier (Diana) and
David Howarth (Teodoro) lead a cast who relish all the vigour, surprises and
range of this exhilarating play.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Arts: Lully's 'Alceste' in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some centenaries work. Lully's tercentenary came in 1987: in Paris the
echoes have not died down but rather increased. From being a respected name
in books and useful provider of warmers-up for song recitals, he is climbing
up the classical charts. At the Champs-Elysees, the beautiful theatre now
one of the city's auxiliary opera houses, a spectacular staging of his
Alceste brilliantly inaugurates a series of annual Lully revivals, backed up
by concert performances of relevant works (Gluck's Alceste included),
lectures, exhibitions, sumptuously illustrated handbooks about 'tragedie
lyrique'. At the Opera-Comique they are reviving the Arts Florissants
production of Atys which won much praise in the tercentenary year.
No half-measures or cheese-paring over Alceste. Producer Jean-Louis
Martinoty has surrounded himself with a team of talents - Hans Schavernoch
(sets), Daniel Ogier (costumes), Jacques Benyeta (lighting). The
choreography, essential feature of an opera written by an expert dancer for
a society mad about dancing, is by Marie-Genevieve Masse and Francois
Raffinot. The Compagnie Barocco provides the dancers. Someone recently
described Lully as 'the Diaghilev of his time, but a Diaghilev who could
compose like Stravinsky and dance like Nijinsky'. That is not all: he
coached, conducted and produced. Only Wagner rivalled him, and he didn't
dance.
Preparations for the first Alceste in 1674 were shared between Versailles
and Paris, the heavy transport expenses for scenery and machines paid by the
passionately interested Louis XIV, who attended rehearsals when he could.
Because of court mourning the premiere took place not at Versailles but in
Paris in the Palais Royal, the public theatre where Lully's operas were
shown sooner or later to enthusiastic audiences ready to go again and again.
Since Lully had a monopoly, there were no alternative choices.
Alceste was the second of the 'tragedies lyriques' Lully wrote with Philippe
Quinault, whose exceptional gifts as a librettist are now recognised again.
There are many differences from the version of the story used by Gluck.
Alceste is betrothed but not yet married to Admete. Alcide (Hercules) plays
an important role: he loves Alceste devotedly. Having retrieved her from the
underworld after she has sacrificed herself to save Admete (wounded in
battle), he nobly gives her up to the man she loves. Lycomede, King of
Skyros, is also in love with her.
Comedy mingles freely with the serious matter. Alcide and Lycomede have
confidants, Lychas and Straton, both in hot pursuit of Alceste's confidante
Cephise, whose view of morality is in complete contrast - she welcomes both
young men and would like more. One famous episode is the rough and ready but
not unfriendly treatment by Caron (Charon) of the dead souls clamouring to
cross the Styx in his bark.
It is the great achievement of this staging that the producer, aided by
Quinault and Lully's dramaturgical and musical skills, has ensured that the
darker moments - Alceste and Admete grieving for his approaching death, the
long scene of public mourning for Alceste, and most of all the sacrifice of
Alcide, stand out strongly from the comedy and the mass of spectacle and
movement. An art-form long regarded as dauntingly old-fashioned and
overcomplicated is now, with each major revival of Lully or Rameau, being
revealed as full of life, relevance, entertainment value and, given the
means, eminently stageworthy.
Schavernoch's designs boldly and imaginatively blend French Baroque with
modern styles. There are machines galore - gods and goddesses descend from
the skies on puffy silver clouds, fat little Cupids fly about, huge blown-up
photographs of formal gardens or seascapes are viewed through tall windows
with giant Venetian blinds with revolving slats polished like mirrors. There
is a stunning effect when they reflect a floor-cloth painted like a baroque
ceiling. Costumes are Baroque theatre traditional, worn in the French way
with pride and unselfconsciousness.
As the heroine, Colette Alliot-Lugaz gives yet another enchanting
performance. She uses more, and more convincing, period gesture than anyone
else. Howard Crook sings Admete with his usual poise. No-one could make the
character seem worth so much sacrifice. Jean-Philippe Lafont asked
indulgence for a bad throat, but his Alcide is a noble, commanding, moving
figure. He is one of the lucky ones who can dominate a stage while keeping
still. Francois Loup mops and mows as the oily Lycomede. The comedy roles
are in the expert hands of Sophie Marin-Degor (Cephise), Gilles Ragon
(Lychas), Jean-Francois Gardeil (Straton), Gregory Reinhart (Caron), Michel
Gens (Pheres). In the big mourning scene the voice of Veronique Gens rings
out finely.
One stumbling block of tragedie lyrique has always appeared to be the
recitative for which Lully studied in detail the declamation of leading
players of spoken theatre. Now we have a generation of singers who can
perform these scenes clearly and naturally. And because so many of
Quinault's lines are simple, direct and even witty, these same recitatives,
weaving in and out of short, expressive 'airs', become a positive pleasure.
Spectacle is indeed an essential part of French serious opera, but the words
remain paramount. In Lully's day the libretto was published in advance,
studied, and taken to the theatre.
The Grande Ecurie et La Chambre du Roy (orchestra, authentic instruments)
and the lively Ensemble Vocal Sagittarius (chorus), were under the direction
of Jean-Claude Malgoire, who firmly outlined the shape and varying moods of
the score even if one missed the greater rhythmic buoyancy and keener
textures of other ensembles of this kind. The opera is given, so far as I
could tell, virtually uncut.
Dresden and Vienna contributed painted cloths, British firms supplied
engineering and lighting technology. The list of technical personnel is as
long as their handling is efficient. Paris programmes are less specific than
ours about financial support. I gather sponsorship came from the Conseil
Superieur du Mecenat Culturel and the Caisse des depots et consignation.
Alceste is a co-production with Montpellier.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Private talks in the park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is pressing on with its programme to privatise the
maintenance of the eight royal parks in and around London despite furious
opposition from the Transport and General Workers Union which represents the
royal parks' 340 employees.
The scheme, the brainchild of Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has
also been criticised by some MPs and peers. But there has been no lack of
tenders from landscaping and ground maintenance companies.
Heseltine sees the policy as an extension of compulsory competitive
tendering which has led many local authorities to put out park maintenance
to private contractors. It is estimated that this market is worth Pounds
700m a year.
The results of some of the tenders are expected to be announced in the next
few days. However, it is already known that Glendale Industries, based at
Chorley, Lancashire, has won the Pounds 500,000 per annum three-year
contract for the maintainance of Green Park and St James's Park in central
London.
Glendale has made bids for some of the other royal parks contracts. 'We
believe we can provide a better service in most of them and a better quality
of horticulture for the same or less money than they are costing at the
moment,' said Tony Hewitt, managing director of Glendale.
But Ron Tindall, district officer of the TGWU, says: 'It is purely political
 -privatisation for privatisation's sake.'
Heseltine is unrepentant. 'It is important that we get value for money and
draw up contracts with high-quality specifications. If you make changes
people always predict disaster.'
The upkeep of the parks, which is the responsibility of the Environment
Department, costs Pounds 20m a year. In addition to the two contracted to
Glendale there are Regent's Park, Hyde Park, Greenwich, Bushey, Richmond and
Kensington Gardens.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Chopping down rainforest myths
 -Christina Lamb describes how a Brazilian pulp producer has achieved
sustainable growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To be a virgin wood pulp producer in a world turning increasingly to
recycled paper is unfortunate. Worse still is to be based in Brazil - which
means being immediately identified with Amazonian rainforest destruction.
For such a company in this shrinking market to have doubled its capacity and
become the world's largest producer of eucalyptus pulp seems sheer madness.
Erling Lorentzen, chairman of Aracruz Celulose, admits that his timing could
have been better. While his company has just completed a Dollars 1.2bn
project to increase capacity to more than 1m tonnes per year, the pulp
industry has, he says, seen a tremendous change of consumer attitudes.
Yet Aracruz has become a showcase for how a thorny environmental area can be
turned into an economically feasible and environmentally sustainable
development project which Lorentzen claims even the greenest of greens
cannot reprove. Lorentzen, a Norwegian who came to Brazil in 1953, sees it
as his challenge to convert a suspicious world to the use of paper produced
from sustainable forestry.
Not only has his company invested heavily in forestry, always met 100 per
cent of its pulp needs from plantations and planted 1.5m native trees to
preserve biodiversity, but he has hired an environmental director and a
British PR company to plead his case. He is also lobbying hard for next
year's World Environment Conference in Rio to use paper from his pulp.
'Paper produced from sustainable forestry may not have the same ring about
it as recycled paper,' admits Gordon Knight, PR adviser for Aracruz, 'but it
is better than recycled paper because with recycling one does not know where
the original came from. We need to break this myth that saving paper saves
rainforests.'
Aracruz is well qualified to do this. Its pioneering forestry work has won
international recognition such as the prestigious Marcus Wallenberg Prize in
1984 and it will feature as a case study of responsible environmental
management in a book being compiled by the Business Council for Sustainable
Development to coincide with the Earth Summit.
So developed now is its technology that the Aracruz forestry team, led by
Yara Ikemori, is exporting seeds back to Australia from where the company
initially bought them. Its techniques are also used in South Africa, Spain,
Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.
Aracruz has developed the perfect eucalyptus tree - one which grows quickly
with a minimum of side branches in order to reduce the amount of land needed
for plantation. Carlos Roxo, the environmental director, explains: 'Through
genetic engineering we've adapted the tree to the local environment and
tried to get the best tree for the area in terms of disease resistance and
fibre quality.'
The tree improvement programme began in 1973 when Aracruz bought seeds from
places with similar conditions such as Indonesia and Australia. As Brazil
could not obtain foreign technology the company sent scientists such as
Ikemori abroad to places like the Oxford Forestry Institute. According to
Ikemori: 'By 1980 we could select the best trees and propagate them.'
Having found the best tree Roxo says the turning point was 'realising we
could produce trees much faster and better through a cloning process than
with seeds'. The simple method is based on planting eucalyptus from
propagated rooted cuttings. When trees are felled the stumps have an average
of 30 sprouts, each of which is cut into three parts and planted. After 75
days a seedling develops and is planted.
Not only is this quicker than using seeds but the cuttings grow with exactly
the same characteristics as the mother tree, whereas seeds display
variation. Brazil's climatic conditions mean planting can occur the whole
year round. Aracruz plants an average of 100,000 seedlings and rooted
cuttings per day. So far the company has planted 133,000 of its 200,000
hectares.
Aracruz trees take only seven years to reach a mature height of 35 metres
compared with 12 years in Spain and Portugal and 35 years for pine trees in
northern Europe. According to Roxo, Aracruz's average yield is 35 cubic
metres compared with a Brazilian average of 18 and a European of three.
'This means we need 10 times less area than in Europe,' he says.
Ecologists complain that eucalyptus plantations damage the soil, encroach
into native forest and reduce biodiversity, but the Aracruz team rebuts
these charges. The soil is monitored continually and nutrients added;
careful land planning means the plantations have never encroached. For
variation Aracruz now has more than 100 clonal banks - each developed for a
particular soil and considered a new species. Lineu Siqueira, environmental
resources manager, heads a programme to preserve the remaining original
forest in which he has so far identified 156 bird, 36 mammal and 3,000
insect species.
The area around the Aracruz mills on the palm-fringed coastline of Espirito
Santo state resembles a chequer-board with row after row of eucalyptus trees
like upturned broomsticks standing to attention, interspersed with darker
green patches of remaining native forest - one hectare for every 2.4 of
eucalyptus.
The landscape is different from when Aracruz bought the land and started
plantations in 1967. The coastal Atlantic forest had been almost entirely
stripped by farmers, cattle raisers, loggers and charcoal burners, leaving
land suitable only for coffee plantations.
'Eucalyptus should really be treated like sugar cane as a crop - one which
produces huge volumes of wood in a very short time,' explains Roxo. 'We do
not cut the Amazon and replace it with eucalyptus - we plant on land a few
thousand kilometres away which has already lost biodiversity and doesn't
generate anything. By giving this land an economic function we are
preventing further incursion into the Amazon.'
As part of this aim seedlings and credit are distributed to local farmers to
plant eucalyptus on degraded land. This prevents them from cutting down
trees to sell for fuel.
'People cannot say that others have no right to cut down trees even if
that's the only way they can earn a living,' believes Lorentzen. 'The way to
both help them and relieve pressure on forests is through development and
you cannot give people anything better than a job'.
Lorentzen, who was one of the first signatories of the Business Charter for
Sustainable Development, is the leading Brazilian crusader for industry to
adopt environmental protection measures.
Aside from its forestry programme the company has spent nearly Dollars 300m
on environmental measures including a Dollars 100m project to introduce a
chlorine-free bleaching process. Aracruz generates almost all its own power.
Effluents go through primary treatment, then enter a series of six lagoons
before being discharged into the sea 1.7km away from the coast.
Lorentzen maintains that environmental protection measures may be costly but
necessary. In his case they also make good business sense: 'We export 80 per
cent of our production so we have to ensure that our product is
environmentally acceptable to our clients and their customers in Europe and
the US.' Aracruz issues clients with a policy resolve which they can show to
customers who may be tending towards recycled paper. 'It's not only our
philosophy it's our self defence,' he says.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Recycling scheme takes 'soft'
option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current heated debate about what to do with the world's waste was given
a boost yesterday as Gateway, the UK food retailer, pitched in with a study
which suggested that Britain could recover 80 per cent of household waste
for recycling in a way which would make both environmental and economic
sense.
The report argued that the UK could achieve the highest waste recovery and
recycling rates in Europe mainly by concentrating on recovering the organic
fraction of domestic waste which constitutes 60 per cent of its volume.
Most other recycling schemes have been almost exclusively devoted to
re-using the 'hard' elements of domestic rubbish such as glass, metals,
paper and plastics, and have largely ignored the potential for recovering
'soft' materials such as soiled paper and putrescibles (waste food and
garden clippings).
The report suggests these soft materials could be be used to produce a
contaminant-free compost using the WMC process - a British technology
capable of separating organic material from the rest of the domestic waste
stream.
Research at the Long Ashton Research Station, a government institute, has
shown that the compost produced by this process has very similar properties
to the best of the commercial, peat-based composts.
The report proposes that a full-scale commercial experiment should be
conducted to test the viability of the WMC process. The scheme could be
financed by the creation of a National Recycling Fund which would levy a
small recycling tax on packaging materials and newsprint. The fund could
also pay for the creation of a comprehensive national system of banks for
glass, metals, plastics, paper, textiles and batteries.
Gateway commissioned the report from Landbank Consultancy, an environmental
group headed by Bryn Jones, a former chairman of Greenpeace, as part of a
programme of environmental research in the packaging field.
Its aim was to establish an effective alternative to the German 'Dual
System' which - to the horror of large segments of the international
packaging industry - has set the benchmark for waste recovery and recycling
schemes throughout Europe. The report criticises the German system, which
has created a separate industrial system for recovering waste, as being an
expensive duplication of existing waste collection networks.
Gateway's Warm (Waste As a Raw Material) proposals will now be sent to every
local authority in the UK in an effort to shape the course of the debate.
'We would like to take recycling out of the commercial-political environment
and make it a national issue. What we really need is an integrated national
recycling scheme,' says Jones.
The Landbank Consultancy has, however, established a reputation for coming
to controversial conclusions. An earlier report it produced for Gateway
attempting to assess the 'cradle-to-grave' impact of various packaging
products was fiercely criticised by many sections of the industry - even
though it formed the basis of a drive by Gateway to reduce the energy
content of its packages by 50 per cent over the next five years.
Elements of the Warm study are also likely to draw fire, especially the
comparison of the economic benefits of door-to-door collection systems and
recycling banks.
Several recycling projects in North America and Europe, such as that being
conducted by the European Recovery and Recycling Association in Adur
District in Sussex, have attempted to establish a commercially-driven
kerbside recycling system. But Jones argues: 'It does not make commercial
sense to use more energy collecting the stuff than can be gained from
recycling it.'
Instead the Warm proposals argue for an intensive network of recycling banks
for metals, plastics and glass at a density of one bank for every 400
households combined with banks for recovering newspapers and textiles at a
density of one bank for every 2,000 households.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Jobs: The numbing effects of visible responsibility - How
the best laid plans of top management are bedevilled by political forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF the Jobs column could have anything it wished for its 19th birthday
today, the choice would be the luck to run across as many realistic books
about management as it did last year. In all, there were two of them.
Mind you, neither was exactly hot off the presses. Indeed, the first (which
I wrote about 17 weeks back) was published as long ago as 1958, being called
The Boss in Britain but The Managers in the United States. It pointed out
that management is not so much an economic exercise as a political one, in
which the power-wielders' personal ambitions may well clash with the best
interests of the organisations they rule over.
The second book, which takes the same theme farther, is at least recent
enough for 1991 to have seen its first appearance in paperback. The work of
Sweden's Professor Nils Brunsson, it is entitled The Organisation of
Hypocrisy.*
Its central message is that - in big, complex organisations at any rate -
politicking is not only inevitable, but as resistant to cure as original
sin. Hence management is a process best undertaken in a spirit of Christian
hope, rather than in any expectation that it will ever work very well here
on earth. What's more, Brunsson suggests that trying to make it do so by
installing sophisticated systems beloved by business schools, is apt merely
to compound the problem.
That book too has already been discussed here, 15 weeks ago. But on
re-reading it since, I have twigged that several of its general truths can
be distilled into a further addition to the Laws of Organisational
Stupidity, of which the Jobs column has for nine years been the
self-appointed codifier.
As enduring readers may recall, those laws aren't of the inviolable kind
exemplified by the law of gravity. What they describe are simply
regularities: events observed to happen more often than not in given
circumstances. The original one, for instance, is Parkinson's First: Work
expands to fill the time available. Accordingly, not only can they be
broken, but when they are the effects are usually beneficial.
The latest addition, bringing the number to 23, reads: Willingness to impose
control declines as visible responsibility for the results increases. And
the book's clearest illustration of its workings is in connection with
probably the most time-honoured of the aforesaid sophisticated systems:
namely, budgeting. Although the particular exercise the professor cites took
place in a Swedish local authority, I've little doubt that the budgeting
rituals of big businesses are often prey to the same bedevilling forces.
The fact that the event occurred in a recession is important because it is
only in such conditions that the new law - 'Brunsson's Turner' - applies. At
buoyant times, the general managers at the top rarely need to impose
control. Availability of extra funds for expansion, albeit never as much as
the subordinate department heads would like, is usually enough to persuade
them and their staff to co-operate with their superiors' policies.
In the Swedish case, recession gave point to the pledge which got the
authority's new top bosses elected. It was to cancel the out-going council's
plans for increases to taxes already among the highest in the land. The
promise was not to reduce taxes, but only to hold them steady instead of
upping them by 0.75 per cent, which was ordained as the minimum increase
necessary by the authority's five-year plan.
The first idea of the tax-freezing bosses, whom the professor calls
'guardians', was to make uniform percentage cuts for the next fiscal year in
the planned income of the departments providing the various services. It
would be up to the departments' heads, called the 'champions', to decide how
the detailed savings were to be made.
But the champions objected that, as departments were not all the same, a
uniform cut would affect them differently to the extent of preventing some
from operating properly. So, since it was the guardians' duty to see the
services worked, they should decide the specific cuts.
The blackmailing overtones of that claim were enough to lever the guardians
into concurrence. They therefore began scrutinising the details of
expenditure, relying for specialised advice on the fellow-guardians they had
appointed to head the committees of officials running the services
concerned. Whereupon there came into play three of the bedevilling forces
mentioned earlier, the first being epitomised by Alexander Pope's line: 'A
little learning is a dang'rous thing'.
As Nils Brunsson says: 'The different levels of knowledge as between
guardians and champions is a typical aspect of budget processes. The
guardians are all too likely to have just the amount of knowledge that makes
savings difficult. If you know nothing about an operation, you can easily
convince yourself there must be plenty of scope for saving, and if you know
a lot about it you have a good chance of seeing concrete opportunities for
saving; but if you just know a little bit, it is more difficult to see how
savings can be made.'
The next bedevilling force lay in the fact that the committee heads,
although appointed by the top management team of which they were members,
still had personal ambitions. That made them loth to see the services they
were heading reduced in importance. Hence they began to side less with their
fellow-guardians than with the champions in their particular departments,
using such specialised knowledge as they'd been able to pick up accordingly.
The third force was that the officials running the various services, being
aware that a chain is as strong as its weakest link, declined to help the
top bosses to identify sensible economies not just in their own domains but
in any of the other services. So the guardians, already weakened by a fifth
column in their own ranks, were also faced by a united front.
The only savings proposed to them from below were of a sort involving them
in heavy risk of being visibly responsible for breakdown. Moreover, the
officials added a subtle touch by suggesting that if their superiors were
reluctant to decide for themselves, they should take advice from the
organisation's treasury department.
That brought into play a fourth force because the treasury officials, while
operating independently of the champions in the spending departments, were
not in favour of savings that would cut future income. Their interest was in
garnering as much cash as feasible for the corporate kitty - which is why
the professor calls them the 'hoarders'.
Trapped in the concatenation of all four forces, the guardians were
confronted by a dilemma. Their only way of doing the job they had been put
in to do as a team - namely, to impose a standstill on expenditure  - was by
jeopardising their individual ambitions.
There are no prizes for guessing the outcome. The pledge to hold costs was
abandoned, and taxes for the coming year were increased. But the rise was
only 0.5 per cent, compared with the 0.75 envisaged by the previous regime.
That enabled the guardians to take advantage of the general tendency to
mistake plans for reality, and represent the increase as an 0.25 per cent
reduction. So they did not do too badly out of the exercise.
While the champions were also fairly satisfied with it, of course, the group
who gained most from it were the hoarders. Nils Brunsson says that when the
budgeted year was actually over, the financial accounts showed a surplus of
more than Pounds 1m - enough not just to have held taxes steady as
originally promised, but to have cut them by a full percentage point.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Management: Health Check - Put the stress on
self-preservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no such thing as executive stress. At least that is what many of
you seem to think as you ignore the warning signs that could eventually
spoil your job prospects and damage your health.
Stress in itself is neither good nor bad. It occurs when the body and the
mind are in a state of extreme alert because of some new demand or
challenge. A limited amount of stress can actually be good for you and your
company. But once the stress becomes intense it overwhelms your ability to
cope. Your performance starts to suffer, as does the quality of your life.
Fighting stress to convert it into a healthy experience can be difficult, as
it means changing your lifestyle and your priorities.
Where to begin then? The first step is to broaden your definition of success
to include self-preservation (for the family and friends) and
self-fulfilment. Do not exchange precious years of your life, your marriage
or your health for one more rung on the career ladder.
Secondly, listen carefully to your body and your mind. Start to decipher
individual signs and symptoms, not as something to anaesthetize, but as red
flags warning of a potentially serious problem.
The symptoms that I frequently encounter in multinational executives
include: high blood pressure, chronic fatigue, nervous eating-drinking,
sleeplessness, peptic ulcers, emotional problems, tension headaches, obesity
and depression.
Our nervous system has evolved much more slowly than our lifestyles. What
may have been a perfectly appropriate response for our cave-dwelling
ancestors to a physical stress no longer serves the 20th century business
person.
During the stressful moment, the adrenal glands secrete two powerful
'stress-hormones': adrenalin and corticoids, which will provide the energy
to meet the new demand through either fight or flight.
Both actions help consume these stress hormones but neither are appropriate
in today's offices. Instead, the executive is left stewing in his or her own
stress juices in front of the computer.
A new strategy is called for to decompress this situation. At the moment
when the body and the mind scream for something as basic as oxygen (for the
proper functioning of the brain, heart and other vital organs) or water (to
cool an otherwise overheated system), modern managers reach for alcohol
(which depresses lucidity and forces the body to lose precious water) or
cigarettes (which decreases oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood).
Sometimes the response to stress is more dangerous than the stress itself.
Ask yourself: is this part of the solution or part of the problem?
After deciphering your symptoms, you must go for the long-term treatment
ticket, the 'cure'. In doing so, you may or may not find alliances in the
medical community. To treat an acute, short burst of stress with
tranquillisers, 'sleepers', ulcer and headache medications may be entirely
appropriate. However, to treat long term, chronic stress with medications
simply silences the alarms that the symptoms are sending out.
The real cure may be something relatively simple like losing weight,
stopping smoking, taking regular exercise, drinking less, or going on
holiday. It may be something more complex involving psycho-therapy. Either
way, nature is unforgiving to us when we ignore its messages.
Lastly, have the courage to talk about it. Seek help from a friend, your
spouse, a member of the clergy, or a professional therapist. Stress already
has a long and illustrious cortege of victims. With an honest and rational
approach, stress can be converted from a serial killer of international
managers to an opportunity for self-knowledge and growth. Don't forget: life
is the real career, not just business.

THE VERACRUZ I
(FT, November 19)
A contract of sale of a vessel stipulated its delivery in inspection
condition on a specified date, but repairs were necessary and the seller was
unable to deliver on the due date. In the ensuing arbitration the buyer was
concerned that the purchase price paid in London would be the seller's only
asset within the jurisdiction. He applied ex parte for a Mareva injunction
restraining the seller from dealing with the price payable on delivery so
that the order was not to come into effect until after delivery and payment.
The seller applied to discharge the injunction on the ground, inter alia,
that until delivery the buyer had no cause of action for defective
condition. Allowing the appeal in part, the Court of Appeal stated it was
firmly established by principle that the right to an interlocutory
injunction was dependent on a pre-existing cause of action.
HALLS vs O'DELL
(FT, November 20)
In 1981 liquidators of a company first intimated that they might have a
claim against its directors for misfeasance but they were only ready to
proceed with the action in 1983. Originating summonses under section 333 of
the Companies Act 1948 were taken out in 1985. At first instance the
directors succeeded in their application for striking out for want of
prosecution. Allowing the liquidators' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated
that there were many cases where the plaintiff had a choice and might
initiate proceedings by writ or originating summons. There were other cases
where it might be fortuitous whether a particular claim was made by summons
or originating summons. Further, the test for dismissal for want of
prosecution was the same as for ordinary actions, namely whether there had
been an 'inordinate and inexcusable delay' so as to prejudice the fair trial
of the defendant. No such causal link had been established in this case.
IN RE A COMPANY, EX PARTE ND PRITCHARD
(FT, November 22)
The petitioners in a winding-up were members of three Lloyd's syndicates who
claimed the company owed them Pounds 59,911 on a treaty of reinsurance. The
company claimed that presentation of the winding up petition was an abuse of
process because the indebtedness was disputed in good faith on substantial
grounds. The treaty provided that books should 'be open to the inspection of
an authorised representative of the reinsurers at any reasonable time during
the continuance of this reinsurance or any liability hereunder'. Similarly,
the notice of loss clause provided that all papers in connection with a
claim should be 'at the disposal of the reinsurers on this insurance or
parties designated by them for inspection'. The syndicate managers, however,
wrote saying that there were claims unpaid and that no inspection would be
allowed until payment had been received while the company was not willing to
pay until it had been given the opportunity to inspect. Granting an ex parte
injunction to restrain the winding-up of the company, Hoffmann J stated that
it would be unfair to allow the syndicates to enforce their claim by a
winding-up petition when they had flatly refused to allow any inspection at
all.
NEW HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE CO AND OTHERS v STRABAUG BAU AND OTHERS
(FT, November 26)
Three companies, two German and one Austrian, which formed a joint venture
for the construction of an international airport in Iraq were collectively
insured with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs avoided the policy when
subsidence occurred to the building and sought to issue writs on the
defendants out of the jurisdiction. At first instance, they were prevented
from so doing on the ground that, under section 3 of the Brussels Convention
on Jurisdiction and Judgments, 'matters relating to insurance' could only be
brought in the courts where the defendants were domiciled. Dismissing the
plaintiffs' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that member states had
already attempted to limit the definition of 'matters relating to insurance'
but had been unable to find a suitable demarcation line. For the court to
draw a line would be to carry purposive construction far beyond any previous
European court decision.
WELSH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY v EXPORT FINANCE CO LTD
(FT, November 27)
Exfinco authorised a company, Parrot, to sell goods on its behalf as agent
to overseas buyers. The plaintiff, the WDA, guaranteed Parrot's obligations
to Exfinco and Parrot's counter-indemnity to the WDA was secured by
debenture. When Parrot ceased trading, the issue was whether the WDA's
receivers or Exfinco were entitled to sums payable by overseas buyers of the
goods that Parrot had exported. Allowing Exfinco's appeal against a decision
that the WDA was entitled under its debenture to those sums, the Court of
Appeal stated that on termination, by clause 9 of the operating procedures,
all amounts owed by overseas buyers became immediately due for payment by
Parrot to Exfinco, and any payment received from buyers into the collection
accounts after Exfinco had been fully repaid would be refunded to Parrot.
Clause 9 was plainly drawn on the basis that moneys were owed to Exfinco by
the buyers, because Exfinco had acted throughout as Parrot's undisclosed
principal.
IN RE THE ERAS EIL APPEALS
(FT, November 29)
A group of companies in the UK, Clarksons, had decided on a new way to write
environmental impairment liability insurance (EIL). Risk-rating,
underwriting and claims-handling were dealt with by participants in the
pool, which was led by Scor, a French company. The pool was a disaster for
all concerned and litigation ensued on both sides of the Atlantic. All the
claims were derivative in the sense that they were not due to the initiative
of the claimants but in response to allegations made against them by others.
The defendants appealed against a first instance decision granting leave to
serve the derivative claims out of the jurisdiction. Dismissing their
appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that in the interests of justice the
whole affair should be explored before the same tribunal. Clarksons were the
organisers of the scheme and remained at the heart of it, however much of
the day-to-day work was executed abroad. Only by bringing the principal
players together could the responsibility for the disaster be ascertained
and distributed between those concerned.
GALLIC LEASING LTD v COBURN (HM INSPECTOR OF TAXES)
(FT, December 3)
Gallic Leasing was a member of a group of companies and it was assessed to
corporation tax for the period ending March 31 1982. On October 31 it
appealed the assessment and applied to postpone payment on the ground that
'profits will be covered by group relief'. Thereafter its accountants sent a
computation of the assessable income submitted 'subject to group relief'.
The general commissioners upheld the inspector that the references to group
relief in the notice of appeal, in the note on the accounts, and in the
accountants' computation, did not constitute a valid claim to group relief.
Mr Justice Vinelott allowed Gallic Leasing's appeal, holding that in order
to make a valid claim to group relief all that was required was for the
claimant company to make it clear that a claim was being made. Allowing
Gallic's appeal against a Court of Appeal decision in the commissioners'
favour, the House of Lords stated that allowance was permitted 'on the
making of a claim' under section 258(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1970 but the provision said nothing about the procedure for making a
claim.
OVERSEAS UNION INSURANCES LTD AND OTHERS v INCORPORATED GENERAL INSURANCE
(FT, December 4)
The seven plaintiff insurance companies instituted proceedings against a
South African insurance company, for money allegedly due under reinsurance
contracts. The contracts were identified by description and period and the
affidavit identified the five contracts and exhibited the cover notes. They
asserted an express or implied term of the contracts that premiums and
claims should be paid in London, and that demands for payment had been made
without satisfactory answers. At first instance, the writ outside the
jurisdiction was set aside on the ground inter alia that the plaintiffs had
failed to establish a good arguable claim. Allowing the plaintiffs' appeal
against that decision, the Court of Appeal stated the plaintiffs had
produced evidence that they were contracting parties and that monies were
due which was sufficient. With regard to the alleged illegality issue set up
by the defendant, it was not enough to conclude that there was a prima facie
case of illegality; there would have to be grounds to conclude a strong
probability that the offences had been committed.

COMPANIES COULD face damages claims totalling millions of pounds after
yesterday's launch of the Environmental Law Foundation (Elf) - an
organisation which helps people protect their environment.
Elf has nearly 100 lawyers ready to give local groups legal advice and take
cases through courts or planning enquiries.
Elf's initial appraisals of cases will be free, and subsequent work will be
charged at legal-aid rates. The scheme has been endorsed by Mr Philip Ely,
president of the Law Society, and Mr Gareth Williams, chairman of the Bar
Council.
Leigh Day, one of Elf's member firms, is handling a claim by 1,500 residents
of London's Docklands against the London Docklands Development Corporation
and Olympia &amp; York, the builder of Canary Wharf. Elf announced yesterday
that the residents had won the right to legal aid.
Ms Sally Moore of Leigh Day said that claims of Pounds 10,000 for each
individual were likely to be made if the case reached the High Court. The
claim is based on nuisance from noise and dust levels and interference with
television reception.
Members of Elf are also advising residents complaining of emissions from the
Monkton Coke Works in Tyne and Wear.
They have also been helping people near Gateshead fight a proposal for the
siting of a waste incinerator on property owned by Northumbria Water, a
water-supply company.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Reluctant spenders hindering recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A FALL in personal disposable income
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and continued reluctance by consumers to spend rather than save - hindered
the recovery of consumer demand in the second half of last year, Central
Statistical Office figures showed yesterday.
Real personal disposable income fell by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter
compared with the second and by 0.6 per cent compared with the third quarter
of 1990.
The savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total
personal disposable income, dropped only marginally - from 11.2 per cent in
the second quarter to 10.9 per cent in the third.
The state of company finances provided no sign of relief for the economy,
with seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO revealing a financial deficit
of Pounds 2.5bn in the third quarter compared with Pounds 1.4bn in the
second.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Warburg Securities, said that, in spite
of the latest increase, the corporate sector's financial deficit would
probably continue to shrink - the trend in previous quarters - as companies
ran down stocks rather than invested.
The increase could be explained partly by a jump of 24 per cent in
third-quarter dividend payments to Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.7bn in the
second quarter. At the same time, the rate of destocking eased from a Pounds
1.7bn reduction in the second quarter to Pounds 0.7bn in the third.
Gross trading profits of the UK corporate sector, net of stock appreciation,
stayed at about Pounds 17.9bn, similar to the second quarter.
However, the figure was maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading
profits. Those increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter
from Pounds 1.2bn in the second, thanks mainly to increased crude oil sales.
Non-North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits fell between the second
and third quarters from Pounds 16.7bn to Pounds 16.3bn.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International in
London, said the higher savings trend in the personal and company sectors
would continue to hinder the recovery of the economy.
'Consumer spending is going to stay sluggish for the rest of the year, and
in turn that means that the recovery of the overall economy is going to be
very weak,' he said.
The higher company deficits, acting as an encouragement to cut investment,
were also likely to hinder growth.
'The financial position of the corporate sector is sufficiently weak that
the emphasis is still going to be on saving and hence on retrenching rather
than investing,' said Mr Saunders.
The latest squeeze on employment was highlighted by the modest increase in
wages and salaries before tax from Pounds 71.8bn in the second quarter to
Pounds 72.5bn in the third. Income-tax payments were up only 1.6 per cent
compared with the third quarter of 1990. Benefits and transfer payments from
the government were up 15.6 per cent.
Mr Gardiner said the figures showed that the personal and corporate sectors
were still adjusting to the financial excesses of the late 1980s.
The Treasury said, however, that it was confident the savings ratio would
decline this year.
There was scope for some fall in the savings ratio in the coming year as
consumer demand began to recover in response to lower interest rates and
inflation, and as personal wealth increased, said the Treasury.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS property market in Leeds is bucking the recession, with only 2
per cent of new offices empty, according to a survey by Leeds City Council.
Although 850,000 sq ft - 10 per cent of the total office space - is
unoccupied, 84 per cent is old or refurbished property.
About 400,000 sq ft of new space was completed during 1990-91 and 410,000 sq
ft taken, which included some new offices unoccupied from the previous year.

BRIDGEPORT Machines, one of the UK's largest makers of machine tools, is to
close its manufacturing plant at Bridlington, Humberside, and transfer
production to its Leicester site.
The Bridlington factory will be phased out over the next six months, and
only a few of the 162 employees will be offered jobs at Leicester. The
closure is one of the biggest of the machine-tool industry recession, in
which orders have fallen as much as 40 per cent in the past year.
The purpose-built Bridlington plant opened in 1964 and according to Mr
Malcolm Taylor, Bridgeport managing director, was restructured three times
last year.
Sales continued to worsen, however, in spite of the transfer from the US to
Bridlington of production for the Far East.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Lilley tackles EC on TV ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to make a formal complaint to the European Commission over
alleged discrimination against British television companies by other EC
member nations.
The decision follows an appeal by Central Independent Television to Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary.
Central argued that whereas under UK legislation an EC company is able to
own 100 per cent of a British ITV company in every other EC country there
were some restrictions or conditions on foreign ownership of television
channels.
In France, the Irish Republic, Greece and Spain a British company can only
own 25 per cent of a television company. In Portugal, the proportion is 15
per cent and in Belgium and Germany a British company can only own a
minority stake.
In the Netherlands no foreign ownership of private television companies is
allowed. In Denmark and Luxembourg there are conditions on the nationality
of directors, although in Italy restrictions take the form of setting a
minimum capital requirement of Dollars 260m (Pounds 144m).
The DTI has been collecting evidence on the issue with a view to making a
formal complaint.
'The UK will be making a complaint to the commission in the near future on
the apparent discriminatory provisions in broadcasting legislation of
certain other member states,' the DTI says in a letter to Central.
The letter, written on behalf of Mr Lilley, adds that the UK is keen to see
that any restrictions apply equally to all EC companies without favour to
domestic ventures.
When the 1990 Broadcasting Act was being drawn up the implications of
foreign ownership of British commercial television companies was considered.
The Home Office decided that any provisions limiting EC ownership of ITV
would breach the Treaty of Rome.
From 1994, hostile takeovers of the 16 ITV companies are permitted although
the new owner would have to take on existing financial and programme
obligations.
Central is particularly alarmed that it could be a takeover target for
overseas broadcasters without being able to counter-attack. Not only is the
Midlands company the second largest in ITV, it retained its franchise
unopposed with a bid of just Pounds 2,000 a year and should become one of
the most powerful in the ITV network.

FT  08 JAN 92 / MPs seek reversal of port sale decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY delegation of MPs is to seek a meeting with Mr John Major, the
prime minister, in a final attempt to overturn the bitterly resented outcome
of the Tees &amp; Hartlepool port privatisation.
But transport ministers were yesterday standing their ground, indicating
that there would be no about-turn unless significant new information emerged
before next week's ratification of the decision.
The MPs are urging the prime minister to reverse the decision to sell the
trust port to Humberside Holdings, a private consortium, instead of the
hotly tipped management-employee buy-out team headed by Mr John Hackney, the
port's chief executive. The decision has caused uproar in the ports industry
because other trusts fear their own management-employee buy-out bids will
also be defeated.
Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough, has sent a 13-page submission
to Mr Major detailing allegations that the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority
conducted the sale of the port improperly in at least seven respects.
Mr Bell's submission says two of the directors of Humberside Holdings had
been directors of two dock service companies that went into liquidation
during the abolition of the dock labour scheme in 1989, leaving the taxpayer
to pay their liabilities of Pounds 6.6m in redundancy payments.
He claims the authority did not take this into account when considering
whether Humberside Holdings met a key criterion of the sale: the bidders'
previous record of meeting their commitments.
Another allegation is that Humberside Holdings was given the opportunity to
introduce additional investors and increase its bid from Pounds 100m to
Pounds 180m during the competition, while the buy-out team was given no such
chance to raise its Pounds 150m bid.
The last opportunity to overturn the decision will be on Tuesday evening,
when MPs are asked to approve a parliamentary order setting out the
provisions for clawing back any property profits made by the port's new
owners.
But the government will use its majority to force the measure through and Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, is expected to confirm the sale
the next day.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Nasa may have to cut 5,000 space shuttle jobs
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US may be forced to cut 5,000 jobs from its space shuttle programme,
according to Mr Robert Crippen, director of the Kennedy Space Centre in
Florida.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has promised to cut
15 per cent over the next five years from the Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.5bn)
annual costs of its shuttle programme, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent
of its overall budget. That would mean a reduction of about 5,000 jobs,
although some staff might be shifted to other programmes.
Vice President Dan Quayle, who chairs the National Space Council, announced
last summer that the US would build no new shuttles, concentrating instead
on developing a new generation of launch rockets.
Nasa said yesterday the more money the agency could free from the shuttle
programme, the more it would have for costly programmes such as the space
station.
Assembly of the space station, whose cost is now estimated at Dollars 40bn,
is due to start in late 1995, while the first platform of the Earth
Observing System is due to be launched in 1997.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council looks set to meet on January 30 to
discuss the break-up of the Soviet Union and the role of the UN in the
post-Cold War era.
The meeting was proposed by the UK, supported by the US and France. Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, would preside over the meeting which
would formally recognise Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union
and permanent member of the Security Council.
The meeting is partly intended to allay western concerns about command and
control of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and the risks of
nuclear proliferation. A broader aim, however, is to reinforce the authority
of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new UN Secretary General.
Mr Ghali is expected to be asked to prepare a report on the UN role in
peace-keeping and other forms of collective security in the 1990s, according
to a senior UN representative in New York.
The New York forum would also offer President George Bush an early
opportunity to hold talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, their first
meeting since the resignation of President Mikhail Gorbachev and the
dissolution of the Soviet Union last month.
Russia has applied to join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to
win financial backing for its transition from communism to capitalism,
Reuter reports from Washington. The IMF said that the former Soviet republic
of Azerbaijan had also applied to join.

FT  08 JAN 92 / US Treasury urges reform of corporate tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury has outlined new ideas for transforming the corporate tax
system to eliminate the bias that drives companies to finance themselves
through debt rather than equity.
In a study on the integration of individual and corporate tax systems, the
Treasury suggests that reform could generate savings of up to Dollars 25bn
(Pounds 13.7bn) a year for the US economy by increasing corporate capital by
as much as Dollars 500bn and reducing corporate debt ratios by up to 7
percentage points.
The distortion arises from the fact that the US, unlike most other developed
countries, taxes corporate dividends twice over: once as the company's
profits and a second time as the shareholder's income. Interest payments, on
the other hand, may be deducted from taxable income by the company.
While the Treasury stops short of recommending any specific legislation to
change the current system, the report argues that simply excluding dividends
from shareholders' taxable income would be the easiest way of stopping the
double taxation.
This approach is gaining support in academic circles, because it ends the
double taxation of dividends while avoiding the pitfalls of systems in
countries such as the UK, France and Germany where corporate income tax is
by various means imputed to the shareholder. It would cost Dollars 13.1bn a
year in lost tax revenue, the Treasury estimates, but this would still be
less expensive than an imputation system.
A much more ambitious reform entitled the Comprehensive Business Income Tax
(CBIT), however, would bring greater economic benefits, the report says,
although it would also be more complicated to introduce.
The CBIT proposal would involve taxing corporate income before either
dividend distributions or interest payments, thereby treating debt and
equity capital equally. Because the tax would be levied on a broader base,
the Treasury says the corporate tax rate could be lowered from 34 per cent
today to 31 per cent, while still raising the same amount of revenue.
The proposal would also end the discrimination against retained earnings.

<TEXT>
THREE Canadian MPs were yesterday expelled from China after meeting
relatives of jailed Chinese dissidents and threatening to lay a wreath in
Tiananmen Square, symbol of the 1989 massacre.
The three MPs claimed they were 'manhandled' then 'thrown' into a bus to
Beijing airport. A Canadian diplomat accompanying the delegation was also
denied diplomatic privileges, the MPs say. China claimed the three indulged
in 'activities incompatible with their status in China'.
Mr Svend Robinson, the New Democratic Party's spokesman on human rights,
said China knew in advance the focus of the delegation's visit was human
rights. 'We feel a profound sense of sadness and tragedy that we leave
behind in China thousands who are victims of human rights infringements,' he
said.
The incident was similar to a September visit to Beijing by US congressmen,
led by Representative Nancy Pelosi. The congressmen also focused on
Tiananmen Square, but were frustrated by Chinese police.
China insists it will not tolerate interference in what it regards as
internal affairs. Yesterday's events are embarrassing for the Chinese, none
the less, because they come shortly before several human rights and trade
issues come up for discussion before the US Congress.
The MPs, speaking upon their arrival in Hong Kong, said they had finished a
meeting with Rong Yiren, head of China International Trust and Investment
Corporation, when they were taken to a police station where about 100 army
and police were present. They were then taken in a convoy of 14 cars to the
airport and were not allowed to return to their hotel.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Seoul to cancel exercises with US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea said yesterday it would cancel annual military exercises with
the US, following a pledge from North Korea to allow inspection of its
nuclear facilities.
The two steps, which appear to have been co-ordinated, will help ease
tensions between North and South Korea. They are the latest signs of a
rapprochement after 38 years of uneasy peace since the 1950-53 Korean war.
North Korea has been under increasing international pressure to allow
inspection of its nuclear facilities. South Korea and the US, its principal
ally, are convinced that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons and that
Pyongyang will have completed a nuclear device by 1995.
A statement issued on North Korean state radio yesterday confirmed reports
from the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday that Pyongyang would
allow inspection of its nuclear facilities.
It is not the first time that North Korea has promised to sign a nuclear
safeguards accord and allow inspections. But it is the first time that South
Korea has accepted Pyongyang's sincerity.
Seoul is apparently convinced that North Korea will fulfil its promise made
during a meeting on December 31 in which the two sides agreed to create a
nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
The scrapping of annual US-South Korean military excercises, agreed this
week between US President George Bush and Mr Roh Tae Woo, his South Korean
counterpart, also removes one of North Korea's principal objections to
improved relations with Seoul.
North Korea has protested over the annual Team Spirit exercises since they
started in 1976 and has frequently suspended confidence-building
negotiations with South Korea because of them.
Western diplomats in Seoul said they were encouraged by yesterday's
announcements but wanted to see promises translated into action. 'It doesn't
matter what North Korea says, or even what North Korea signs,' said one
diplomat. 'What matters is what they do, and there is still plenty of scope
for frustration regarding the inspection of its nuclear facilities.'
Despite such caution, however, most diplomats said that the process of
improving inter-Korean relations was gaining momentum. The two sides have
signed a non-aggression pact and are expanding economic links.

President Bush yesterday pressed home his campaign to champion US interests
during his visit to Japan by attending the opening of a second outlet of
Toys R Us in Kashihara City.
The US retailer, after years of fighting government restrictions, opened its

the Japanese marketplace.
'We have much to learn from the three-year battle waged by Toys R Us to open
the Dollars 6bn Japanese toy market,' said Mr Bush, pictured with the

Shopper Fukada Eiji bought a computer game for his son and said: 'I guess
the trade problem must be very serious for the president to come to the
opening of a toy store.' The Asahi Evening News reported that the US store
had put local toy shops 'in a state of panic'.

FORD, the second largest US car maker, is to export Ford-badged right-hand
drive vehicles to Japan and the UK, the world's biggest right-hand drive car
markets, for the first time since the early 1900s.
It said yesterday that a right-hand drive version of the new generation Ford
Probe, a sporty coupe due for launch in the US in mid-1992, would be built
in the US for export from autumn 1993.
Ironically, the Ford Probe is built at the Michigan assembly plant of Mazda,
Ford's Japanese affiliate in which it holds a 25 per cent stake.
The Probe is a Ford-derived version of the Mazda MX-6 coupe.
Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's automotive operations, said that the
right-hand drive version of the Probe, would be 'merely the beginning of a
series of vehicles built in America that will be exportable to right-hand
drive markets.'
Historically Ford and other US car makers, have chosen to manufacture
vehicles locally around the world, but Mr Gilmour said that the convergence
of product concepts and technologies meant that Ford was planning to produce
in the US a 'greater variety of right-hand drive products for Japan and the
UK.'
The introduction of the Ford Probe to the UK will be welcomed by Ford's
hard-pressed British dealers, which are suffering in part from the lack of a
sporty coupe in their range to rival the successful Vauxhall Calibra. Ford
has lacked a coupe in Europe since it stopped production of the Ford Capri
in 1987.
Japanese car producers last year increased further their share of US car
sales, adding to mounting US-Japanese trade frictions. Their advance came as
US new car sales fell by 12 per cent to 8.2m, the fourth decline in five
years and the lowest level since 1982.
With the recession in the US car market deepening the big three US car
makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - all suffered heavy losses.
The chairmen of the big three are accompanying President George Bush on his
visit to Japan this week.
Japanese-badged cars captured 31 per cent of the US new car market last
year, compared with 28 per cent a year earlier.
For the first time Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, was overtaken by
two Japanese producers and was relegated to fifth place.

MRS Imelda Marcos, the former Philippines first lady said yesterday she
wants to run for president in Philippine elections scheduled for May, Reuter
reports from Manila.
Minutes after pleading not guilty on corruption charges in a Manila court,
Mrs Marcos said she hoped to secure the nomination of one of the opposition
parties as its candidate to contest the May polls.
'After months of direct consultation with our poor and oppressed citizens, I
have decided to run for office to seek the presidency by submitting to the
democratic process of a national convention,' she told reporters.
Mrs Marcos and the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos were hounded from the
Philippines in a popular revolt in 1986, accused of looting billions of
dollars from the country. The 62-year-old widow returned to an enthusiastic
welcome from supporters last November after almost six years of exile in the
US.
She accused President Corazon Aquino, the woman who ousted her, of running
'a sick and misdirected government'.
It was the first time Mrs Marcos had announced plans to run for the
presidency, although she has been gradually edging towards such a move since
returning from exile.
She said she hoped to forge a united opposition coalition for the May polls
and wanted a national convention to select the opposition candidate.
Mrs Aquino has said she will not run in the elections, scheduled for May 11.
Some political commentators believe she may change her mind if Mrs Marcos
runs.
The filing of criminal charges is part of a government bid to recover more
than Dollars 350m (Pounds 192m) it says the Marcoses had deposited in secret
Swiss bank accounts.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Pakistan's privatisation policy reaches a key stage:
Although sell-off targets have not been met there is optimism in Islamabad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S programme for privatising public sector industry has reached a
key stage this month with the planned sale of 44 factories.
The programme is looked upon as a test of the policies of Mr Nawaz Sharif,
the prime minister, who has undertaken economic reforms including removal of
regulation, privatisation and private sector incentives since he took office
in November 1990. The reforms have won the backing of the International
Monetary Fund.
The initial target of selling over 115 factories by the end of 1991 was not
met. But government officials and businessmen nevertheless see the sales
arranged so far as an important boost to the programme. Mrs Salma Ahmed, a
Karachi-based industrialist, says: 'The sale of 44 units is a good
off-loading for the first year'.
Of these, 24 deals have been finalised and the remainder are due to be
completed during January. They include tractor and cement factories as well
as bakeries and cooking oil plants. Buyers are mainly Pakistani industrial
groups. Though the government expects foreign participation in some of the
sales, none has so far been confirmed. The government expects to earn at
least Rupees 10bn from the 24 confirmed deals. It aims to receive at least
90 per cent of an undisclosed reference price, and does not disclose
individual sale prices.
The public sector units being sold are generally inefficient with low
productivity and profitability.
Mr Saeed Qadir, chairman of the privatisation commission, expects
profitability to improve when the factories are sold. By March, he expects
the total of factories sold to rise to about 80. Mr Qadir says a government
deal with labour unions was the biggest step towards success of the
privatisation programme.
Under the deal announced in October, the government agreed that new owners
of factories would not be allowed to retrench any workers during the first
12 months after privatisation. It was also agreed that 10 per cent of shares
would be offered to workers at a mutually agreed price.
If workers were laid off, the deal provided for an unemployment allowance,
easy credit facilities for self-employment initiatives, scholarships for
children and grants for marriage of daughters. The government also agreed to
compensation of one month's full salary and four months basic salary for
each year of service.
Mrs Ahmed, the Karachi industrialist, says that as a result of the
agreement, labour unions are in a better position to understand the
privatisation initiative.
But one leading businessman cautions that 'the deal with labour unions has
put off some investors. It is not clear how much liabilities on this front
would go to the new owners. For factories which are already running losses,
such a deal could be back-breaking'.
Other business people are optimistic for the privatisation programme because
of other reforms, including reduction of bureaucratic restrictions,
permission for Pakistanis to keep foreign exchange accounts at local banks,
and steps to improve infrastructure such as telephones.
Officials claim that Pakistan's first important international investors'
conference, held in November, attracted commitments to new projects
totalling Dollars 600m. However, businessmen are sceptical that such a large
amount will be invested in the near term.
Aside from the attempt to sell off industries, the government's initiative
to sell two of the largest public sector banks and two development finance
institutions in November received fewer than expected offers. Senior
officials including Mr Qadir conceded that the outcome was disappointing.
Western economists in Islamabad remain cautiously optimistic. Says one:
'Even with these problems, the government seems to be persistent and wants
to go along . . . If the programme doesn't go far enough, it would be hard
not to give them credit for at least trying.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Caribbean clothing exporters fear new textile regulations

CLOTHING exporters in Central America and the Caribbean say they will be
damaged if proposals for new rules governing the textile and clothing trade
are implemented.
The producers, who ship mainly to the US, say their industries will be
damaged if quotas are phased out over 10 years, as proposed in the current
negotiating text for the industry in the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
The producers say their fears have been compounded by the conclusions of a
report prepared by the Fiber, Fabric and Apparel Coalition for Trade, a
combination of US textile and clothing groups.
'The report projects severe damage to the US industry which would decline by
40 per cent to 60 per cent in the face of unfettered competition by Asian
economies, including the large non-market economy of China,' the producers
said in letters sent recently to the White House and US congressmen.
'This would occur by the year 2002 if quotas were phased out over the
10-year period proposed in the text tabled by the chairman of the
negotiating group on textiles and clothing.'
Much of the region's clothes trade with the US is based on bilateral
treaties in which clothes are assembled and re-exported. They are assembled
from fabric made and cut in the US. On re-entry to the US, duty is paid only
on the value added in assembly. The letters say the proposed changes could
lead to a reduction of jobs in the US industry from 1.74m to 780,000.
'Consequent job loss and disruption in the Caribbean and Central America
would be devastating because 80 per cent of the region's exports of textiles
and garments to the United States is through the assembly and re-export
programme,' the letters say.
The Caribbean interests say the proposed 10-year phase-out of quotas is
inadequate protection for the region's fledgling industry. 'The impact on
small exporters must be taken into account in any consideration of a
timeframe.
'We have concluded that a 15-year period is required. In arriving at this
figure, account was taken of the experience of countries such as Hong Kong,
Taiwan and South Korea.'
US clothes imports from the Central American and Caribbean countries last
year totalled 718m sq metres, representing an 8 per cent increase over 1989
volume, in a year in which the volume of total US imports declined by 1 per
cent.
The region's share of the US market last year was 12 per cent, and the
exports earned Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 980m), 12 per cent more than 1989
earnings. The leading regional producers are the Dominican Republic, Costa
Rica, Haiti, Jamaica and Honduras.

<TEXT>
A POLITICAL crisis which has left Belgium without effective government since
elections last November has taken a fresh turn that could make it even
harder to build a new coalition, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Guy Spitaels, president of the French-speaking Socialists, has agreed to
become president of Wallonia, the French-speaking southern half of Belgium,
effectively withdrawing from any role in assembling a new national
government.
Mr Spitaels' power base is in Wallonia and he is widely disliked in
Dutch-speaking Flanders.
The move is likely to exacerbate tensions between Belgium's two main
regions, which argue constantly about budgets and other issues.
The two regional governments are of key importance as they have wide-ranging
powers under a programme of devolution pushed through in recent years.
The Dutch-language daily newspaper De Standaard said in an editorial
yesterday: 'The chances of building a stable national government are small.'
The previous coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists, which
collapsed in October, has stayed on as a caretaker government. Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens is Europe's longest serving premier but his
political future is uncertain as his Flemish Christian Democrats (CVP)
suffered a setback in the November poll.

<TEXT>
VIOLENCE prompted by soaring food prices and fresh rumblings in the armed
forces marked the first Russian Orthodox celebration yesterday of Christmas
as an official holiday since the Bolshevik Revolution.
Tass news agency said people in the southern town of Stavropol smashed shop
windows in anger at the explosion of prices triggered by the abrupt end of
seven decades of price controls last week. Shops in the agricultural centre
best known as the birthplace of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev were forced to reduce
their newly-liberated prices for meat and sausage.
In Ukraine, the deputy chief of the Black Sea Fleet said the 300-ship force
could not go along with an oath of allegiance demanded by the Ukrainian
government. Admiral Ivan Kapitanets explained the fleet was part of the
strategic forces which are supposed to remain under the unified command of
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
President Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, has given servicemen
until January 20 to decide whether to take the oath or to go back to Russia.
A first batch of 850 recalcitrants is due to be repatriated this week. But
the Russian leadership, already unhappy about Ukraine's haste in dividing up
the armed forces, has served notice that it will resist attempts to take
over the Black Sea Fleet.
Two conservative newspapers, Krasnaya Zvezda, the armed forces daily, and
Sovietskaya Rossiya, published angry officers' letters and hostile
editorials expressing concern at the break-up of the Red Army.
Republican representatives today meet in Moscow to tackle military issues at
expert level.
But food remains the main issue. Protests in the ancient town of Vladimir
forced authorities to intervene to lower the still-controlled price of milk
from Rbs6 to Rbs1.20, while a complaint by young mothers prompted similar
action by the regional government council in Nizhny Novgorod. (The Russian
government has devolved responsibility for remaining price controls to local
authorities).
Elsewhere there were signs of a voluntary lowering of prices by shops after
food was left lying untouched on the shelves. With free prices an entirely
new concept for state shops and most suppliers, it will take time to find
the right price levels to clear stocks.
Tass said prices for dairy products and vegetables, which initially soared
by as much as ten times, had fallen back in a number of towns such as
Yaroslavl and Syktyvar.

GERMANY and Russia signed an agreement yesterday to allow up to 11,000
Russian contract workers to find jobs on the German labour market every
year, as well as offering training for a further 2,000 young labourers and
apprentices, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
At the same time Germany has agreed to provide advice and training in a
range of areas, including labour relations and labour law.
The deal is the most comprehensive yet signed by the Russian government
since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the speed with which it has been
agreed underlines German concern to give practical support to the economic
reform process under way there.
The agreement to take up to 11,000 contract workers - the second largest
number from eastern Europe after Poland, with 40,000 - is an indication of
German concern to have a legal framework for Russian workers, at a time when
there are fears of a potential new influx of unofficial migrant workers.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Regional division 'impeding Czechoslovak reform': OECD
report praises federal government for overcoming political handicaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL economic costs have been incurred and Czechoslovakia's
structural reform delayed by a failure to define the post-communist
constitutional relationship between the Czech and Slovak parts of the
country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
warns in its first economic survey of the federal republic, writes Anthony
Robinson, East Europe Editor.
However, 'a great deal has been accomplished in a short time' despite this
political handicap, the report says. Achievements include the liberalisation
of prices and foreign trade, a sharp reduction in subsidies, and the
creation of 'key elements' of a legal basis for private-sector development.
The Paris-based think-tank also points to the groundwork laid down for an
ambitious privatisation process through vouchers offered to all citizens to
buy shares at a discount.
Czechoslovakia embarked on its reform process from a far less promising base
than Hungary and Poland, which were able to build on substantive earlier
reforms begun under former communist governments, the report notes.
The orthodox socialist policies followed after the Soviet invasion of 1968
ensured the starting point for market reforms after the 'velvet revolution'
of November 1989 was 'an economy almost completely dominated by central
planning, with little experience of markets and almost no legal and
institutional base for a market economy'.
However, the conservatism of the former rulers left Czechoslovakia with a
lower foreign debt, lower inflation and lower government debt than either
Poland or Hungary. It also gave the newly democratic state a more solid
macro-economic base than its central European neighbours.
Against this background the reform strategy of the government is 'clearly
appropriate', the report says.
It defines the policy as 'libties, tight macro-economic policies to sustain
stability and privatisation to transform the fundamental structural
conditions for economic activity'.
One of the notable achievements of the first phase of reform has been 'the
preservation of macro-economic stability in the face of liberalisation'. A
key contribution to stability has been 'the apparent willingness of the
population to accept one-time substantial declines in real wages'. The
combination of wage restraint with tight budget and monetary policies in
1991 has yielded benefits.
'By not allowing the price surge associated with liberalisation to become
embedded in an inflationary spiral, the authorities have avoided the
intractable economic management problems that arise in high inflation
situations.'
Under the government's attack on the old planning system the percentage of
gross domestic product under regulated prices fell from 85 per cent in 1990
to 5-6 per cent by October 1991. As a result prices rose 49.2 per cent over
the first six months of last year but stabilised during the summer and rose
by no more than 5 per cent from June to the end of the year.
Planned increases in house rents will put unavoidable pressure on the
consumer price index in 1992, the report says. But 'it should be possible to
keep inflation in single digits'.
However, this will partly depend on workers who are expected to try to
recoup part of last year's fall in incomes. Real wages fell 27 per cent over
the first half of 1991, when personal consumption fell 37 per cent. GDP fell
9.2 per cent in the period and net material product (GDP less services)
declined 13.8 per cent.
The OECD survey points to the problems presented by poor statistics and the
need to concentrate western technical assistance on improving this service.
Official figures probably over-estimate the decline in output by not
recording growth in the private sector.
The organisation estimates the number of private entrepreneurs rose from
86,000 in 1989 to 921,000 in August 1991, when the private sector accounted
for only 1.2 per cent of industrial production but 13 per cent of domestic
trade and 5-6 per cent of construction.
The survey notes that the government's small-scale privatisation plans got
off to a quick start, while plans for large-scale privatisation are 'on
track'.
Voucher books have been distributed, company lists published and the
physical infrastructure for the bidding process is in place.
'There can be little doubt that the strategy of privatising quickly is
basically sound.' But success, the survey cautions, 'will be determined by
three factors - administrative feasibility, effective monitoring and
establishment of the rules of the market game'.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Fabius set to become French Socialist party chief

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LAURENT FABIUS, speaker of the French national assembly and former prime
minister, is expected to be elected to succeed Mr Pierre Mauroy as the
Socialist party's first secretary when its governing committee meets
tomorrow. Mr Mauroy resigned yesterday
He has won the appointment largely because of the decisive support of Mr
Michel Rocard, also a former prime minister and leader of the third largest
faction in the party. Between them, the two men command the support of more
than half the votes in the 131-strong governing committee.
The deal, hammered out by party barons, significantly strengthens Mr
Rocard's chances of selection as the Socialist candidate in the next
presidential election, due in 1995.
Mr Mauroy, in his resignation announcement yesterday, described Mr Rocard as
'the virtual candidate' of the party.
The one faction which appears least satisfied, because it has secured least
from the intra-party negotiations, is the traditional main-line group led by
Mr Lionel Jospin, education minister. Last-minute horse-trading is thus
possible before the vote on Mr Mauroy's successor at tomorrow's committee
meeting.
As the ostensible price for his support, Mr Rocard has called on Mr Fabius
to end the war between the party factions, and for a collegial and
proportional sharing of party jobs in the departmental federations.
The irony is that it is Mr Fabius who did most to stimulate the faction war.
He made two previous attempts to seize the party leadership, in 1988 and in
1990, with the moral backing of President Francois Mitterrand. Both of
failed, but they deepened the party's traditional splits and contributed to
its sagging public repu-tation.
In addition, Mr Rocard has called on Mr Fabius to resist any move (by
President Mitterrand) to reintroduce a large element of proportional
representation in next year's general election.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Anti-peace forces strike a blow in Yugoslavia: Some elements
want both EC and UN out of the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHOOTING down of a European Community helicopter north of Zagreb, the
capital of Croatia, yesterday comes at a crucial juncture in peace
negotiations involving the United Nations and the EC.
The tragedy appears to be in the interests of no one side in the conflict.
But a western diplomat said: 'Some forces simply do not want the peace
process to succeed.'
Diplomats said the timetable for the negotiations could be jeopardised by
the incident unless all sides - Croat, Serb and federal army - insisted that
the peace process continue even in the face of violent defiance by
uncontrolled elements.
Croatia wants a ceasefire and UN forces in order to speed up recognition of
its independence. It also needs stability to cope with half a million
refugees and to rebuild its war-torn economy and infrastructure.
The Serbian government wants a ceasefire because an anti-war movement is
growing in the republic, along with shortages of raw materials, and it fears
that it will be isolated by the international community.
Sections of the army, which remains out of political or constitutional
control, want a ceasefire because they know that if the war spreads, they
will not be able to consolidate their gains.
However, according to western military attaches, hardline army nationalists
who oppose Croatia's independence, and who support Serb nationalist rebels
inside Croatia, appear determined to fight on.
Today, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, is due to hold talks
with Mr Milan Babic, head of Serbs in the self-proclaimed republic of
Krajina in southern Croatia.
Mr Babic, and other hardline Serb nationalist leaders in eastern Slavonia,
east of Croatia, recently defied the Serbian leader's acceptance of the
latest UN-sponsored ceasefire and the deployment of UN troops. They said
they would refuse to disarm, or allow UN troops be deployed in these
Serb-inhabited regions.
By challenging Mr Milosevic, Serb rebels in Croatia appear to be acting
independently of Belgrade and increasing the possibility of a formal split.
In Bosnia-Hercegovina, the authority of Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the
republic's Serbs who has close contacts with Mr Milosevic, is also being
undermined by nationalist Serbs.
These Bosnian Serbs are threatening to support the rebel Serbs in Krajina by
declaring their own republic, and defying any ceasefire. As unity among
Serbs weakens, a formal split among Serbs in these three republics could not
only scupper the peace process but also lead to a spread of the fighting to
the ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia.
Western diplomats said radical factions in the federal army could end up
supporting nationalist Serbs in Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia.
'Yesterday's tragic incident could well play into the hands of the Serb
nationalists, who, unlike many Serbs in Serbia, do not want an end to the
fighting until they have their own separate republics,' one said.
The issue of recognition of four of the six Yugoslav republics is one of the
items under discussion tomorrow when the EC-sponsored peace conference on
Yugoslavia is scheduled to reconvene in Brussels. On January 15, EC
countries will decide on recognising the republics of Slovenia, Croatia,
Macedonia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Said a western diplomat: 'Some forces simply want the UN and EC to forget
about recognition, and get out of Yugoslavia. All sides in the conflict
should defy these people.'

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (17): Coping with tranquillity - Kiwayu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Air Kenya twin-engined aircraft banked smoothly, passing over the
mangrove swamps and pygmy palms which sprawl along Kenya's northern Indian
Ocean coastline. It headed towards what appeared to be a small sandy
clearing in the scrubland and then suddenly alighted, coming to a sharp stop
at the end of a narrow airstrip.
Waiting in the warm breeze by the side of a makeshift shady lean-to was an
open jeep, watched over by a tall Kenyan in a sarong, a G3 automatic rifle
slung over his shoulder.
For the four passengers who disembarked, this welcome to Kiwayu, one of
Kenya's most splendid and exclusive beach resorts, was both unexpected and
unnerving. Seclusion is what Kiwayu - inaccessible by road and serviced by
irregular flights - is all about.
To the south lies the belt of hotels catering mainly for the package holiday
visitor, lured by keen prices, modern amenities and cheap curios.
Kiwayu, at the other end of the market, has fought to preserve its solitude
and its Robinson Crusoe atmosphere while ensuring that its guests receive
all the creature comforts of a fine hotel.
Balmy monsoon winds blowing down from Arabia roll in across the tropical,
azure Indian ocean in front of the camp. With the fragrant breeze comes
rough-hewn fishing boats and Arab dhows, their frail, dirty white sails
fluttering in the wind, laden down with spices to sell along the ancient
trade routes of the African coastline.
The camp is a stone's throw away from a scrubland where buffalo and antelope
abound. At night, the deep gruff sound of a lion can be heard above the
murmur of the surf and occasionally one of the big cats can be seen basking
in the sunlight on the beach.
Elephants, which used to come down through the mangrove swamps, have
suffered from the poaching of Somali bandits, known locally as shifta.
'Trying to get back to nature,' is how Mr Alfredo Pellizoli one of the
partners of Kiwayu camp describes the 25 bandas (beach huts) set in a wide
bay on an expansive, sun-bleached, unspoiled white sandy beach.
The bandas are the essence of the castaway image that Kiwayu has cultivated.
Each is thatched with coconut leaf and the walls are covered in raffia
matting. There are no doors and no locks, just mats which unroll to give
visitors privacy from the few local fishermen walking along the beach. Basic
plumbing, showers and flush toilets have been installed but, one suspects,
with the reluctance of the proprietors of the camp.
Fresh seafood is standard Kiwayu fare - huge prawns, lobster and crab caught
locally and bought each day in the fishing villages which dot the area
around the site. All other produce has to be flown in when there are new
arrivals at the camp.
'In the past at Kiwayu,' Mr Pellizoli recalls, 'it was possible to shoot an
elephant in the morning on the beach and catch a huge marlin in the sea the
afternoon.' Today, hunting is banned and elephants run shy, but guests at
Kiwayu can at least still take advantage of Kenya's terrific big game
fishing for marlin, sailfish and tuna. More leisurely activities of wind
surfing, water-skiing and day excursions by speedboat along the coast are
available.
For most visitors, Kiwayu provides a rare opportunity to walk along a
deserted beach at night with crabs scuttling across the sand, the moon
shimmering across the bay and only the African night-time sounds of crickets
to break the silence.
Most guests stay several days. A few, unable to cope with the tranquillity
hard to find in the western world, leave early. According to Mr Pellizoli,
they find 'Kiwayu is something beyond their comprehension'. For the rest of
us, this is part of Kiwayu's charm.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (16): Strategies for all seasons - Tourism,
from potential disaster to mild success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE worldwide downturn in tourism last year, fuelled by the Gulf crisis, the
international economic recession and the escalating costs of air travel, has
proved a watershed in Kenya.
Kenya's dynamic tourism industry, although faced by the prospect of a severe
loss of jobs and hard currency in what is its biggest foreign exchange
earning sector, has turned 1991 from being a potential disaster into a mild
success.
The private sector and the government, with cancellations running at up to
60 per cent for the peak season of January to March, rallied with a series
of measures.
The boldest move by government was the decision to open up Kenya to South
African tourists, several months before the October Commonwealth head of
government conference in Harare. Visas, previously denied to South Africans,
were granted at the airport and an agreement was reached to allow South
African Airways and Kenya Airways to operate one flight each a week between
Nairobi and Johannesburg.
The government also gave new incentives to the hotel training college,
established an autonomous airports authority and started the rehabilitation
of Nairobi's international airport and continued to strengthen the
newly-created Kenya Wildlife Service, a semi-autonomous parastatal in charge
of security and management in Kenya's national parks.
The private sector moved quickly, reducing rates and increasing charter
flights, particularly from Spain and Britain. In August and September there
were 42 such flights a week arriving in Kenya, each with about 200 seats, in
addition to scheduled flights.
These measures appear to have averted a slump in tourist arrivals which in
1990 nearly reached 900,000 people, while foreign exchange earnings last
year should approach the 1990 level of Dollars 467m.
Sustaining the remarkable growth which Kenya's tourist sector has enjoyed
since independence will not be easy.
Since 1963 the numbers of visitors a year have increased from 110,000 to
889,000 in 1990 and foreign exchange earnings in the same period have
mushroomed from Dollars 25m to Dollars 467m. In 1987, tourism overtook
coffee as the country's number one foreign exchange earner.
The impact on the rest of the economy has been vast. Throughout the last
decade employment in the sector has grown by at least 5 per cent a year and
tourism has contributed to the expansion of the services sector - hotels,
restaurants, road and air transport - and to allied industries such as
construction and food. Much of the rapid growth in tourism in the past
quarter of a century has been due to declining costs of air travel and the
extensive infrastructure which was in place at independence.
The government has created a reasonably attractive enabling environment
through welcoming foreign investment in tourism, the development of
infrastructure and the maintenance of relative political stability.
Increasing importance has been given to conservation and better animal
management and while the national parks and reserves sector was marred by a
long period of poaching and inefficiency between 1976-88 it has become a top
priority.
However, with mounting regional competition and the demands of the growing
population a much greater effort is required. In order to continue
generating jobs and increasing critical foreign exchange earnings the
government has recognised the need to creat a better environment.
Mr Philemon Mwaisaka, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Tourism, says
the government is targeting two key areas for growth over the next three
years: diversifying the type of tourism available and drawing in visitors
from new markets.
Diversification away from game parks and beaches will depend on giving
greater importance to attractions such as cultural, conference and
speciality tourism, scuba diving, fishing or mountaineering, and opening up
new areas of Kenya to tourist development such as the volcanic desert around
Lake Turkana.
Attracting visitors from outside the traditional markets of the US and
Europe will require a big publicity drive in the Asia Pacific area,
particularly Japan and Singapore.
In order to realise both ambitions a overhaul of Kenya's hitherto weak
overseas marketing is necessary. So far the government has been content to
leave most of the marketing to the private sector. Unlike many other
countries Kenya does not have an autonomous tourist board. Between 1986 and
1990 the government spent a mere Dollars 25m on marketing.
Kenya's well organised private sector has been lobbying hard for a tourist
board to be set up under an autonomous director to launch a concerted
marketing campaign of research, information gathering and publicity to
enable the industry to better tailor and target their products in a
competitive market. The government has given its blessing to the appeal but
progress appears slow.
Good marketing and closer links with airlines will be vital to attract the
high income from the choosy Japanese market.
Plans for Kenya Airways to open up a route to Bangkok next year may prove
insufficient to penetrate Asia and South Africa is proving a formidable
competitor with Singapore Airlines operating a flight to Johannesburg.
A number of issues need the government's urgent attention. Problem areas
include privatisation of government share holdings in hotels, developing a
strategy for high income VIP tourism, planning how to cope with the growing
demand for combination tourism with tourists visiting at least two African
countries, better harmonisation of visa and health requirements and more
incentives, such as import duty exemption on vehicles for the tourist
sector.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (15): Vested interests stall growth -
Agriculture, Government must grasp the nettle of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH A rapidly expanding population, desperate shortage of arable land and
an unsustainable rural-urban drift the importance of Kenya's agricultural
sector to the economy and to increasing standards of living has never been
more important.
Yet in spite of the generous flow of foreign aid to Kenyan agriculture the
government still appears to have failed to have grasped the three
fundamental policy reforms necessary to increase agricultural growth by more
than 3.5 per cent per year. These are; price and trade liberalisation,
rolling back excessive government interference in marketing and creating a
payments system which will provide greater incentives to smallholder farmers
to increase yields by applying fertiliser.
The signs of the government's failure in agriculture are apparent. In 1992,
for example, Kenya will have to import at least 5m bags of its annual maize
requirement of about 30m-31m bags, the main food staple. Although maize
production has been hit by bad weather in 1989 and 1990, inadequate
government reforms have meant that for the first time in several years maize
will join wheat and sugar as deficit crops. A poor policy environment,
combined with a slump in world prices, has also severely affected
smallholder production of coffee.
The government continues to articulate the ambition of food self-sufficiency
for a land-hungry population of 27m people growing at about 3.6 per cent a
year. Wheat will always be difficult, with the government having to import
about half of the annual demand of about 440,000 tonnes but there is no real
reason why Kenya should not be able to produce enough maize and sugar to
meet domestic demand.
The recent changes needed in agriculture were first identified by the
government in the mid-1980s and were followed up by an Agriculture Sector
Adjustment Operation, funded by the World Bank. The problems of maize
production and marketing and reducing the suffocating role of the state-run
National Cereals and Produce Board were high on the reform agenda. Next
year's import needs of maize are a clear sign that the reforms identified
have only been addressed half-heartedly. It has once again revealed that a
powerful alliance of vested interests, both private sector merchants and
public sector bureaucrats, continue to frustrate the goals outlined by
government.
Agriculture continues to play a pivotal role in the country accounting for
30 per cent of gross domestic product, 70 per cent of employment, and 60 per
cent of the foreign exchange earnt from merchandise exports. Smallholder
farmers (less than 10 acres) are the dominant part of production, combining
subsistence food crop and livestock production with varying amounts of cash
crops.
Throughout the 1980s the average rate of agricultural growth was 3.5 per
cent a year - not enough to keep pace with population which grew about 4 per
cent a year in that decade. With only 18 per cent of Kenya's land judged to
be of high or medium potential, prospects for further growth depend on
increasing crop yield. The World Bank estimates that yields of crops and
livestock could be doubled with progressive farming techniques. With a
better policy environment exports of coffee, tea, horticulture, milk and
beans could be increased.
The constraints to growth in agriculture are; poor price incentives, delayed
payments by government marketing boards, low use of yield increasing inputs
such as fertiliser, the suffocating role played by government in marketing
and inadequate availability of financing to smallholder farmers.
Progress was made between 1986-88 under the first agriculture adjustment
operation in increasing producer prices and beginning the deregulation of
maize and beef marketing. But the government showed poor commitment to a
fundamental overhaul of NCPB and other parastatals, the removal of supply
constraints on fertiliser availability and a critical examination of public
sector investments in agriculture. Grain marketing and the role of NCPB
became the main thorns in the side of international donors.
These last policy objectives have become the focus of the ongoing Second
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation signed with the World Bank in late
1990 and funded by a bank loan of Dollars 75m with additional financing from
bilateral donors and the African Development Bank.
This two-year operation has two main aims. First, to improve maize producer
incentives through prompt payments to farmers, increase efficiency of maize
marketing by abolishing controls on the movement of maize and to reduce the
role of the NCPB and therefore its budgetary burden. The second is to
increase the timely availability of fertiliser at lower costs. According to
the bank, to achieve an agricultural growth rate of over 4 per cent per
year, fertiliser consumption must increase at an estimated rate of 11 per
cent per year.
In addition, the bank and other donors are involved in reforms of the coffee
payments system to farmers and restructuring of the cotton and sugar
industries.
In the maize sub-sector the government has made some reforms - it wrote off
NCPB's Ksh5bn debt, closed down over 400 NCPB buying centres, slashed the
staffing levels of the board and began the phased liberalisation of trade
and movement of maize across district boundaries. But in the face of
concerted pressure from vested interests the government recently retracted
some of the progress on movement of maize, cancelled the provision to allow
free movement of 90 bags (eight tonnes) and revoked licences given to
private traders. This backtracking has put in jeopardy the disbursement of
the second tranche of the loan. 'The NCPB is fighting for its life,' said
one western donor. 'It does not want to go down and it is fighting to the
bitter end.'
The influence of vested interests in the private sector is much more
apparent in wheat and sugar. In 1990, private traders were allowed to import
300,000 tonnes of wheat - above the import needs of about 220,000 tonnes.
Much of the imports came from Saudi Arabia where wheat is heavily
subsidised. Large profits were made by private traders exploiting the
difference between the world market price of about Dollars 130 a tonne and
the controlled Kenyan price of about Dollars 230 a tonne. The British
government complained about the opportunities for corruption and absurd
profits from private imports and wheat farmers said they were being driven
out.
In sugar, private traders have made large profits. Kenya should be
self-sufficient in sugar but the price incentives for growers and processors
are inadequate to guarantee supply. Of the five sugar processing factories
in which the government has a majority share holding only one makes a profit
on more than 200,000 tonnes of output. Much sugar production is smuggled
across the border into Uganda with the involvement of senior government
officials.
Like many other sectors of the economy agriculture continues to suffer from
a lack of real commitment to the necessary policy reforms and poor
government implementation capacity. The worrying signs of food insecurity
should encourage the government to grasp the nettle of reform and combat the
powerful vested interests who are doing so much to hold back agricultural
growth.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (14): Crops bend to price fluctuations - The
coffee sector is under pressure while tea production increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE and tea continue to form the backbone of Kenya's merchandise exports
and the bulk of cash income for smallholder farmers who are their main
producers.
However, both crops are highly sensitive to international price
fluctuations, conditions in other producing nations, the local incentives
system given to farmers and political interference.
While Kenyan coffee and tea remain largely at the mercy of external
developments, many of the pressing domestic reforms necessary to make the
best of a poor international climate have either not been taken or have had
to slog their way through the opposition of powerful vested interests.
Coffee, until 1987 Kenya's top export earner, has been severely hit.
Production has slumped from 130,000 tonnes in 1987-88 to an estimated
75,000-90,000 tonnes for 1990-91. Foreign exchange earnings have fallen from
Dollars 278m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 140m for 1991.
Bad weather and a fall in international prices after the collapse of the
price-supporting International Coffee Organisation have played a critical
role in the decline of the Kenyan coffee industry. But serious mismanagement
in the government and the state-run agencies involved in the coffee industry
have contributed significantly to the coffee slump.
The government has been fairly candid about corruption in the industry.
An official report compiled last year said there was 'chaotic mismanagement
of financial affairs' in the state-run Kenya Planters Co-operative Union
which processes coffee on behalf of farmers. It said that senior KPCU
officials had obtained nearly Ksh70m (Dollars 2.5m) in unsecured loans while
others had fraudulently received gifts of Mercedes-Benz cars.
The decline in coffee production has mostly taken place in the smallholder
sector, which traditionally accounted for about 70 per cent of annual
production.
Farmers have faced not only low international prices but also a hopelessly
inefficient and tortuous payments system which gets money back to them as
much as 18 months after crops have been delivered and after several
unexplained and large deductions have been made by the various agencies
between the producer and the marketing board.
The result has been that many small farmers have neglected their coffee
trees, failed to apply fertiliser and pesticides and even gone as far as
breaking the law by uprooting their trees and replacing them with other,
more lucrative crops. Smallholder production fell from 85,000 tonnes in 1986
to 45,000 tonnes in 1990.
To improve incentives to farmers, the World Bank is lending Kenya Dollars
46.8m for a Second Coffee Improvement Project.
A primary aim of the project is to set up a much faster flowing payments
system to the farmer, using a Dollars 10m revolving fund at the Co-operative
Bank to cut out the lengthy and obscure cash flow, particularly by
eliminating the role of the KPCU. The project aims to provide speedy loans
to farmers to pay for vital inputs, such as fertilisers and fungicides.
However, for the past five months the KPCU has been fighting a rearguard
action to sabotage the project and maintain its financial hold over the
industry. As vested interests have threatened its reforms, the government
has appeared a helpless spectator.
Falling international prices have exposed the inefficiencies of the coffee
industry. In tea, however, Kenya has been able to exploit strengthening
world prices and strong demand for its quality tea.
The closure of plantations and processing plants in Assam, because of
terrorist activity, and the poor levels of production in Sri Lanka, are
likely to lift Kenyan tea even further.
Tea production has been steadily increasing with estimates for 1991 at just
above 200,000 tonnes. In 1989, tea overtook coffee as the second biggest
earner of foreign exchange, winning Kenya Dollars 264.3m. Tea earnings for
1990 were Dollars 273m.
The government is pursuing an aggressive expansion of planted tea acreage
with a goal to produce 300,000 tonnes by the end of the century.
Present indicators suggest that is an achievable target. But the problems
which plague the coffee industry also undermine that goal for tea.
The first problem is the rise in fertiliser prices, its uncertain
availability at critical times and the lack of financial credit for
small-scale farmers to buy the necessary inputs.
Mr Eliud Mahihu, chairman of the Tea Board of Kenya, has said that the
misuse of funds collected from levies imposed on farmers, which are supposed
to go toward improving tea access roads, could affect the steady growth in
production. He has alleged that Ksh90m collected by local authorities from
tea farmers in 1990 was misappropriated.
Foreign exchange earnings and agricultural incomes from coffee and tea will
continue to be vital to future economic growth.
However, if the Kenyan authorities are to give encouragement to expanding
tea production and save coffee from spiralling into crisis, the reforms
which the government has articulated need to be implemented more swiftly and
with greater disregard for vested interests.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (13): Draining the economy - Privatisation,
few concrete achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW PROGRESS in the privatisation programme is probably the chief criticism
of the government's economic policy. Parastatal reform has been on the
agenda since the late 1980s but concrete achievements are few. These include
the sale of 30 per cent of the shares in the state-owned Kenya Commercial
Bank, and measures to restructure Kenya Airways, including the retrenchment
of 1,000 employees.
State-owned enterprise looms large in the Kenya economy, with an 11 per cent
share of gross domestic product. There are 255 commercially-oriented
enterprises, with the state having a majority shareholding in more than half
of them.
The largest single activity is manufacturing, where the public sector
accounts for about one-third of national output. Some 60 per cent of the
parastatals are engaged in manufacturing and mining, especially food and
beverages; 18 per cent in distribution, and 15 per cent in finance.
Average wages in parastatals are roughly twice the national average, though
the national figure is biased downwards by low incomes in agriculture.
Productivity levels are estimated to be significantly lower in state-owned
than in privately-owned businesses, implying that the country would benefit
substantially from privatisation. The public sector is a drain on the
economy in two other vital respects:
Parastatal losses account for approximately 20 per cent of the budget
deficit, while their borrowings make up 17 per cent of Kenya's foreign debt.
Government borrowing to sustain state enterprise has contributed to rapid
inflation and higher interest rates than would otherwise have been
necessary.
Critics say the important weaknesses of the government's reform policy have
been the absence both of a coherent overall strategy and of political
commitment. This has changed.
In April last year the Cabinet approved a parastatal reform programme, and
in the July budget, plans were announced to divest 139 state-owned companies
while cutting back on financial support to the sector.
In mid-year, Maxwell Stamp consultants concluded a study of Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications and will provide technical assistance for restructuring.
A high level Parastatal Reform Programme Committee (PRPC) has been created,
and a new post at permanent secretary rank in the president's office to
oversee parastatal reform.
At the Paris donor's meeting in December, the government tabled a detailed
action plan of measures to be introduced during 1992 and provided a
checklist of benchmarks against which they can measure the pace of reform.
Parastatals have been classified into three groups: strategic, non-strategic
and regulatory.
Strategic enterprises such as Kenya Railways and the Ports Authority are
being restructured with the aim of improving productivity. Non-strategic
parastatals are to be divested 'in an orderly and transparent manner'.
Many of the latter could - indeed should - have been sold off already. One
reason this has not happened is that they are owned by state-owned financial
institutions, established as venture capital operations, but which have
become conglomerate holding companies.
They are only too happy to have successful privately-managed companies in
their portfolios to compensate for loss-makers.
In spite of this, the government says 32 investments have been divested or
are in the process of being sold off, while 14 have been liquidated and 22
classified as 'consistent loss makers on the verge of bankruptcy'.
Independent valuations are being prepared for a number of companies in which
existing joint-venture partners have shown an interest in buying equity,
including Eveready Batteries, Firestone and Grindlays Bank International.
Shares in 10 companies - including East Africa Oxygen, East African Portland
Cement and BAT Development - are to be sold off through the Nairobi stock
exchange by the end of the year, while competitive bids are to be sought for
three other companies - Kenya Film, the Milling Corporation of Kenya and
Kenya Cashew Nuts. Government shareholdings in a third list of nine
enterprises, including CMB Packaging, East African Match and Grindlays Bank
International, are to be sold following discussions with existing
shareholders.
A good deal of the criticism of the pace of privatisation fails to take
account of the familiar constraints that exist in a developing economy - a
shallow capital market with a weak stock exchange; a reluctance to sell 'the
family jewels' to foreigners and, more specifically, to Kenyan Asians whose
economic clout is resented.
The government action plan shows just how much highly technical preparatory
work must be done before companies are sold off, and the skills just are not
readily available.
Kenya, which has been such a haven for donors in the past, will become happy
hunting ground for international consulting groups with expertise in
corporate restructuring and privatisation.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (12): Decade of growth - Horticulture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY NIGHT the freight terminal at Nairobi's International airport comes
alive in a frenzy of activity.
Vans pull up loaded to the limit with boxes of strawberries, French beans
and fresh cut flowers. Anxious producers mingle with customs officials and
handling agents under dim neon lights. Produce is carefully checked, loaded
into airline containers and put on-board flights heading for Amsterdam,
Frankfurt, London and Paris.
In the past decade Kenya's horticultural sector has grown rapidly providing
the country with vital new sources of foreign exchange and the only serious
success in diversification of exports. In 1990, Kenya exported 49,920 tonnes
of fresh horticultural produce, more than double the 22,266 tonnes of a
decade earlier. Foreign exchange earnings from horticulture during the same
period nearly doubled from Dollars 76m in 1980 to Dollars 139m in 1990.
Exports are expected to rise by a further 12 per cent for 1991 with
estimated earnings of Dollars 157m.
Horticulture seems likely to overtake coffee as Kenya's third biggest
foreign exchange earner (behind tourism and tea) if coffee prices remain
depressed this year.
Much of the growth in horticulture has taken place in exports of fresh
produce such as cut flowers, French beans, strawberries and pea. Fresh
produce earned Kenya Dollars 90m in 1990 up from Dollars 31m a decade
earlier. At least half of this figure has been made up of floral exports
which have increased from 2,746 tonnes in 1975 to 14,365 tonnes in 1990.
Agricultural experts say there is great potential for further growth in the
sub-sector - there are less than 1,000 hectares under cultivation for flower
exports and ideal climatic conditions. In spite of an average freight cost
of Dollars 1.20-Dollars 1.40 a kilogramme Kenya retains a competitive
advantage.
Britain and Germany have proved to be the main markets for Kenyan produce.
There is a strong demand for fresh cut flowers in the Netherlands which
re-exports the produce under Dutch labels. France has been a strong market
for French green beans.
The success of the horticultural sector has primarily been due to the
absence of excessive government regulation and controls and the presence of
big, private Kenyan businessmen with political connections in the sector.
Horticulture exports have benefited from Kenya's sensible depreciation of
its currency and strong international prices.
The government has specifically recognised the mounting importance of
horticulture to the Kenyan economy by granting some of the demands of
producers - duties on aviation spirit were lowered, although by an
insufficient amount, and the government abolished import duties on packaging
materials - which had prevented Kenya packaging its produce competitively.
Opportunities for further expansion lie in taking advantage of the Sameer
Industrial Park private sector export processing zone in Nairobi.
Constraints to further growth remain, primarily the limited availability of
air freight space to Europe. Many of the European flights originate in South
Africa and Kenyan produce has had to fight for space with southern African
producers.
It is unclear whether this problem will improve or deteriorate when Kenya
airways and South African Airways take up their monopoly of the
Johannesburg-Nairobi route this April.
Bureaucratic regulations and controls implemented by the Horticultural Crops
Development Authority and problems with the inefficient Kenya Airfreight
Handling, which has a monopoly on handling cargo, has hampered growth.
Another problem lies with the excessive valuation by Kenyan authorities of
duty on air freighted imports which discourages charters because they cannot
get a return southbound load. Delays in handling, high handling charges and
insufficient liberalisation of cargo at the airport have restrained growth.
Horticulture has demonstrated that opportunities for growth in
non-traditional exports do exist if the private sector is given a relatively
free hand. If the government can iron out the few remaining obstacles to
expansion horticulture is likely to continue growing giving the government
an excellent source of foreign exchange and opportunities for job creation.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (11): The platform option - Export Zones,
tempted by Mauritian miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mauritian miracle, based largely on the success of that island's export
processing zone (EPZ), has encouraged Kenya to try the export platform
option.
Two companies are exporting processed vegetables and packaging materials
from the privately-operated Sameer Industrial Park in Nairobi, owned by
Firestone East Africa. Phase I of the development comprises 12 production
units, of which two are operational and another two - one to export machine
components and the other rubber and leather goods - will come on stream
soon. There are some 45 candidates for the remaining eight units, and
Firestone plans to develop the second phase of the park.
The Kenyan government is establishing a state-operated EPZ at Athi River,
26km from Nairobi, funded by the World Bank. It will have 12 units and
should be open for business by mid-1993, and a second phase will be
developed by private sector operators. The African Development Bank is
interested in financing a second government-owned estate, this time at the
port of Mombasa, which would be ready in 1994, while the Commonwealth
Development Corporation is considering developing a privately-owned EPZ
alongside. At Nakuru, a Kenyan private developer has plans to create an EPZ
and there are two more private proposals for estates at Thika and Nairobi.
The zones are outside the Kenyan exchange control system so that there are
no restrictions on profit and dividend remittances. The organisers claim
that Kenya is ideally located to penetrate regional markets, especially the
19-member Preferential Trade Area. There are no quotas on Kenyan exports of
garments and textiles to North America or the EC, and there is abundant
cheap labour, with unskilled workers being paid Dollars 50 monthly.
Hopes are highest for exports of textiles, electronics, rubber and leather
goods and furniture.
Some businessmen believe there is scope for fruitful co-operation with South
Africa, saying that businessmen from the south are considering using Kenya
as an 'offshore' location both for the manufacture of exports to Third World
countries and for processing products for reimport to South Africa. This
strategy assumes that domestic South African production is going to be
dislocated by industrial and political unrest and undermined by high labour
costs.
The EPZ programme expands and supplements the manufacturing-under-bond (Mub)
scheme which has attracted more than 30 companies. In both cases all
production must be for export, both schemes involve complete exemption of
duties and enjoy different tax holiday arrangements. The main differences
are that Mub is not confined to specific locations, and it is designed to
foster processing of indigenous raw materials rather than imported ones,
with an emphasis on agro-processing.
Mr Silas Ita, who chairs the EPZ authority, believes the two schemes will
have a vital demonstration effect in the Kenyan economy.
If the EPZ succeeds in increasing non-traditional exports, it will
demonstrate to sceptical old-school Kenyan civil servants that
liberalisation is preferable to regulation and controls. On the private
sector side, EPZ success would convince investors, local and foreign, that
their scepticism about government policy is unjustified while at the same
time developing the export culture that manufacturing industry needs so
desperately.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (10): Attacking the tariff barriers -
Manufacturing must become a lead sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF STRUCTURAL adjustment is to succeed, manufacturing industry, and
manufacturing exports in particular, must become the lead sectors of the
economy for the rest of the century. This was recognised in 1986 when the
government's economic policy statement - Sessional Paper No 1  - set a
target growth rate of 7.5 per cent a year for the industrial sector during
the 1988 to 2000 period.
While manufacturing industry has been the lead sector since 1988 with growth
of 5.5 per cent a year, it has, in common with the rest of the economy,
fallen behind target, in spite of the impressive momentum of reform,
especially in trade policy.
Kenya's industrial sector ranks as the fourth largest in Africa after South
Africa, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. In 1985, it comprised some 560 medium and
large-scale companies, more than 700 medium-scale businesses, and an
estimated 1,600 micro-enterprises. In 1990, manufacturing value added was
estimated at Dollars 440m.
Food processing is the largest single activity, accounting for almost 30 per
cent of value-added, followed by tobacco and beverages with 11.5 per cent,
while chemicals and machinery and transport equipment account for about 10
per cent each. Manufacturing is the second largest employer, providing
334,000 jobs or a quarter of wage employment.
In 1987, a World Bank team studied a sample of 45 companies and concluded
that the average company enjoyed 90 per cent protection. In spite of this,
some import-substitution activities, notably food processing, beverages and
tobacco, were relatively efficient. But when they were assessed as potential
exports, the bank found that while their ex-factory prices were competitive
against those of landed imports, once transport costs to export markets were
taken into account, they were too costly to compete. Furthermore, packaging
and quality did not measure up to international standards.
It concluded that the rest of the sector was inefficient. Highly protected
activities - steel, chemicals, transport and electrical equipment - would
never be internationally competitive because of scale economies, and the
bank was unhappy that so much investment had gone into these industries.
Critics of Kenyan economic policy tend to overlook the extent to which these
shortcomings have been addressed, primarily by reducing protection and
devaluing the shilling. Tax rates have been lowered, most prices
decontrolled, imports liberalised and export incentives strengthened. The
main thrust of reform has been to force industrialists to seek export-led
growth and to improve efficiency as protection is reduced.
Quantitative controls on imports have been abolished, tariff rates lowered
and tariff dispersion narrowed. There are 12 tariff bands compared with 25
previously, and while maximum tariff rates have been cut and average tariffs
reduced, the main reduction in protection was achieved by abolishing import
controls. In the mid-1980s, import bans covered most of industrial
production, but by the end of 1990, the IMF estimated that only about 5 per
cent of imports were restricted. Today, protection is greatest for cars and
textiles.
Four years ago, the top tariff rate was 170 per cent, and as recently as
1990 there were more than 1,400 items with tariff rates of 80 per cent or
more. Today, the top rate of 70 per cent applies to some 1,370 items, with
more than half the product categories attracting tariffs of 15-35 per cent.
The next stage of tariff reform is to abolish the licensing system and
further narrow the range of tariffs which will shift the responsibility for
stabilising the balance of payments to demand management by fiscal and
monetary means.
It is too early to tell how the sector is responding to this shock therapy.
There is some evidence of inefficient producers going to the wall and of
industrialists responding positively to improved export opportunities
brought about by the reduction in protection and currency depreciation.
Industrialists support liberalisation, though there have been loud
complaints from electronics, vehicle components and razor blade
manufacturers that they are being marginalised by import dumping.
Statistics on industrial exports differ. According to the government, there
has been a 70 per cent rise in the volume of manufactured exports since
1982, but the value of manufactured exports (excluding chemicals) shows a
fall from more than Dollars 100m in 1980 to an average of Dollars 96m over
1988-90.
Opinions differ about Kenya's capacity to become a significant exporter of
manufactures. The optimists believe its geographical location is ideal for
exploiting its traditional east African and Preferential Trade Area market
and markets in the EC and southern Asia. Pessimists say the market is too
small to secure scale economies while quality and packaging is inferior.
A worrisome aspect is the apparent reluctance of multinationals to invest or
expand in Kenya. Bankers say that most of the new investment in
manufacturing has come from smaller and newer investors, often Asians,
including Asian businesses based abroad. This has led to increased
competition in industries such as edible oils, previously a monopoly, and to
improved performance in several sectors where cost-conscious entrepreneurs,
using modern equipment, are transforming some of Kenya's industries.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (9): Dependence on capital inflows - Balance
of payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA's current account deficit of more than Dollars 400m annually - 5.5 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1990 - highlights the country's dependence
on capital inflows.
During the 1980s, Kenya ran up an accumulated current account deficit of
Dollars 3.5bn and was a net capital exporter to the tune of Dollars 500m. It
relied almost exclusively on foreign aid and loans from multilateral
institutions such as the World Bank and IMF to finance its Dollars 3bn
current account deficit.
In fact, gross disbursements during the 1980s exceeded Dollars 4.5bn, of
which the World Bank provided almost one-third, and bilateral loans from
donors another third. The balance was provided in the form of export and
suppliers' credits and bank borrowings which totalled Dollars 675m.
This is not a reassuring situation, at a time when Kenya is coming under
intense, albeit largely politically-inspired, pressure from donors, and when
foreign aid budgets are being closely scrutinised and reallocated. The
debt-service ratio peaked at 39 per cent in 1987 then fell to 29.5 per cent
in 1990 and Kenyans have become proud of their status as one of only four
sub-Saharan countries to have avoided debt-rescheduling in the last eight
years.
The government says that it will reduce the debt-service ratio to 24 per
cent next year, though this is based on the somewhat optimistic assumption
that export earnings will increase 10 per cent annually during the next two
years.
Provided Kenya can keep the donors moderately happy while avoiding serious
political upsets, the external debt situation should continue to be
manageable. However, Kenya's proud debt servicing record could be threatened
if the country falls short on either count, especially since its past export
track record does not lend support to the rose-tinted export growth
scenario.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (8): A weak export performance - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN COMMON with almost every other African country, Kenya is trying to reduce
dependence on a narrow range of commodity exports and develop
non-traditional exports, especially of manufacturers. It has made little
progress, in spite of the reversal of policies which, until the mid-1980s,
ensured that it was more profitable to produce and sell domestically than
export.
Trade liberalisation and a supportive exchange rate policy are beginning to
change that but since 1985 the dollar value of exports has increased less
than 10 per cent.
The main reason for this sluggish performance was the collapse of coffee
prices in 1987. Prices more than doubled between 1982 and 1986 before
falling 36 per cent in 1987. After a strong recovery in 1988, they reverted
to their depressed 1987 levels last year, and have since fallen still
further. This has been partially offset by the rise in tea prices, which
have more than doubled over the past 10 years.
The blame for the country's weak export performance cannot be laid at the
door of volatile commodity prices alone. At the end of the 1980s, the share
of exports in GDP was averaging 12 per cent, compared with 19 per cent 10
years earlier.
The most exciting development has been the growth of horticulture. The value
of horticultural exports has doubled since the mid-1980s to Dollars 140m and
they are the fourth largest foreign currency earner after tourism, tea and
coffee. The lacklustre performance of manufactured exports, which at Dollars
94m in 1990 were worth less than in 1980 (Dollars 109m), continues to
disappoint.
Trade figures must be interpreted cautiously, since there the informal
exports are not reflected in the official data. One industrialist estimates
that up to 30 per cent of his company's products are sold in neighbouring
territories, but only 5 per cent is officially recorded as exports.
In spite of this disappointing performance, Kenyan businessmen are confident
they can develop non-traditional exports. The key prerequisites for a
much-improved export performance are a marked reduction in inflation,
liberal import policies, greater efficiency on the part of the transport
parastatals, and an active exchange rate policy. Experience in the early
1980s demonstrated that the wrong conditions - expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies, trade controls and an over-valued exchange rate - will bias
production towards the domestic market.
That is now accepted, and the establishment of export processing zones and
the manufacturing under bond scheme are evidence of an aggressive export
strategy.
An important element has been exchange rate policy, with the real effective
rate for the Kenya shilling depreciating more than 40 per cent since 1985.
This, in combination with falling real wages, has improved the country's
international competitiveness - though there is little evidence as yet of an
upsurge in non-traditional export volumes.
Kenyan optimism over its ability to penetrate neighbouring markets is
tempered by recognition that South Africa - and Zimbabwe, following its
recent sharp devaluation - will become increasingly aggressive competitors
in regional markets. Furthermore, even where Kenya has a cost-leadership
edge, quality, product design and packaging standards do not measure up to
international standards, nor is there much evidence of a dynamic export
culture, especially in manufacturing.
The impact of trade reform is apparent in the changed and changing structure
of exports. Horticulture, in which Kenya has a clear comparative advantage,
is benefiting; while two exports in which Kenya does not have competitive
advantage - cement and transport equipment - have declined.
Imports are dominated by capital equipment - 37 per cent of the total,
manufactures (18 per cent), intermediate goods (16 per cent) and fuel (15
per cent). The import substitution strategy that dominated foreign trade
policy before structural adjustment was launched has been progressively
abandoned, first with the abolition of direct controls, and second with the
reform of the tariff structure - reducing the average rate of protection and
simplifying the tariff book.
In theory, imports are freely available, but in practice there is a queueing
system for licences caused by the foreign currency shortage.
The EC dominates the direction of trade accounting for 45 per cent of both
exports and imports. Britain is the main trading partner with an 18 per cent
share of the Kenyan market and purchasing 17.5 per cent of exports in 1990.
Japan has a 9 per cent market share, while the United Arab Emirates, with 13
per cent of the market in 1990 (during a period of high oil prices), is the
main supplier of oil.
Japan's imports from Kenya are negligible (Dollars 13m in 1990), and there
is obvious scope for broadening regional trade. Kenya has a Dollars 170m
recorded trade surplus with the rest of Africa, with exports of Dollars 235m
and imports of only Dollars 65m. The actual trade surplus is significantly
higher, given substantial unrecorded exports with neighbouring countries,
especially Uganda and Tanzania. In 1990, these two countries accounted for 8
per cent of total exports and more than half Kenya's African business.
For adjustment to succeed, trade patterns must change, since the obvious
market opportunities for manufactured exports are in Africa, and especially
within the 19-member Preferential Trade Area (PTA), where Kenya, Zimbabwe
and Mauritius are the big players.
South African imports are bound to grow rapidly over the next few years, and
other African suppliers, the UK and some Asian exporters will lose market
share.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (7): Little interest from abroad -
Investment, Unemployment problem sits on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF KENYA is to avoid a serious unemployment problem later in the decade, it
will have to invest a good deal more and make that investment more
productive.
By sub-Saharan standards its recent investment record is relatively good,
with fixed investment (ignoring inventories) averaging almost 20 per cent of
gross domestic product. The capital output ratio has been close to four -
implying that Kenya has to invest Dollars 4m to obtain a Dollars 1m increase
in output. This means that to grow at 5 per cent a year, Kenya must invest
four times that - approximately 20 per cent of GDP. Unfortunately, 5 per
cent growth is inadequate, given Kenya's population growth rate and age
profile, so that a 20 per cent investment ratio is just not good enough.
The country's capacity to maintain investment at current levels depends
heavily on foreign funding. Not on foreign direct investment, which averaged
Dollars 30m annually during the 1980s, but on aid grants and loans. Domestic
savings, as a share of GDP, have declined in recent years, partly because of
the government deficit. The result has been that between one-fifth and a
quarter of total investment is funded from abroad and in a world short of
capital, this is a precarious situation.
The Kenyan response - like that in many other African countries - has been
to promote private investment by establishing an Investment Promotion
Centre, seeking to create an enabling environment to foster private
entrepreneurship, and establishing export processing and
manufacturing-under-bond zones.
However, foreign investors are staying away, which is hardly surprising
given the two-year dividend remittance pipeline. Rapid exchange rate
depreciation compounds the problem: a KPounds 17.8m dividend was worth
Dollars 1m in 1988, but by the time it could be remitted in 1990, it had
depreciated to Dollars 775,000, thereby sharply lowering the foreign
shareholder's return on his investment. Nor has foreign investor sentiment
been helped by Kenya's poor international media image.
The IPC, established in 1982 as a department within the Ministry of Finance,
was converted to an autonomous parastatal five years ago, charged with
promoting foreign and domestic investment, acting as a one-stop-shop for
investors, and advising government on policy reforms needed to increase
investment. Officials insist the centre's chief task is promotional - to
attract and motivate investors and then help them through the labyrinth of
Kenya's tangled, overlapping bureaucracy. They have been instructed to get a
project fully approved within a month, but acknowledge that it takes five to
six weeks.
Businessmen say it takes longer, pointing out that even when the IPC has
obtained its basic approvals from the relevant government departments and
the central bank (where applicable), there are often other licences and
permits to be obtained - work permits, and trade and import licences.
The IPC has processed more than 229 applications since 1988, resulting in
project approvals totalling some Dollars 350m, and creating 23,200 jobs. Not
all approvals are actually translated into projects, and an IPC list of 123
approvals shows that less than one-third are operational.
Another third has been approved, but these are held up because the promoters
have yet to raise the necessary capital or are looking for a joint-venture
partner. A handful have been rejected including one submitted by Colgate
Palmolive, while eight projects cannot go ahead until suitable land is made
available. Ten of the 120 were abandoned after being approved, while the
remaining 20 are under construction or awaiting the arrival of imported
machinery.
Most of the 35 operational projects are small, representing a total
investment of less than Dollars 30m. Particularly disconcerting is that only
about 10 per cent of the project list is expected to generate foreign
currency, though there could, be significant import savings.
The list is far from complete since investors are not obliged to go through
the IPC, although they are advised to do so. One official estimates that as
much as 30 per cent of new projects bypass the centre. The IPC hopes to
expand its activities abroad in the next few years, opening a second
European office - it has one in Zurich - as well as establishing a presence
in the Asia Pacific region and the US.
The slow response is not surprising, given that less than 2 per cent of
global foreign direct investment goes to Africa. Kenya does not offer a
package of attractive investment incentives - except in the EPZs. Non-EPZ
investment qualifies for export compensation for non-traditional and
manufactured exports, import tax and VAT exemptions on imported plant and
equipment and tax breaks on investment in plant and machinery.
Foreign investment is guaranteed against expropriation, and while dividends,
profits and royalties are freely remittable, there is a two-year queue which
has encouraged some companies to reinvest. Kenya is a signatory to the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga), and has signed the US
Overseas Private Investment Corp (Opic) agreement. The EPZ package is far
more attractive - a 10-year tax holiday, followed by a 25 per cent rate of
corporate tax, exemption from exchange controls, and no withholding taxes on
dividends.
The IPC's belief that there are attractive opportunities in agro-processing,
horticulture and tourism is well-founded, though there are very real
environmental and crowding-out constraints on tourism, while international
competition in horticulture is increasing rapidly.
Whether Kenya can attract investment in electronics, pharmaceuticals,
chemicals, engineering and vehicle components is more problematic. With the
declining importance of low-skilled labour in many manufacturing activities,
Kenya does not have much to offer by way of competitive advantage.
Its best hope perhaps is as Africa's third growth pole - after South Africa
and Nigeria - exploiting its geographical position as the hub of the east
African market. But that is not a large market by international standards,
and not big enough to yield the scale economies so essential to profitable
manufacturing and export in many industries today.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (6): A question of the right rate - Banking,
Most policy reforms have been implemented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE SECTOR where the Kenyan government cannot be blamed for dragging its
heels is banking and finance.
The bulk of the policy reforms laid out in the Financial Sector Adjustment
Operation have been implemented, though there is still a good way to go on
the institutional side. In April 1989, minimum savings and deposit rates
were raised in three steps from 10 per cent to 13.5 per cent. With inflation
below 11 per cent, real rates were positive, remaining so until 1991.
In 1990, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) abolished its controls on
lending-related fees, thereby liberalising interest rates, though maximum
lending rates were capped until July this year when interest rates were
completely deregulated. Treasury Bill rates are market determined - the cap
was lifted in October 1990 - and early this year the CBK began open-market
operations.
It has not been possible to shift the entire government overdraft into the
Treasury Bill market, partly because the authorities wanted to avoid paying
more for their money, and because the money market could not have coped with
the volume of short-term public sector borrowing.
Prime lending rates are in the range of 16 per cent to 17 per cent for the
main banks, and while this means lending rates are negative in real terms,
the authorities expect the inflation rate, which averaged 20 per cent in the
first 10 months of the year, to fall below prime and some deposit rates in
the first half of 1992. The government is predicting positive real savings
rates of about 2 per cent, and real lending rates of 5 per cent.
It's a highly segmented interbank market with the leading players reluctant
to lend to a number of the smaller, local banks. Similarly, high-risk
borrowers are paying well over the prime rate - as much as 24 per cent to 25
per cent - for their loans.
Four commercial banks dominate a market comprising some 28 banks and more
than 50 financial institutions. The banking sector is dominated by the
state-owned Kenya Commercial Bank and Barclays, each with more than 20 per
cent of the market, followed by Standard Chartered with 15 per cent and the
government-owned National Bank of Kenya with less than 10 per cent.
Banking legislation was amended, specifying new capital asset ratios, set at
5.5 per cent in 1991 and 7.5 per cent by January 1992. Ten financial
institutions were restructured and merged into a new bank - the Consolidated
Bank of Kenya. A Capital Markets Authority (CMA) was set up in March 1990,
tasked with broadening and deepening the existing markets. It has three key
objectives - increasing competition in the securities markets, encouraging
secondary market development, and improving incentives for private capital
and particularly privatisation issues.
Its first steps including getting the government to abolish double-taxation
of dividends, reduce corporate rates, amend the unit trust legislation and
allow company share issue expenses to be tax deductible.
The authority has not moved as fast as it would like, partly because market
conditions have been difficult, with the growth of political uncertainty and
because the government fell behind target with its privatisation programme.
There have been just two public share issues in the last two years - by
Kenya Commercial Bank, and the Kenya Finance Corporation, while two others
were aborted.
The CMA believes that the market can absorb between KPounds 1bn and KPounds
2bn of new issues over a 12-15 month period, and has plans to bring as many
as possible of the 15 parastatals identified for flotation to the market
during 1992. The pace of privatisation will depend on market depth and
enthusiasm for the different issues.
An important reform in November was the launch of Foreign Exchange
Certificates, denominated in US dollars and paying interest at the London
Interban Offered Rate (Libor). These allow Kenyans or foreigners to bring in
foreign currency - though not export earnings, which have to be sold to the
central bank - and obtain a certificate enabling them to repatriate funds.
The aim of the exercise was to loosen exchange controls, encourage Kenyans
and others to bring in foreign currency, and marginalise the black market.
The certificates are being traded at a premium in the secondary market, with
anyone who imports foreign exchange being allowed to sell the certificate at
a premium to someone moving funds out of Kenya.
While the innovation has been welcomed by the banks, there are some worries
over the government's ability to provide the foreign currency - and over the
size of the premium that might emerge. The certificates are a potentially
attractive vehicle for transferring dividends which are subject to a
two-year pipeline.
Their introduction has unlocked an area of pent-up demand pressure for
foreign currency and if inflows are only modest, the premium in the
secondary market could widen, dragging the black market premium of about 15
per cent to 20 per cent up with it.
As in most sub-Saharan countries, monetary policy is budget-driven, with the
central bank financing the public sector deficit. In 1990, government
borrowing from the banks increased nearly 60 per cent to KPounds 28bn. This
had slowed to 22 per cent in the year to September 1991. The public sector
accounted for 70 per cent of money supply growth, underlining the extent to
which monetary policy is dominated by fiscal considerations.
Reserve requirements - 6 per cent for commercial banks - and liquidity
ratios of 20 per cent for banks and 24 per cent for non-bank financial
institutions are not used to regulate credit growth, because while most of
the banks and financial institutions maintain such ratios, there are some
which cannot and the CBK has not forced them to do so.
Credit ceilings were introduced at the end of 1987, but these tended to be
ignored by the banks until the authorities imposed penalties in May 1990.
The snag with such controls is that they are targeted at the private sector,
thereby constraining investment, while government credit creation continues
unabated.
If the government can get a grip on public spending, money supply growth
should slow during the latter half of the fiscal year to June. The
authorities are committed to cutting the budget deficit from 5.6 per cent of
GDP in 1990-91 to 2 per cent, but this is an overly ambitious target and the
signs are that it will be closer to 4 per cent. In spite of this, there
should still be a marked slowdown in government borrowing and credit
expansion over the next six months.
Monetary growth has contributed significantly to the acceleration in
inflation. Kenyan research shows that money supply growth fuels inflation
with a lag of about six months, though a variety of other factors, such as
the decontrol of prices, higher energy costs and currency depreciation,
explain the increased tempo of price rises.
With economic growth of no more than 4 per cent last year, and monetary
expansion of about 20 per cent, inflationary pressures will remain strong
for much of 1992, suggesting that the authorities will overshoot their
target of 5 per cent inflation by the end of 1992.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (5): Donors face up to the realities - The
Economy, In trouble but not yet in deep crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LISTENING TO donors and some Kenyan businessmen, it is easy to believe that
the Kenyan economy is in deep crisis. It isn't yet, though it could well
become so if the political situation continues to sour. The truth - which
almost all donors have denied until recently - is that the economy has been
in trouble for some years, but it was neither politic, nor fashionable, to
say so.
That it has become so, especially in the last year, reflects a sea-change in
donor opinion. There are three clear strands to this: post-1989 focus on
human rights and governance is arguably the most important, especially for
Kenya, whose record in the field of pluralism, transparency and
accountability is abysmal. Corruption has escalated and is a significant
part of the country's economic and political difficulties.
Two other influences have been at work. One is the spurned suitor syndrome:
donors have lost patience with the African country, for so long their
favourite son, reacting with indignation at what they see as betrayal. The
fact that it took them so long to recognise that their money was failing to
achieve the desired result is a sorry commentary on the quality of donor
decision-making.
As one businessman puts it: 'The donors went on taking Kenyan promises at
face value for too long, while at the same time kidding themselves that
reform was on track.'
Thirdly, the theology of structural adjustment has changed. In Kenya,
progress in the financial sector, in the decontrol of prices, agricultural
marketing and trade liberalisation has been undermined by a deteriorating
public sector.
Getting half the equation right is not good enough. Mr Lucas Ndungi,
chairman of Nestle in Kenya and president of the Kenya Association of
Manufacturers, sums it up: 'The private sector cannot move faster than
government.'
In the public and parastatal sectors a gap separates promises from
performance. The absence of political commitment, the sense that no-one is
wholly in charge of economic strategy, the determination of 'rent-seekers'
to secure their unwarranted slice of the action, and the familiar problem of
motivating a bloated bureaucracy to push through politically unpalatable
policies have combined to create the feeling of an economic crisis.
That a country whose economy has been growing at 4.9 per cent a year since
1985, and which has outperformed virtually all other African countries, is
now deemed to be in crisis is hard for the outsider to grasp. At first
glance, it appears to have achieved far more than most other African
countries, judged by the normal yardsticks of economic performance. A
comparison with Zimbabwe - a country widely regarded as another African top
performer - illustrates the point.
However, Zimbabwe climbed on to the structural adjustment bandwagon only a
year ago, while Kenya has been on it for six years. Moreover, Kenya's
performance is visibly deteriorating, while Zimbabwe's experience with
reform is too shortlived for any meaningful conclusions to be reached. Also,
Kenya has become increasingly aid-dependent in recent years, while
Zimbabwe's aid reliance is among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa.
Above all, there is the sense that, should Kenya, with its impressive growth
record, be in danger of slipping into the crisis category, that is largely
of the government's own making. But this is less than fair, given the
one-third deterioration in the terms of trade since the mid-1980s.
Four problems loom when assessing economic prospects: public sector reform,
aid dependence, export expansion and unemployment. The most urgent is that
of restructuring both the parastatal sector and central government.
The country's near-term stabilisation difficulties have their origins in
excessive public spending. Inflation, which averaged 20 per cent on the
revised retail price index last year, is at its highest level for a decade -
the result, mainly, of rapid monetary growth of 20 per cent annually in the
last two years, currency depreciation, increased fuel prices and the
decontrol of prices.
The main cause of money supply growth was government borrowing to fund the
budget deficit of 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. The authorities are
committed to reducing this to only 2 per cent in the fiscal year to June,
but that target looks optimistic and about 4 per cent seems more likely.
The problem is partly structural - too many ministries, too many civil
servants and too much spending on wages rather than goods and services. The
result - a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy.
Parastatals are a big part of the problem. Over the years the government
built up a portfolio of investments ranging from horse-breeding to Kenya
Airways. Ten years ago a government report found that the state was earning
a return of a mere 0.2 per cent on its Dollars 1.4bn parastatal investment.
If the profits of the central bank are excluded, the parastatal sector is
costing the government KPounds 2.9bn or almost 1 per cent of GDP.
Elimination of the parastatal deficit is central to balancing the budget.
While 139 non-strategic enterprises were listed in the July 1991 budget as
privatisation targets, little progress has been made. This is the root cause
of donor disillusionment. It also helps explain Kenya's difficulties in
meeting targets set under the current loan agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
Today, Kenya can afford neither the financial burden of an inefficient
public sector, nor donor disapproval. In the last five years, the balance of
payments has been in surplus only twice - in 1986, when coffee prices were
buoyant, and again in 1989 when there were substantial aid inflows. Over
that period aid grants averaged 2.5 per cent of GDP, while foreign capital
inflows have financed more than 20 per cent of total investment.
The growth in aid dependence is reflected in the sharp rise in the ratio of
grants to GDP - from 1 per cent in 1986 to more than 3 per cent in 1990. In
a world of capital shortages and heightened competition for the donor
dollar, Kenya needs to improve its image with the donor community while
reducing aid dependence.
This will be difficult. Kenya's trade policy reforms, designed to increase
domestic efficiency and encourage exports have had little impact. Exports
increased 10 per cent in the four years to 1990, while imports grew twice as
fast, rising 23 per cent. Even after grants averaging Dollars 365m a year
the current account foreign payments deficit averaged Dollars 500m in
1989-90.
While tourism, whose 1990 earnings of Dollars 465m matched those of tea and
coffee combined, is partially financing the trade deficit, its growth is
likely to slow, underscoring the urgency of an early, powerful export
response.
The pieces are in place - strengthened export incentives, the launch of
export processing zones, tariff reform and shilling depreciation - but
Kenyan industry does not have an export culture and it will be competing
against in a world where dozens of developing countries have similar
strategies and where cost-leadership is not enough. Quality is vital.
Horticulture has set a precedent, demonstrating that an export culture can
be created and high quality achieved.
Kenya needs to create 400,000 jobs a year to keep pace with a population
that will double over the next 17 years. There is a large pool of
unemployed, with urban unemployment estimated at 16 per cent.
In the last four years, formal sector job generation has averaged 90,000 a
year, with the bulk (48,000 a year) occurring in small-scale enterprises.
Official figures point to the creation of more than 400,000 jobs in 1990 in
the informal sector, but because informal sector incomes and productivity
are not growing, this - in the words of a Kenyan report - is 'neither growth
nor development'. Privatisation and fiscal stringency mean that the public
sector, which accounts for virtually half wage employment, will make little
contribution to employment expansion.
The fact that unemployment has risen rapidly in spite of economic growth of
5 per cent headlines the need for significantly faster expansion in the
1990s if a socio-political crisis is to be averted. But for the economy to
grow more rapidly, the inter-related balance of payments and investment
constraints must be loosened, underscoring yet again the need for Kenya to
pursue an export-led growth strategy while making its peace with the donor
and foreign investor communities.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (4): Battle to cut spending - The budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE AFRICAN structural adjustment programmes have foundered on budgetary
problems than any other single obstacle.
From 1985, when it launched its Budget Rationalisation Programme (BRP),
Kenya has been grappling with the problem of excessive and inefficient
patterns of public spending. The number of government ministries has
increased from 19 in 1970 to 28; there are six ministries responsible for
manpower training, and public sector employment has been expanding at over 6
per cent a year - faster than GDP. In 1990, there were more than 26,000
people employed in excess of establishment, costing 0.5 per cent of GDP.
An important factor has been education. There are more than 5.6m pupils in
schools compared with just over 900,000 30 years ago. Education spending
accounts for more than 40 per cent of recurrent public expenditure.
Much is rightly made of the contribution of education to economic growth,
but the emphasis of Kenya's higher education programmes has been on turning
out graduates qualified to work in the public sector. The government
estimates that roughly two-thirds of graduates are best qualified to work in
the public sector.
A second striking feature is the distribution of civil servants across
departments, with the Office of the President employing some 48,000 people -
more than such ministries as health, agriculture and public works.
The combination of rapid public sector employment growth, higher pay for
civil servants, rapidly rising interest payments and slow-growing government
revenue has undermined civil service effectiveness and created a
destabilising fiscal situation.
Public service efficiency is suffering from the shift in the pattern of
expenditure in favour of wages and salaries, and away from goods and
services. The share of non-personnel spending in the recurrent budget has
fallen from more than one-third 10 years ago to less than a quarter today,
with the familiar result of pupils without desks and books and agricultural
extension officers without transport.

Meanwhile, government revenue slipped to 24 per cent of GDP last year, while
expenditure rose to almost 30 per cent, leaving a budget deficit of 5.6 per
cent, well above the targeted 3.8 per cent. The 1991-92 budget projects a
sharp reduction in the deficit, from KPounds 12.2bn to KPounds 4.6bn, to be
achieved by holding expenditure growth to only 5.6 per cent. With inflation
at current levels, this implies a double-digit decline in real public
spending, while revenue increases 19 per cent.
Revenue will rise, due mainly to the imposition of VAT on fuel in February
1991 for the full 1991-92 fiscal year, along with increases in indirect
taxes. User fees are to be imposed on university students, and outpatients
fees reintroduced at hospitals.
The main challenge will arise on the expenditure side, where the government
is committed to retrenching some low-paid employees while freezing new
appointments. There will be no increase in the number of primary school
teachers, meaning an increase in pupil-teacher ratios. University enrolments
are being halved, and civil service pay awards will be phased in over three
years. Development spending has been cut with the cancellation of some
projects and restricting new projects to those wholly-funded by donors.
Because public sector retrenchment and parastatal restructuring are running
behind timetable, while inflation is ahead of forecast and economic growth
slower than predicted, the 2 per cent of GDP budget deficit target for the
year looks optimistic.
There was a carry over of expenditure from the previous financial year, and
the government has been forced to pick up the tab for parastatal
debt-servicing to avoid default. Higher interest rates will push up the cost
of debt service, and parastatals are going to need continued financial
support from central government.
Revenue is on target and in the absence of new public spending setbacks,
always possible at a time of high inflation, the Treasury should manage to
get the deficit close to 4 per cent of GDP, thereby convincing donors that
Kenya is at last getting to grips with the problem of public expenditure.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (3): Moi tests voters' mood - Politics,
Stage set for an engrossing general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE space of three weeks late last year, Kenyan politics was transformed.
It began with confrontation and ended in accommodation, as President Daniel
arap Moi bowed to mounting domestic and external pressure and lifted the ban
on opposition parties.
The stage is set for an early general election in which an opposition led by
a coalition party is pitted against the ruling Kenya African National Union
(Kanu), unchallenged at the polls since 1966.
Recent resignations, including that of Mr Mwai Kibaki, a senior minister and
former vice-president who intends to launch his own party, have seriously
weakened Kanu. And if the main opposition party, the Forum for the
Restoration of Democracy (Ford), an alliance of veteran politicians,
businessmen, lawyers and academics, can hold together, Mr Moi faces a
formidable threat.
However, he does have the advantage of long established party machine,
control of state patronage, and an economic record which, while tarnished,
is bettered by few African states.
Although differences may emerge once the campaign gets off the ground, there
so far appears no fundamental policy dispute between the parties. Ford, led
by former vice-president Mr Oginga Odinga, 80, has not suggested it would
deviate from the government's economic reform programme.
However, the government will be vulnerable to charges that mismanagement and
official corruption have seriously undermined these reforms. The opposition
will contrast its strong human rights stance with Kanu's authoritarian
history.
The president has displayed an unexpected political agility. Once committed
to the one-party system that has kept him in office for 13 years, Mr Moi
last year began hinting at change in the offing. But the speed with which he
finally moved caught the nascent opposition unprepared.
In early December somewhat bemused delegates to a special congress of Kanu,
who had spent the day extolling the merits of a one-party state, were
effectively instructed by Mr Moi that they had to allow multi-party
politics.
Yet this remarkable turn-around began with a crackdown that boded ill for
Kenya.
In mid-November leading supporters of Ford, which at that stage stopped
short of calling itself a political party, were arrested shortly before they
were scheduled to address a Nairobi rally.
The next day riot police used tear-gas to disperse crowds trying to defy the
government's ban on the meeting, and Kenya appeared set for confrontation.
The timing could not have been worse for the country's economy. A few days
later Kenya's aid donors meeting in Paris announced that they would withold
their response to the government's request for new aid for six months.
Further help, they warned, would depend on progress in political and
economic reforms.
Adding to the tension were the allegations and revelations surfacing at the
official inquiry into the murder in 1990 of Mr Robert Ouko, then Kenya's
foreign minister and a leading member of the Luo tribe.
Mr John Troon, a British detective who led a Scotland Yard team of
investigators called in by the government, named Mr Nicholas Biwott, a
cabinet minister seen as Mr Moi's closest ally, as a prime suspect in the
murder.
The motive, he suggested, was growing concern about information unearthed by
Mr Ouko during his internal probe into high-level corruption, which
allegedly implicated Mr Biwott and other senior officials.
Mr Moi responded by sacking Mr Biwott from the cabinet. A week later, Mr
Biwott was arrested after the president ended the 244-day inquiry and
ordered police to act 'immediately' on the information that had been made
available.
Another senior government official arrested at the same time has been
charged with murder. Mr Biwott, however, was subsequently released, with
police explaining that there were insufficient grounds on which to hold him
'at this stage'.
Events have been moving so fast in Kenya that it may be premature to draw
any conclusions from this surprising development. But most observers agree,
that Mr Moi will pay a price at the ballot box if quicker progress is not
made in resolving the Ouko affair.
The corruption issue apart, the president has no time to lose in addressing
other concerns.
Mr Moi has to reshuffle a cabinet and party leadership in which sycophancy
has often outweighed competence. But a critical consideration for the
president, a member of the minority Kalenjin clan, will be the need for his
new team to reflect the ethnic arithmetic of the main four tribal groupings
 -the Kikuyu, the biggest single tribe, the Luo, the Luhya and the Kamba.
The first stage of the reshuffle has proved controversial. The president
dismissed Mr Peter Oloo Aringo, a Luo who was minister of manpower
development and national chairman of Kanu.
Mr Aringo, who subsequently joined Ford, was seen as a leading member of the
reformist wing of Kanu, supporting multi-party politics and critical of the
often corrupt and intolerant old guard. His departure suggested that the
hardline guard is still in charge.
The opposition, relishing the spectacle of sackings and resignations (five
ministers quit in December alone), continued to consolidate one of their
main assets, a careful ethnic spread.
This consideration is uppermost in the selection of the opposition's
presidential candidate. Mr Odinga could prove to be a shrewd choice -
assuming his current leadership status is confirmed at the party's
forthcoming inaugural congress.
Although a Luo, he has a national appeal, while the combination of his
advancing years and the likelihood that there will be a strong cabinet -
should Ford win - drawn from across tribal lines will reassure Kenyans
anxious not to repeat their experiences of all-powerful presidencies with a
strong ethnic bias.
Under the Ford umbrella are prominent figures from the Luhya community, such
as Mr Martin Shikuku, who led a short-lived breakaway movement before
returning to the Ford fold, and Mr Masinde Muliro, both veterans of the
independence struggle.
Kikuyu representation includes by Mr Kenneth Matiba, a leading businessman,
Mr Charles Rubia and Mr Manyua Waiyaki, ex-ministers, and a younger
generation of politicians such as lawyers Mr Paul Muite, and Mr Gitobu
Imanyara, from the closely associated Meru tribe.
It is a powerful combination, but one with undercurrents of personal and
tribal rivalries that Mr Moi can be expected to exploit as he wages the
battle for his political life.

FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (2): Aid packages linked to social and
economic reform - Foreign Relations, Donors turn frustration into action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FROM GOLDEN boy to whipping boy,' observed a senior Kenyan official,
responding to the most severe jolt in foreign relations since independence
nearly 30 years ago.
Once an African development model, Kenya has become an important test case
for the policy which links aid levels to good government.
Thus the outcome of an aid donors meeting in Paris last November dwarfed in
significance other important external issues such as the instability in the
Horn of Africa, the development of closer ties with South Africa, and hopes
for greater economic co-operation in east Africa.
The donors, chaired by the World Bank, announced they were holding back on
new aid pledges for six months. It was a remarkable demonstration of anger
and frustration over corruption, the slow implementation of an economic
adjustment programme, and the government's intolerance of opposition.
Many forces for change in Kenya were at work, some going back years. But it
seemed no accident that, days after the Paris meeting, President Daniel arap
Moi ended Kenya's one-party system.
The Paris decision was unprecedented in black Africa. Other states, such as
Sudan, have lost aid because of human rights abuses or economic
mismanagement. But the countries concerned have either been hostile to the
west, or of little commercial or strategic interest.
Kenya, however, presents a very different case. The pro-western stance
adopted under the late President Jomo Kenyatta has been followed
unwaveringly by President Moi.
Its mixed economy, broadly pro-capitalist when much of Africa was espousing
socialism, and home to some Pounds 1bn worth of British investment, expanded
at a rate that won Kenya plaudits as an African role model.
On issues ranging from backing for the boycott of the Moscow Olympics and a
supportive part in efforts to bring independence to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe)
and Namibia, to military pacts with Britain and the US involving training
facilities and access to the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, Mr Moi has been a
steadfast ally.
The rewards have been considerable.
Kenya has been one of the leading recipients of external aid in sub-Saharan
Africa, in the last two years alone receiving some Dollars 1.6bn, while the
ratio of grants to gross domestic product has grown from 1 per cent in 1986
to over 3 per cent in 1990.
Even as aid was rising, there was an increasing feeling among donors that
the Kenyan government was running what amounted to a skilful public
relations campaign, drawing up admirable development plans and policy papers
 -often containing frank analysis of economic shortcomings - but falling
well short of targets when it came to implementation.
With the thawing of the Cold War and the end of proxy conflicts in Africa,
and the growing demand across the continent for multi-party government, the
time was ripe to turn donor frustration into action.
First to move were Kenya's Scandinavian partners, vigorously lobbied by
Kenyans in exile, drawing attention to human rights' abuses at home.
In October 1990 Norway stopped its aid programme after Kenya broke off
diplomatic relations following Oslo's criticism of the government's
treatment of a prominent dissident. This was followed last year when Sweden
reduced aid and Denmark cut off all assistance.
It became apparent that the World Bank, Kenya's largest donor, was prepared
to put its foot down. In the course of 1991 the Bank suspended negotiations
over a loan to the energy sector, which had become notorious for the level
of corruption under Mr Nicholas Biwott, the energy minister, since sacked.
Meanwhile, Washington's outspoken ambassador to Kenya, Mr Smith Hempstone,
was increasingly critical of Kenya's human rights record; even the British
government, hitherto a proponent of discreet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy,
issued an unprecedented public warning.
Speaking shortly after last November's arrest of government critics Mrs
Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, condemned the action as
'oppression of opposing views' and called for 'further progress towards
democracy.'
In spite of these warnings, it nevertheless came as something of a shock for
the government - and provided a lift for the opposition - when the
communique issued after the World Bank chaired Paris meeting put the
principle of linkage between aid and good government so bluntly. 'Delegates
made clear their willingness to support Kenya's economic development', said
the communique, 'but stressed that levels of aid for Kenya also depend on
clear progress in implementing economic and social reforms.'
In vain, Kenyan officials have pointed out inconsistencies and anomalies in
the application of this principle elsewhere.
Nigeria, they note, has not attracted international opprobrium for its use
of the electoral system in which voters line up according to their political
preference, for a public count - a procedure dropped by Kenya last year.
Nor, they argue, can Nigeria boast a better human rights record, and the
country is renowned for corruption. Closer to home, Tanzania and Uganda are
also candidates for 'aid linkage', officials suggested.
They may have a point, acknowledged western diplomats in Nairobi, but it
would not divert donors' from their target.
Scenting success, Kenya's aid partners are unlikely to ease their pressures
until the government has taken further steps down the path of economic and
political reform.

THESE ARE momentous times for Kenya as it embarks on the difficult path to
democracy.
Moving from one-party rule to multi-party government is difficult enough in
Africa, where tribal allegiances still run deep; but making this change
while committed to painful economic reforms is a challenge indeed, as
leaders in Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia and elsewhere will testify.
With marked reluctance, President Daniel arap Moi last month joined this
group, ushering in what Kenyans hope will be a new era for a country whose
reputation has been damaged in recent years.
Bowing to pressure at home, and responding to a blunt demand by external aid
donors for speedier social and economic reform, Mr Moi lifted the ban on
opposition parties to the palpable relief and delight of most Kenyans.
In the next few months the country goes to the polls. It will be a
watershed: for the first time since Kenya became a de facto one-party state
in 1966, the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu) will face
competition.
The opposition line-up is still taking shape, but it is clear that the Kanu
government, already weakened by resignations and scandal, has a battle on
its hands. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), a broad-based
coalition is led by Mr Oginga Odinga, the former vice-president. With senior
officials coming from all three main tribes  - Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya - it
poses the main challenge.
Mr Mwai Kibaki, a former vice-president, a prominent Kikuyu, and one of five
ministers and deputy ministers to resign in the past month, leads the other
newly-formed Democratic Party, but may have difficulties disassociating
himself from a Kanu legacy of mixed achievements.
The run-up to the poll could prove a demanding period should feelings run
high. Continuing defections from Kanu would further undermine the authority
of a government evidently unpopular in Nairobi, whatever the support it may
enjoy elsewhere. At the same time, multi-party politics could exacerbate the
tribal and regional tensions that lie not far below the surface.
However, the safety valve should be the general election ahead. 'It is',
says a member of the post-independence generation, savouring the prospect of
political choice for the first time, 'a fresh start, a chance to make up for
mistakes made since independence.'
Few Kenyans want to jeopardise this opportunity to restore their country's
status as a rare African success story. Kenya can boast that for nearly 25
years real growth in gross domestic product outpaced an annual population
increase of nearly 4 per cent.
However, during the 1980s doubts began to set in about Kenya's economic
management, coupled with concern about a human rights record which, while
better than much of Africa, was falling short of what donors expected from a
leading recipient of their aid.
Although western assistance to Kenya was growing - the ratio of grants to
GDP rose from 1 per cent in 1986 to more than 3 per cent in 1990 - the gap
between government's policy promises and implementation widened. An economic
adjustment plan introduced in 1986 with the backing of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) frequently failed to meet performance
targets in important areas.
Tariff reforms, restructuring of the financial sector, export incentives,
and a competitive rate of exchange have won approval. But a growing fiscal
deficit, over-expansion of money supply and poor progress with the reform of
inefficient parastatals and a bloated government bureaucracy, overshadowed
these achievements.
Corruption, a problem since independence in 1963, became endemic, with
kickbacks and inflated contracts undermining aid programmes and deterring
foreign investors. Kanu became increasingly intolerant of outside criticism,
while losing credibility with many of its own supporters through blatant
rigging of party and parliamentary elections.
As power and wealth accumulated in the hands of a presidential clique, human
rights abuses multiplied. They ranged from spurious charges of sedition as a
way of crushing legitimate dissent, and restrictions on press freedom, to
torture, and detention of leading critics. The nadir was reached in early
1990 with the murder of Mr Robert Ouko, the popular former foreign minister.
The public inquiry that followed implicated senior government officials,
apparently determined to conceal a corruption scandal. Leading suspects
remain at large, gravely undermining the government's reputation.
Frustrated and angry, and armed with the comparatively recent development
strategy which links aid to political and economic reform in recipient
countries, Kenya's donors last November suspended new assistance, giving
government six months to put its house in order.
Barely days later, against a background of growing domestic dissent, Mr Moi
took the important first step. It may prove to be the easiest in what is
likely to be a difficult road ahead.
Whatever party emerges triumphant at the forthcoming general election has to
confront unpleasant economic realities and implement tough measures if it is
to win back the confidence of donors.
These require severe cuts in state spending, pruning of a bloated civil
service, new revenue raising measures including university and outpatient
fees, and faster privatisation of parastatals. All this and more has to take
place against a background of rising unemployment and growing land hunger.
Two-thirds of Kenya is arid or semi-arid. Sub-division of smallholdings is
approaching its limit, and more and more school leavers look to the towns
for work.
Though government has made headway in efforts to reduce the population
growth rate, the economy needs to create 400,000 jobs a year for a
population that will double in 17 years.
How much the electorate will blame Mr Moi for the state of the economy -
still in better shape than almost any other in Africa - remains to be seen.
Government officials argue that the origins of some of Kenya's economic
problems predate Mr Moi, who succeeded the late Jomo Kenyatta in 1978. But
the fact that many of those long-identified problems have yet to be tackled
suggests that the 1980's was a decade of lost opportunities.
As pertinent today as when written are the conclusions of a government
inquiry into government expenditure, appointed 10 years ago.
The government's 'serious financial crisis' had two roots, concluded the
committee, chaired by Mr Philip Ndegwa, a former governor of the central
bank. It acknowledged the adverse impact of external events. But, the report
went on, a 'stronger but less well perceived root (is) the proliferation of
commercial activities by government, which has diverted scarce management
talent away from the central functions of government.'
This, said the committee, together with heavily subsidised social and other
services, had led to an 'unmanageable growth' in government expenditure.
Ten years on, and the parastatal sector is costing the government Ksh2.9bn,
or almost 1 per cent of GDP. It is the largest single cause of governments
failure to meet spending targets. 'The new Kenya needs better management, a
crackdown on corruption, constitutional checks on the executive, and the
support of donors,' concluded a leading Kenyan businessman who has served in
government.
If the post-election administration accepts this advice, there is every
chance that Kenya, lapsed role model, could emerge as successful African
test case for democracy, donors and development.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Brazil calls for rethink on use of resources

<TEXT>
MR Jose Lutzenberger, Brazil's environment minister, yesterday accused the
industrialised world of 'continuing on a suicidal path' and called on world
leaders and businessmen to 'use 1992 to rethink our model of economic
development'.
He warned: 'If we do not want our children to be damned we must end our
current destructive culture and stop acting as if the planet is a mountain
of resources that we can use up as quickly as possible.'
The market economy was only a good model 'if it is complete  - which means
including future generations and the have-nots. What we are currently doing
with resources such as the Amazon is like the auction of a priceless
painting to a group of people who don't know its real worth, by a thief who
just wants to take his profit and run.'
His appeal came at the launch of the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable
Development, a Dollars 2.4m initiative by 24 of the country's leading
companies to create a technological databank.
He said the destruction of the Amazon rainforest should be the world's
principal preoccupation. Contrary to predictions by leading Amazonian
scientists, he claimed that deforestation last year was down on 1990.
Although official figures will not be published until April, Mr Lutzenberger
said he expected the destruction to be 8,000-9,000 sq km, compared with
14,000 in 1990 and 90,000 in 1987.
According to Mr Lutzenberger, the removal of subsidies has virtually
eliminated the destruction of rainforest by large ranches. His main
preoccupation now was with those exporting precious woods, such as mahogany.
A weekend of torrential rain in Rio de Janeiro has left a trail of
destruction, with at least 23 people dead and hundreds homeless.
The rains, which began late on Saturday, were the worst since 1988, when
many people died in flooding or were buried under rubble from favelas
(slums) sliding down the hills of the city.
The rains swept rubbish and sewage into houses and streets in northern
suburbs, leading to renewed fears over cholera.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Bush calls on South Korea to remove non-tariff barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Bush, the US president, yesterday called on South Korea to remove
all non-tariff barriers to trade and liberalise its financial system, saying
that doing business in Korea was still more difficult than it should be.
Mr Bush, addressing the subject of trade liberalisation which has been one
of the principal objectives of his Asia-Pacific tour  - Seoul is his third
stop and he arrives in Tokyo today  - said that Korea had made 'great
progress in removing visible trade barriers over the last five years'.
But he said that there are still 'fundamental problems that stifle the
ability of foreign firms to compete in Korea'. He cited 'cumbersome customs
procedures' and 'unjustified standards and regulations' as some of the
difficulties facing US exporters.
Mr Bush also urged Korea's co-operation in a successful conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Korea's refusal to allow imports of rice
has been one of the obstacles to a successful conclusion of the multilateral
negotiations.
There were several scattered protests by students, farmers and dissidents
demanding the Washington end pressure on the Seoul government to improve
trade.
Students and farmers burned effigies of President Bush, torched US flags,
staged marches and took out newspaper advertisements to demand an end to
Washington's pressure for opening of Korea's rice market. Protests occurred
in three cities, at the US embassy, in streets and on campuses. No arrests
were reported and most protests were peaceful.
The main opposition Democratic party adopted a resolution urging Mr Bush to
halt pressure to open Korea's rice market, saying it could touch off a new
wave of anti-Americanism.
Thirty-seven opposition party members who represent farm districts boycotted
Mr Bush's speech to the National Assembly. The Democratic party has 75 seats
in the 299-seat parliament.
Riot police blocked a march on parliament by angry farmers. There was
pushing and shoving, but no serious injuries were reported.
In Kwangju, 210km south-west of Seoul, about 300 students shouting 'No rice
imports' staged a rally in the streets, the national news agency Yonhap
reported.
Another group of several hundred students burned an American flag and a bag
of US rice before riot police dispersed them, Yonhap said. Later, 400
students staged a torch-light parade through Kwangju.
The government-backed National Agricultural Co-operative Federation placed
half-page advertisements in two English-language newspapers to support the
government's protectionist stance. It cited a recent campaign that collected
13m signatures in support of keeping the rice market closed.

POLAND'S new government will press ahead with privatising state-sector
companies and will seek finally to untangle ownership rights, Mr Tomasz
Gruszecki, the incoming senior privatisation official, has pledged.
'We want to privatise fast, but first we must clean up our present jungle
and finally establish who owns what,' he said yesterday. State-sector
companies needed to be told if they were to be privatised or not and a
'privatisation map' was to be drawn up.
Mr Gruszecki reiterated his support for 'mass privatisation' plans, or a
transfer of about 200 state-sector companies to foreign-managed investment
funds, with distribution of shares in the funds to the populace.
He said three top officials from his ministry had resigned with the change
of government, but stressed that talks with western investors which had been
started by the outgoing government would continue.
The new government also plans to merge the Privatisation Ministry with those
of Industry and Central Planning to form a single Economics Ministry. This
would be headed by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, now in charge of economic policy.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Portugal's pioneering approach to product research pays off:
An unusual alliance between academics and industry has won praise from the
Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH limited government resources to fund research programmes and few
companies able to undertake their own research, Portuguese academics and
industry have formed an unusual alliance by creating private institutions to
help companies develop products and improve their production and management
techniques.
Among them, the Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores (Inesc),
which specialises in information technology, telecommunications and
computers, has won praise from the European Community for its pioneering
approach. Its success has encouraged others such as the Oporto-based
Instituto de Engenharia Mecanica e Gestao Industrial (Inegi) which concerns
itself with engineering and management. Today there are 17 such institutions
in Portugal covering a wide range of sectors from biotechnology to physics.
Inesc was founded in 1980 as a private non-profitmaking organisation by
academics and state-owned telecommunications companies which wanted to pool
research resources. Today it has a budget of Es5bn (Dollars 36.4m) and has
added training and sponsorship of new high-technology companies to its
research and development work.
Finance comes from Inesc's shareholders, which include companies and
universities, from participation in EC programmes such as Esprit and Race,
and from research contracts. It is involved in about 50 large research
projects.
'The government didn't have the money to meet our needs, so we adopted a
(North) American model. We offered to train engineers and technicians for
the big companies so that they don't have to send people abroad, and in
return they help to finance our work and our equipment,' says Prof Jose
Tribolet, a founding member of Inesc.
Inesc has trained more than 5,000 young technicians  - school students with
no work experience and company employees requiring new skills.
It employs directly 150 full-time staff, with another 250 part-time
employees including a large number of professors seconded from the
university. About 200 post-graduate students do research at the institute
and some 300 undergraduates undertake their final year project there.
The relationship works both ways as Inesc can provide research conditions
and equipment which the universities cannot afford. 'We didn't want to take
people away from the university, but to improve and enrich it,' Prof
Tribolet says.
The relationship has been crucial in bringing universities closer to the
needs of industry. Prof Tribolet says education in Portugal for too long has
been seen as a source of personal status rather than as a tool to promote
wealth creation. 'Our objective is not to create a heaven for researchers,
but to make Portugal rich,' he says.
That philosophy is extended into Inesc's promotion of new high-tech ventures
through Aitec, an investment company set up in 1987 by Inesc and
Investimentos e Participacoes do Estado (INE)  - a state-owned holding
company  - each with a 50 per cent share.
Aitec acts as an incubator for new technology-based companies, providing
some of the initial risk capital, expertise and assistance with research.
The promoters of the company usually provide about 15 per cent of the
start-up capital, but once the company is established Aipec pulls out.
'We lead the market when it comes to risk capital. The so-called risk
capital and investment companies do everything except invest in risk, but
they come to us to back companies we're involved in.'
Inegi began more modestly and operates mainly in the industrial north.
Established in 1986, it is linked to the Mechanical Engineering and
Management department of the University of Oporto from which most of its
staff and researchers come. It is involved in more than 100 projects
including pilot studies to develop safety devices for car seats, finding an
alternative plaster for broken limbs or a new technology for producing cast
iron.
'In the early days it was difficult to convince people in industry we could
be useful to them, so at the beginning we worked for nothing. Demand grew
and we found it difficult to cope, so we created Inegi. Companies come to us
because they need to develop a new product and they don't have the qualified
people to do it,' Prof Silva Gomes, Inegi president says.
He says Inegi, with an annual turnover of close to Es200m and a budget about
10 times the size of that of the engineering department (excluding
salaries), has more resources for research and can respond quicker than the
university to requests from industry.
All money earned from research is ploughed back into the institute and to
help pay for some of the university's own staff and equipment.

FT  07 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Seelig statements on invoice 'differed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER SEELIG, a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell,
gave Mr Graham Walsh, then head of the corporate finance division,
inconsistent explanations of a Pounds 1.65m invoice the bank sent to
Guinness, Mr Walsh said yesterday.
Mr Walsh told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that Mr Seelig initially
told him that Pounds 1.35m represented commission on the placing of
Distillers shares converted into Guinness shares. Mr Seelig had said that
other items accounted for the balance.
Mr Seelig had not suggested that the invoice related to a loss Morgan had
made or might make on Guinness shares it had bought from LF Rothschild, a
New York investment bank.
After Department of Trade and Industry inspectors began investigating
Guinness Mr Seelig told Mr Walsh the invoice had included a 'cushion' to
protect Morgan against loss on Guinness shares.
Mr Walsh, now a non-executive director of Haslemere Estates and Moss Bros
Group, said he had been surprised, because there had been no loss. 'I was
astonished that anybody would agree to pay the bank for a paper loss which
had never been realised,' he said.
Miss Elizabeth Gloster QC, prosecuting, asked: 'Did you consider that was
consistent with what he had told you earlier?' Mr Walsh: 'I did not.'
He was giving evidence in the trial in which Mr Seelig and Lord Spens,
former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant
bank, deny fraud and false accounting.
Mr Walsh said he had not known during Guinness's bid for Distillers in 1986
that LF Rothschild had bought Guinness shares at Mr Seelig's request.
After the bid closed Mr Seelig told him he was trying to organise an orderly
disposal of Guinness shares purchased during the bid by 'friends' of
Guinness, including LF Rothschild. Mr Seelig had said there had been no
agreements or arrangements requiring the purchases to be disclosed under
takeover rules.
Miss Gloster asked what Mr Walsh's reaction would have been if Mr Seelig had
told him LF Rothschild had been indemnified by Morgan Grenfell against loss.
Mr Walsh said it would have been that the LF Rothschild purchase would in
effect have been on Morgan Grenfell's behalf and should have been disclosed.
What if Mr Seelig had said that Guinness would be covering any LF Rothschild
loss? Miss Gloster asked.
Mr Walsh said he would have been concerned about a possible infringement of
section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act because he would have thought Guinness
would have been giving financial assistance for the purchase of its own
shares.
The trial continues.

FT  07 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for oil majors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of forecast reductions for oil prices and company earnings and
dividends by a number of leading broking houses left the oil majors in
disarray, with the sector relative at its lowest level since 1989.
At the end of a busy session in the oils, BP was 12 1/2 down at 278p on
heavy turnover of 9.4m shares, Shell 10 lower at 488p on 4.3m and Enterprise
11 weaker at 434p on 856,000.
The oil price forecast cuts were instigated by James Capel and Hoare Govett,
and are likely to be followed by other brokers, according to dealers. James
Capel was thought to have lowered its oil estimate to Dollars 20 a barrel
from Dollars 21, and Hoare said it had shifted its forecast to Dollars 20.
The real damage to BP's share price, however, came from the earnings and
dividend reductions said to have been carried out by Capel, which was
thought to have reduced its full-year net income estimate for BP to Pounds
950m. This compares with a majority of estimates above Pounds 1bn. The
broker was also thought to have adopted a cautious line on fourth-quarter
dividend expectation. Oil companies have been hit by a combination of
falling oil prices and adverse currency movements.
Eurotunnel firm
A French press report that Eurotunnel was close to settling its dispute with
contractors TML sent the former's shares leaping 22 to 420p. The financial
daily Agefi reported that an agreement would be concluded this month and
that Eurotunnel's provisions for the deal, made in its last accounts, would
cover most of the cost of the renegotiated construction contract.
BAe lacks support
The implications of negative speculation at the weekend regarding British
Aerospace's (BAe) chances of winning the second phase of the Pounds 2.5bn Al
Yamamah defence contract continued to depress the shares yesterday.
The company's insistence that these negotiations are at an advanced stage,
was counterbalanced by news yesterday that US sales of the Range Rover,
manufactured by Rover, BAe's UK car manufacturing subsidiary, fell by nearly
28 per cent last year. This blow follows a bearish note last week from
Nomura, the Japanese securities house, which reportedly referred to
disparaging remarks about Rover by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of
Britain's defence procurement. After an initial fall to 282p, the shares
rallied to close 3 down at 288p.
BT 'new' edged higher to 125 1/4 p on heavy turnover of 20m shares; today is
the last session in which SG Warburg Securities, global co-ordinator of the
government's sale, is allowed to 'stabilise' the share price.
Bank shares were among the weakest of the Footsie constituents, upset by
continuing worries about the level of provisions against bad debts to be
included in their preliminary figures, expected next month. Adding to the
gloom in the sector was a story that a leading UK agency broker had
downgraded the whole of the sector.
One stock to stand out against the trend was Standard Chartered, where a
flurry of buying, part speculative and part recovery, left the shares 11
higher at 433p on relatively heavy turnover of 1.9m.
The downgrade stories weighed heavily on NatWest, which dropped 15 to 270p
in exceptionally heavy trading of 6.1m, and Barclays, down 9 at 364p on 4m.
More downgrades and sell recommendations on NatWest are said to be in the
pipeline.
Composite insurers were well supported, with buying interest prompted by a
positive note from Kleinwort Benson Securities. Kleinwort said it believed:
'The worst is now behind the sector, which may now be at the bottom of the
trading range; sustained outperformance is expected later in the year.' Its
best buy in the sector is Guardian Royal Exchange, up 3 at 121p on very
heavy turnover of 5.1m.
Health and household sector shares reversed early gains as investors took
profits after the recent rallies. Sellers were also motivated by weekend
press reports that leading drugs companies were likely to face pressure to
cut their prices.
Wellcome was finally down 29 at 1062p, after touching 1119p, as investors
reconsidered reports on tests for a new combination Aids treatment using two
Wellcome drugs. The shares had risen sharply on the reports last week. Glaxo
lost 8 on the day at 845p after being up 15 initially.
SmithKline Beecham held steady for most of the session, receiving some
support from news that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved a
minor drug. However, the shares slipped later to close 3 off at 900p.
ICI managed to remain firm at 1194p following recent comment about the
company's anti-cancer drug.
Ratners shares, under relentless downward pressure since October last year,
dropped to a record low of 18p before stabilising and ending a difficult
session only marginally easier at 21 1/2 p. Turnover reached 4m.
The latest slide was triggered by a number of bearish stories in the weekend
press suggesting that the company had endured a decline in sales over the
Christmas period. But the stock picked up after hints in the market that
some big management changes may be in the pipeline, along with a debt
restructuring programme.
Other retailing shares also took a pasting. Argos, the specialist
catalogue-showroom retailer, dropped 15 to 256p and Kingfisher, weakened by
a bearish review of the DIY companies published by the influential County
NatWest retailing team, fell 18 to 446p.
Details of J. Sainsbury's price-cutting promotion were received calmly by
the market and food retailing shares perked up as dealers took the view that
the move was nothing out of the ordinary. Sainsbury managed a minor gain at
360p, Asda hardened to 33p and Tesco eased a fraction to 224p. Argyll edged
up 3 to 277p.
A Kleinwort Benson note highlighting the 'generous' yields on food shares
boosted Unigate, 6 higher at 278p.
Strong brewery shares reflected the continuing pressure imposed by one big
buyer in a tight sector last week. Bass, up 12 to 1019p, was helped by a buy
note from Panmure Gordon; Whitbread continued to recover and gained 13 to
463p; and Grand Metropolitan and Guinness improved 13 to 911p and 11 to 553p
respectively as investors sought out quality stocks.
Ladbroke attempted to instill some new year cheer into its recent poor form
with the announcement that its Texas DIY chain had increased sales over the
Christmas period by 15 per cent. The shares put on 3 to 223p, but analysts
were less enthusiatic.
Paul Heath at UBS commented: 'Despite the fact that they took 25 per cent
off everything at Texas anyway, I am more worried that recent dollar
movements are going against Ladbroke.'
Profit-taking took the wind out of Airtours' sails in spite of the group
announcing a deal with the leading holiday tour operators to sell Airtours
packages. The announcement, made towards the end of trading, could not halt
a slide in the shares of 21 to 874p.
Buying in a tight market ensured strength in Reuters Holdings, which ended
11 up at 1055p after being 25 ahead at one stage, with volume reaching about
1m shares. Observers said general optimism was being driven by hopes of a
forthcoming share split.
Conglomerate BTR suffered initially from speculation - soon rejected -
regarding the wellbeing of its chief executive. The shares fell 7 against
the market on talk that Mr Alan Jackson would be retiring through ill
health.
However, securities houses telephoned the company and satisfied themselves
that the talk was, in the words of one analyst: 'A classic market rumour
that swept around and went as quickly as it came.' The stock rallied to
close a penny firmer on balance at 397p with 3.2m shares traded.
On hearing the stories, the company said: 'Mr Jackson is hale and hearty and
not going to stand down.'
Several engineering groups benefited from weekend press tips. Fairey Group
moved ahead 11 to 317p.
Dealers reported more heavy switching out of the electricity distribution
stocks and into the power generators.

AFTER delivering gains for 11 consecutive days, and setting six new record
highs in the process, the upsurge in US stock markets finally ran out of
steam yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.35 at 3,200.13, and
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.38 easier at 417.96. The
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, powered to yet another
all-time high, adding 5.25 at 597.90. Turnover on the vy 251m shares.
The market opened hesitantly as Mr David Dinkins, the Mayor of New York,
rang the opening bell to celebrate the start of the NYSE's bicentenary year,
and amid strong two-way trading, share prices struggled to add to last
week's gains. In spite of selling, the underlying tone of the market was
still positive, aided by another decline in long-term interest rates on the
US Treasury markets.
Westinghouse stood out, advancing Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 in
turnover of 3.9m shares on the heels of an upgrade from London based
stockbroker County NatWest, which raised its rating from 'underperform' to
'accumulate'.
Teledyne jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 24 1/2 after the electronics and
aviation equipment group reported fourth-quarter profits of 50 cents a
share, against just 1 cent a share a year ago.
Waste Management declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 in active trading,
unsettled by a court ruling in California which blocked the company's
planned construction of a toxic waste incinerator. Industry experts predict
that the success of the lawsuit brought by local residents could pose
problems for Waste Management in similar cases in the future.
On the over-the-counter market, Borland International dropped Dollars 3 1/4
to Dollars 80 amid growing concern that there may be delays in the release
of new personal computer software products. This concern was behind Morgan
Stanley's decision to lower its first-quarter Borland profits forecast from
75 cents a share to 50 cents.
Going the other way was MCI Communications, which climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 33 7/8 in turnover of 4.7m after Merrill Lynch upgraded its
medium-term rating on the stock.
Canada
THE TORONTO composite index closed a modest 7.3 up at 3,524.8 as gains in
transportation and communication stocks were largely offset by losses in the
metals sector.
Advancing issues led declines by 335 to 247 after a light volume of 22m
shares. Eleven of 14 sub-group indices were in positive territory. The
transportation group strengthened 3.1 per cent, boosted by Laidlaw 'B',
which gained CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 10 7/8 . The communications and media
group was up 2.0 per cent and merchandising gained 1.1 per cent. Mining lost
1.3 per cent and golds shed 1.8 per cent.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market interest rates edged slightly higher in London yesterday, with
only a small liquidity shortage emerging on the first active trading day
since the year-end holiday period.
The Bank of England made an early forecast of a Pounds 750m liquidity
shortage, later revised to Pounds 800m. Early assistance consisted of the
purchase of Pounds 57m band 4 bills at 10 1/8 per cent, with a further
Pounds 33m purchased at the same rate later in the morning session. During
the afternoon the bank injected a further Pounds 217m, mainly through the
purchase of band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds
155m, leaving a shortage of around Pounds 440m.
Although the shortage was not relieved during the day, breaking the recent
pattern, overnight money rates were little changed on the levels seen last
week.
By the close, unsecured overnight money was quoted at 10 3/4 -11 per cent,
although traders reported some business being done at a higher 11 1/2 -11
per cent rate. Three months inter-bank money was quoted at 10 13/16 -10 per
cent, up just  1/16 of a point on the day.
The March short sterling futures contract on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange closed little changed at 89.32, implying base
interest rates of 10.68 per cent by the spring from the current level of
10.5 per cent.
However, market rates could come under more pressure later this week when
more substantial liquidity shortages, running into billions of pounds, are
likely.
In Tokyo, overnight call money fell sharply from the last close before the
national holiday that began on Decem-ber 31. Call money was trading at 5
9/32 per cent, down from the year-end 5 9/16 per cent. The Bank of Japan cut
its overnight discount rate by  1/2 point to 4 1/2 per cent a week ago.
The authorities are seen as keen to prevent money market interest rates
falling further, however. Today the market is anticipating a Y200bn
liquidity shortage, with speculation that the Bank of Japan may not act to
relieve the pressure in an effort to keep short rates firm.
In Frankfurt, call money was little changed at around 9.45-9.55 per cent,
comfortably below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, the Bundesbank's emergency
funding rate for financial institutions.
In the US, the Federal Reserve added Dollars 2.5bn liquidity via customer
repurchase agreements.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell back substantially on the foreign exchange markets
yesterday, as dealers focused on the weakness of the US economy ahead of
important economic statistics due for release later this week.
The US currency opened in Tokyo at DM1.5315, already down from Friday's
close in New York of DM1.5425. However, the main weakness came during
European trading with switching out of the dollar into European currencies,
primarily the D-Mark.
The dollar hit a low of DM1.5180 during the afternoon in London before
finding support to end at DM1.5190 (the close in London on Friday was
DM1.5465). It finished lower in New York at DM1.5160.
Dealers said sentiment surrounding the US currency was negative ahead of
non-farm payroll data for December due to be released on Friday. In the
recent past, poor employment statistics have been the spur to monetary
easing by the US authorities.
Data for November showed a 217,000 fall in employment; market forecasts
centre on a smaller decline of between 50,000 and 100,000 this time.
However, the dollar was little changed against the yen, underlining that the
flow of money out of the dollar was primarily in favour of European
currencies. The dollar closed in London at Y124.05 (against Y124.85 on
Friday). It slipped in New York to Y123.35.
US President George Bush is due to visit Japan this week for talks which
will include the trading relationship between the two countries. The visit
has fuelled speculation that the US authorities are content to see a further
depreciation of the dollar against the yen as a means of capping the US
trade deficit with Japan.
The weakness of the dollar posed problems for sterling yesterday within the
European exchange rate mechanism. The pound lost  1/2 pfennig against the
D-Mark, closing at DM2.85.
Dealers commented that there was no sign of intervention by central banks
yesterday to support the UK currency. However, if the dollar comes under
further pressure against the D-Mark this week, the Bank of England may be
forced to support sterling.
While most currency markets were open for business yesterday for the first
time since Christmas, analysts noted that trading volumes were still low.
The real position of the dollar against the D-Mark, and therefore the
position of sterling within the ERM, may not be clear until the end of this
week.
Currency economists at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew are forecasting a sterling rate
of DM2.8450 by the end of the week.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar strengthened following the launch of CDollars
850m bonds in the international bond market. The Canadian currency rose from
CDollars 1.1470 to CDollars 1.1425 against the US dollar during the day,
prompting intervention from the Bank of Canada to stem the rise. The
Canadian authorities sold Canadian dollars at around the CDollars 1.1430
level.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Major urges UK farmers to get
closer to markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OXFORD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK FARMERS, hard pressed by falling incomes, should get closer to the
markets they are aiming for and concentrate on adding value, the prime
minister said last night.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of the current Gatt talks and
Common Agricultural Policy reform plans, Mr Major said, but it was clear
that farmers faced more competition and lower price support.
The prospects were uncertain to bleak for farming, 'even though the rest of
the economy is beginning to emerge from recession', he said. But it was not
possible to continue present production patterns and price support.
'The key to surviving in this new environment will be the ability to respond
rapidly to consumer demands,' he told the annual dinner of the Oxford
Farming Conference. It was not just a matter of efficiency - UK farmers were
among the most efficient in Europe. Quality was needed, and some farmers
would have to change their production and selling methods.
The government believed the answer must lie in better collaboration between
farmers, said Mr Major, although that does not necessarily mean
co-operatives. He referred to a recent Downing Street seminar involving food
producers and retailers. The retailers promised to target opportunities for
increasing their supply of UK food and food products; to offer a more
open-door policy to producers; to second managers to help producers meet
market requirements; and to declare the country of origin on own label
products.
'The opportunity is there for more British producers to supply our
supermarkets. They must grab this opportunity with both hands,' he said. The
size of the UK food trade gap was itself an indication of the size of the
market farmers had to tap. 'If British farmers can meet the high standards
demanded by their customers in the food manufacturing and retail sectors,
they will greatly benefit, not simply through recapturing their own domestic
market, but in penetrating markets elsewhere in the community.'
Mr Major told the 400 delegates that CAP spending would be right up against
its limits this year. He criticised the CAP for not operating in the
interests of producers, consumers or taxpayers. 'And it also led to the
absurd prejudice that farmers are living in the lap of subsidy when in
reality your income is falling.'
Mr David Clark, the shadow agriculture minister, said last night that Mr
Major had failed to give a lead to the farming industry and his suggestion
that the planning regime in the countryside could be weakened was
'particularly worrying'.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally on talk of curbing
long-end issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TREASURY prices rose at the long end yesterday amid renewed speculation that
the US government may curtail issues of new long-dated securities to save on
borrowing costs.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/2 at 106 21/32 ,
yielding 7.435 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16 at 100
15/32 , yielding 4.732 per cent.
Prices rose primarily in response to a press report that officials in
Washington have become increasingly serious about reducing the amount of
30-year bonds it issues. Although there was nothing new in the story,
suggestions that supply at the long end could shrink boosted an already firm
market, and provoked some short-covering by dealers.
The return of Japanese buyers to the market after the Christmas and New Year
holiday break also contributed to the positive tone.
GERMAN government bonds gained a quarter-point helped by fresh buying
interest and some switching out of long-dated bunds into shorter-dated
securities.
The Liffe bund futures contract jumped from its opening of 87.68 to a high
of 87.88 before closing at 87.81. Volume in the Liffe futures contract was
normal at 41,500 contracts.
Traders said the longer end of the maturity range was suffering from worries
over the outcome of the 1992 wage round and the prospect of higher
inflation.
The bund market is awaiting a batch of economic data this week including
unemployment figures for December and industrial production and retail sales
figures for November. Traders said the market will be looking for
confirmation of a slowdown in the German economy.
Elsewhere in Europe, Dutch government bond prices ended sharply higher,
helped by strong demand for the 15-year issue from both domestic and foreign
buyers.
UK government bonds drifted up in dull trading yesterday as traders reported
only sparse interest from foreign and domestic buyers, many of whom are only
just returning from the holiday break. The gilt market is waiting for fund
managers to start reallocating their portfolios for the new year.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose by less than a
half-point to 115 1/8 to yield 9.51 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rise in yesterday's half-day session,
helped by the strength of the yen and last week's unexpected half-point cut
in the official discount rate to 4.5 per cent. However, modest profit-taking
limited the gains in both the cash and futures markets.
Traders said the bond market remained bullish, helped by the yen's strength
against the dollar and lower short-term interest rates.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.35 per cent and moved to
5.32 per cent before closing at 5.34 per cent. The unsecured overnight call
money rate traded at around 5 5/16 per cent, sharply down from its level of
5 9/16 per cent at the previous close on December 31. Three-month
certificates of deposit traded at around 5.4 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction Y800bn to Y900bn of January
10-year bonds later this week. The coupon on the new issue is expected to be
around 5.5 per cent to 5.6 per cent. The coupon on the December issue of
10-year government bonds was 6 per cent, but yen bond yields have dropped
since then.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Revco hearing set to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BANKRUPTCY court hearing to consider the stalemate situation at Revco, the
Ohio-based drugstore chain, is to begin tomorrow.
Over the weekend, none of the three rival reorganisation plans put forward
for the bankrupt retailer won outright backing from creditors. The
Revco-backed creditor plan had majority support from four of the seven
groups of creditors - the bank and trade creditor classes, and two classes
of bondholders.
A proposal from Rite-Aid, which essentially involved the competing drug
retailer in acquiring Revco, won support from two classes of creditors. A
third plan from Jack Eckerd, another drugstore chain, had support from one
class.
Revco appeared hopeful that the weight of support in favour of the creditor
plan would encourage the bankruptcy court judge to force this plan on other
dissenting groups. However, there was no sign that Rite-Aid would back out
of the contest and Revco conceded that it expected some objections to be
voiced at the court hearing.
Revco was taken private via a Dollars 1.25bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, but
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code in mid-1988.
It runs around 1,140 drug stores.

DU PONT, the US chemicals group, expects to take a Dollars 3bn to Dollars

to comply with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health
benefits of employees.
All US companies have to adopt the new standard by 1993. Many big
corporations have announced similarly large non-cash charges against
earnings. The standard allows the charge to be taken in one blow, as Du Pont
proposes, or amortised over 20 years.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Boom] Crash] Popcorn whizz bangs pan - Ken
Lewis, Nicholas Saphir and Butterkist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS Saphir has lost his taste for popcorn. That innocuous confection
brings back bad memories to the chairman of Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce
and herbs and spices group.
Just two weeks ago, Hunter Saphir sold Butterkist, the toffee popcorn
manufacturer, for Pounds 2.9m to privately-held Portfolio Foods. The sale
was completed only four years after Hunter bought Butterkist for Pounds 19m
in cash and shares - although the actual cost to the company was closer to
Pounds 12m, according to Mr Saphir.
The sale to Portfolio - and the resultant loss of more than 100 jobs - has
aroused the anger of shareholder and former Butterkist owner, Mr Ken Lewis.
Mr Lewis, who became a multi-millionaire as a result of the sale to Hunter
at a price which he himself agrees was too high, claims the business is
worth up to Pounds 5m.
Mr Saphir, for his part, maintains that the company got the best price in
the shortest amount of time possible for a loss-making business. 'The offer
was very quickly on the table,' he says. Yet it is believed that Portfolio
was offered an exclusive opportunity to bid for Butterkist.
The only sure thing appears to be Portfolio's acquisition of more than 80
per cent of the butter toffee popcorn market. The Office of Fair Trading
said yesterday it was reviewing the deal, although there was some confusion
as to how candycorn should be classified - as popcorn or as confectionery.
Butterkist's history and the passions which surround it are as volatile as
the popcorn itself. Under Mr Lewis' stewardship Butterkist more than trebled
its profits in two years. Within a similar period, he says, Hunter let the
business run down. When Hunter sold Butterkist, the business was losing up
to Pounds 50,000 a month.
But Hunter says its biggest mistake was to agree an unfavourable earn-out on
the purchase and a deal whereby Mr Lewis had complete control of marketing
and distribution.
Mr Lewis took over Butterkist through a Pounds 3m management buy-out in
1986. Then, as in recent years, the popcorn industry was in the throes of a
fierce price war. When he sold the business in 1987 to Hunter Saphir,
Butterkist was making annual profits of Pounds 595,000.
The deal agreed by Hunter included a Pounds 6.3m acquisition price, backed
up by a two-year earn-out - 4.5 times any profit above Pounds 595,000.
Within a year, Butterkist was making profits of Pounds 1.5m. The following
year, it reported more than Pounds 2m.
'We were pleasantly surprised and a little concerned,' says Mr Saphir. 'We
didn't expect profits to climb as fast as they did.'
How Mr Lewis achieved these profits is up for debate, but it would appear
that Butterkist moved into supermarkets, which gave the operation a
significant boost, and production was operating round-the-clock. Also,
margins - at between 60 and 70 per cent gross, according to a rival popcorn
manufacturer - were much higher than was common in the Pounds 25m-per-year
candycorn market.
Mr Lewis was also well-known in the industry. The former managing director
of Butterkist began at the popcorn factory more than 25 years ago as a truck
driver. A leading manufacturer says he was a popular figure who inspired
considerable customer loyalty.
Loyalty will only go so far, however, and is significantly curtailed when it
dents the purse. Butterkist's high margin was a golden opportunity for Bard
Brothers, a subsidiary of Portfolio Foods, to take business. By 1990, the
rival popcorn manufacturer had moved aggressively into the market, slashing
prices and sparking a war in which Butterkist was seriously wounded.
After Mr Lewis left, Hunter backed the brand through television advertising,
introducing novelty products such as Teenage Mutant Ninja popcorn, and
increasing capacity for the expected market growth. Margins were also
gradually reduced, although they were still higher on average.
Something went seriously wrong, however: the expected growth never appeared.
The extra capacity lay dormant and Butterkist began to go stale. Bard had
snapped up 40 per cent of the market by last year and claims it was on
target for more than 50 per cent, before buying Butterkist.
By the middle of 1991 Hunter was carrying a business laden with
over-capacity and plunging margins. To make matters worse, the rest of the
group was under pressure. A takeover approach - believed to be from Dalgety
 -collapsed, and the group had just completed an expensive refinancing.
So, without the management resources or will to tackle Butterkist's
problems, the business was sold. Mr Saphir says the experience has taught
him some tough lessons: 'It was a painful saga.'
Painful not only for Hunter, but also its shareholders. These include Mr
Lewis who has seen part of his profit on the original sale - 400,000 Hunter
shares - fall in value from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 204,000.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Europe tops company shopping lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US ceded its position as the most favoured market for acquisitions by UK
companies to continental Europe last year, according to a survey of UK
companies' acquisitions and divestments in the US conducted by JP Mervis,
the corporate finance advisers, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
UK companies spent Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.59bn) to buy 113 companies in the
US in 1991, compared with a total of Dollars 3.5bn spent on 150 acquisitions
in Europe. Almost as much - Dollars 2.7bn - was realised from US sales.
The value of British acquisitions in the US last year was 74 per cent down
on the near-Dollars 11bn spent in 1990 and 91 per cent lower than the 1988
peak of Dollars 33.5bn spent on 425 US companies.
Most sectors experienced a waning of interest. A notable exception was the
medical industry where the value of acquisitions increased from Dollars 25m
to Dollars 238m and the number of companies bought remained at five.
The food, beverages and agriculture sector was another exception, with the
value of acquisitions more than doubled to Dollars 233.2m (Dollars 101.5m)
despite a drop in the number of companies acquired from seven in 1990 to
three.
The natural resources exploration and services sector fell from the top
position in 1990 with Dollars 2.52bn to Dollars 99m. The consumer products
and services sector came top this year with Dollars 638m of acquisitions.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Eurotunnel hopes to settle costs dispute with TML
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL hopes to present its board with a settlement of its costs dispute
with Transmanche Link, the consortium building the Channel tunnel, in
February.
Optimism about the prospects for a deal sent Eurotunnel shares higher in
Paris and London, where Eurotunnel's units finished up 22p at 420p.
A deal to settle the dispute, mainly about the costs of completing the
so-called lump-sum works at the tunnel's terminals, could be presented to
the Eurotunnel board in the second week of February.
A senior executive close to the talks said: 'It is premature to say a deal
is close. Nothing has happened over Christmas but the talks were going well
and they have resumed in that spirit.'
The Eurotunnel board is likely to be told this week a settlement will
involve a trade-off between the amount Eurotunnel pays for the tunnel to be
completed and the pace of the work.
Originally the tunnel was to open for full services on June 15 next year.
However, it seems likely this could be delayed until September because of
delays in delivering railway rolling stock.
TML, which brings together the 10 main contractors on the project, has told
Eurotunnel it will co-operate with a revised and accelerated commissioning
process as long as Eurotunnel responds positively to its claims to cover the
extra costs of completing the work.
If Eurotunnel does not meet TML's claims it risks losing the builders'
co-operation during the key commissioning process. This could delay the
tunnel's opening.
TML is claiming about Pounds 1.27bn to cover the lump-sum works at 1985
prices, which Eurotunnel initially costed at about Pounds 625m. Eurotunnel
has set aside an additional Pounds 450m which could be used to cover TML's
claims.
Some of the Pounds 200m gap between the two sides is likely to be bridged by
an agreement to defer some claims until next year.
The negotiating teams have agreed a procedure for settling the designs for
the rest of the project to prevent changes generating further cost overruns.
The schedule for completing commissioning and testing of the tunnel's
operating systems has been disrupted by delays in the delivery of engines
and carriages for the shuttle services to be run by Eurotunnel and those
British Rail plans to run with its continental partners.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Sales fears depress Ratners shares: Jewellery retailer may
have to renegotiate its banking covenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL, ANDREW BOLGER and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives at Ratners Group accept they will almost certainly have to
renegotiate the jewellery retailer's banking covenants this week following
weak Christmas trading. However, analysts increasingly took the view
yesterday that fears of a financial meltdown at the group had been wildly
exaggerated.
After initially falling to 18p yesterday, the Ratners shares recovered to
close at 21 1/2 p, a net  1/2 p down on the day.
'We do not believe at this stage that there is a fundamental risk of the
company going under but the shares will continue to look vulnerable until we
know what, if any, restructuring is going to take place,' said Mr Quintin
Price, retail analyst at James Capel, the stockbrokers.
The Ratners board met all day yesterday to review the Christmas trading
performance and the company will issue a statement on its prospects on
Friday.
The company declined to comment before the announcement other than to dispel
suggestions that its 1,000 store managers were holding a crisis meeting.
Ratners has suffered from poor levels of demand this Christmas in the UK and
the US, where it runs the second-biggest jewellery chain. The company's
extensive discounting campaigns - in addition to its normal rash of
promotions - suggests it was trying to liquidate stocks and was running the
business for cash to prevent its borrowings running out of control.
Although this may have helped prevent a drastic fall in volume sales it will
have eroded margins. James Capel estimated a total pre-tax loss for the year
of Pounds 35m - although this includes Pounds 12m in exceptional costs
relating to an anticipated rationalisation programme.
Trade in the US was also badly hit by low consumer confidence and
difficulties at Zale, the biggest jewellery chain in the US. Officials at
Sterling, the Ratners US business, would not comment on Christmas sales but
the performance of other US retailers in December gives little cause for
hope. Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery retailer, saw its US retail
sales slide 3 per cent from a weak Christmas a year earlier.
The whole North American jewellery industry is in disarray as it waits for
Zale to implement a reorganisation or file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
'When the largest company in any industry is in Zale's position, it
adversely impacts the whole industry,' said Mr Dick Miller, chief financial
officer at Sterling. 'We don't relish that Zale is in trouble, but in the
longer term we should benefit from this.'
In spite of these worries, the principal bankers for Ratners, Barclays and
Midland, seem to be taking a fairly relaxed view of the situation and are
making no move ahead of the trading statement. One banker said: 'Ratners may
break a banking covenant. But that in itself is no reason to panic. What we
have to assess is how much cash the business is generating and is capable of
generating. Only then will we need to discuss whether its debt has to be
restructured. There has to be a serious possibility that Gerald Ratner will
give up either his role of chairman or chief executive.'
Analysts estimated the Ratners bank debts were about Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m
although much of this was spread among several US institutions. Mr John
Richards, retail analyst at County NatWest, brokers for Ratners, said: 'The
bankers will want to talk to the company but there is no immediate financial
crisis or a need for a restructuring. Ratners does not have to go to its
banks and say 'we need some more money'.'
The company will come under pressure, however, to provide further details of
its future strategy including any attempts to sell assets or close outlets.
The company may also be forced to tidy up its debt structure; it has five
different types of preference shares in issue.
'I think that there may well be some kind of boring financial restructuring:
maybe paying off the preference shareholders and converting their holdings
into ordinary shares,' said one analyst.
Jewellery manufacturers will also keenly await developments at Ratners,
which controls more than 30 per cent of jewellery sales in the UK. Shares in
Abbeycrest, one of its biggest suppliers, fell 14p to 78p.
According to Mr Patrick Fuller, chairman of the British Jewellers'
Association, the trade group, Mr Ratner is respected for what he has
achieved in the jewellery business, but not particularly liked.
The association's main criticism is that Ratners has been very aggressive in
its buying, using its dominant position to dictate onerous terms to
suppliers, many of which are relatively small companies.
Mr Fuller said Ratners did not place firm orders, but gave manufacturers
'estimated requirements' - allowing Ratners to return the goods if they did
not sell. Ratners refused to confirm it took goods on such a
'sale-or-return' basis, saying it did not discuss its commercial
relationship with suppliers.
In 1990, Ratners antagonised many suppliers by returning large amounts of
stock during October and November. Mr Fuller said manufacturers kept their
factories going all the year round, but made most of their profits in the
last quarter of the year, so it was infuriating for them to have goods
returned which they had supplied a few months earlier.
Mr Fuller said: 'He got away with it once, but a lot of the bigger companies
got together and said they were not prepared to deal with him again on that
basis, so he had to change.'
Excalibur, a quoted jewellery manufacturer, said it had been given a written
assurance before Christmas that Ratners would not return any stock. If such
assurances were widespread it helps explain the group's frantic
price-cutting over Christmas.

FT  07 JAN 92 / US call for halt to silicone breast implants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Food and Drug Administration called on doctors yesterday to stop
using silicone breast implants in patients, saying 'troubling questions'
remained about their safety, write Karen Zagor and Clive Cookson.
The FDA, which is seeking the move while new information on implants is
assessed, also asked manufacturers to stop distributing the products until
an advisory panel has met. Recommendations are expected within 45 days.
Saline-filled implants will not be affected by the moratorium.
According to the FDA, about 20 per cent of the 1m women in the US with
implants have them for breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. The
remaining 80 per cent have them for cosmetic reasons.
Silicone breast implants have been far less popular in the UK than in the
US. Only a few thousand British women have had implants.
The Department of Health said: 'We are waiting to see what the FDA does. We
are looking at their new data but are not making any recommendations for the
moment.'
The FDA's decision is the second blow in less than four weeks to Dow Corning
Wright, a subsidiary of Dow Corning and the leading US implant maker.
In mid-December, a federal court ordered Dow Corning to pay a woman Dollars
7.3m (Pounds 4m) in compensatory and punitive damages for hiding evidence
which linked ruptured silicone gel implants with auto-immune disorders.
Dow Corning has said it will appeal against the decision.
Other big implant makers include Bioplasty, Mentor and McGhan Medical. On
Wall Street, shares in Mentor tumbled Dollars 2 to Dollars 12 1/4 before
trading in the issue was halted at midday yesterday. Shares in Bioplasty
were also halted.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Business failures show 56% rise for 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 4,000 UK com-panies went into receivership last year, a rise of
more than 50 per cent on 1990 but still only a small proportion of the
companies in difficulty, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy
firm.
For every one company that went into receivership there were three or four
others which faced financial difficulties and had been put on their banks'
'special watch' or 'intensive care' list, said Mr Tim Hayward, head of
corporate recovery.
If there is no market for a business or its assets, receivership leading to
insolvency is a last resort which only leaves the bank with a bad debt. Well
over half the companies helped by their bank survive, Mr Hayward said.
In 1991 4,112 companies went into receivership, an increase of 56 per cent
on 1990, according to Peats. In 1989 the number of receiverships was 1,187.
Receiverships were spread fairly evenly last year with about 1,000 in each
quarter.
Peats expects at least as many receiverships this year as the international
business scene becomes increasingly bleak. The prospects of a 'double dip'
recession in the US and the sharp decline of the Japanese stock market make
the outlook for UK exporters more difficult.
Mr Hayward said he did not expect a marked recovery for at least another
year. Even when it came it would lead to 'second-round failures' as business
picked up and overwhelmed companies' financial resources.
Failures by retailers accounted for 7.5 per cent of the total and are
expected to increase after the new year sales end. But many businesses in
this sector are small and will therefore appear as liquidations or
bankruptcies and not as receiverships.
Construction companies accounted for 16 per cent of receiverships last year
and property companies for a further 6 per cent. As companies finish work on
projects begun before the recession receiverships will rise because there is
little prospect that they will be able to find new work.
Manufacturing companies made up 29 per cent of 1991 receiverships and Peats
foresees no improvement this year because of the poor outlook for exports.
Hotels and catering accounted for 5 per cent of receiverships. This sector
continues to suffer from a downturn in the corporate hospitality and
conference trades but this year should be better than last when the Gulf war
depressed demand still further.
By region the south-east recorded the largest number of receiverships with
2,171 (1,354 in 1990) followed by the Midlands with 621 (327), the
north-west with 390 (266) and the north-east with 346 (306).

The international acquisition business, it seems, reacts to recession in
curious ways. It is no surprise that activity overall should have been down
heavily last year. But it was also concentrated in countries which had yet
to go into recession, as opposed to those in it already. Thus, according to
Daiwa, foreign acquisitions by Japanese companies were down nearly 80 per
cent by value last year, with the sharpest falls in the US and UK. Purchases
of Japanese companies by foreigners, on the other hand, went up eightfold.
Similarly, the London research company J P Mervis calculates that UK
companies spent 73 per cent less on US acquisitions last year. But they
increased their spending in Continental Europe, the heaviest concentration
being in the late-cycle economies of Germany and Spain.
There is something slightly perverse about this. It may be that companies in
recession-struck economies are relatively expensive because investors are
discounting recovery, as they plainly are in the US. Just conceivably, the
reverse may be true in Germany or Japan. But commonsense suggests that
acquisitive companies would find better bargains in economies where business
confidence was at its lowest.
Or perhaps the reality is the other way around: that it is the acquiring
companies which lack confidence. The appeal of acquisition targets in
countries which have yet to enter recession may be precisely that they show
an unblemished profits record. If so, traditional bid activity within the
Anglophone economies may be slow to pick up this year. If even the strong
companies cannot judge their own future, they are less likely to take a bet
on that of their neighbours.

FT  07 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of last year's big takeover tussles - BTR/Hawker and Lasmo/Ultramar to
name but two - turned out much closer than the market originally assumed. So
despite the blandness of Steetley's document rejecting Redland's Pounds 600m
bid, there is reason to believe that the battle of the UK brickies can yet
provide an absorbing finish.
You would hardly think so from the movements of the two companies' shares.
So far, at least, no white knight is being signalled by the Steetley price,
which last night was still trading 7 per cent below Redland's paper offer
and bang in line with the mainly cash alternative. But these are early days.
Steetley can do better than highlight a financial record which transparently
leaves out its dismal performance last year. It can spell out in greater
detail the benefits of the proposed building materials joint venture with
Tarmac. Above all, it will be able to trumpet the results of its
much-heralded asset revaluation.
In the end, however, the fairness of the price comes down to a good deal
more than asset value. Steetley's strategy was arguably a good one for the
1980s, but the cost to shareholders now is all too visible in a stretched
balance sheet. Redland is financially much stronger but is vulnerable to
jibes about the volume of new paper it has issued in the last few years.
There is a clear choice in management style and an equally clear choice
between exposure to the UK through an independent Steetley or a more diverse
merged European portfolio. Redland's timing has been neat and its
intellectual case well made. But there is still a long way to go.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,493.2 (-10.9)
It is not hard to see why debate over the Labour party's income tax
proposals has degenerated into an unseemly slanging match about the level of
standard rate required to meet its manifesto plans. Labour can scarcely be
right to argue that it would not need any extra levy from individuals
earning less than Pounds 20,300. The Tories are wrong to assert that the
standard rate would rise by 10p in the pound. But Mr Lamont's problem lies
in trying to argue that Labour's overall proposals would have much economic
impact as they stand, even though they appear to be a sharp reversal of the
Thatcherite trend towards a lower, simpler tax structure.
Taking some Pounds 4bn from higher-rate taxpayers and redistributing it
through higher pensions and child benefit ought, in theory, to be mildly
stimulative because the recipients are more likely to be spenders than
savers. But the amount is tiny against total personal disposable income.
There is also a risk that the economic benefit would be offset by a further
loss of confidence among affluent but debt-ridden consumers which would act
as a drag on recovery. Uncertainty over the future tax regime is inhibiting
the housing market, though this might dissipate after the election if only a
small minority of taxpayers actually found their bills increasing.
In isolation, Labour's income tax proposals have limited implications for
the financial markets. As they are skewed towards consumption rather than
saving, they might in theory reduce the funds available for investment,
though here again the amount of money involved is small. Within the equity
market, there might be some sector effects, with food retailers, for
example, benefiting at the expense of stores selling big ticket consumer
goods.
There are, of course, plenty of other market factors which would apply in
the event of a Labour victory. The foreign exchanges would probably test Mr
Kinnock's commitment to the European system, forcing interest rates up
sharply, at least to begin with. Labour would have to reconcile its policy
ambitions to its capacity to borrow and its commitment to an unchanged tax
burden for the vast majority. Where that line is finally drawn is far more
important to the markets than a shift in the distribution of the income tax
burden.
Higher top rates have the reputation in Tory mythology of reducing
incentives and constricting activity at the micro-level. The academic case
for this is unproven, though Labour is pushing its luck with its plan to
generate additional social security funds by reintroducing a surcharge on
investment incomes over Pounds 3,000. Not only would this push up its own
cost of borrowing, it would also distort investment decisions by putting
undue emphasis on tax efficiency. The biggest beneficiary would be the
financial services industry,which must already be totting up the fees to be
earned from helping clients avoid the charge.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Shevardnadze offers to help Georgia: Siege ends after
desertion of troops prompts Gamsakhurdia to flee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, yesterday
offered to return to his native Georgia to help establish democracy after
the overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
Mr Shevardnadze, who was Communist party leader in Georgia from 1972 to
mid-1985, called for national reconciliation and said: 'I am personally
ready to take part in this complex process.'
His offer came as citizens emerged to pick their way through the rubble in
the main avenue of the capital Tbilisi, devastated by fighting in the
two-week siege of parliament.
Mr Shevardnadze, 64 later this month, once embodied Communist dictatorship
over Georgia and it is not known how its people would react to his return.
But one rebel leader yesterday described him as an able figure who could
help build democracy.
The siege of the Georgian parliament ended in the early hours of yesterday
morning when Mr Gamsakhurdia fled in the face of further barrages from
opposition troops who then overran the building, parts of which were ablaze.
The catalyst for Mr Gamsakhurdia's decision to flee seems to have been the
desertion on Sunday night of 60 highly-trained security troops - one of his
few military advantages over the opposition. By midnight, Mr Gamsakhurdia is
said to have told his supporters that the battle for the government building
had been lost.
There were conflicting reports on the whereabouts of the president, who had
been under siege in the parliament building in central Tbilisi. Officials in
Azerbaijan said he was heading for Armenia, but Armenian officials denied
they had offered him asylum and said he was thought to be making for
Gyandzha in Azerbaijan.
'Wherever he is we will find and arrest him and bring him back to stand
trial in Georgia,' said Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the leaders of the
military council that now controls the republic. The jubilant opposition
claimed a victory for its strategy of holding back from launching an all-out
attack, instead putting the president under constant military and
psychological pressure.
Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, the joint leader of the military council, said: 'We
were prepared for this a long time ago. We said earlier that we were sure Mr
Gamsakhurdia would leave without bloodshed. Our psychological warfare has
worked.'
Mr Iosseliani said the military council was likely to remain in control of
Georgia until the situation stabilised. The opposition leader warned of
possible 'excesses' by remaining forces of Mr Gamsakhurdia and said the
network of regional prefects who had bolstered his dictatorship was still in
place.
In the longer term, the military council intends to hold new parliamentary
elections, possibly in April, and said it was organising a political forum
of all parties to prepare for these elections. The position of president
will cease to exist.
When Mr Gamsakhurdia fled the parliament more than 200 supporters went with
him in a convoy of two armoured personnel carriers, three buses and other
vehicles.
The convoy left through the unguarded streets to the south of the building
and apparently met no resistance until it clashed with an opposition
detachment at a nearby bridge over the River Kura.
Opposition leaders said about 10 government soldiers and five opposition
soldiers had died in the shooting.

FT  07 JAN 92 / US group may enter UK telecoms market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRINT, the big US telecommunications carrier, has applied for a licence to
compete with BT and Mercury Communications in the UK. It is the first
significant challenge to the duopoly held by the two companies since the
government last year abolished their exclusive rights to provide basic
telecommunication services.
Sprint, the third-largest long-distance telecommunications carrier in the
US, wants to provide domestic and international telecommunications services
in the UK. It plans to lay a fibre optic network around the UK, largely
alongside the canal system, at a cost of Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m.
The application to provide domestic services is expected to be approved by
the Department of Trade and Industry. But Sprint's application to provide
international services will test the openness of the UK telecommunications
market.
In its white paper last year, the government said that the duopoly on
international services should be ended but that it was unlikely to grant new
international licences in the short term. It argued that this was because UK
companies found it difficult to operate in foreign markets.
Sprint said yesterday a relaxation of US regulatory policy last month meant
this should no longer be a consideration as far as US companies were
concerned. If Sprint is granted an international licence, other US and UK
groups are likely to follow suit because international services are the most
profitable part of the telecommunications market. About 20
telecommunications licence applications, most to run niche services, have so
far been filed with the DTI.
Officials are understood to be particularly interested in an application by
Millicom, a US-based group, to provide voice and videophone services using
radio links.
British Rail and the regional electricity companies, which expressed
enthusiasm about entering telecommunications last year, have yet to make
formal applications.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Head of steam for German rail reform: State support is set
to rise unless the system is given a thorough overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the stuff of politicians' nightmares. At a time when German public
finances are already stretched to the limit to pay for unification, a
government commission has concluded that unless the country's railways are
restructured, the total burden of state support until the end of the decade
will exceed DM400bn (Pounds 139.30bn).
The message was stark, but music to the ears of Mr Heinz Durr, who became
head of the west German rail system (Bundesbahn) a year ago. He has argued
forcefully that the unwieldy and expensive public authority needs to be
transformed into a modern, flexible corporation that could make money rather
than lose it.
Mr Durr wants the government to write off Germany's entire DM45bn rail debt
within three years and give the system a fresh financial start. This year,
the railways are expected to record a combined loss of some DM11bn, much of
it in interest payments; the Bundesbahn's share of the loss will be more
than DM7bn. Today, the Bundesbahn owes twice its DM20bn turnover. By 2000,
if the commission's proposals are not acted on, total east and west German
rail debt could be DM220bn. Together with accumulated losses, the state
could be left with a DM400bn price tag.
If, on the other hand, the railways are prodded into greater efficiency,
that DM400bn could be cut by up to DM80bn, the Bundesbahn estimates. The
commission mentions potential savings of well over DM100bn.
The government is determined to save what it can from the public purse by a
radical overhaul of the rail network. While the Bundesbahn is efficient,
punctual and comfortable compared with services in other European countries,
it is hobbled by a high degree of political involvement at national and
regional level. For instance, it needs transport and finance ministry
approval for all investments over DM5m and is subject to intense pressure
from local politicians to operate uneconomic lines. This has created a
management with little commercial freedom or entrepreneurial drive.
'We've got to free the management of the railways from these political
burdens,' says Mr Peter Reinhardt, head of the rail department at the
transport ministry. 'The financial development of both east and west
railways is frightening. We have to find a breakthrough.'
Government frustration at years of resistance to reform by the railways has
finally led to a groundbreaking series of proposals. The central plank of
the restructuring involves the setting up of a shareholding company,
Deutsche Eisenbahn (German Railways) AG, which could operate without
political oversight as an independent concern. Initially, the AG would
comprise the Bundesbahn alone, but Mr Durr, who took over as head of the
Reichsbahn last September, wants to bring in the creaking,
investment-starved east German system after it has been modernised and
slimmed down.
As an AG the railways' accounts would be much more transparent - loss-making
routes kept open for social purposes in outlaying areas could not be
financially camouflaged - and the government would be able to decide whether
to continue making payments for such individual routes. At the moment,
payments for 'social' routes are subsumed in general subsidies to the
network and the commercial viability of the routes is unclear.
Under the commission's proposals the government would still own the rail
system, but a revamped management board would be responsible for day-to-day
operations. Unlike at present, there would not be an advisory board -
consisting mainly of local and regional political appointees - which
influences policy. The removal of this bureaucratic management tier would
make the system more efficient, it is hoped, and thus more attractive to
private investors. They could, for instance, operate their own freight
services on state-owned track, or help to finance capital spending.
The need for wholesale corporate restructuring has not arisen solely because
of German unity. The Bundesbahn's mounting deficit, its loss of freight
business to the roads, and the resulting congestion on the motorways have
long worried the government. But unification has brought a new urgency,
mainly because of the extra financial challenge - it will cost DM50bn to
bring the Reichsbahn up to Bundesbahn standards.
Because the railways commission's 60-page report offers a solution to this
financial headache, the government's initial reception has been favourable.
But setting up an AG would need a change in the country's constitution, so
the matter looks set to become a many's opposition Social Democrats, some of
whom could see the changes as anticipating privatisation, would have to
accept the proposals for there to be the requisite two-thirds majority in
parliament. So far, they have not made their final judgment.
As the political manoeuvring gets under way, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made
clear he wants the railways made more efficient. 'The government wants rail
to play a bigger role in transport policy,' says Mr Durr, previously chief
executive of AEG, the electrical subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. 'It's also what
the citizens of this country want. The trouble is that most people go by
car.'
The roads also have the lion's share of freight business, about 50 per cent
in west Germany. Over the past 30 years, rail's share of freight business
has fallen from 44 per cent to 25 per cent. The task now is to reverse this
trend or at least to keep it steady. Mr Gunter Krause, the transport
minister, has said rail should aim to win up to 30 per cent of all freight
traffic by the end of the decade.
As a leading government supporter of the planned reforms, he hopes, along
with Mr Durr, that the political hurdles can be cleared soon. But Mr Durr
wants to go further than setting up an AG, and to introduce sweeping labour
market changes. This might bring him into conflict with the Social Democrats
and the unions, which want to protect the jobs and benefits of railway
employees. Mr Durr is keen to introduce a more flexible staff policy into
the Bundesbahn by doing away with the special status of many employees. As
Beamte (public servants), they have jobs for life and special pension
benefits, but are forbidden to strike.
What frustrates Mr Durr is that their status inhibits many of his proposals
 -for example, staff tend to be promoted more on the basis of seniority
rather than on ability. There are 140,000 Beamte among the 230,000
Bundesbahn employees, including train drivers, guards, and ticket-sellers.
Their promotion routes and pay scales have to accord with nationally agreed
conditions throughout the German public sector, making it hard to attract
managers from private industry. Mr Durr does not want the Reichsbahn's
200,000 employees, now being reduced by about 10,000 a year, to become
Beamte.
The fact that the east German system has nearly the same number of employees
as west Germany's, which has almost twice as much track, shows the magnitude
of the task of integration and matching productivity levels. In 1989, the
last year of the old East German government, only 300m East Marks were
invested in the Reichsbahn, nowhere near enough to maintain it. This year,
the figure will be at least DM5bn.
New east-west links are being built and existing ones modernised. 'Some
stretches are practically all building sites,' Mr Durr says. Re-equipping
the Reichsbahn is only part of the picture, though. Finding the right
managers is just as important, and by no means easy. All the top managers of
the Reichsbahn have been changed and the boards of east and west German
railways now meet together. There are joint planning and investment policies
and a growing exchange of personnel. For Mr Durr, transforming Germany's
railways is the challenge of the century - 'though I hope it doesn't take a
century to achieve'. But it will take more than money to fulfil the vision
of a united German rail concern which operates with a minimum of
bureaucratic fat and a maximum of entrepreneurial drive. It will also take a
strong political will.

Miffed at being refused entry to a trendy nightspot for having no tie, a

Today's edition of Holiday Which?, the UK Consumers' Association guide to
the best and worst of tourist deals, features nine of what it calls 'the
worst resorts in the world', including Pattaya in Thailand - 'runs Bangkok a
close second as the world capital of sleaze'; Gzira in Malta - 'rubbish
everywhere'; Kanoni in Corfu - 'located at the end of the runway of Corfu
Town's airport'; and Sunny Beach, Bulgaria - 'marauding gangs of thugs. . .
an influx of pimps, prostitutes, drug-dealers and black marketeers'.
After slagging off eight of the nightmare spots, Holiday Which? attempts to
redress the balance by offering a much better local alternative. But
interestingly enough the magazine fails to offer a Bulgarian improvement on
poor old Sunny Beach. Holiday Which? tells Observer there is a simple
explanation; 'we agonised over this, but the only merit of Bulgaria's Black
Sea coast is its cheapness.
It conjures up your worst nightmares of Spain in the 1960s'. Some things
glasnost just cannot cure.

Salomon Brothers has finally taken the plunge and replaced Henry Kaufman who
stepped down as its chief economist in 1988. John Lipsky, a 44-year-old
American, has been based in London as a director of the economic and market
analysis department of Salomon Brothers International since July 1989 .
If Lipsky's name isn't as familiar in London as, say, Gavyn Davies of
Goldman Sachs or Bill Martin of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, it is not because of
any lack of distinction as an economist. He is highly regarded among his
peers and, as a former assistant chief in the exchange and trade relations
department of the International Monetary Fund, is well known among
international policy-makers.
He will be commuting across the Atlantic for a while until a successor is
found for him in London. His appointment shows how economic punditry is a
global business these days. It remains to be seen whether increased exposure
to the fragile US economy will lead Lipsky to take over Henry Kaufman's
unofficial title of 'Dr Doom'.

Ocean Group is only a fifth of the size of its old enemy - P &amp; O - but it
still seems able to hire a classier sort of non-executive director. Its
latest recruit - 55-year-old John Loudon - is one of business's
international smoothies.
Loudon's father and grand-father were managing directors of Royal Dutch
Petroleum. His cousins include the chief executives of Akzo, and Pierson,
Heldring and Pierson, and his younger brother, George, is chief executive of
Midland Montagu.
Although John sits on the boards of Freddy Heineken and Paul van
Vlissingen's companies and served in the Dutch cavalry, he has spent most of
his career as a London merchant banker, first with Lazards and then
Rothschilds. Since 1988 he has been involving himself with merchant banking
boutiques and a string of international directorships.
Loudon's friendship with Royal Dutch Petroleum's Dirk de Bruyne, who
recently retired from Ocean on reaching 70, probably had something to do
with his new appointment. He should be able to open doors for Ocean but his
family pedigree still looks more impressive than his own achievements to
date.

When it comes to ancient politicians, America has plenty to be proud of. The
secretive Jamie Whitten moved into the record books yesterday as the
longest-serving member of the US House of Representatives.
The Mississippi Democrat first came to Washington a month before Pearl
Harbor after winning a by-election on November 4 1941. A reformed
segregationist, he has never scored less than 63 per cent in his 26
elections Congress's seniority system means that Whitten, although one of
the least known politicians in Washington, is also one of the most powerful.
Other congressional leaders may decide on policy and dominate the news
headlines, but it is Whitten, as chairman of the House Appropriations
committee since 1978, who actually doles out the money.
Old politicians know that purse strings are more important than policy, so
it is no accident that Whitten's counterpart on the Senate Appropriations
committee is the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd
of West Virginia with 33 years under his belt.
Now 81, Whitten still has one longevity record ahead of him: the almost 57
years of total congressional service clocked up by Arizona's Carl Hayden,
who served 15 years in the House before moving over to the Senate.
By contrast, Britain's politicians are positive youngsters. Sir Bernard
Braine, the father of the house of commons, has only been an MP for 41 years
and he is retiring this year . . .

FT  07 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Russia's gamble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS a long history of impatient rulers who imposed untold suffering
to speed the pace of change or shift the country in a new direction. The
freeing of most prices at the start of the year looks like another of these
desperate gambles. But the motivation is no longer ambition; rather it is
desperation, a sense that, after seven decades of communism and seven years
of discussing economic reform, such change had to start somewhere.
Only now is the full extent of the economic disaster becoming understood.
Even before the New Year price rises, most families spent more than 80 per
cent of their declining real incomes on food. But with oil and energy output
falling in line with the overall drop in production, there is a growing risk
that more and more people will face both cold and hunger in the months
ahead.
For the advocates of price reform, such a situation is partly a consequence
of decades of central price fixing. Artificially low prices for oil, coal
and food made the producers of real wealth dependent on ad hoc subsidies.
Perhaps that mattered little in a command economy where resources were
allocated from the centre, mainly in the direction of the military. But it
is impossible to operate a market economy without a link between prices and
the cost of production.
In the short run, higher prices may not call forth much of a supply-side
response from an economy still in the hands of state-owned monopoly
producers. In an ideal world, price reform would have been introduced only
after large scale privatisation of state property was well under way and
where plans to cut government spending, and ensure more effective tax
collection, were in place. Without this there is a risk that higher prices
will lead to an explosive wage-price spiral, fed by the printing presses.
Immediate benefits
Nevertheless, price liberalisation will bring some immediate benefits:
reduction in the wasteful use of food, for example, and, perhaps still more
important, closure of the gap between official and unofficial prices and
elimination of the basis of much of the current black-marketeering and
associated corruption. Provided the printing presses can also be stopped,
the monetary overhang accumulated during the previous years of artificially
low prices and scarce goods will also be eliminated. These gains are, on
balance, worth the risks now being taken.
Thanks to the experience accumulated by Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
over the last two years, Mr Yegor Gaidar and the other young economists
currently in charge of Russia's economic reforms are well aware that things
must be taken still further. Price liberalisation is only part of a broader
package which includes privatisation, tight budgetary controls, curbs on
real wages and a realistic exchange rate, backed up by a substantial hard
currency stabilisation fund.
Without support
They, and Mr Boris Yeltsin, their political master, have decided to push
ahead without the supporting mechanisms in place because they fear that
otherwise there may be no chance of movement at all.
Windfall profits will now be made. But this is no more iniquitous than the
previous method of enrichment, when those with access to state-controlled
goods were able to make large fortunes by simplying selling them at market
prices to the new co-operatives. These were often indirectly owned by the
managers of state controlled plants who, in practice, sold subsidised goods
to themselves.
The next few months will be exceedingly hard. The west must continue to
channel food and other aid as accurately as possible into Russia and the
most vulnerable of the republics, while forging closer ties with the new
governments and with the military. But having embarked on price
liberalisation, Russia and the other republics also have no alternative but
to flesh out their reform programme. The circumstances are as difficult as
they could be. But this may be the only chance of democratic,
market-oriented reform for more than a generation. Mr Yeltsin's gamble is
justified by the prize; it also justifies whole-hearted western support.

FT  07 JAN 92 / On the campaign trail - in Japan: Bush may leave Tokyo
disappointed by Japanese concessions, and less able to resist protectionist
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Bush, who arrives in Japan today on the last leg of an Asian tour,
will be offered a bumper package of new year's gifts by his Japanese hosts.
But whether the US president will be satisfied with his presents looks very
doubtful.
What Mr Bush wants is a cut in Japan's politically sensitive bilateral trade
surplus - to be achieved, preferably, before this autumn's presidential
election. What he will get is a mixed bag of concessions from Japanese
government and industry which is unlikely to have much immediate
macro-economic impact.
Japanese officials and businessmen alike fear that Mr Bush may return to
Washington a disappointed man and that his disappointment could rebound on
Tokyo. The danger is that the president might no longer have the stomach to
resist demands from Congress for electorally popular action against Japan,
possibly including protectionist measures.
Japanese officials are also concerned that arguments over the Dollars
40bn-a-year bilateral trade imbalance will overshadow discussion on issues
such as the Uruguay Round of trade talks and the impact in Asia of the end
of the Cold War. Mr Nagayo Homma, a retired professor of Tokyo University
and an expert on US-Japan relations, says: 'The Japanese government is
extremely worried about the likely outcome of this visit.'
The concerns should be kept in perspective. Although links between the US
and Japan are being put under strain, they will not be easily broken. The
two countries, which together account for 40 per cent of the world's gross
national product, are each other's largest trading partners. The US is the
biggest recipient of Japan's foreign direct investment, accounting for
nearly half the total. Politically, the partners have been bound together
since the end of the Second World War. More American servicemen (46,000) are
stationed in Japan than anywhere else in Asia. Japan pays for more than 40
per cent of their costs.
Mr Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will spend time
on the fate of the former Soviet Union and other global issues, as well as
regional matters such as North Korea's nuclear weapons research programme.
With great ceremony, they will sign a Tokyo declaration - a joint statement
 -which will affirm the security alliance between the two nations and their
common interest in world peace and prosperity. The document - appearing a
few weeks after the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbour - will be presented as
a symbol of all that has been achieved in trans-Pacific relations since
1941.
However, there is no disguising the new strains that are emerging in the
relationship, born of the fact that Japan accounts for an ever-increasing
share of the income of the industrialised world, whereas America's share has
been in decline for 40 years.
Many Japanese are concerned about their long-time partner's economic health.
Mr Miyazawa said last week that the US needed 'friendship and compassion' in
its hour of need - words that some Americans may find patronising. Speaking
at the Grand Shrine at Ise, the centre of Shinto, the Japanese national
religion, Mr Miyazawa said that America deserved to be rewarded for helping
Japan's post-war economic recovery through the transfer of technology and
capital. 'It would be a loss to the entire world if the US could not fully
discharge its responsibilities as the world leader because of its domestic
difficulties.'
The US, as the politically dominant partner in the alliance, hates to see
its economic advantage ebbing way. As an avowed free-marketer, Mr Bush would
prefer American companies to staunch the flow for themselves. But as a
politician he cannot afford to wait much longer. Too many jobs are being
lost in the US. And too many voters are blaming Japan for the losses. That
is why he is touring Asia banging a drum for American business and why he is
seeking from the Japanese government interventionist moves (such as pressure
on carmakers to distribute imported vehicles) that he would not countenance
in the US.
It is a far cry from the original plans for the visit. When the trip was
first considered last year, it was intended to be a celebration of the
global partnership between two inseparable allies. Many internationally
minded Japanese regret that Mr Bush could not come, as previously scheduled,
in November. At that time the memory of the Gulf war was still fresh, and
Japan was smarting from the charge that it failed to do enough to support
the US-led forces in the Gulf. It was anxious to make amends.
In particular, the government wanted to pass through the Diet (parliament) a
controversial bill which would have allowed Japanese troops to be sent on
active missions overseas, on United Nations peace-keeping operations. The
bill provoked some hostility from people who feared that it would infringe
the country's peace constitution and possibly trigger a resurgence of
militarism. But the government rightly thought that it was an essential
first step towards Japan playing a role in the world commensurate with its
economic power.
Professor Akihiko Tanaka of Tokyo University's Institute of Oriental Culture
believes a timely visit from Mr Bush might have persuaded legislators to
back the bill. In the event, a decision was postponed, and is unlikely to be
made this year.
Similarly, it might have been easier last year for Mr Miyazawa to speak
positively about opening Japan's rice market to imports, as he is under
pressure to do from his partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. Now with the deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round only a few
days away, the time for manoeuvre is very short.
Mr Bush was forced to postpone his trip, partly because of events in the
former Soviet Union and partly because of criticism in the US that he was
spending too much time on foreign affairs, and too little fighting the
recession at home. Now Japanese officials are dismayed to see him
preoccupied with domestic considerations. They are concerned too that
Japanese politicians, led by Mr Miyazawa, are increasingly involved with an
election of their own, to be held in June, for the Diet's upper house.
The deterioration in the US economy since the autumn has further soured the
climate for the visit. The decision by General Motors, the carmaker, to lay
off more than 70,000 people has given ammunition to Mr Bush's critics who
accuse him of doing too little to protect US industry from the effects of
Japanese competition. The president's opponents have pointed to the gross
imbalance in auto trade between the US and Japan, with Americans importing
some 1.58m Japanese-made cars in the first 11 months of last year and the
Japanese buying just 28,000 from the US (13,000 of them made in America by
Honda Motor, the Japanese group).
In the past, the president might have shrugged off such criticism. But the
seriousness of the recession has forced Mr Bush to espouse some of the
rhetoric of economic interventionism. Speaking in Australia last week, Mr
Bush said the purpose of his Asian tour was to secure measures from Japan to
create jobs in America.
Many Japanese are astonished that Mr Bush has chosen to bring with him on
his tour 21 top executives of US corporations - including the heads of the
Big Three carmakers, GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler Motor. Prof Tanaka says:
'It's very peculiar for the president of the most powerful nation in the
world to act like a commercial salesman.'
Nevertheless, Japanese officials and businessmen are doing their best to
accommodate the president. While they do not like Mr Bush seemingly bringing
his re-election campaign to Japan, they would like it even less if he lost
the presidency to a Democrat rival, swept to power on an interventionist or
protectionist ticket.
Hence, the pile of gifts for Mr Bush. Top of the list is the Bank of Japan's
decision on December 30 to cut the Official Discount Rate from 5 per cent to
4.5 per cent, a move which could stimulate domestic demand.
The Bank of Japan has also presided over a rapid appreciation in the yen
over the last few weeks to around Y124 to the US dollar - its strongest for
three years. A sustained appreciation should make imports, including US
goods, more popular.
Mr Miyazawa will almost certainly agree to American demands for a resumption
of the Structural Impediments Initiative talks - bilateral discussions about
deep-rooted economic problems which first began two years ago. The prime
minister may also suggest that Japan could contribute to the Superconducting
Supercollider - an Dollars 8.25bn scientific research plant under
construction in Mr Bush's home state of Texas, for which the US has been
seeking Japanese support.
Concrete action should come in the car market. Tokyo is finalising measures
to deal with Mr Bush's specific demands for better market access for
American companies. The government is expected to relax testing standards on
imported cars. It is also exerting great pressure on Japanese carmakers to
open their dealerships to foreign companies and set targets for sales of
imported cars.
For their part car manufacturers have already announced wide-ranging plans
to increase purchases of imported parts and of locally produced components
for their foreign factories. Nissan Motor, for example, plans a 150 per cent
increase in imports over 1990 levels to Dollars 1.23bn in 1994 and a 200 per
cent increase in local procurement to Dollars 5.4bn.
However, even if these import-boosting measures succeed, the results will
not be evident for some time. It has taken Mercedes Benz 50 years to build a
network of 200 outlets in Japan. The Japan Automobile Dealers Association
complained yesterday that it had hardly ever received an approach from US
carmakers, and Japanese consumers had serious concerns about the quality of
US-made vehicles. Mr Hiroshi Kume, the chairman of the Japan Auto
Manufacturers Association, says bluntly: 'It's up to the customers what cars
they buy.'
The Japanese bristle at the claim - made most recently by Mr Bush in
Australia - that Japan is partly responsible for the US's economic problems,
including unemployment. 'Japanese people feel that GM's job losses are a
reflection of GM's own failings, not ours,' says Prof Tanaka. The commonly
held Japanese view, propounded with increasing directness, is that
weaknesses in the US - such as the budget deficit, poor educational
standards, insufficient investment and inadequate efforts in export markets
 -are the root cause of America's economic woes.
American officials do not deny the accuracy of these charges. But they
counter with equally pointed attacks on continuing barriers to the entry of
foreign companies into the Japanese market - notably the complexity of
bureaucratic decision-making and the preference of companies in keiretsu
(industrial groupings) to trade with each other at the expense of outsiders.
The danger of engaging in such discussions in an election year is that Mr
Bush's short-term political requirements will divert attention from the
search for longer-range economic policy initiatives. As Prof Homma says: 'In
Japan and the US the political will to solve serious economic problems does
not exist.'
Japanese officials feel that they have little choice but to try to help Mr
Bush. They see him as their best hope of blocking the rise of protectionism
in the US. But in spite of the Ministry of Trade and Industry's reputation
for influencing industry, there are limits to its capacity for squeezing
concessions from businessmen. When he returns to a US mired in recession, Mr
Bush may judge that the gifts from Tokyo were too little too late.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The competition that Pioneer Hi-Fi sponsor for the London Philharmonic
Orchestra has just completed its sixth successive year of existence. It is a
small competition, and its value is therefore that of real practical use to
a young musician - a prize of Pounds 2,500, awarded by a panel of judges
made up of musicians (including the LPO leader, David Nolan, and the
conductor of the evening, Jan Latham-Koenig) and other professionals, and a
concerto date with the LPO on the South Bank.
It is exactly this sort of boost, modest but exactly judged, that genuinely
serves a talented young performer at a crucial career stage - not the
grossly over-inflated, over-publicised antics of the BBC Cardiff Singer of
the Year and Young Musician of the Year shindigs.
The finals of the latest Pioneer Competition at the QEH on Sunday, were to
have shown us three young violinists each in a complete concerto performance
with the LPO. Unfortunately, one suffered a back injury and had to withdraw;
even so, there was plenty of interest in the remaining two. Surely no-one
who heard the 18-year-old English girl, Lucy Jeal, could be in doubt that
hers is a talent of a rare and precious kind, and that her winning of the
prize was other than totally deserved.
She undertook the Tchaikovsky concerto not as an exhaustively drilled
competition warhorse but as a musical experience that she made blossom with
fragrant freshness before our delighted ears. Everything about this lovely
young player told of artistic personality already distinct and fully formed
 -tone with its own definable character (not big and steely but warmly
ductile), a gentle, sometimes quietly musing way with the phrases that was
wholly personal, and utterly captivating.
Miss Jeal's command of the virtuoso flourishes was bold but not always
absolutely spot-on; in the highest reaches there was an occasional hint of
walking-on-thin-ice. No doubt she will firm up on these technical matters
before her Festival Hall concerto date; in any case, the wholeness of her
musical grasp put them into proper perspective.
The second player, the young Romanian Vesko Eschkenazy, gave us the
Beethoven concerto. He plays with shining ease and freedom from top to
bottom - no flutters, no shakiness, and (on this evidence) not much
sensitivity to the unfolding of a musical argument. In all those moments of
melodic or rhythmic definition where a performer can show his or her
peculiar Beethovenian grasp, this performance remained resolutely neutral,
bland, superficial. As tends to happen on such occasions, his particular
strengths and weaknesses made themselves felt in unfair contrast to those of
his predecessor.

In the first of two programmes called Learning To Fail (7.50 BBC2) Sir Claus
Moser pursues his concern that British education fails to meet the needs of
most young people and the country. Bamber Gascoigne presents the three-part
documentary Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint (8.00 C4), telling of the
3,000-mile journey made in 1483 by a German Dominican monk who, having
fallen in love with St Catherine of Alexandria, set out to cross the Alps
and the Mediterranean in order to touch her bones.
Our Boys, made by Irish film maker Cathal Black, is described by BBC2 as
'provocative and unusual'. It seeks to illustrate what Black regards as one
of the chief causes of sectarian division and social conflict in Irish life:
the control of education by The Christian Brothers (9.45).
An Angel at My Table has already won great critical acclaim as an
autobiographical book describing the life of New Zealand writer Janet Frame,
and as a cinema movie which won eight prizes at the Venice festival. The
three-part mini-series starting today (10.00 C4) is the form in which Jane
Campion originally intended the film to be seen.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: Sophisticated Ladies - Globe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People who saw Sophisticated Ladies, a celebration of Duke Ellington, in New
York and Paris in the mid-1980s still speak of it with great admiration and
affection. The production that has finally appeared in London is not on that
level. In short, it is not sophisticated.
The Globe is a relatively small theatre - too small for this kind of
tribute. An 11-man band plus leader sits not in the pit but on the stage,
taking up more than half the space and thus leaving little room for anything
else. When staircases are introduced at the sides to give height, they look
distinctly wobbly. No-one is going to dance the night away in these
conditions.
Although the second half is better than the first, almost to the point of it
being advisable to arrive at the interval, there are imperfections
throughout. 'Sophistication' is one of those relative words that mean
different things to different audiences: it does not apply to these ladies.
There is a plentiful supply of legs: indeed at times one was reminded of the
old Television Toppers in the days of the BBC monopoly. The faces are as
pretty as the legs, but on the whole these girls tend to alternate between
the three little maids from school variety and ordinary tarts.
The men are in an altogether higher class, notably Horace Oliver, a
19-year-old who has already done a national tour with 42nd Street and
appeared in Porgy and Bess at Glyndebourne. Oliver leads the gang in 'Drop
Me Off in Harlem' and later does a splendid competitive tap dance with Jon
Peterson. That is one of the peaks of the evening.
Other memories that linger are the insistent bass-playing by Frazer Snell
and the piano-playing of Malcolm Newton. Jacqueline Dankworth, daughter of
Cleo Laine, has a plausible shot at 'In a Sentimental Mood', but it is not
much more.
The main puzzle is why a show which on the face of it seems to promise so
much should turn out to be so disappointing. Part of the answer lies in the
lack of variety. It would seem almost impossible to fail with a song like
'I'm Beginning to See the Light', yet if you belt it out as if it were 'When
the Saints Go Marching In', the subtlety - the very light and shade that the
song is about - are lost. There are very few changes of mood in this
production.
Lack of variety is underlined by the almost entire absence of dialogue.
Since there are no characters, there is no characterisation. There is also
no story. The piece could do with the odd joke or stroke of wit and at least
some differentiation. In this production, it is not a patch on Swell Party,
the Cole Porter story at the Vaudeville. In the end Sophisticated Ladies
falls because it is not live up to the title. Perhaps it is being done on
the cheap. That is not what sophistication is about. The direction is by
Roger Haines.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Low sales and a lack of business is the most important problem facing small
businesses, according to the latest NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small
Business.*
Forty per cent of small businesses identified this issue, the largest
proportion ever to agree on a single concern, and an indication of the depth
of the recession, NatWest said.

Regional development agencies from around Europe have formed the European
Association of Development Agencies (EURADA) to influence the European
Communities policies on small business and regional development.
Eighty agencies are expected to become members of the association which was
launched at a meeting in Brussels last month. Four UK agencies - Greater
London Enterprise (GLE), West Midlands Enterprise Board, Lancashire
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise - are among the founding
members.
The agencies believe that the community's small firms policies need to be
better focused.

In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures plans to raise a Pounds 50m fund to back
management buy-outs. F&amp;C has already raised Pounds 20m from British,
Japanese and US institutional investors towards what will be its fourth
fund, F&amp;C Ventures Limited Partnership II.
Over the past 10 years F&amp;C Ventures made 69 buy-out or development capital
investments, of which 39 have either obtained a public listing or been sold

alone - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 4 per cent of small business owners would advise others thinking of
starting a firm not to do so, according to research carried out for National
Westminster Bank.
The most popular advice from the more than 800 small businesses up to two
years old which were polled was: check carefully, do your homework and get
expert advice. Eight per cent of those questioned advised against starting
up with too little capital.
Asked for the biggest hurdle they had to jump, one in five small business
owners cited sustaining and monitoring cash flow while one in six reported
it had been finding the original finance.

FT  07 JAN 92 / TV channel to cover all Commons debates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TELEVISION channel offering full coverage of the Commons will be launched
on Monday when MPs return after the Christmas recess.
The Parliamentary Channel is the creation of nine cable television companies
and will be available to more than 200,000 homes with cable throughout the
UK.
The channel, which will be run as a non-profit venture, is similar to C-Span
in the US which has provided coverage of Congress for the past 10 years and
is available in about 52m homes.
Ms Miranda Curtis, general manager of The Parliamentary Channel, said: 'The
idea is to provide unadorned coverage of the proceedings as they happen. We
will not provide analysis or commentary because other people can do that
very much better than we can.'
The channel will simply distribute the 'raw' feed provided by Commons
Committee Television, an independent television producer, as long as the
Commons sits.
The channel will be run for the nine consortium members by United Artists
Programming. The nine include leading cable television operators such as
Comcast, Videotron and CUC, and US telephone companies such as Pacific
Telesis and Southwestern Bell.
Together they are providing the Pounds 2m in loans believed to be needed to
allow the channel to break even within three years.
Cable operators in turn will pay Pounds 1 a year for each subscriber, who
will receive The Parliamentary Channel automatically as part of the basic
package of channels.
This year the channel will concentrate on coverage of the Commons. It hopes
to add the Lords and parliamentary committees next year.
A three-hours-a-day digest of the proceedings of the European parliament in
Strasbourg should be available from September.
The Parliamentary Channel would like to be able to broadcast from the Marco
Polo satellite system launched by British Satellite Broadcasting - in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, had a significant stake - when the
channel becomes available next year for public-service broadcasting uses.
Ironically, the only interruption to the flow of debate on The Parliamentary
Channel will come with the calling of a general election.
When politics moves outside the chamber, the channel will go off the air for
the six weeks of the campaign and will only come back when the MPs return to
the Commons from the hustings.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Dealing in the business of fear: How rival paramilitary
groups raise and launder money through commerce and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND the more visible measures to deter terrorism in Northern Ireland the
government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary are fighting a secret war
against the IRA's fund-raising efforts.
Officials believe the IRA raises up to Pounds 6m a year, which finances arms
and explosives, weekly payments to about 500 active 'volunteers', safe
houses, travel, bribes and research and development on armaments.
Protestant paramilitaries also fund operations from racketeering, generating
income estimated by officials to be about Pounds 2m a year. But the IRA's
financial activities and military organisation have been identified as far
greater and more sophisticated than those of the Protestants and are the
main focus of RUC activities.
The IRA's bombing campaign against commercial targets and its assassinations
of executives whose companies supply the armed forces have fuelled the
climate of fear on which racketeering and extortion breed.
The war against the paramilitary fund-raisers centres on two special units;
one at an anonymous-looking building by the river in east Belfast, the other
in the government offices at Stormont Castle.
The first is the RUC's C13 anti-racketeering squad. The second is a
little-known department made up of tax experts, accountants and an
assortment of secretive intelligence gatherers from various sections of the
Civil Service.
Both units are considered by some officials as being as important as the
detachments of police and soldiers that patrol the streets in the fight
against terrorism.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, underlined the importance that
the government attaches to its anti-racketeering strategy last year.
He told the Commons that businessmen and accountants - 'persons of
substance' - were becoming increasingly involved in raising and laundering
funds used to finance terrorism.
He also warned that, without action soon, there was a serious risk that
those acting on behalf of terrorist organisations would succeed in
establishing a commercial or business infrastructure capable of providing
long-term support for terrorism.
C13, set up in its present form in 1986, has recently had its status in the
RUC upgraded. It has greatly increased its personnel and introduced
state-of-the-art surveillance equipment and computerised intelligence
databanks. Its officers are slick and - uncharacteristically for the RUC -
worldly-wise. They have had contacts with the FBI in the US and with
European police such as those in Italy, who have had experience of dealing
with organised crime.
The Civil Service unit at Stormont is a more recent creation. The Northern
Ireland Office, for security reasons, carefully protects the identity of its
members, some of whom are drawn from government departments not normally
associated in the public eye with counter terrorism.
Racketeering is one of the few issues that the Confederation of British
Industry's regional office in Northern Ireland is not prepared to comment
on. It argues that to go public would only fuel the IRA's campaign and
produce more potential targets on both sides of the political divide.
The main areas of the black 'micro-economy' in which officials claim
paramilitaries have been operating include:
Taxi services. Contributions are believed by officials to be made from
companies operating in the republican and loyalist strongholds of Belfast.
Non-invoiced drink sales. Money is thought to be channelled from sales in
the social clubs which have taken the place of some of the Belfast pubs
burnt down in the rioting of the 1970s.
Tax fraud. This is thought to arise from the use of forged or illegally
obtained tax exemption certificates by sub-contractors on building sites.
Protection rackets. Business-people are forced to pay 'subscriptions' rather
than risk having their operations disrupted by bombing or assassination of
personnel.
In addition, companies supplying the armed forces have been subjected to a
campaign of intimidation often involving the killing of key personnel.
New powers under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill include
those empowering the courts to seize the assets of anyone who benefited
terrorist-related activities.
Both the RUC and government officials claim they have begun to stem the tide
of terrorist funding. They say that is the result of raids on organisations
alleged to have been making significant contributions to the republican
movement that had the potential to be diverted to the IRA.
Not all the raids have been successful. Fourteen months after being raided
by the security forces, offices of Sinn Fein (the political wing of the
IRA), the Prisoners Welfare Committee, a charity called the Green Cross, and
a Catholic taxi co-operative called West Belfast Taxi Insurance are
operating within a short walk of each other off the Falls Road.
Their fund-raising activities on behalf of the families of political
prisoners remain unobstructed by the security forces as do those of the New
York offices of Noraid, which channels funds from the Irish-American
community.
The only common link admitted to by all five organisations is that they are
responsible for shouldering part of the costs of the republican movement.
According to accounts registered with the US Department of Justice, Noraid
has made deposits and payments through two US banks, Citibank and First
Citizens.
Green Cross says it has been a client for many years with Allied Irish Bank,
while West Belfast Taxi Insurance says that it banks with Northern Bank.
Noraid, Sinn Fein, the Prisoners Welfare Committee, the Green Cross and West
Belfast Taxi Insurance all deny financing the IRA, although Noraid is
registered with the US Department of Justice as a 'foreign agent
representing the Irish Republican Army'. All four banks say they are not
prepared to comment on accounts held by individuals or organisations.
Documents seized so far have failed to provide evidence linking the
fund-raising of the organisations and terrorist activity, although the RUC
and the Stormont unit claimed to have found evidence of false accounting in
the case of one Belfast taxi association and several social clubs.
The RUC says several hundred thousand pounds have gone missing from the West
Belfast Taxi Association. The accusation of false accounting, however, is
denied by Mr Jim Neeson, the organisation's chairman. He said the 650 taxi
drivers who belonged to his organisation paid an average of Pounds 2 a week
each to the Green Cross, which he described as a 'charitable organisation'
channelling funds to the families of political prisoners. The security
forces, in their search for what may be much larger sums of money, are
understood to be up against a complex system of money laundering by the IRA.
According to government officials this is thought sometimes to involve front
companies and the accounts of sympathisers or nominees who are not easily
identifiable. They possibly extend to numerous banking jurisdictions both
onshore and offshore, although the RUC and Stormont admit they may still
have some way to go before coming to grips with the IRA's complex financial
structure.
While the identity of some individuals close to the IRA's finance 'command'
 -responsible for supervising the collection and distribution of funds
within the organisation - may be known to intelligence, there is as yet no
hard evidence to ensure their conviction.
One security official said: 'There is a disparity between what we know to be
the case and what we can do because of lack of evidence.'
Mr Alasdair Maclaughlin, of the Northern Ireland Bankers' Association, says
he had no information as to how many local banks had shared the experience
of the Bank of Ireland, which was presented with an extortion demand by the
IRA for Pounds 2m last year - a demand it rejected.
But he confirmed the practical difficulties faced by the authorities as they
attempt to track more subtle forms of terrorist-based financial transactions
involving the use of nominee directors for front companies and money
laundering. 'It's bound to be difficult when you have the criminal
fraternity remarkably well qualified. They have brains which are trying to
be ahead of the game . . . there are ways of getting into the system and
laundering money.'
Few companies will talk openly about the costs of protection rackets or
their motives for not supplying the armed forces. The real costs of
resisting terrorism is only slightly clearer.
Economists believe the government compensation fund (see chart) understates
the costs of terrorist activity against commercial activities.
Short Brothers, the defence manufacturer and Northern Ireland's biggest
private employer, has been the victim of seven IRA bomb attacks in the last
two years. but it says it has never paid protection money, and its
investment programme has not been affected. Smaller companies, however,
cannot afford to pay the Pounds 10m Shorts says it has spent on security in
the last two years. They have therefore been more vulnerable to extortion
and threats against personnel.
In September one of Northern Ireland's leading timber companies, McCue Dick,
announced it would no longer supply goods to the security forces after Mr
John Haldane, its managing director, was shot dead by the IRA.
The issue of payments to terrorist organisations and the operation of
contracts with the security forces is regarded as virtually taboo by the
majority of the business community.
The Northern Ireland Building Federation refuses to discuss the issue in
public. But one senior member of the Federation said extortion had been on
the increase since the beginning of 1991.
'The difficulty comes when a contractor is two thirds of the way through his
project and has made a financial commitment . . . but the practical reality
is that it is impossible to have a 24-hour police guard and there is no
choice but to abandon it.'
The construction company Mivan is among the few businesses to have talked
about its difficulties, after testifying against paramilitaries that
extorted money from it. Although Mivan faced racketeers that belonged to
Protestant paramilitary organisations, the case illustrates the problems of
construction companies which feel threatened by the IRA.
The company had started work on a building site in Belfast when one of its
managers was approached by men claiming to be raising funds on behalf of a
prisoners' welfare fund.
In the following weeks the pressure intensified with warnings that, unless
the company agreed to pay cash directly to collectors, plant and machinery
would be damaged and members of staff attacked.
Mivan agreed to be party to a sting operation involving C13 and subsequently
testified in a court case against the men involved. Last year it was again
approached for money when it began work on a Pounds 500,000 renovation
programme in the low-income Shankill area of Belfast. It decided to abandon
the contract.
Money paid by the Northern Ireland Office in compensation to companies which
have been victims of terrorism reached a record last year and forced the
government to freeze its public-spending budget.
The government argues compensation is necessary if future investment is not
to be deterred, but it has not succeeded in eradicating the fear felt by
wide sectors of the business community.
Fear underlined the words of a Belfast businessmen who told a local
journalist soon after Mr Brooke's appeal in October: 'If businessmen have
any sense they'll keep their mouths shut . . . even if we do own up, the
police won't catch the big boys. I'm paying Pounds 600 every six months to
the Provos and Pounds 600 to the Prods, so I'm getting off pretty light.
'The way it works is that you get a phone call saying a collection's going
to be taken in a couple of days for political prisoners and to have the
money ready. But if you phone the police and they lift the man who calls for
the money, that's only the messenger. When he doesn't get back the godfather
knows what's happening and I'm dead.'
Police are urging businesses to use their 'helpline' to tip them off about
extortion attempts and to testify in court. But a leading builder, who
insisted on anonymity, commented: 'Most people are unwilling to go to court
unless they feel the weight of evidence is such that the police can get a
conviction and are quite certain that neither (they) nor their families
would be put at risk.'
He added: 'The reality is that the IRA have the potential to kill and the
security forces are unable to protect us.'
