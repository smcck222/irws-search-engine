FT  07 JAN 92 / Many foreign holiday hotels condemned as dangerous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME HOTELS used by British tour operators in popular resorts in Spain,
Portugal and Greece are dangerous to holidaymakers, Holiday Which?, a
Consumers' Association magazine, says today.
The January edition of the association's magazine says its inspectors 'found
major safety flaws in every grade of hotel' in Benidorm, the Algarve and
Corfu.
The hotels were assessed for fire and glass hazards, as well as safety in
swimming pools, play areas, lifts and balconies. All but four of 42 it
investigated in mid-1991 were found to be deficient in at least one way.
The hotels scrutinised are used by some of the biggest names in the UK
travel industry, including the Thomson group. Among the more serious
findings of the report are:
An 'appalling' state of fire safety equipment in the Algarve, with nine out
of 16 hotels having inadequate fire safety precautions. Half the inspected
hotels in Corfu and Benidorm are also dubbed 'inadequate' on fire safety.
The majority of swimming pools failed to come up to scratch, with murky
water and sudden, unmarked depth changes a potential hazard for weak
swimmers or children.
The Tour Operators' Study Group (TOSG), representing 22 of the larger UK
operators, recommends that travel representatives conduct safety checks
every six weeks in hotels they use.
But Holiday Which? says that such changes 'have patently not resulted in
safe hotels for British holidaymakers abroad'. It adds that 'operators
cannot just pay lip-service to improving safety standards while still
selling holidays to hotels which are clearly unsafe'.
Ms Gloria Ward of Thomson said: 'We don't use any accommodation anywhere
which does not conform to local safety requirements. However, we do not
control local laws, so whether or not the local regulations are the same as
those in Britain is irrelevant. But it is in no one's interest to send
people to places which are not considered safe.'
The study group said the Holiday Which? findings 'will be checked by TOSG
members to ensure corrective action has been taken where appropriate. It is
up to each individual operator concerned to consider the continued use of a
particular hotel.'
Mr Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs at the Association of British
Travel Agents, said there was a need for European Community legislation on
hotel safety standards.
Mr Betton added that UK operators, which may this year account for 8 per
cent of the 100m tourists in the Mediterranean region, 'do not have the
commercial clout' to force overseas hoteliers to bring their safety
standards in line with the 'very high' levels found in Britain.
Holiday Which? criticises the EC for failing to introduce legally-binding
fire safety standards for hotels. One senior member of the UK travel
industry said Holiday Which? is 'recommending safety levels far above those
normally found in Mediterranean countries. Generally speaking, hoteliers
there simply do not feel that such high standards are necessary'.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Exam scheme for 14-year-olds to be tested in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECONDARY SCHOOLS in England and Wales are to be invited to join the pilot
scheme for new national examinations in mathematics and science devised for
14-year-olds, Mr Tim Eggar, education minister, announced yesterday.
The exams will become compulsory for all 14-year-olds from next year as part
of the government's drive to raise educational standards through the
national curriculum.
Pupils entered for the national exams under the pilot scheme will sit three
one-hour written papers each in mathematics and science in June. Papers in
English and technology will be added when the exams become compulsory next
year, with papers in history and geography to be added in 1994.
Described by Mr Eggar as 'academically rigorous and easy to administer', the
exams are mainly timed, written tests. They will be taken simultaneously by
all pupils under controlled conditions in their schools. Marking is to be
done by teachers in the school, subject to audit by the examination groups
responsible for setting the GCSE examinations.
Results will be available to parents and the government hopes that schools
will publicise them. But since participation is voluntary, publication of
results is not mandatory.
The response from the teaching unions was hostile. Mr Doug McAvoy, general
secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said that the tests were
'ill-conceived'.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers advised his 120,000 members not to
volunteer for supervising the tests without cast-iron guarantees of extra
resources.
Schools in England need at least Pounds 3.5bn to deal with building and
repair work, Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's schools spokesman, said yesterday.
The Department of Education said an increase of 15 per cent in capital
allocations for local authorities next year to more than Pounds 700m showed
the strength of the government's commitment.

<TEXT>
A MEETING of the Zoological Society of London to discuss the future of
London Zoo yesterday agreed on a Pounds 9m scheme to rescue the zoo, which
is running at a loss of Pounds 2m a year.
A postal ballot gave a vote of confidence to the council by 659 to 191. A
reform group then moved a motion of lack of confidence in the past
performance of the council, officers, and executive directors. This was
carried by 208 to 56.

<TEXT>
TWO CONTRACTORS have won nearly half of the main new motorway and road
contracts awarded in the current fiscal year, David Owen writes.
Balfour Beatty and Tarmac Construction won Pounds 161.6m of contract awards
between them, equivalent to about 45 per cent of the total of more than
Pounds 350m total.
Two years ago the top two contractors - Balfour Beatty and Fairclough Civil
Engineering - secured less than 29 per cent of work available, which
amounted to more than Pounds 500m.
The figures for the top 20 contractors in each of the past three years were
a response to a written question by Mr Peter Pike, Labour MP for Burnley.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Revenue staff urged to end overtime
ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX STAFF have been recommended by their union to end their overtime ban and
'work-to-charter' after concessions from the Inland Revenue on a disputed
performance-pay system.
Members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation voted early in December by
more than 3-1 to concentrate on tasks of immediate benefit to the public, in
the spirit of the government's Citizen's Charter, rather than those of
benefit to the Revenue.
The 'work-to-charter' started in the middle of last month and was backed at
the end of the month by an overtime ban.
Mr Clive Brooke, federation general secretary, said there had been enough
progress in talks on the performance-pay system for the union to recommend
suspension of the action until talks were completed.
He warned, however, that his executive's recommendation to suspend the
action might not be heeded by staff. They will start voting on the issue on
Friday.
Federation members felt aggrieved that the performance-pay system for the
Revenue had tougher performance conditions than systems used in other parts
of the Civil Service. For example, tax staff categorised as merely
satisfactory were given nothing.
The Revenue has now agreed to give a one-off Pounds 300 payment to workers
who have been categorised as satisfactory for five years or more. Talks will
now take place on whether such staff will also receive an annual award.
The union also says the Revenue has agreed to make its system of performance
classification more open and to recruit an extra 600 staff to help deliver
the tax element of the Citizen's Charter.
Mr Brooke said: 'We have not got everything we wanted, but a few important
breakthroughs have been made and there is now a more level playing field.'
The existing performance pay systems throughout the Civil Service are due to
be replaced after March 31. The new systems are likely to increase the
element of performance pay in total pay packages and to extend individual
contracts farther down the Civil Service hierarchy.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Peugeot Talbot's profit level 'acceptable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT TALBOT will be seen to have made an 'acceptable' level of profit
last year when the depressed state of the car market is taken into account,
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of the UK subsidiary of the French
group, said yesterday.
He said the UK car industry would undergo a modest revival this year after
hitting 'rock-bottom' in December.
Mr Whalen declined to comment on the size of last year's profit made by
Peugeot Talbot. It is expected to be less than half of 1990's pre-tax profit
of Pounds 109m. The 1990 figure was, however, the company's second-best
result since Peugeot took over the loss-making UK operations of Chrysler
(formerly Rootes group) in 1978.
Among the rest of the UK's main carmakers, Mr Bill Ebbert, chairman of
Vauxhall, has also said that the General Motors subsidiary 'will definitely
stay in profit'.
This is in contrast to Ford, which has warned that its financial performance
last year would be 'far worse' than the pre-tax loss of Pounds 274m incurred
in 1990.
Rover Group, the British Aerospace subsidiary, showed a Pounds 45m trading
loss in the first half of last year, compared with a Pounds 33m profit in
the same period of 1990.
Work is continuing at Peugeot Talbot's manufacturing facility at Ryton, near
Coventry, on additional facilities to build a second range of cars from
early next year. Currently it builds only the 405 car.
In spite of exporting nearly 60,000 Ryton-built 405s to Continental markets
last year, the depressed state of the UK market meant that the company was
unably to prevent total output falling to 87,000, from 116,500 a year
earlier.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Bank lending for personal consumption falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKNESS of the UK economy pushed new bank lending for personal
consumption down sharply in the three months to the end of November,
according to figures from the British Bankers' Association.
Borrowing from Britain's leading banking groups through credit cards was
particularly slack, in line with depressed demand ahead of Christmas and the
desire by consumers to repay credit card debts, which are perceived as the
most expensive form of credit.
The association said money borrowed on credit cards from the banks rose by
Pounds 23m in the three months compared with an increase of Pounds 254m in
the previous quarter and Pounds 271m a year earlier.
As a result the increase in personal lending for consumption fell to Pounds
101m in the latest three months compared with an increase of Pounds 415m in
the three months to August and Pounds 653m in the three months to the end of
November 1990.
In general, the figures in the association's quarterly analysis of sterling
lending by the UK's nine biggest banking groups are not seasonally adjusted.
But the association also published data showing that total lending grew by
less than Pounds 2bn, seasonally adjusted, in the latest three months. This
compares with Pounds 5.4bn growth in the three months to November 1990, in
spite of the addition of Abbey National figures to association statistics in
April 1991.
Most of the increase in lending in the three months to November was to
individuals - a rise of Pounds 1.58bn on an unadjusted basis. This was
mainly accounted for by a Pounds 1.48bn rise in lending to house buyers.
Borrowing by retailers, which would normally be high in the approach to
Christmas, rose Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 555m in the same period in
1990. The association said this reflected the continuing succession of
capital issues by big retailers used to repay bank lending.
After six months of net repayments the company sector resumed borrowing in
the latest three months.
But the increase - of Pounds 500m - reflected activity by financial
companies and was low compared with 1990 when borrowing by the company
sector averaged more than Pounds 4bn a quarter.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Gilts sales of Pounds 1.32bn recorded

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England sold Pounds 1.32bn of government gilt-edged securities
in November, according to official figures released yesterday, Peter Norman
writes. This prompted City analysts to suggest that the government is close
to funding the public sector borrowing requirement for 1991-92.
The Bank's final monetary statistics for November showed large purchases of
Pounds 1.1bn of gilts by the non-bank private sector. According to Mr Don
Smith, an economist for Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged, the government may
have to sell only a further Pounds 500m of gilts to fully fund the Pounds
10.5bn PSBR for 1991-92 forecast in the Treasury's Autumn Statement.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are wasting thousands of pounds on headhunters and recruitment
consultants in their search to find the right candidates for top jobs,
according to an independent study released today.
Some consultants are more concerned with keeping on the right side of job
applicants than putting candidates through their paces, according to the
survey of 365 executive recruitment consultancies.
The study said some consultants were likely to use unstructured interviews
and references - methods least likely to pinpoint the best candidate -
rather than tests of aptitude and personality.
Mr Timothy Clark, of the Open University's School of Management, will today
present his findings to the annual conference of occupational psychologists,
which is being staged in Liverpool by the British Psychological Society. He
said the cost to companies of employing headhunters 'could outweigh any
productivity benefits' of the new appointment. That was because the wrong
people were often selected for important jobs.
All the headhunters in the survey used interviews, and almost all also
relied heavily on references. But only 40 per cent employed the
psychological tests that have been shown to predict reasonably accurately
how an individual will perform, said Mr Clark.
Headhunters and executive search consultants are often not qualified to
carry out psychological testing, he added. They are also often reluctant to
subcontract the work to those who are qualified because of fears they will
lose control of the contract.
The findings could cause the increasing number of companies which rely on
consultants to reconsider the way they spend their money.
Mr Clark emphasised, however, that headhunters still perform one very useful
function: if a company wants to target a particular individual for a
vacancy, consultants remain expert at persuading candidates to quit their
present employers.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Manufacturers in dark mood after false dawns: From cars to
carpets, there are few signs of recovery on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS had a bad year in 1991, and they are braced for little better
in 1992.
Companies from a range of manufacturing industries expect output to be
further down on 1991 levels. Those looking forward to growth this year
expect it will come only in the second half, if at all.
Exporters expect a tougher time with slower growth abroad and increasing
competition as Far Eastern manufacturers turn to European markets to offset
sluggish domestic demand. Selling prices remain under intense pressure and
investment plans are being reviewed.
That is the gloomy message the cars, chemicals and engineering industries
will deliver in the next two days.
UK car sales were 21 per cent down last year, following a 31 per cent fall
in 1990, according to figures to be published today by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Yet 1992 will be a tough year although some senior executives have spotted
the first glimmers of recovery. Car manufacturers largely offset the decline
in the UK market by boosting exports, which were 70 per cent up in the first
10 months of last year. But slower growth in continental Europe and
intensifying competition from Japanese manufacturers will make life harder
for exporters this year.
The chemical industry is expecting output growth of at most 2.5 per cent
this year, after a flat 1991, according to forecasts to be published by the
Chemical Industries Association tomorrow. Even this modest growth will
depend mainly on the strength of the pharmaceutical industry, which should
mask further falls in output from bulk sectors such as fertilisers and
industrial chemicals. Most worrying of all is that investment this year is
expected to be at best flat after a worse than expected 15 per cent fall
last year.
The engineering industry is in sombre mood, whether one looks at traditional
metal bashing industries or high-tech aerospace companies which are facing
cuts in defence spending. The Engineering Employers Federation says
engineering output continued to fall in the last three months of last year.
It sees little reason to expect much growth this year. The EEF forecasts a
2.2 per cent increase in the fourth quarter of 1992, compared with 12 months
earlier.
There is little prospect of growth in mechanical engineering, which may have
to wait until 1993 for an upturn. The UK machine-tool industry, where sales
to some motor industry customers were down 40 per cent last year, and
construction equipment manufacturers, see no signs of improvement this year.
In electrical engineering a year-end survey by Hoare Govett, the securities
house, found that 81 per cent of companies in four main sectors of ing
products, industrial products, power equipment and rail equipment - thought
the sector was still in recession. But 62 per cent were more optimistic
about prospects than they had been three months previously. They expected UK
demand for their products to rise by 7 per cent this year after a 4 per cent
fall in 1991.
The steel industry, which is suffering fierce price competition from cheap
imports from the Continent, faces a further decline in output from 16.3m
tonnes last year to about 16m tonnes this year, according to MEPS, the
Sheffield-based steel consultancy.
The commercial vehicle industry, still suffering its sharpest post-war sales
fall, also has little cause for optimism. Its customers are not planning to
expand - more than half the 240 member companies of the Freight Transport
Association expect their fleet sizes to remain at 1991 levels.
Registrations of trucks, vans and buses were down 30 per cent last year to
about 190,000 after a 22 per cent fall in 1990.
Exports, provided by large one-off contracts with Africa and the Middle East
for some truck makers such as ERF and AWD, were buoyant. But that did not
prevent truck, van and bus production falling to 172,577 in the first 10
months of last year, nearly 27 per cent below the comparable 1990 period and
nearly 40 per cent below 1989. Most makers of trucks of more than 3.5 tonnes
expect a small rise in sales next year to about 35,000, but warn that this
will depend on whether a recovery takes hold in the first half of the year.
The textile industry starts 1992 with only a glimmer of hope for recovery,
after production fell 6 per cent last year, according to the British Textile
Confederation. Sales were down 3 per cent.
Even though textiles usually recover early in the economic cycle,
particularly low-cost items such as lingerie, hopes that this autumn
heralded an upturn have been dashed.
Sales of high-priced items such as suits and coats remain depressed. The
carpet market is also unlikely to show any sign of recovery until the
housing market recovers.
The construction industry is resigned to further decline this year. The only
good news is that the decline will be slower than in 1991.
The National Economic Development Council's construction sector group
forecasts a lean year in 1992, with output likely to be about 5 per cent
down this year after a 9.5 per cent decline in 1991.
Industry spent most of last year apprehensively scanning the horizon for
signs of recovery only to be rewarded with several false dawns. It is
approaching this year in a mood of such sombre resignation that it will take
a lot more than a glimmer of light on the horizon to lift its spirits.

<TEXT>
MORE THAN Pounds 25m of European Community funding has been allocated to
British organisations for training projects designed to help women, people
with disabilities and to promote new qualifications.
The three initiatives, backed by the European Social Fund, will be
trans-national projects exchanging skills and training knowledge between
member states. One project, Euroform, develops skills and qualifications in
preparation for the single market.
Mr Eric Forth, employment minister, said yesterday that Britain benefited
significantly from the European Social Fund, receiving about Pounds 350m a
year. Most of this was focused on training for the long-term unemployed. The
new funds meant the UK could share expertise with other member states.
Mr Forth said substantial interest had been shown in all three initiatives.
Organisations chosen to run them included voluntary bodies, colleges and
industry. Several Training and Enterprise Councils were among the successful
bidders.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Row over British Coal move to oust commercial director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL plans to oust Mr Malcolm Edwards, its commercial director, on
the grounds that it has no confidence in his commitment to the company or
his ability to negotiate contracts with the electricity industry, it emerged
yesterday.
The decision by Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman since January last
year, has prompted speculation that, through the removal of one of British
Coal's staunchest defenders, the government is preparing to reduce the
organisation's size.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, said yesterday: 'Malcolm Edwards
is the only person in British Coal who really cares about a British coal
industry.'
Coal industry commentators suggest that Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary,
is worried that Mr Edwards' assertive marketing style could threaten the
smooth settlement of new contracts to sell coal to National Power and
PowerGen, the two electricity generators of England and Wales. One
commentator said there was 'no doubt' that Mr Clarke and Mr Wakeham wanted
Mr Edwards to go.
Existing contracts expire in March next year, and the new contracts will be
critical in determining the future size of British Coal. Mr Edwards has long
argued for maintaining a sizeable coal industry.
The news of a plan to remove Mr Edwards leaked after he failed to appear at
a Commons energy committee meeting last month. His absence prompted Labour
MPs to ask Mr Clarke if Mr Edwards had been sacked.
This was followed by the announcement in a British Coal house bulletin that
Mr Andrew Horsler, number three in Mr Edwards' department, was being
appointed director-general of marketing, responsible for negotiating
contracts with the generators. This function was previously part of Mr
Edwards' responsibilities in the organisation.
Mr Horsler will report directly to Mr Clarke who, it is understood, intends
to be involved in negotiations with the generators - an unprecedented step
for a British Coal chairman.
Mr Edwards was offered a redundancy package about two months ago, it emerged
yesterday, but had hoped to stay. According to a senior British Coal
executive his removal after 36 years in the organisation sprang from a
fundamental conflict between him and Mr Clarke over negotiations with the
generators.
Mr Edwards believed in actively promoting British Coal while Mr Clarke
preferred a more low-key approach. Mr Edwards was also unwilling to rely on
Mr Wakeham to ensure British Coal's future, the executive said.
British Coal is understood to have questioned Mr Edwards' commitment to its
future. Mr Edwards is being backed, however, by the unions and by
electricity industry executives such as Mr John Baker, chief executive of
National Power, who has written Mr Edwards a letter of support.
The National Union of Mineworkers and Union of Democratic were also
concerned about Mr Edwards' potential departure.
Mr Edwards' solicitor, Mrs Denise Kingsmill of DG Freeman, said criticisms
of Mr Edwards were unsupported. 'Both Mr MacGregor and Mr Haslam (former
British Coal chairmen) have confirmed there is no one in Europe better at
selling coal than Malcolm Edwards,' she added.
British Coal said yesterday: 'Mr Edwards' proposed departure from the
corporation has been under discussion for some time, and the matter is being
dealt with by our respective lawyers.'
THE ELECTRICITY industry is wasting money in gas-fired power stations,
according to a report by Mr Stephen Fothergill, reader in economics at
Reading University, and energy specialist Mr Stephen Witt. The report,
commissioned by the Coalfields Communities Campaign, a local-authority
pressure group, was published yesterday. The authors argue that National
Power and PowerGen have replaced nine serviceable coal-fired stations with
gas-fired stations at great expense. The 30-plus gas-fired stations planned
are superfluous because there is already a surplus of generating plant, the
report argues. If they do come on stream, it adds, there will not be enough
gas to supply them long-term.  It estimates that if nearly all the planned
stations materialised, the UK's North Sea gas reserves would be exhausted in
25 years rather than the 40 expected. Gas demand from the new stations would
also force up gas prices in the long run, Mr Fothergill said yesterday.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Puerto Ricans ponder future: Governor who got it wrong will
step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rafael Hernandez Colon, the governor of Puerto Rico, has decided against
seeking another term in elections this year, after misreading the mood of
the 3.3m people of the island about their political future.
The decision of the governor, who has been in office since 1984 and served
an earlier term between 1972 and 1976, has coincided with increasing concern
over the economic future of the US Caribbean possession, and over whether
tax preferences which have contributed to its economic health will be
continued.
Mr Hernandez Colon has been losing popularity, not only among Puerto Ricans
in general, but in his own Partido Popular Democratico (PPD), where he was
being challenged for the candidacy in this year's gubernatorial elections by
the popular Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza. The governor's decision to step
aside will spare the PPD a damaging battle over the candidacy, at a time
when it could least afford one.
Mr Hernandez Colon's decision also means a PPD united under Mrs Munoz
Mendoza will present a stronger challenge to the opposition Partido Nuevo
Progresista, led by Mr Pedro Rosello, which has been gaining in popular
support from public disfavour with Mr Hernandez Colon.
Mr Hernandez Colon committed a seemingly grave error of judgment last month,
leading the PPD to a setback in a referendum which it lost by a wide margin.
Puerto Ricans were asked to say whether they supported his proposals for a
package of 'democratic rights'. These included a guarantee of continued US
citizenship for Puerto Ricans regardless of any future changes in the
island's political status, maintaining Spanish as the territory's official
language, and protection for Puerto Rico's 'cultural identity'.
The referendum was a clear effort by Mr Hernandez Colon and his party to
influence Puerto Ricans, and Washington, over the island's political status.
Puerto Ricans have been contemplating their political future, and a
plebiscite will give them a chance to decide whether they want to continue
the current 'commonwealth 'relationship with the US, become a state of the
union, or be politically independent.
Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for a president. The island
is represented in Washington by a commissioner who has no vote to influence
legislation.
Mr Hernandez Colon's PPD supports an enhancement of the current
quasi-colonial 'commonwealth' relationship with the US, while the opposition
PNP, led by Mr Rosello, advocates a move to statehood. Support for the
government's proposals would have damaged the island's chances of becoming a
state: Washington is unlikely to look kindly at having a Spanish-speaking
state in the union. And islanders showed little enthusiasm for independence,
relegating the Partido Independentista Puertoriqueno (PIP) to a distant
third place in recent elections.
When the referendum on statehood is held, the decision is likely to turn on
economic issues. As a 'commonwealth', Puerto Rico benefits significantly
from transfers of federal funds and its economy rests on a section of the US
Revenue Code which gives tax breaks to mainland companies investing in the
island.
Federal transfers reached Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in 1990, the highest
ever received by the island, with half going to welfare programmes and the
rest to government expenditure. On a per capita basis, however, this was
less than was received by the poorer US states. Even supporters of statehood
in Puerto Rico agree that changes which would have to be made if the island
became a state could see a reduction in the flow of federal funds.
The Puerto Rican administration committed itself to providing Dollars 100m a
year for lending to Caribbean and Central American states. Loans totalling
about Dollars 700m have been approved for a range of ventures, mainly in
Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Costa
Rica.
Caribbean states which have gained from Mr Hernandez Colon's programme will
be keen to determine whether Mrs Munoz Mendoza, if elected, will continue
the facility. It is unlikely that a PNP administration, should Mr Rosello
win, will find the financing facility compatible with its desire for the
island to become a state.

<TEXT>
As dealers (above) tried to sell US cars in Tokyo showrooms yesterday on the
eve of President Bush's visit, Mr Kozo Watanabe, international trade and
industry minister, said Japan would probably have to set import targets for
US cars and car parts to satisfy American demands, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
The minister was due to appeal to Japan's car industry to boost purchases of
US cars and components. 'I must ask for your co-operation to make (Mr
Bush's) visit a suc-cess,' he told industry officials.
Car trade friction and Japan's trade surplus with the US will be high on Mr
Bush's agenda. Japan's big carmakers plan to boost purchases of foreign-made
cars, but some say there are limits to what they can do. Toyota and Nissan
said yesterday they might boost imports further. Sales of US-made vehicles
in Japan for January-November 1991 totalled 27,754, out of 180,852 imported
vehicles sold there in the same 11 months.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Call to save US motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US vehicle industry is dying and needs government help to survive,
according to a new report by the Economic Strategy Institute, a
Washington-based think tank.
'Detroit is basically going out of business and is being displaced by Japan.
When the auto industry goes down the tubes, so do a lot of other American
industries,' said Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department official
under the Reagan administration and institute president.
The call for government intervention came on the eve of President George
Bush's arrival in Japan. The president has taken with him the heads of
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in an attempt to persuade Japan to ease
market access for US cars and to persuade voters that he cares about the US
recession.
US carmakers suffered one of their worst years in 1991. The big three lost
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) between them in the first nine months, and last
month GM said it would close 21 plants and cut 74,000 jobs. Ford yesterday
said it sold only 2.87m cars and trucks last year, down 14 per cent from
1990.
The report says US carmakers have improved quality and efficiency but still
suffer a cost disadvantage of Dollars 1,481 a car against Japanese
competitors because of differences between the two economies.
Around Dollars 505 of this difference comes from the cost of health care,
usually borne by the employer in the US but is covered by the state in
Japan. Organisational costs, including pension plans, contribute Dollars
660, and labour costs are Dollars 316 per car higher in the US.
The report says the US government should give an income tax credit to people
who buy US-built cars this year, and should use Dollars 2bn of military
research money to provide low-interest loans to the car industry for
research into energy conservation, safety and pollution control.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Kuwait defence spending likely to jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT's long delayed first budget since the Gulf war is expected to allow
for a steep rise in defence spending to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) from
Dollars 1.55bn in the last budget and an outlay of more than Dollars 10bn on
war-related expenses.
The figures, disclosed in the Middle East Economic Survey (Mees), are in a
planned budget that covers the year from July 1 last year. They were delayed
because of post-war disarray among Kuwait's government departments.
The planned budget is being reviewed by committees of the National Council,
the emirate's interim and purely advisory assembly, before publication in
its final form, which diplomats expect early next month.
The present draft projects an overall 67 per cent rise in government
spending for the year to Dollars 20.99bn, according to Mees.
Revenues are expected to reach Dollars 3bn, mostly from oil sales as output
is planned to accelerate towards pre-war levels of 1.5m barrels a day by the
end of this calendar year.
Part of the remaining deficit will be made up by income from Kuwait's
overseas investments, though no estimates for these are disclosed in the
plan.
Before the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, investment income on Kuwait's
estimated Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn overseas assets often exceeded
incomes from oil. However, Kuwaiti economists estimate that Gulf war costs
may have run these assets down to less than Dollars 50bn.
Extraordinary, non-recurring costs related to the war are put at Dollars
10.28bn in the present budget draft - including Dollars 7.31bn in payments
to Desert Storm allies and Dollars 1.34bn to pay for a write-off of consumer
loans to Kuwaiti citizens.
This spending, on top of the likely deficit for the present fiscal year and
estimates which put the cost of restoring oil production and refining
capacity at Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn over the next three years, may force
Kuwait to return to international markets for finance.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Beijing reformers keep anxious eye on Moscow: How China,
like Russia and Ukraine, is facing some difficult economic choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is anxiously watching reaction in Russia and Ukraine to the shock
therapy of freeing prices from state control, one of the main pillars of
centralised communist economic planning.
There has been little official comment here but media coverage has
emphasised Moscow's empty shelves and desperate queues, contrasting them
with reports of mid-winter plenty in Beijing and images of the city's
well-stocked stores and street stalls.
Fear of civil unrest in the old Soviet empire spilling over its borders is a
major worry for China, which has hastened to establish diplomatic relations
with Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Tajikistan. Full diplomatic
relations with Kirgizia were established on Sunday, giving it formal ties
with all the former Soviet republics on China's border.
However, Beijing's concerns go beyond that. Economic reformers in the
government are uncomfortably aware of the need to bite harder on the bullet
of economic reform and so run the risk themselves of adverse reaction and
civil unrest.
Economic reform in China has gone much further than under the communists in
the old Soviet Union, especially in the agricultural sector. Moscow is only
now putting forward serious proposals to give Russian farmers freedom to
work the land for themselves and the incentive of private profit, while
China ended the collectivisation of agriculture some 10 years ago.
Freed to work their own piece of land and eager to get rich, the peasants
ensured that food flowed on to the market in sufficient quantities to keep
the gap between free market prices and state prices narrow. There was little
opportunity for black-marketeers to buy out state stocks to resell at
outrageously inflated prices on the free market, as has happened in Russia
and Ukraine.
More than 52 per cent of prices for Chinese farm produce are now market
regulated. Even prices for grain and edible oil, heavily subsidised by the
state, have been raised. Fears that the move would bring civil unrest proved
groundless but further cuts in subsidies, on housing as well as staple
foods, could mean trouble.
The official news agency, Xinhua, argued recently that prices should reflect
market supply and demand. Price stability did not mean prices would never
change and people were beginning to accept that, the agency claimed.
Paradoxically the privatisation of state-run agriculture, by boosting food
supplies has helped shore up communist power.
By contrast the state-run industrial sector, the backbone of China's
socialist system, is in a parlous state. It cries out for reform decisions
as drastic, and as risky, as those just taken in Moscow and Kiev.
Government officials here make no secret of the desperate state of the bulk
of China's 10,000 state-owned industrial enterprises. Heavily overmanned and
producing goods no-one wants to buy, they have built up huge stockpiles and
massive debts. Every year they eat up billions of dollars in state subsidies
 -more than goes to education or the military. One third of them are losing
money.
Communist party leader, Jiang Zemin, said recently the revival of the state
sector was vital economically and to the 'status of the public ownership
economy and the solidity of the entire socialist system.'
Some economists say the patient is so sick there is no hope of recovery.
Last year for the first time in more than 40 years, less than half
industrial output (45.6 per cent) came from the state sector.
Kickbacks, malpractice, corruption, embezzlement, expensive favours to
retired cadres and lavish wining and dining by those still in the job,
compound hefty losses.
The semi-official China News Service candidly reported no lack of criminal
cases of swindling public institutions out of several hundred thousand or
even several million yuan.
To talk of reforming this rotting system, the main source of state financial
revenues and the biggest employer of industrial labour, is one thing.
Implementing reform is another, very risky business.
State industrial workers enjoy lifetime employment. Housing, free health
care, kindergartens, schools, leisure facilities and subsidised rice all
come with the job. Profits and productivity come second to basic welfare, in
a system designed to ensure quiescent workers and political stability.
Beijing wants every province in China to commit itself to closing 10 of its
large, loss-making operations. No province has yet complied, fearing factory
closures will lead to unrest from laid-off workers.
Bankruptcy was first allowed by law in China in 1988, but it has so far
taken its toll of only a handful of small collectives. Some provinces are
experimenting with giving enterprises hire and fire rights. In some cases
the state is guaranteeing to buy only half a factory's output or supply half
its raw material, leaving the management to fight for a place in the market
by making goods which will sell, or go under.
If the state sector continues to ail while private business continues to
prosper and grow, what will remain of socialism in China? Like Russia and
Ukraine, China is also faced with a choice: economic growth or continued
subsidies to a bankrupt and unworkable system.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Indonesia seeks large rise in tax revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE BOLDERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 will rely on a big
rise in tax revenues to fund an 11 per cent increase in spending.
President Suharto, in his budget speech to parliament yesterday, announced a
drive to improve tax collection. 'The public must become even more aware of
their duty to pay tax. The number of taxpayers must be constantly increased,
the tax administration and collection must continuously be improved,' he
said.
Development projects, which will comprise nearly 41 per cent of spending,
will especially involve the improvement of Indonesia's weak infrastructure,
particularly the road, communications and electricity sectors.
Revenue from income tax is projected to increase by 36.3 per cent while
revenue from value-added tax will increase by 34 per cent. Growth in non-oil
exports is also projected to contribute to the growth in revenues. A
domestic fuel subsidy is being eliminated.
Revenues and expenditure in the 1992-93 budget, which by law has to balance,
are to increase by 11 per cent to Dollars 28.9bn. The budget shows a growing
reliance on domestic income as Jakarta tries to move away from dependence on
foreign aid. The budget assumes a 7.4 per cent drop in foreign aid to
Dollars 4.9bn.
President Suharto said that Indonesia would continue to use available
foreign aid to accelerate development but that 'the key remains in our own
hands, namely to discover and develop domestic resources for development.'
Sectors other than oil and gas are projected to supply nearly 70 per cent of
domestic revenues, or Dollars 16.3bn, an increase of more than 29 per cent
over the current fiscal year while revenues from oil and gas will contribute
Dollars 6.9bn based on a projected average oil price of Dollars 17 per
barrel.
The budget projects total exports rising by 8.8 per cent. Inflation for the
1992-93 year is put at 8 per cent compared with an official level of 9.52
per cent in 1991-2. GDP growth is estimated both for the current fiscal year
and for the next at 6 per cent, a slight drop from rates of more than 7 per
cent in the two previous years.

FT  07 JAN 92 / North Korea takes steps to ease nuclear tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH Korea yesterday told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it
would sign a nuclear safeguards agreement this month, clearing the way for a
significant reduction in tension on the Korean peninsula.
Signature of the safeguards accord would involve opening nuclear facilities
to inspection by IAEA experts.
Earlier yesterday, demands for international inspections had been repeated
in Seoul by US President George Bush, who said the US and South Korea would
call off annual military exercises if Pyongyang took positive steps on the
issue.
Mr Bush, on the third leg of an Asia-Pacific tour which will end in Japan,
where he arrives today, also emphasised the endurance of the US security
commitment to South Korea and the Asia Pacific region.
A statement from the IAEA in Vienna said Mr Chon In-chan, North Korea's
ambassador to Austria, 'today informed the director general of the IAEA that
his government will sign the Safeguards Agreement . . . pursuant to its
obligation under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.'
He said the agreement would be signed before the end of January and that
early ratification of the agreement would follow.
South Korea and the US believe North Korea is developing nuclear weapons.
This is denied by Pyongyang. Belief that a nuclear bomb could be built at a
plant at Yongbyon, 100km north of Pyongyang, within two years - far sooner
than was previously thought possible - has made the issue a top priority for
the western governments in recent months.
South and North Korea last month signed a pact of reconciliation and
non-aggression after 40 years of Cold War hostility. Seoul wanted the
nuclear issue settled before both prime ministers meet in Pyongyang next
month to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons from the peninsula.
The US has withdrawn all battlefield nuclear weapons from South Korea, but
has said it will not withdraw some of the 40,000 US troops stationed there
until North Korea ratifies the IAEA pact.
Mr Bush reaffirmed his administration's commitment to the security of South
Korea. He congratulated Mr Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean president, for the
progress which has been made in easing tensions with Pyongyang.
He said that while the emerging post-cold war era presented an opportunity
for the US to restructure its defences, such as the closure of US bases in
the Philippines, the US would remain 'a visible, credible security presence
in the Asia Pacific region'.
President George Bush yesterday called on South Korea to remove all
non-tariff barriers to trade and liberalise its financial system, saying
that doing business in Korea is still more difficult than it should be, John
Ridding writes.
Trade liberalisation has been a principal objective of Mr Bush's
Asia-Pacific tour.
He said Korea had made 'great progress in removing visible trade barriers
over the last five years.' However there were still 'fundamental problems
that stifle the ability of foreign firms to compete in Korea.'
Mr Bush cited 'cumbersome customs procedures' and 'unjustified standards and
regulations' as some of the difficulties facing US exporters.
He also urged Korea's co-operation in the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks. Korea's refusal to allow rice imports has been one of the obstacles
to a successful conclusion of the negotiations.
Anti-riot police stopped farmers from marching to parliament to protest at
US pressure to open rice markets. The scattered protests were among several
by students, farmers and dissidents demanding that Washington end pressure
on Seoul to improve trade.

<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S Foreign Ministry said yesterday that there was no truth in British
press reports that Iraq had supplied either experts or nuclear materials to
help Algeria build a military nuclear reactor.
Algeria said it had decided to submit both its nuclear reactors - at Draria
and at Ain Oussera - to the control of the International Atomic Energy
Agency in Vienna.
Mr Lakdar Brahimi, Algerian minister of foreign affairs, said yesterday: 'As
far as I know the agency is 100 per cent satisfied with the arrangements
that have been or are in the process of being made.'
Britain yesterday urged Algeria to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, but a British official refused to confirm the report in the Sunday
Times.
'We look to Algeria to abide by this undertaking and invite the IAEA
(International Atomic Energy Agency) as soon as possible' to inspect the
plant, a British official said.
He said China, which is helping Algeria to build the reactor, had given
similar assurances.
'We also note Algeria's affirmation of a commitment to nuclear
non-proliferation and we urge her to formalise this commitment by acceding
to the NPT,' the official said.
Meanwhile, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, Algeria's prime minister, acknowledged
yesterday that last month's vote for the radical Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) reflected the population's 'profound despair'. Breaking a 10-day
silence, Mr Ghozali told Algerian journalists that despite his government's
best efforts, the elections had not been as fair as he had hoped.
Mr Abdelkader Hachani, provisional leader of the FIS, which won 47.3 per
cent of votes in the first round of polling on December 26, said that most
cases of alleged fraud sent to the Constitutional Council were 'completely
without foundation'.
'Other extremist parties which have been rejected by the people are trying
to manipulate the media in order to frighten off these people from the
choice of an Islamic state,' he said.
Observers say that complaints of cheating will make little difference to the
commanding lead seized by the fundamentalists in the first round of voting.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Hong Kong sees record container throughput
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S container port handled more than 6m TEUs - or twenty-foot
equivalent units - for the first time last year and total cargo throughput
exceeded 100m tonnes also for the first time.
Container traffic increased 21.7 per cent to about 6.2m TEUs, according to
provisional figures from the Hong Kong government. Singapore, which overtook
Hong Kong as the world's busiest container port in 1990, is expected to
announce even higher throughput figures later this year.
Hong Kong's increase is largely a result of exports from southern China.
Hong Kong manufacturers have shifted production across the border into China
for cheaper land and wages. Southern China's economy has also expanded
rapidly, despite an austerity programme launched in 1988.
'China trade has been steaming ahead at a greater rate than anyone could
have forecast two to three years ago,' said Mr Ian Dale, assistant director
of marine planning.
Hong Kong's rate of increase, which exceeded government five-year forecasts,
will add urgency to plans for the colony's ninth container terminal, due to
become operational in 1995. The site for the terminal has been criticised by
environmental groups.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Tokyo begins improving ties with Hanoi

<TEXT>
JAPAN HAS taken an important step towards improving relations with Vietnam
by announcing a government mission to Hanoi to negotiate the repayment of
loans that have not been serviced for over a decade.
The Japanese government regards the visit this weekend as a sign that it is
prepared to develop a foreign policy independent of Washington. The US is
unwilling to lift an embargo on Vietnam that has limited the country's
access to foreign aid and investment.
Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, indicated that the dispatch of
the 10-member delegation, including representatives of the Trade Ministry,
the Finance Ministry, and the Economic Planning Agency, was likely to be
followed by another mission which will assess projects for possible
financial assistance.
While Japan is keen to develop a stronger political presence in Vietnam and
Cambodia, a Foreign Ministry official indicated that Washington had been
consulted before taking the decision to send the delegation. The official
said the US did not oppose a 'step by step' improvement in ties between
Tokyo and Hanoi.
The delegation, which will spend nine days in Vietnam, is to negotiate the
settlement of arrears on Japanese government loans totalling Y28bn (Pounds
120m). Repayments were stopped after Japan and other countries suspended
economic aid to Vietnam after its invasion of Cambodia in late 1978.
An expected settlement of the debt question and the likelihood of government
assistance resuming in the near future will encourage Japanese companies to
increase their exposure in Vietnam. Until now, they have been wary of large
investments for fear of a negative reaction in the US, where the issue of
Vietnam war servicemen missing in action remains sensitive.
Japanese investment in Vietnam has accounted for about 8.6 per cent of the
total Dollars 1.06bn (Pounds 580m) pledged by foreign partners, while
Taiwanese investment is about 14 per cent of the total and French capital
13.8 per cent.
Mr Watanabe, who has taken a personal interest in improving relations with
Vietnam, said that fresh Japanese government money could begin flowing into
the country within a year. New lending by the World Bank and other agencies
is likely to follow the lifting of the US embargo.

FT  07 JAN 92 / New Zealand intervenes to prop up its currency
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday intervened to stop a sharp decline in
the value of the New Zealand dollar which has fallen by 4 per cent in the
past three weeks to trade at record lows against its trade-weighted index.
A formal statement from the central bank expressed alarm at the falling
value of the currency which it said would push domestic inflation to 3.5 per
cent by the end of the year.
The bank operates under an act of parliament which places it in charge of
monetary policy, with the aim of achieving nil to 2 per cent inflation by
1993.
The statement, with its underlying threat to tighten monetary policy if the
dollar continued to fall, appeared to do the trick, with the currency moving
into what is regarded by the Bank as an acceptable level of 54.7 US cents
compared with 52.7 US cents on Friday.
The bank was reported to be pleased with the movement, as it was keen to
avert a politically unpopular tightening of monetary policy.
The Reserve Bank was instrumental in the currency's slide when it released
official forecasts before Christmas which said inflation would be at the
lower end of its target range of between 1.5 and 3.5 per cent, which would
allow some easing of the exchange rate. It is believed the bank will not
intervene if the currency stays above 53 US cents on the trade-weighted
index.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA and Denmark have signed an investment protection and promotion
agreement, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
The pact would give investments involving the two countries some protection
against nationalisation and expropriation, with adequate compensation should
either occur, Ms Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's international trade and industry
minister, said.
'The Malaysian government recognises the importance of providing such
protection in its efforts to promote foreign direct investment,' the
minister added.
Malaysia had approved 16 Danish manufacturing projects worth Dollars 83.6m
(Pounds 45.9m) between 1987 and November 1991, compared with 14 totalling
Dollars 6.3m between 1980 and 1986.
Danish investment in Malaysian manufacturing had stayed relatively small,
but interest had 'shown a favourable trend'.
Danish-linked manufacturing projects approved since 1981 had been mainly in
the food, beverage and chemicals sectors.

DAEWOO Corp's construction division has received a contract for a Dollars
957m (Pounds 525.8m) highway project in Pakistan, the company says, AP-DJ
reports from Seoul.
The contract, awarded by Pakistan's National Highway Authority, is for a
204-mile road linking Islamabad and Lahore.
The project includes building 74 bridges. Daewoo will handle design, detail
engineering, procurement and construction, with the design fee totalling
Dollars 9m.
Daewoo says the contract is the biggest international road contract awarded
by Pakistan. Construction is scheduled to be completed by April 1995.
South Korea won Pounds 1.7bn worth of foreign construction orders last year,
up 42 per cent from the previous 12 months, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
The Overseas Construction Association of Korea, a private group of
contractors, said contracts in south-east Asia topped the list, followed by
the Middle East, North America and Africa. Projects under negotiation this
year included a Dollars 1.8bn power plant in Libya.

FT  07 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Aero-engine makers rev up for new era -
The pressures which may force three traditional rivals to collaborate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BIG sign greets the visitor in the modern Cincinnati office block where
General Electric is developing its Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) GE90 large
commercial jet engine. 'We are truly launched with British Airways.
Congratulations GE90 team,' it says of the controversial deal the US company
won last summer against Rolls-Royce to supply its new engines for BA's fleet
of Boeing 777 airliners.
The engine order, coupled with BA's simultaneous decision to sell its
Cardiff engine overhaul plant for Pounds 272m to the American company, was
seen by many as GE's revenge on Rolls-Royce for withdrawing seven years ago
from a commercial aero-engine partnership with GE.
However, Mr Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aircraft engine operations, was not
exultant. If anything, he felt depressed. 'You've come on a bad day. We are
laying off 1,500 of our people,' he said.
Even by its own cut-throat standards, the aero-engine industry has been
going through a particularly rough patch during the past few months. The
decline of military sales in the post-cold-war defence market and the
lingering recession in civil aviation have had devastating effects on all
engine manufacturers.
GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce have all been forced to undertake
sweeping restructuring programmes. To win new engine orders in the current
depressed market, the three rival companies have had to make hefty
concessions and offer enlightened terms to attract customers.
'We must stop killing ourselves with our crazy pricing structure,' Mr Rowe
said. 'We are not only having to give away new engines but we are now having
to make deals with airlines on spare parts. That's how tough it is.'
Commercial engine manufacturers have traditionally relied on spare parts to
produce a significant portion of their revenues and profits.
During the past few months, even small orders have provoked big battles.
Some have ended in court. When Malev, the Hungarian airline, cancelled a
Pratt &amp; Whitney engine order for GE engines to power two Boeing aircraft,
Pratt took legal action. But BA's decision to buy GE, rather than
Rolls-Royce engines, and select Boeing rather than European Airbus airliners
provoked the biggest storm of all.
Although an engine alone has never sold an airliner, an engine deal can tip
the scales in an aircraft competition. Engine manufacturers work closely
with airframe makers to develop power plants for new aircraft. But it is
difficult for them to remain neutral when they are offering engines on rival
airframes.
The combined pressures of the market and Airbus's frustrations over its
repeated failure to win an order from BA prompted Mr Jean Pierson, the
Airbus chairman, to attack the BA deal with Boeing and GE. Alleging BA had
favoured the American companies over its European competitors, Mr Pierson
asked the European Commission to investigate possible breaches in EC
competition rules. But after discussions with the Commission, Airbus last
month decided not to file a formal complaint. BA, Boeing and GE all rejected
allegations of foul play.
Mr Rowe said recent engine orders, including the BA fracas, showed there
were no captive markets for manufacturers. 'After the BA order we thought we
would get the GE90 on the new Boeing 777s of All Nippon Airways, one of our
good customers. But we are still trying to understand why they chose Pratt
instead,' he said. Rolls-Royce also struck back against GE last month when
it clinched a Dollars 500m order from Emirates for Trent engines.
Powering the new generation of wide-body aircraft has now become the focus
of a three-cornered battle between GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce.
To reduce the financial risks of developing new heavy-thrust engines, all
three engine makother companies as risk-sharing partners or subcontractors.
But the pressures facing the three leading players are now expected to force
even broader collaboration. Some industry experts have suggested that three
big engine makers were too many for the market to sustain.
Mr Rowe disagreed. 'There's got to be competition but I don't see why
anybody should die. It's stupid to believe the British are going to give up
on Rolls-Royce. There are various ways of working together and we will have
to work out some solution to stop shooting ourselves,' he said.
At the end of the day, the industry could not continue pricing itself out of
business. It would have to find a new 'modus vivendi' if it was to remain
viable, Mr Rowe argued. There was no need for any of the big companies to
disappear, but there was also no need for more than two engines in any given
thrust size to compete on any aircraft, instead of three as is the case on
many airliners today.
Mr Rowe felt co-operation between companies would have to increase, although
this was likely to lead to changes in the existing pattern of alliances in
the industry. This could eventually lead to renewed co-operation between GE
and Rolls-Royce. 'The door remains open for Rolls,' Mr Rowe said.
Rolls-Royce will offer its Tay 670 engine to power the new McDonnell Douglas
MD-95 twin engine airliner. This follows an agreement between the UK engine
maker and the US aerospace group, writes Paul Betts.
The new Tay 18,000lb thrust engine is expected to be certified in 1994 while
the new 105 seater MD-95 is due to enter service in early 1996. McDonnell
Douglas announced last year that the MD-95 would be assembled in China in
conjunction with MD-90 co-production for the Chinese Trunkliner aircraft.
China is currently in negotiations with the US aircraft manufacturer on the
Trunkliner programme.
Rolls-Royce also said yesterday it had reached agreement with Textron
Lycoming, the US engine company, to take part in the Tay 670 programme as a
sub-contractor. The recently established BMW/Rolls-Royce joint venture as
well as Volvo of Sweden are also partners in the Tay 670 programme.

FT  07 JAN 92 / German parties' asylum deal faltering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S four leading parties have called new talks tomorrow to deal with
the soaring numbers of asylum-seekers in the country, amid signs that their
previous compromise is falling apart, Quentin Peel writes from Bonn.
The issue threatens once again to explode politically, after an arson attack
on a refugee hostel in the Black Forest on Sunday left a Lebanese immigrant
critically ill.
At the same time, publication of statistics for 1991 showed the number of
asylum-seekers in Germany reached 256,112, almost 33 per cent higher than a
year earlier.
The latest talks between the ruling coalition and the opposition Social
Democrats (SPD) come amid reports that their previous agreement, to protect
refugees by gathering them in big camps and to speed procedures for dealing
with asylum claims, cannot be put into effect for months, if at all.
The Christian Democrats (CDU), senior partners in the ruling coalition,
maintain the vast majority of asylum-seekers are, in reality, economic
migrants seeking work. They want an amendment to the German constitution to
allow immigration officials to stop such applicants at the border and send
them home.
The SPD and the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition reject changes in the
constitution as too drastic and insist the problem can be dealt with by
improving procedures to process asylum-seekers.
Only one state - Baden-Wurttemberg - has adequate capacity to house refugees
in the proposed 'collection camps', according to a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry.
The asylum issue remains acutely sensitive at a time of rising discontent
over higher taxes to pay for German unification, and the inflow of
immigrants of both German and non-German origin.
The latest attack was on a hostel housing some 40 refugees at Waldkirch in
Breisgau, near Freiburg in the country's prosperous south-west.
Yesterday saw a spontaneous demonstration by about 400 people in Waldkirch,
protesting against 'hostility to foreigners'.
Publication of the latest asylum statistics seems certain to heighten
debate, however. They show that almost 77 per cent of applications were
rejected as unfounded, 16 per cent more were withdrawn, and only 6.9 per
cent were deemed to be genuine cases for political asylum under Germany's
liberal laws.
Of the total, 74,854 came from Yugoslavia, 40,504 from Romania, 23,877 from
Turkey and 12,056 from Bulgaria.

FT  07 JAN 92 / French Socialists dig in for presidential fight: Party
barons are manoeuvring for position in the 1995 election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE departure of Mr Pierre Mauroy as first secretary of the French Socialist
party is likely to prove the penultimate move in a power struggle between
party barons to decide who will be the Socialist candidate in the 1995
presidential elections.
Mr Mauroy will tell the executive bureau of the party this morning that he
is resigning after three-and-a-half years in the job. Why he is resigning is
unclear.
When news of Mr Mauroy's decision broke last Saturday it was widely assumed
he would press the candidacy of Mr Michel Delebarre, the 45-year-old urban
development minister and mayor of Dunkirk, who was for many years one of Mr
Mauroy's closest associates in his town hall fiefdom in Lille.
The job was not Mr Mauroy's to give, of course. The choice will be made,
probably before the end of this week, by the 131-strong governing committee
of the party.
Since membership reflects the numerical strength of the rival factions in
the party, the vote should give a strong indication of the internal bargains
being made by the barons.
By yesterday evening it seemed they had indeed made their bargains when it
became clear Mr Mauroy would not be endorsing Mr Delebarre, but rather Mr
Laurent Fabius, the 45-year-old speaker of the National Assembly and former
prime minister. Later Mr Delebarre formally announced he would not be a
candidate.
The reason for the shift from Mr Delebarre is that Mr Michel Rocard, former
prime minister and long a fancied contender in a future presidential race,
had undertaken to back Mr Fabius.
On the face of it a Rocard-Fabius alliance looks an unlikely pact of two
ambitious rivals between whom there is no love lost. The explanation is not
that Mr Rocard has discovered a sudden affinity for Mr Fabius, but that he
was determined to keep Mr Delebarre out.
He suspects Mr Delebarre of being a covert supporter of a rival whom he
fears far more than Mr Fabius; that is Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, who has recently soared higher than Mr Rocard in the
opinion polls and who is widely discussed as a future star of the French
political scene.
Not only does Mr Delors enjoy enormous prestige, he is untouched by the
stain of corruption and general discredit which affects most of the French
political establishment. The prime reason for this is that he has been away
from French politics since 1985. Although he is a member of the Socialist
party governing committee, he is not the leader of a faction and he does not
command campaigning power or bargaining leverage.
In recent months Mr Delors has been assiduous in maintaining a prominent
political profile in France, as a way of maximising his appeal in the minds
of the party's king-makers.
On Sunday, for example, he was the star guest in the prestige personality
television show L'Heure de Verite, and he took advantage of the occasion to
make statesmanlike pronouncements on French policy issues - from the future
of the nuclear bomb to economic reform.
The significance of his statements should not be misinterpreted, however.
The fact that Mr Delors says that French nuclear weapons should eventually
be placed at the service of a common European foreign policy should be set
alongside his other recommendation, that for the time being France should
maintain the independence of its nuclear force.
Mr Delors is not announcing a change in French policy, he is just
advertising his availability.
Being available is one thing; getting adopted is another. One option for him
would be to return fully to French politics as a springboard for a
presidential campaign in 1995.
This was much discussed last autumn, when it was suggested that President
Francois Mitterrand might summon him back to replace Mrs Edith Cresson, the
prime minister whose unpopularity has grown by the month.
The disadvantage of this option is that Mr Delors would risk contamination
without any real prospect of being able to avert heavy defeat for the party
in the 1993 general election.
Since last month's European Community summit at Maastricht, however, Mr
Delors has seemed less tempted by a premature return to France, not least
because his tenure in Brussels could conceivably be extended until the end
of 1994.
But if Mr Delors stays away from France, he can give his candidacy real
credibility only on two conditions: he must appear constantly before the
public, and he must have a friend at the heart of the Socialist party.
Since Mr Delebarre is a member of the traditionalist faction to which Mr
Delors also belongs, but is not himself a plausible presidential candidate,
perhaps he could have been that friend.
If Mr Rocard had wanted to keep out Mr Delebarre he could have done so
without difficulty. The traditionalist faction led by Mr Lionel Jospin,
education minister, in association with Mr Mauroy, has almost 30 per cent of
the votes in the party, but so does the Fabius faction. Mr Rocard's group is
slightly smaller, with nearly 25 per cent.
But he and Mr Fabius between them command a majority of the votes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will have to accept British beef as part of European Community aid if
emergency food deliveries are to continue as planned, European Commission
officials said yesterday, writes our foreign staff.
One official said Russia's rejection of the free UK beef - because of fears
it might be contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad cow
disease' - could have been prompted by rival EC beef producers seeking
orders from the former Soviet republics, which will get EC food credits to
pay for them.
The Commission's agriculture management committee decides tomorrow on aid
deliveries and 'it goes without saying that there will be further
consignments of British beef', a Commission official said.
Britain expressed irritation at the delays in obtaining Russian clearance
for British beef sent as part of EC aid, and a Foreign Office minister
hinted that food aid policy to Russia might have to be reconsidered.
Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said: 'If they are going
to react like this we have lots of other things to do, not only with our
beef but with our time.'
Brussels is concerned that Russia's initial refusal of a 120-tonne
consignment of UK beef could lead to a disastrous new consumer scare over
meat safety. The British beef came from intervention stockpiles, financed by
the EC to keep meat prices up, and last night had arrived in Murmansk, where
it was to be canned.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UN chief wary of big Yugoslav peace force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations is sending 50 military observers to Yugoslavia
immediately to monitor the ceasefire, Mr Boutros Ghali, secretary-general,
said yesterday. In a report to the Security Council, he said he would not
recommend deploying a larger peace-keeping force in Croatia until he
believed Yugoslav leaders had accepted the terms of a broader peace plan.
The terms include withdrawal of the federal army from Croatia, disarming of
Croat and Serb paramilitary units, and creation of three demilitarised areas
into which peace forces would be sent.
The ceasefire forged last Friday by the UN between the army and the Serbian
and Croatian governments appeared to be holding yesterday. But, Serbs in
Krajina, the self-proclaimed republic which forms an enclave in Croatia, are
continuing to reject terms for sending a UN peace-keeping mission. Also,
leaders in the region of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem in eastern
Croatia said yesterday they wanted any UN force to be stationed not in their
territory but deep in territory 'controlled by Croatian paramilitary
forces'.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia yesterday vowed his republic would
regain control of all its territory held by the federal army and Serb
reservists. 'We will not cede one inch of territory,' he told reporters in
Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia who is now in New York,
recommended that Mr Ghali seek Security Council agreement to send observers
as soon as possible to assess the possibility of dispatching a 10,000-member
force.
'This would have an enormous psychological impact,' a western diplomat in
Belgrade said yesterday.
'It might finally stop the fighting. But then the real work - defining
post-Yugoslavia's borders - will begin.'
France said yesterday it was was ready to contribute up to 4,000 troops to
an international peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia.
Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said: 'Whether it is within the framework
of the UN or within that of a European force, we are ready to send between
3,000 and 4,000 men. That would be about a quarter of the total force that
has been mentioned.'
Croat officials are concerned that the international community is making
territorial concessions to Serbia in return for peace, and at Croatia's
expense.
Mr Zdravko Tomac, Croatia's deputy prime minister, warned: 'We are prepared
to continue the war if anybody tries to take an inch of Croatian soil from
us.' A third of Croatia is occupied by the army and Serb forces.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Shevardnadze warns Georgia faces economic catastrophe:
Former Soviet foreign minister refuses to condemn new rulers for using force
to oust President Zviad Gamsakhurdia

<TEXT>
THE FORMER Soviet foreign minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, yesterday called
for national reconciliation in his native republic of Georgia which, he
said, faced catastrophe because its resources were exhausted and its economy
was destroyed. In an interview with the FT he offered his help to build a
democratic society on the rubble left by President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
The man who so frequently warned of impending dictatorship in the former
Soviet Union dismissed suggestions that Georgia's new rulers were tainted by
having used force to oust an elected president, whatever his authoritarian
tendencies.
'It was not so much a violent takeover as a conflict between an
authoritarian regime and democratic forces which were supported by armed
formations,' said the former chief of Soviet diplomacy, losing no time in
trying to boost the tattered image of his southern republic.
The most famous living Georgian has been rootless since his republic
declared independence from the union he served for most of his life. While
he survived as a national politician as long as the Union survived, its
dissolution last month spelt the end for him in Moscow.
He quit Georgia and his job as republican Communist party chief in 1986,
when he became foreign minister - a post in which he helped change the face
of international relations.
One of the rebel leaders yesterday described Mr Shevardnadze, who turns 64
later this month, as an able figure who could help build democracy in
Georgia. He warned, however, that he could not say how people would react to
the return of a man who once embodied Communist dictatorship over Georgia;
Mr Shevardnadze once had Mr Gamsakhurdia jailed for dissent.
However, Georgians know that Mr Shevardnadze - with his competence and
international authority - could bring them the one prize which eluded Mr
Gamsakhurdia: recognition and respectability as an independent state.
Saying that Georgia had 'a lot to do to obtain recognition and join
all-European processes', Mr Shevardnadze also predicted the republic would
soon join the Commonwealth of Independent States spurned by Mr Gamsakhurdia.
The former foreign minister praised Mr Tengiz Sigua, the civilian figurehead
for the rebel movement who has been appointed caretaker prime minister.
FORMER US president Jimmy Carter and former Soviet foreign minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will convene a summit of elder statesmen next week to seek an
end to civil conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Reuter reports
from Atlanta, Georgia.
The 12 leaders of the private International Negotiation Network which Mr
Carter chairs will meet for the first time at his presidential library.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Palestinian expulsions condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL was strongly con-demned last night by the United Nations Security
Council, with the full backing of the US, over its decision to deport 12
Palestinian activists from the occupied territories.
The resolution, backed by all 15 council members, could pave the way for a
resumption of the US-sponsored Middle East peace talks, which had been due
to resume in Washington today. Arab delegations had delayed their arrival to
await the outcome of UN deliberations.
There were indications that Israel saw the UN condemnation of the planned
expulsions as the price it must pay for the resumption of talks.
Mr Yossi Ben Aharon, the senior Israeli negotiator who arrived in Washington
with his team yesterday, said before the vote: 'We have heard from (the
Arabs) they expect some kind of denunciation measure from the Security
Council, and that will be their admission Continued on Page 18
ticket to the talks. It's a pity they are using these tactics.'
As the Security Council prepared to vote, a Palestine Liberation
Organisation official said that the Arab delegations, including the
Palestinians from the occupied territories, would leave for Washington as
soon as the resolution was announced. It requests Israel, as the occupying
power, to ensure the safe and immediate return of deportees. It also
reaffirms the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment
of civilians to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since the
1967 Middle East war.
The council also decided to keep the matter under review, leaving the door
open for further action once the expulsions had occurred.
Israel is considered unlikely to halt the deportations as it has already
rebuffed similar requests by the US.
The latest expulsion orders were retaliation for the killing of a Jewish
settler in the Gaza Strip. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister,
has defended the expulsions as vital to combat terrorism.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Windsor Safari Park calls in receivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THEMES INTERNATIONAL, the pri-vate leisure group which owns Windsor Safari
Park, became the latest casualty of the recession yesterday when it applied
to go into administrative receivership.
The decision, which came as figures were published by accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick showing that more than 4,000 companies went into receivership last
year, was made after several weeks of talks between the group and its main
banker, Royal Bank of Scotland.
The group, which employs about 1,200 people, has also held talks with
possible buyers for its operations.
As well as the 148-acre Windsor Safari Park, one of the UK's most famous
theme parks, the group also owns Hollywood Bowl, which runs 13 bowling
alleys in the UK, the Liberty Street restaurant chain and the Heights night
club group.
Its other interests include Bygone Times, the largest antiques market in
Europe, a string of pubs, a paddle steamer in Rotterdam and other leisure
operations in Spain and the US.
The group encountered difficulties in the past two years as its income
declined and it became steadily dependent on borrowing.
In 1990 it made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m on turnover of Pounds 42.75m.
Cork Gully, the insolvency pract-itioner arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
have been appointed joint administrative receivers.
Mr Chris Barlow and Mr Ian Bond of Cork Gully will be the receivers
responsible for the parent company and Windsor Safari Park, while Mr Barlow
and Mr Mike Moore are responsible for Leisure Times, the subsidiary which
owns the bowling alleys, restaurants and night clubs.
Mr Barlow said he was certain that buyers for the two core business, the
safari park and the bowling alleys, would be found eventually even if the
process took several months.
'Windsor Safari Park is a unique asset because of its location and we are
not in a hurry to sell it,' Mr Barlow said. He added that Mr Ernest Potter,
Themes International chairman, and the other directors were co-operating
fully with the receivers.
Royal Bank declined to indicate the size of its lending to Themes
International, but said it was determined to keep Windsor Safari Park open.
'Customers are not going to be turning up at the park to find either that it
is closed or that the facilities offered are reduced during the period a
buyer is being sought,' the bank said.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Tories warn of big tax rises under Labour: Chancellor
pledges basic rate of 20p in the Pound 'when affordable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tories yesterday launched what amounts to their first pre-election
offensive as Mr John Major was joined by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
in claims that taxes would 'go through the roof' if there were a Labour
government.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, called the assertions absurd.
Mr Lamont reiterated the Tories' pledge to reduce the basic tax rate to 20
pence in the pound. He underlined, however, that the reductions would be
made only when they were 'affordable'.
Speaking in Oxford last night, Mr Major claimed Labour pledges would mean
higher taxes for everyone. The Labour party's promises would mean 'a
whopping tax increase not just for the rich - certainly for the rich - but a
tax increase for each and every taxpayer', he said.
The basic rate of income tax would have to rise 10p in the pound if Labour's
taxation plans were put into effect, he said.
Mr Lamont, using figures drawn from the costings of Labour policies that the
Tories presented in June, said that a taxpayer on Pounds 14,000 would be, on
average, Pounds 1,000 a year worse off under Labour.
But Mr Smith accused the Tories of going for 'the big lie' and warned that
the move was intended to divert attention from the state of the econ-omy.
He attacked the Tory pledge on reducing income tax, saying: 'We do not think
that can be done and also afford the money that needs to be spent on the
health service and education.'
While ministers believe that emphasis on prudent tax cuts is a vote-winner,
a survey for today's Independent newspaper and BBC's Newsnight found that 71
per cent of those asked said they thought the country would gain more from
increasing public spending than from cutting income tax. The NOP poll also
shows that if there are tax cuts, most people would prefer a reduction in
VAT to a cut in the basic rate.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, sought to pre-empt yesterday's onslaught
by insisting at the weekend that 88 per cent of all earners would not suffer
higher taxes under Labour.
The new top rate of income tax at 50 per cent would affect only people
earning 'well over Pounds 30,000', while the removal of the ceiling on
national insurance contributions would apply only to those earning more than
Pounds 20,280 a year. There would be no increase in the basic tax rate of 25
per cent, Mr Kinnock insisted.
While the Tories are keen to emphasise their commitment to being the party
of lower taxation, they are conscious of the need to maintain their
reputation for economic competence.
The Tories' nationwide campaign, on the theme of 'Labour's tax bombshell',
involves more than 1,000 posters. Thousands of leaflets with figures for
claimed tax increases for people on incomes from Pounds 5,000 upwards will
be distributed over the coming weeks.
Mr Lamont said that anyone who did not accept that Labour would have to
increase taxes across the board to pay for its 'wish list' of policy
pledges, was 'living in Cloud Kinnockland'.
The Tories say that, in a year when the Labour programme was being fully
implemented, their plans would cost an extra Pounds 35bn.
The costings assume that Labour's planned tax changes would raise up to
Pounds 10bn and that the remaining Pounds 25bn would have to come from
increasing the standard tax rate from 25 per cent to 35 per cent.
Labour countered that the Tories would increase VAT if they won the
election, drawing the parallel with the increase after their 1979 victory
from 8 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Lamont said he had no plans to raise indirect taxes, and emphasised that
the last 5p reduction in the standard rate of income tax had been achieved
without a corres-ponding shift to indirect taxation.

FT  07 JAN 92 / IRA takes aim at centre of Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONIST MPs and Northern Ireland civic leaders are demanding improved
security following a massive IRA bomb explosion yesterday in Belfast's
commercial centre.
The blast came hours after an earlier powerful explosion had caused millions
of pounds worth of damage.
The two attacks represent a partial reversion to the IRA tactics of the
mid-1970s, when a high-intensity campaign was undertaken against economic
targets.
Meanwhile, the government is stepping up its drive against terrorists who
try to extort money from businesses in the province in an attempt to stem
funding for the IRA.
The initiative is spearheaded by C13, a police squad attached to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, and a new government unit composed of civil servants
with expert knowledge of the taxation and financial systems.
It is estimated that the bill for civilian damage in Northern Ireland during
the past year will be some Pounds 60m. The latest explosions follow a
stepping up of fire-bomb attacks in the province, which can be carried out
by less experienced IRA units.
They also come against a background of successful job creation by the
government, which has moved some Inland Revenue and social security jobs to
the province.
After the latest explosion Mr Richard Needham, Northern Ireland economy
minister, promised to look carefully at 'every conceivable method we can
adopt to ensure we try to keep the bombers out of Belfast city centre'.
But Mr Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said the
government had demonstrated its 'inability to win the war against
terrorism'.
Meanwhile the army admitted last night that 500 extra troops drafted into
Northern Ireland in November to tackle the upsurge in terrorist violence had
been withdrawn.
In Lancashire, police appealed to the public for help to catch an IRA unit
operating in north-west England after the discovery of a 6lb bomb near
Weeton Barracks, Blackpool.
A 43-year-old man was operated on last night after being shot in both legs
in an apparent reprisal shooting in north Belfast.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Barclay brothers buy The European
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European newspaper, founded by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, one of
Britain's most effective self-publicists, has been sold to the Barclay
brothers, two of the country's most publicity-shy businessmen.
Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, the 58-year-old identical twins who own
ships and hotels, yesterday announced the acquisition of their first
newspaper. It is the first significant part of the collapsed Maxwell empire
to be sold by the administrators.
Mr Alan Chamberlain, a director of the brothers' main company, Ellerman
Investments, and the new managing director of The European, said: 'I think
it's a question of timing. It's 1992 and this is an extremely exciting
period for Europe and an exciting period for The European.'
The Barclays' interests range from the Gotaas-Larsen bulk shipping line to
the Howard Hotel in London and the Mirabeau Hotel in Monte Carlo.
In the latest edition of the Sunday Times Book of the Rich, the brothers
rank merely as Super-Rich - taking 18th position with a joint fortune of
Pounds 450m. The edition, published in November, places them a full 10
places behind Mr Maxwell, who was rated as a billionaire worth Pounds 1.2bn.
The brothers are admirers of the weekly newspaper, now selling about 200,000
copies an issue. They were impressed by the commitment of the staff who
produced an issue without pay during the search for a buyer.
They admired Mr Maxwell's vision of a pan-European newspaper and also saw
its acquisition as a good business opportunity. Mr Maxwell invested at least
Pounds 50m in the venture. It is likely that the Barclays paid less than
Pounds 5m and possibly considerably less.
Mr Charles Garside, the new editor of the paper is at present the only
employee. The Barclays' purchase involved the title and equipment, but it is
not yet clear how many journalists will be hired.
The new newspaper owners began their business lives as estate agents, moved
into property, survived the crash of 1973-74 and have in the past owned
breweries.
They evidently plan serious investment in the future of The European. The
aim will be to make the paper more European and less a publication looking
into Europe through British eyes.
This may involve opening a Brussels office and distribution in Scandinavia
and Japan.
Acclaim Entertainment of the US has bought assets from Mirrorsoft, a Maxwell
producer of entertainment software for an undisclosed price.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEFTY premiums in the financial futures market ensured considerable selling
pressure and subsequent volatility yesterday, writes Peter John.
In the cash market, prices were marked up sharply at the opening to catch
any panicky buyers who had missed out on the Christmas holiday rises. As a
result the Footsie future for March delivery jumped some 37 points. This
left it at a 52-point premium to cash and some 24 points above its estimated
fair value.
It was at an ideal level for the arbitrageurs, who moved in and brought the
price and the premium back down. March closed at 2,533, with 8,265 contracts
dealt and the premium reduced to 41 points.
The gap between cash and the Footsie future was also narrowed by a large
trade in the traded options market. One UK investment bank sold 2,000 of the
March 2,400 calls at around 180.
The same house also carried out a large 'buy-write' trade in Cadbury
options, ensuring it was the day's most active stock option with 2,309 lots
dealt. It sold, or wrote, 1,000 May 460 calls at 25 and bought stock in the
market.
The two trades helped total turnover to reach a still uninspiring 24,672
contracts.

SCALLY AND OTHERS v SOUTHERN HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES BOARD AND OTHERS
(FT, October 30)
The plaintiffs, who were medical practitioners employed in the Northern
Ireland Health Service, were required to make contributions to a statutory
superannuation scheme. To qualify for full pension, it was necessary to
complete 40 years' service but they did have the right to purchase 'added
years' - a right which was only exercisable within a stipulated period. The
plaintiffs claimed damages from their employer for failure to bring that
right to their notice.  Upholding the decision of the Northern Ireland Court
of Appeal, the House of Lords stated that it was necessary to imply an
obligation on the employer to bring to his employee's notice the entitlement
and that such an obligation would be implied when: (1) the terms of the
contract of employment had not been negotiated with the individual employee
but resulted from negotiation with a representative body or were otherwise
incorporated by reference; (2) a particular term gave the employee a
valuable right contingent on him taking action to avail himself of its
benefit; (3) the employee could not, in all the circumstances, reasonably be
aware of the term unless drawn to his attention.
PRICE WATERHOUSE v BCCI HOLDINGS (LUXEMBOURG) SA AND OTHERS
(FT, November 1)
Price Waterhouse were appointed members of an investigation committee to
investigate problem loans made by companies in the BCCI group. The Serious
Fraud Office served notice on Price Waterhouse for the production of
specified documents under the Criminal Justice Act 1987 and the Banking Act.
In declaring that Price Waterhouse were not precluded by legal professional
privilege from complying with the notices, Mr Justice Millett stated that
legal professional privilege only attached to documents brought into
existence for the purpose of litigation if that was the dominant purpose.
However, in the instant case, the dominant purpose of the investigation was
to determine the extent to which the problem loans were recoverable which
was quite independent of the possible need to take recovery proceedings.
Moreover, there was an important public interest in the effective regulation
of authorised banking institutions and the Bank of England's power under
section 39 of the Banking Act 1987 to obtain information overrode legal
professional privilege and banking confidentiality.
THE MARE
(FT, November 5)
Smit Internationale NV, together with its interrelated companies had entered
into a policy which included liability for loss or damage to any property in
connection with its activities anywhere in the world. STOS was a joint
venture in which Smit Tak, a subsidiary of Smit Internationale, owned a 49
per cent interest. STOS had removed the wreck of a vessel on order of the
Dubai government and contended that the removal was a liability within the
meaning of policy. Mr Justice Sheen held that STOS had not been under a
legal liability to remove the wreck and, in dismissing an appeal from that
decision, the Court of Appeal stated that the fact that it was called an
umbrella policy and was plainly designed to scoop up liabilities not covered
by the underlying hull, war risks, and P&amp;I policies, did not mean that it
gave STOS protection against all misfortunes not insured elsewhere.
RE BRITISH &amp; COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS PLC
(FT, November 6)
B&amp;C acquired Atlantic Computers plc for Pounds 420m and then put in another
Pounds 117m. B&amp;C went into administration and Atlantic's statement of
affairs showed a deficiency of assets of Pounds 279m. The administrators
applied for an order for production of documents to them under section
23(2)(c) and (3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 and Mr Registrar Scott ordered
S&amp;O, who were Atlantic's auditors, to produce any 'books, papers or other
records in their possession custody or control' having any connection with
the 1987 and 1988 audits of Atlantic, and with the acquisition. Allowing
S&amp;O's appeal, for an order to inspect the administrator's statement filed in
support of the application, the Court of Appeal stated that the order was in
very wide terms. If S&amp;O were not allowed to inspect the statement so that
they could scrutinise the basis on which the order was made and see whether
its width was justified, the court might well be unable fairly to dispose of
their application to have it set aside.
PAN ATLANTIC GROUP INC AND OTHERS v HASSNEH INSURANCE CO OF ISRAEL LTD
(FT, November 8)
A reinsurance contract provided that all disputes were to be submitted to
arbitrators who were to be 'disinterested executive officials of insurance
or reinsurance companies'. Hassneh appointed an arbitrator who was an
executive official of Mercantile and General Insurance Co but he retired
from his position thereafter. The plaintiffs contested the validity of the
appointment on the ground of his retirement. In holding that he was still
qualified to act, both the court of first instance and the Court of Appeal
stated that the qualification requirement related only to date of
appointment.  Otherwise not only would an arbitrator in a long arbitration
be inhibited from voluntary retirement lest that should render the
arbitration null and void, but he would also be placed in an impossible
position should he, for example, reach compulsory retirement age under his
employers' regulations, or be made redundant against his will.
EVIA LUCK
(FT, November 12)
The International Transport Workers' Federation had boarded the vessel Evia
Luck at a Swedish port and had informed the master she would be 'blacked'
unless the owner entered into ITF employment contracts with the crew. The
owners agreed to pay the sums demanded and to sign the required documents.
The owners claimed declarations that they had lawfully avoided all the
contracts on the ground of duress, and claimed restitution of payments. At
first instance, the ITF succeeded in its contention that the relevant system
of law was Swedish law as the law of the country where the pressure was
exerted and, under which, such pressure was lawful. Upholding the Court of
Appeal's decision in favour of the shipowners that the proper law was
English under which a contract induced by duress was voidable, the House of
Lords stated that if a person entered into such a contract, he had for most
purposes to accept the regime of the proper law of the contract; and if
under that regime a particular form of conduct constituted duress, rendering
the contract voidable - wherever the conduct occurred - he had to accept the
consequences.
MERCURY PUBLICITY LTD v WOLFGANG LOERKE GMbH
(FT, November 13)
Mercury, an English company, claimed monies due under a contract for a
commercial agency relationship between it and Loerke, a German company. At
first instance, Mercury's action was struck out under Article 5(1) of the
Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments 1968 on the
ground that the exceptional rule in Ivenel v Schwab (1981) ECR 1981 applied,
namely that in a contract of employment in which one contracting party might
be at a disadvantage to the other, the court would look at the whole
contract and the place where it was substantially to be performed, so as to
ensure that the employee's position was properly protected. Loerke
successfully contended for a wider application of the Ivenel rule to extend
to a 'trade representative'. The Court of Appeal stated that Mercury had
established a case that (a) the contract had established an independent
relationship wholly different from that of employer/employee; (b) the Ivenel
principle in Community law was restricted to cases of a personal nature in
the master/servant relationship; and (c) in the contract's context and
purpose, as well as its execution, the law most closely connected with the
performance of the contract was English law.
RE ARROWS LTD
(FT November 15)
The issue concerned the Serious Fraud Office's right to information that the
liquidators wanted from an insolvent company's officer under section 236 of
the Insolvency Act 1986. The liquidators wanted the court to direct that the
examination would not be disclosed to the SFO. The SFO objected. Finding for
the liquidators, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated that (1) it seemed wrong that
the SFO should in that way be able to circumvent the protection given to the
accused by section 2(8) that a statement might not be used in evidence
against the examinee except inter alia in a prosecution for knowingly giving
false information; and (2) unless the direction was given, the probability
was that the examination would produce no useful inf ormation for the
liquidators or the SFO. The balance came down clearly in favour of the
direction being given and the SFO had nothing to lose.

FT  07 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profits taken as turnover improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVERSAL of nearly 50 Footsie points during yesterday's equity session in
London indicated the market's vulnerability to profit-taking after its sharp
advance over Christmas. Wall Street performed steadily, and sterling was
only slightly lower against the German D-Mark. But an early gain of 36 on
the FT-SE Index was transformed into a loss of 10.9 in the face of a further
spate of corporate downgradings by City brokers and a sudden shrinking of
the premium on the Footsie futures contract.
The market opened firmly after weekend press comment had suggested a
slackening in the political tension which has been prompted by Britain's
economic situation. The investment mood was also helped by City forecasts
that UK equities will advance again this year, in spite of the current
uncertainty over the economic and political outlook.
Trading volume returned to more normal levels as Christmas 1991 faded into
memory. The erosion of the premium on the FT-SE March futures contract in
part reflected the success of marketmaking dealers in straightening out
their trading books as they were freed from the straightjackets imposed over
the holiday.
In early deals, the market moved to FT-SE 2,540, helped by the futures
markets and Friday's 29-point gain on Wall Street. But trading then became
markedly two-way, with the institutions willing to take profits on some of
the sectors which had starred in the Christmas advance. Gains were lost, and
with oil shares particularly weak in late trading the Footsie slipped
steadily downwards. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,493.2 for a
decline on the day of 10.9 points.
Seaq volume totalled 492.4m shares against 452m on Friday. Traders
maintained that 'the market did not feel busy' but added that this was
perhaps because business was healthily two-way, with both buyers and sellers
able to transact their business without facing unduly large movements in
share prices.
A leading agency broker downgraded its profit forecasts for two major
sectors; both, the oils and the banks, have been the subject of previous
downgrades within recent weeks. Bank stocks were targeted because of renewed
fears of loan losses in their corporate business, while sharp falls in such
leading oil producers as BP and Shell reflected concern about the impact of
falling demand on the outlook for crude prices.
Second thoughts on the Christmas rally brought falls in several leading
stores as profit-taking was prompted by adverse reports on holiday trading,
which were emphasised by comments on Ratners, the high street retail
jewellery group.
But, in spite of the persistent worries about the outlook for domestic
interest rates should sterling come under pressure within the ERM range,
there was some support yesterday for a number of the construction and
building shares which have suffered so harshly from rate pressures.
Most of the blue chip internationals stood up well to weakness in the US
dollar yesterday. But among the individual stocks to run into profit-takers,
Glaxo, last year's star performer, shaded lower while Wellcome, one of the
more ebullient performers of the Christmas rally, came back smartly.
Eurotunnel units, however, were firmer.

FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei kicks off 1992
with a jump of 3.6 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHER yen, lower bond yields and last week's record-breaking advance on
Wall Street encouraged buyers on the first trading day of this year, and the
Nikkei average soared 3.6 per cent in the half-day session, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 817.41 stronger at 23,801.18 after opening at the day's
low of 23,030.66 and attaining a day's high of 23,801.78 just before the
close.
A total of 180m shares changed hands. Advances overwhelmed declines by 879
to 103 and 81 issues remained unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks climbed 48.75 to 1,763.43 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 6.00 to 1,347.22.
Traders said investors had started to react to positive fundamentals. The
Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate by a half-point to 4.5 per
cent on December 30, the last trading day of 1991.
Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel Pacific, said: 'The rally is a
follow-through from last year as most investors were absent from the market
and were unable to react.' He forecast that the Nikkei average was likely to
reach 25,000 during the next month.
Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, an analyst at Nikko Research Institute, said that
although the index had room to advance, turnover would remain subdued due to
the lack of trading by domestic investors. He added that most domestic
institutions still held losses on investments and would not become active
participants until such holdings were liquidated.
Last year's total turnover on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell to 91.7bn shares, down 23 per cent on the year and the lowest since
1982. Total trading value dropped to Y107,108bn, one-third of that in 1989,
the peak of the bull market, and down 38.7 per cent on the year.
Investors sought interest rate-sensitive shares on hopes of a further
decline in interest rates. The yield on the 129 benchmark bond closed at
5.34 per cent, after falling to 5.32 per cent during the session, the lowest
yield on a benchmark bond since October 1989.
Electric power companies gained, with Tokyo Electric Power moving ahead Y160
to Y3,700, while shipbuilders also advanced. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries climbed Y28 to Y594 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y33 to Y729.
High-technology issues were stronger on bargain hunting in spite of the rise
in the yen against the dollar. Sony surged Y300 to Y4,400 and TDK put on
Y200 to Y4,200.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 718.18 to 24,887.27 on volume of 9.4m
shares. Total turnover for last year on the OSE first section fell 47.7 per
cent from 1990 to Y18,722bn. However, thanks to active futures trading,
turnover for the Nikkei 225 futures soared 35.9 per cent to Y536,725bn last
year.
Roundup
TOKYO'S optimistic start to the year encouraged the rest of the Pacific Rim
yesterday.
SINGAPORE surged on news that the US and Singapore had agreed in principle
to transfer a US naval logistics unit from Subic Bay in the Philippines to
Singapore. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 19.56 or 1.3 per cent to
1,500.45 in turnover of SDollars 135.8m, against a previous SDollars 62.1m.
Shipyards were seen as direct beneficiaries of the US naval unit transfer.
Keppel Corp, Singapore's biggest shipyard, topped the gainers list, rising
40 cents to SDollars 8.55, while foreign shares of the government-backed
Singapore Shipbuilding appreciated 23 cents to SDollars 2.62.
NEW ZEALAND started the new year on a strong note as equities caught up with
the recent surge on international stock markets. The NZSE-40 index reached
an intraday peak of 1,546.91 before easing back to close 31.08 or 2.1 per
cent ahead at 1,535.86. Turnover grew to NZDollars 25.5m from the NZDollars
14.3m of last Tuesday.
AUSTRALIA gained 1.6 per cent in the first half-hour of trading on continued
hopes of an early interest rate cut, but then settled back to close just 0.9
per cent up on disappointing trade data for November. The All Ordinaries
index ended 15.4 ahead at 1,675.1, after touching 1,685.9, in turnover of
ADollars 192m, up from ADollars 115m.
The market was also pulled back by BHP, which rose as high as ADollars 14.20
on news that it would begin oil exploration drilling offshore in southern
Australia, but then receded to leave a net gain of 16 cents at ADollars
14.00.
TAIWAN saw hectic dealing, mostly on international comparisons but also on
speculation that its central bank will lower the rediscount rate by half a
point to 5.75 per cent within the week. The weighted index, which posted a
small gain of 12.30 on Saturday, rose 79.20 or 1.7 per cent to 4,692.17 in
turnover of TDollars 33.9bn, up from TDollars 25.7bn.
HONG KONG registered its first decline in two weeks as the Hang Seng index
eased 0.16 to 4306.97 in turnover up from HKDollars 966m to HKDollars
1.22bn.
Bargain hunting balanced profit-taking on the day, but uncertainty over
Sino-US trade friction continued to dampen sentiment ahead of the bipartite
trade negotiations in Washington on Friday.
SEOUL took a break after its recent rise that was fuelled by active foreign
buying. The composite index was down 0.21 to 650.10 in turnover of
Won440.2bn on the first full trading session this year, compared with
Won229bn in Saturday's half-day trading.
KUALA LUMPUR finished higher after light trading on selective bargain
hunting. The composite index ended 4.35 up at 557.34. Turnover rose to
MDollars 108m from MDollars 76.9m.
BANGKOK's bank shares took the SET index up 7.69 to 719.50 in turnover of
Bt5.04bn, the largest in almost a month, although declines led advances by
almost two-to-one across the board.
The three most active stocks were banks: Bangkok Bank jumped Bt34 to Bt502
in turnover of Bt676m, Thai Farmers Bank Bt32 to Bt466 in Bt433m and Thai
Military Bank Bt16 to Bt326 in Bt425m.
JAKARTA decided that higher tax on corporate bank deposits was good for the
equity market, where the index rose 2.37 to 249.76 in active trade. Volume
was still fairly low at 3.95m shares, against Friday's 3.11m.

FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Thin volume as world follows the Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unanimity with which world equity markets followed the US lead in last
week's rally is reflected in the fact that every single national component
of the FT-Actuaries World Index rose in local currency terms. However, the
increases were often achieved on thin, holiday-week volume.
Wall Street, moving up steadily on the back of the Federal Reserve's
pre-Christmas one-point cut in the discount rate, rose by 3.0 per cent. US
share prices are now 10.4 per cent above the level of a month ago, and 31
per cent higher than they were at the depths of the pre-Gulf war gloom in
early January 1991. Japan moved up in response to a half-point reduction in
the official discount rate on Monday December 30.
The biggest jump came in Finland, one of the worst performers in 1991, where
there was a one-week rise of 7.8 per cent. Other Scandinavian markets showed
mixed results. Share prices in Norway, seriously eroded by banking scandals
in 1991, and by weakness in the shipping and oil markets just before
Christmas, recovered to register the next best rise in Europe. Sweden put in
a below-par performance, with Ericsson, once mightily fancied, still licking
its wounds and brokers recommending sales into the recent bounce in the
shares.
There were strong gains in Australia, up 4.3 per cent as a new team of
Treasury ministers took over the steering of the economy; in Mexico, up 3.5
per cent after the country figured in year-end reviews as the
best-performing bourse of 1991; and in the UK.
Continental Europe lagged behind on aggregate, Wall Street-influenced
bourses in Amsterdam and Zurich outperforming the rest.
The poorest performers were still able to eke out an increase on the week.
South Africa lost its way on weak precious metal prices; and in Malaysia,
the government investment fund, which has been buying recently, was absent
from the market for part of last week.

FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotunnel in focus as CAC 40
meets resistance at 1,800
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES were initially encouraged by Tokyo, but many failed to hold on to
the day's gains. Milan, Madrid, Stockholm, Helsinki and Vienna were closed
for Epiphany, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS continued its New Year rally but the CAC 40 index failed to break
decisively through 1,800. It closed at 1,787.57, up 17.27 but off the day's
high of 1,802.50. Turnover was estimated at just under FFr2b, after Friday's
FFr1.47bn, reflecting the return of fund managers from holiday.
Among the day's most active stocks was the Anglo-French Eurotunnel, which
rose FFr2.25 or 5.6 per cent to FFr42.20 with with 189,050 shares changing
hands. Dealers said the stock jumped on a report in the French newspaper
Agefi that Eurotunnel and TML, the consortium building the tunnel, had
agreed to bury their differences on cost overruns.
Eurotunnel was also buoyed up by reports that it had been fund managers as a
likely outperformer in 1992. Paribas, one of the worst performers on a
two-year view, was also mentioned in the poll, and the stock rose FFr6.50 to
FFr334 in active trading for a gain of 7.8 per cent since January 2.
FRANKFURT could not hold its early gains and the DAX index came back from an
intraday high of 1,613.54 to close 0.30 lower at 1,603.32 after a decline of
0.59 to 652.60 in the FAZ at midsession. Worries that the US rally was
unstable, and domestic economic fears were blamed for the weakness in
sentiment.
Dealers said that selling of DAX index futures, after hopes for a further
DAX rise faded, had also prompted some cash market selling. Volume fell from
DM3.8bn to DM3bn, reflecting the holiday in southern Germany.
Gainers yesterday were mainly second-tier stocks, some after a period of
weakness. Altana, hit later last year by litigation in its baby food
business, recovered DM14.50 to DM579.50; Asko, down on its connections with
the ailing Adia temporary employment group in Switzerland, closed DM6.50
higher at DM616.50.
Among blue chips, the best gain was in the chemicals group, Bayer, up DM3 to
DM287.90 on a large order.
AMSTERDAM ended below the day's best as leading companies issued their
traditional New Year messages. The CBS Tendency Index closed at 113.6, up
0.1 from Friday, but off the intraday high of 114.1.
DAF eased 30 cents to Fl 21.30. After the close the truck manufacturer said
that DAF said that it expected its losses to continue in the first half of
1990. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.70 to Fl 44.00 despite its forecast that 1992 will
be another difficult year.
ZURICH gave up some of its early gains, but the Credit Suisse index still
closed 2.7 higher at 459.6, dealers reporting some buying by London-based
institutional investors.
Trading in blue chips was lively while activity in second-tier shares was
subdued. Activity focused on the industrial sector, Roche certificates
adding SFr30 to SFr2,750 and Ciba-Geigy bearers closing SFr30 firmer at
SFr3,060.
BRUSSELS continued to focus on the retailer Delhaize which rose BFr100 to
BFr8,650 and accounted for one-fifth of the day's turnover of BFr666m. The
Bel-20 index rose 1.43 to 1,104.53.
The travel and tourism company Wagons-Lits, which is now 97 per cent owned
by Accor of France, plunged BFr700 to BFr8,000 ahead of today's suspension
from the forward market today. The stock will still be traded on the cash
market.
OSLO rallied for a fifth day in a row, the all-share index climbing 5.80, or
1.4 per cent to 432.87 although the close was well below the day's high of
437.78. Turnover was about NKr310m.
Pessimism about the Norwegian economy has been toned down and the industry
index, which includes stocks linked to North Sea oil, rose to 8.13 to 700.09
with Hafslund A frees rising by NKr6 to NKr271, and Aker A frees NKr4 better
at NKr69.
ISTANBUL rose by 2 per cent, partly on late demand for companies with high
year-end profit expectations, the market index closing 87.28 higher at
4,410.22.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers' diamond sales hold up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND SALES by the Central Selling Organisation, through which De Beers of
South Africa controls 80 per cent of world rough (uncut) diamond trade, last
year fell by 6 per cent or USDollars 240m from the 1990 level to Dollars
3.927bn.
The CSO said demand for both uncut and polished diamonds was 'flat' for the
whole of last year and no rebound could be expected until 1993.
The sales figures were at the upper end of analysts' expectations -
forecasts ranged between Dollars 3.6bn and Dollars 4bn. Analysts said the
results illustrated how the CSO has been able to sustain the diamond market
in the most dire conditions. In 1991 it had to cope with recession, the Gulf
war and the inability for much of the year of the Indian cutting houses to
pay for diamonds because of their government's foreign exchange
restrictions.
'This is a very good result and will please a lot of people,' said Mr
Vincent Tattersall, analyst with Williams de Broe, stockbrokers. 'The
(diamond) this will give it heart.'
The CSO also reassured traders by saying that its Dollars 5bn five-year deal
to market Soviet rough diamonds would continue with a new partner,
Rosalmazzoloto of Russia. The CSO has also recently concluded new five-year
marketing agreements with Angola, Australia and Botswana.
The organisation will also maintain promotional spending on diamonds at
about Dollars 150m.
'Stocks are not overly high in the major consumer markets which means that,
once a better consumer environment takes shape, increased demand for rough
diamonds should follow,' the CSO stated.
The organisation insisted that the highly-publicised financial problems of
two big jewellery chains, Zales in the US and Ratners of the UK, was
unlikely to make much of a difference to the diamond market 'except for
sentiment'.
The CSO has not increased prices since March 1990 (when they rose by an
average of 5.5 per cent). Against calls for a March increase, the
organisation said yesterday: 'You can only think about price increases when
the market can sustain them - and it does not look that way at the moment.'
In the two biggest retail markets, analysts suggested that destocking by US
retailers had probably ended but Japanese retailers would continue to
destock for three months.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals in price tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRECIOUS METALS prices tumbled yesterday as a wave of selling by fund
managers started in Japan and was carried over to Europe and then New York.
Platinum touched the lowest level for nearly seven years in New York, driven
down by worries about the US economy and the continuing poor prospects for
car sales. About half of the platinum produced is used in automotive
anti-pollution catalysts.
In London platinum closed at Dollars 330.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 6.25
from Friday's close. Sentiment was not helped by news at the weekend that a
strike at Impala's Bakokeng mine in South Africa had ended.
Gold crashed through the psychologically-important Dollars 350 an ounce
level to close in London at Dollars 348.50, down by Dollars 3.65 from
Friday's close and the lowest price since September.
Meanwhile, silver lost 6.5 cents an ounce to close in London at Dollars
3.92.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'The Japanese
came back from holiday and sold gold and platinum. That started the fall.'
He suggested that silver would recover rapidly and help gold prices back up
again. But gold might first retreat to about Dollars 345 an ounce.
He pointed out that yesterday's fall in precious metals prices was 'paper
driven' (or took place because of selling in the futures, not the physical,
market) and therefore should be more easily reversed.
Physical demand for gold remained good in the Far East where the approach of
the Chinese New Year, traditionally a time of buoyant demand for gold, had
seen the premium for tael bars in Hong Kong widen yesterday to Dollars 2 an
ounce from Dollars 1 last week.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Statoil buys 15% of Norwegian
Frigg field licence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday improved its position
for future gas exports to Britain by buying 15 per cent of the Norwegian
part of the Frigg field licence from Elf Aquitaine Norge, the Norwegian unit
of France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine.
However, British Gas has broken off negotiations over buying Norwegian gas
from the mid-1990s because the price was too high.
The Frigg deal, the value of which has not been disclosed, lifts Statoil's
stake in the field's licence to 20 per cent, while reducing Elf's Frigg
shareholding from 41.42 per cent to 26.42 per cent. It covers only the Frigg
field infrastructure and not the few remaining gas reserves.
The Frigg field, one of the oldest producing Norwegian gas fields, began
production in 1977. Last year's production is estimated at 2.4bn cubic
metres, down from a peak of 21.5bn cu m a year in the 1980s. The gas is
forecast to run out between 1993 and 1997.
Statoil said its stake in the field installations would now match more
closely its stake in the Frigg-St Fergus pipeline, the only Norwegian gas
pipeline to Britain, in which it has a 24 per cent share. From 1996
Statoil's stake in the pipeline will rise to 29 per cent under an existing
swap agreement with Elf.
Mr Einar Berg, a Statoil spokesman, said that even when the Frigg field ran
out of gas its installations would continue to serve as an important transit
centre for future Norwegian gas exports to Britain.
Separately, Mr Berg confirmed that British Gas had broken off negotiations
with Gasforhandlingsutvalg (GFU), a three-company consortium headed by
Statoil, which sells gas on Norway's behalf. British Gas had been
negotiating with GFU to purchase 5bn cu m of gas, worth an estimated NKr4bn
(Pounds 355m), annually from 1995. The gas, equivalent to just under 10 per
cent of current UK demand, would have entered Britain through the Frigg-St
Fergus pipeline.
The company was negotiating with Norway to buy gas to replace the Frigg
field's diminishing supplies. The field used to supply 25 per cent of UK
demand, but now only manages eight per cent.
British authorities have yet to ratify a deal agreed last April in which
National Power would buy 2.2bn cu m of Norwegian gas annually for 15 years
from the mid-1990s. The deal - thought to be worth Pounds 150m - is viewed
as a test case for the UK government's policy towards Norwegian gas imports
following its last minute veto of the giant Sleipner deal in 1985.
British authorities maintain that the 1977 Frigg gas treaty will have to be
amended to allow more gas to flow through the Frigg-St Fergus pipeline.
Amendments to the treaty would have to cover issues such as jurisdiction and
approval for gas from new fields to use the pipeline.
Mr Berg said: 'We do not view amendments to the treaty as an obstacle to
approval of the National Power deal or future new exports to Britain. We see
it more as a formality then anything else.'

JAMAICAN PRODUCTION of bauxite (aluminium ore) increased last year by 5.5
per cent to 11.5m tonnes, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute.
Production of alumina (aluminium oxide) was 3.01m tonnes, 5 per cent more
than 1990.
Exports of crude bauxite ore in 1991 reached 4.3m tonnes, 10.25 per cent
more than 1990. That represented a slowdown in the growth of the Jamaican
industry, the world's third largest after Australia's and Guinea's.
In 1990 Jamaica's bauxite ore production increased by 19.8 per cent, while
alumina output grew by 30 per cent.
Mr Dennis Morrison, the institute's director of economics, said the fall in
international aluminium prices had affected Jamaica's earnings from bauxite
and alumina, and that the industry's net earnings in 1991 of Dollars 240
were Dollars 30m less than in 1990.

NICKEL prices touched seven-week highs at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday before meeting profit-taking in after-hours trading. The three
months delivery price peaked at Dollars 7,405 a tonne in thin afternoon
trading as a rise encouraged by short-covering touched off stop-loss buying
orders. Traders noted that sentiment had been changed by Friday's late news
of possible production cuts by Falconbridge of Canada. The profit-taking
trimmed the price back to Dollars 7,385 a tonne at the final kerb close, but
that was still Dollars 157.50 up from Friday's close. Copper prices were in
retreat until the equalling during the afternoon of last May's 1991 lows (in
dollar terms) encouraged support buying. Dealers said Far Eastern buying was
also supportive. At the close the cash position was quoted at Pounds 1,134 a
tonne, down Pounds 16.50 on the day, while the three months delivery
position was at Pounds 1,162.75 a tonne, down Pounds 17. Zinc prices were
also under pressure but, like copper, finished off the bottom. Dealers said
the market again fell prey to long liquidation in fairly brisk afternoon
trade. The cash price, which fell Dollars 26 on Friday, lost another Dollars
28 to close at Dollars 1,117 a tonne, while the three months quotation was
Dollars 19 down at Dollars 1,086.50 a tonne.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Taking
plenty of food for granted - Falling self-sufficiency matters because of the
widening trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE PAYING the equivalent of two months' salary for a couple of
kilograms of fat pork and having to queue for it for up to half a day with
no guarantee that there would be any left when you reached the shop counter.
This is the prospect facing the citizens of Moscow and a great many of the
cities of what used to be the Soviet Union this cold Russian January. It
really makes you appreciate an abundance of food, doesn't it?
Or does it? Apart from a few hiccups with sugar and potatoes in the mid
1970s, British people have not experienced a shortage of any food or drink
since the second world war and the few years of rationing after it. Most of
today's consumers were not even born then so perhaps we have come to take
food for granted.
The level of UK self-sufficiency in food that can be produced in our climate
was about 30 per cent during and just after the war years. Higher yields and
greater farming efficiency raised this figure to nearly 80 per cent by the
early 1980s but it has slipped back since then to between 73 per cent and 75
per cent and the downward trend appears to be continuing.
British self-sufficiency in all foods, including those from warmer climates,
was just 56.4 per cent in 1990, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, so
the country is still heavily dependent on food imports.
But does it matter you may ask. After all, there is plenty of cheap food on
world markets. It might even be cheaper to import it rather than try to grow
it at home. The problem, surely, is food surpluses?
As you would expect, farmers, myself included, believe that it does matter,
and not just because of the effects on our incomes. Indeed the food and
drink sector has become the largest single contributor to the UK's trade
deficit at Pounds 6bn, or 42 per cent of the total. Furthermore, close to 60
per cent of that figure is with northern European nations with climatic
conditions similar to our own. In other words, those imported products could
just as easily have been grown at home.
Even more worrying, for the government as well as for farmers, is that total
food and drink imports into the UK virtually doubled during the decade
1980-90. Moreover, forecasters have predicted that, if the trend is not
halted, by the year 2000 Britain will have a food trade gap with northern
Europe of well over Pounds 4bn.
The reasons for all this are many and varied. They range from accidents of
history to the changing tastes of British consumers returning from holidays
abroad.
On the face of it, Britain benefitted from having its agricultural
revolution in the Middle Ages and developing, thanks to the principal of
primogeniture, an industry composed of yeoman farmers surrounded by broad
acres.
In some parts of Europe the Code Napoleon still dictates that when a farmer
dies his property be divided between his children, leading to the
fragmentation of farms. The practice in Britain, where the eldest son
normally inherits the land, may be seen by second and subsequent children as
unfair but it has allowed efficient-sized holdings to be maintained.
In retrospect, however, the small acreages run by European farmers virtually
forced them to co-operate in order to survive. Some of these
long-established co-operatives, which handle and market almost all of their
members' produce, are now huge and powerful. They are able to accept large
orders for packaged produce amalgamated from their members and to deal on
equal terms with big retailers.
Britain's farmers on the other hand did not see any need to co-operate.
Furthermore, when it was recognised in the depressed 1930s that there was a
need for better organised marketing of farm produce, the solution adopted
was statutory marketing boards, which, by guaranteeing to market their
produce, tended to insulate farmers from the marketplace.
It is hardly surprising therefore that British farmers are poor
co-operators, and that many of their recent efforts to organise have ended
in tears.
Meanwhile the big supermarkets - which are much more significant than in any
other European Community country, claiming over 60 per cent of the food and
drinks market between them - are tempted to buy abroad rather than from
domestic producers, some of whom find it difficult to produce the quality
required in the quantities required.
More recently the system of quotas imposed by the EC has inhibited UK
farmers from increasing production to supply a bigger proportion of the home
market. The EC milk quota, for instance, ensures that although British farms
supply virtually all the milk required for liquid consumption, the UK has to
import 35 per cent of its butter and 36 per cent of its cheese requirements.
Britain's EC sugar quota restricts UK production to just 56 per cent of its
requirements, while co-responsibility levies paid by UK farmers on several
commodities the EC has a surplus in but in which this country is not
self-sufficient, act as a disincentive to production.
The food trade gap could of course be improved by greater exports of UK food
or by successful import substitution, and many individual companies,
together with the promotional organisation Food from Britain, are attempting
both. The problem is lack of resources for advertising.
Food from Britain for instance has a total budget of Pounds 7.7m (compared
with a total UK food industry turnover of about Pounds 40bn) of which Pounds
3.2m comes from the agricultural industry and Pounds 4.5m from the British
government. Similar organisations in France and Germany receive up to 10
times more government aid, as well as matching contributions from farmers.
As Mr Paul Judge, the FFB chairman, told an all-party House of Commons
select committee investigating the food trade gap last month: 'It is hardly
a level playing-field.'
The danger is, if, as a result of ever declining margins, UK food
availability falls back further, big food processors may decide to base
themselves in other EC countries and treat Britain as an offshore island to
be supplied from the mainland. Indeed I understand that Cadbury has already
made such a move and other companies seem set to follow.
The problem hardly compares in magnitude to that facing Muscovites and St
Petersburgers. But at a time when the UK's economy is not exactly booming it
should surely concern the British government that the balance of payments is
being eroded in this way. It certainly concerns me that, at a time when I am
being urged to produce for the market, the market may be going elsewhere.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Pent-up demand released with wave of
new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of Canadian dollar, Ecu and Swiss franc deals led the way yesterday
as pent-up demand from issuers finally brought a wave of new paper on to the
international bond market after the Christmas period. Investors, though,
were generally reported to be waiting on the sidelines rather than rushing
to buy the first new paper on offer.
Credit Local, with a CDollars 500m issue, dominated the Canadian dollar
sector, which has now seen just short of CDollars 1bn of new issues since
the end of last week.
The largest issue yet by a non-Canadian borrower, the deal, brought by
Paribas Capital Markets and Merrill Lynch, was designed to create a large
liquid issue for investors with an appetite for the currency but wary of
taking on additional Canadian credit risk.
The December 1997 maturity was selected to appeal to investors as a long
five-year credit, rather than a longer-dated one, given the steepness of the
yield curve between five and ten years. It was priced at 45 basis points
over the benchmark government 8 1/4 per cent bonds maturing in March 1997 -
or 39 basis points over the yield curve.
The bonds, swapped into sub-Libor floating-rate dollars, were reported to
have met some demand, though coming in the wake of other Canadian dollar
issues, a substantial proportion is said to remain with the managers. The
syndicate is expected to be broken this morning, after selling in the Far
East market.
Paribas repeated the long five-year formula for Swedish National Housing
Finance, though with less success. The CDollars 200m issue, with a coupon of
8 per cent, was reoffered at 99.85, to give a yield of 51 basis points over
the five-year benchmark.
The pricing was generally considered tight, and late in the day the bonds
were quoted on the bid at 10 basis points below their reoffered price.
The third Canadian dollar offering of the day, a CDollars 150m issue from
Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export financing institution, was brought with
a maturity of five years and ten months. The 40 basis point spread over the
five-year benchmark had widened to around 42 basis points in later trading.
All of yesterday's Canadian dollar deals are thought to have been swapped
into floating-rate dollars, leading to some congestion in Canadian/US dollar
swaps, and less opportunity for other issuers to follow, dealers said.
Nonetheless, demand for Canadian dollars could bring further issues from
Canadian borrowers in the days ahead.
By yesterday, the spread over US dollars at the five-year maturity had
narrowed to 132 basis points, the tightest since early November.
Indigestion was also reported for yesterday's Ecu deals, brought by Barclays
de Zoete Wedd (the first Ecu issue lead managed by the British investment
bank) and Credit Suisse First Boston. BZW's Ecu100m issue for Swedish Export
Credit, fully fungible with an existing Ecu400m of bonds due in February
1994, was widely seen as tightly priced - though it was offered at five
basis points above the similar deal from OKB at the end of last week. The
reoffered price of 33 basis points over par compared with a premium of
around 10 basis points on the existing bonds.
CSFB's Ecu200m issue for IBM International Finance, by contrast, was a
classic retail issue: a top blue-chip name offering a yield acknowledged by
the managers to be anything but generous. Selling got off to a slow start
yesterday, as the investors returned from the Christmas and New Year break.
Swiss franc issues for Guinness, BP and Rabobank, totalling SFr400m, and a
Pounds 150m floating rate note from Bristol and West Building Society, added
to the wave of new paper yesterday. With further issues expected today, and
global offering from the World Bank due on Wednesday, investment banks were
yesterday already pondering how to shift what threatened to a be a glut of
new bonds to start the year.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Nymex seeks overnight success
with Access - The race to round-the-clock electronic trading of energy
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NYMEX, the world's largest energy futures market, will this year join the
ranks of exchanges using electronic trading systems.
By doing so, some traders on the New York-based exchange foresee that more
business will be concentrated at Nymex, possibly robbing London's
International Petroleum Exchange of trading volume.
Nymex recently unveiled details of its plan to create a round-the-clock
screen trading system which will be known as Access - standing for American
computerised commodity exchange system and services.
The system has been developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph together
with Task Management, a software company. Among its features will be a
unique risk and credit control check.
Despite the doubts of floor traders who fear they may be gradually replaced
by computer trading, the exchange believes that with 20 per cent of all
world trade devoted to oil and energy, it must increase access to its market
in off hours.
Trading volume at Mymex has risen dramatically over the past five years,
from just 14.7m contracts in 1986 to 42.4m last year. In the first week of
November this year, volume was running somewhat below last year's record
pace at 34.7m contracts.
The jump in trading volume has increasingly brought pressure on the exchange
to provide greater access to its markets. Mr Lou Guttman, Nymex's chairman,
said the exchange believed it had to either extend floor trading hours to
triple shifts or develop a screen trading system.
So more than two years ago Nymex became the first exchange to seriously
consider becoming a partner in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Globex
electronic trading system. 'We knew what our needs were,' said Mr Guttman.
But Nymex officials were much chagrined when the CME suspended talks with
them in 1990 to bring in as a partner the Chicago Board of Trade, the
world's largest futures exchange and the CME's traditional rival.
Instead of waiting for the Chicago exchanges to return to negotiations with
Nymex, the New York exchange decided early last year to cut a path on its
own. It now regards that decision as an especially wise one given the
repeated postponement of Globex.
Nymex intends to have its own Access system up and running by the end of
1992 with contracts listed for crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and
platinum. Current plans are for the system to operate from 5pm to 8am the
next day, New York time. Nymex's normal market hours are from 8.20am to
3.10pm.
Because energy traders will be able to enter or exit the market overnight in
the US, open interest in Nymex contracts, or the number of contracts
outstanding, is expected to increase. And some traders believe that fewer
will resort to London's IPE if they can do all of their business on a
24-hour basis in the US.
Speculators who normally would not wish to hold any position overnight, now
will be able to in the knowledge that if they must unwind their positions
they can do so.
The Access system's special real time credit and risk checking feature will
in addition provide futures commission merchants control that not even
Globex can yet offer. FCMs will be able to set limits by contracts or by a
dollar figure on the customers that clear through them, each of whom will
have a identification number. If that limit should be exceeded, the Access
system will not accept the trade.
This is expected to help eliminate the criticism by FCMs that they will be
disenfranchised by electronic trading systems, said Mr Guttman. It allows
them in essence to be in control of their customer base.
Nymex estimates that if 7,000 to 8,000 contracts are traded per night, it
will break even financially. It would not yet disclose how fees would be set
except to say that these would be 'commensurate with the level of trading
activity and the costs of maintaining the system'.
For the moment, Globex plans a credit control system that entails actions
only after a trade is executed. While this improves the current human
monitoring of trades, it does not offer a pre-order entry screening.
Globex is expected to begin testing at the end of January and officials say
they hope to be able to launch the system by the second quarter of next
year.
But with the rate of postponements of Globex, Access may have a chance to
beat it to the launch pad.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Telebras confident of 15% growth
in profits - A stellar stock market performance by Brazil's state-run
telecommunications company which is expected to be fully privatised by 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE most Brazilian companies are saying their 1991 results will be the
worst in at least a decade, Telebras, the 20 per cent state-owned
telecommunications company, is forecasting a 15 per cent rise in net profits
to over Dollars 700m.
The company has emerged as the clear rising star of Brazil's stock market,
where about 80 per cent of its shares are traded. Foreign interest in
Telebras pushed stock prices up nearly 11 times in dollar terms in 1991.
From 11th place at the beginning of last year, the company has become the
largest publicly-traded group in the country, with a market capitalisation
of about Dollars 46bn, compared with Dollars 15.4bn at the end of 1990.
Telebras also chalked up a stellar performance in the international capital
markets over the past few months, easily raising Dollars 300m in Eurobond
issues.
The group plans to capture another Dollars 1.3bn in 1992 in American
Depository Receipts. Behind the phenomenal rise in Telebras' share price is
the expectation that the group will be fully privatised by 1993.
Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela have already privatised their
telephone systems with notable success. Brazil's constitution currently
prevents such a move, but that may soon change.
Brazilian public opinion and 55 per cent of the country's congressmen are
behind a sell-off. Investor confidence also reflects some more immediate
changes. The company has begun to tackle some chronic problems.
One is a nation-wide shortage of telephone lines. Anyone wanting to sign up
for service has to purchase Dollars 2,000 to Dollars 3,000 of Telebras
stock, and even then faces a two-year wait for installation.
Black market telephone exchanges have sprung up in Brazilian cities, where
buyers pay up to Dollars 10,000 for a telephone line. In 1991, Telebras
inaugurated a record 400,000 lines and began to contract out installation to
private companies.
Mr Jose Ignacio Ferreira, Telebras president, said on completion of a new
telephone system in Minas Gerais by private construction groups: 'We will
not only tolerate private investment (in the sector), we want to attract
it.'
According to new telecommunications rules, the private groups install the
telephone systems at the request of a region or neighbourhood then deliver
the completed system to Telebras for operation.
Mr Delson Siffert, a telecommunications consultant, said: 'The private
sector should be able to cover a lot of the demand for new lines that
Telebras cannot meet.' Private companies have installed major systems in
several Brazilian states, and are also getting involved in the building of
data transmission and mobile telephone networks around the country.
New instalments still fall far short of demand. There is an estimated
backlog of 6m lines in Brazil, and demand is expected to increase by 1m new
lines a year for the next decade.
With an investment budget of Dollars 3.9bn next year, however, compared with
an annual budget of just Dollars 2.5m over the past few years, telephone
installation will continue to accelerate. And with the network expanding
rapidly, the company can look forward to surging revenues from telephone
usage.
The company has also made headway in dealing with another long-term problem
 -low local telephone rates. International telephone calls from Brazil are
among the most expensive in the world, and domestic long-distance calls are
higher-priced than average, but much of the revenue from these services is
used to subsidise local telephone usage.
In 1989, real local telephone rates were just 20 per cent of the level they
were at in the 1970s. Overall tariffs more than doubled in real terms in
1990 and 1991, and should continue to rise in 1992.
Telebras has also managed to improve significantly the quality of its
service. Two years ago, Brazilian callers failed to get a dial tone one out
of every three times they picked up the telephone.
That rate is now just one in seven. The company also managed to reduce its
workforce from 93,000 to less than 90,000 over the past two years. There's
still plenty of room for improvement.
Despite the lay-offs, Telebras is still one of the least efficient companies
in the industry with 99 employees per 10,000 access lines, compared with 88
in Mexico and 93 in Chile. Quality of service is still inferior to
international standards.
Local rates are too low and international rates too high, and the group
still faces an acute shortage of telephone lines.
But the fact that the company is heading in the right direction will
probably assure profit growth for some time to come.
And if Brazil follows the example of its neighbours in privatising the
sector, Telebras could become one of the biggest success stories of Latin
America.

ORIX, the largest leasing company in Japan, will securitise the income from
part of its business in the domestic market to diversify ways of raising
cash, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
This will be the first time for a non-bank to sell securities directly in
Japan without the help of financial institutions.
The first securities, totalling Y3bn (Dollars 24m), will be sold to
investors through an Orix subsidiary yet to be established.
The subsidiary will sell to investors the right to the income from a
particular leasing contract which Orix has signed with a client. The
investors will then receive the income from the contract.
The minimum security will be Y50m. Orix hopes to start selling the
securities within a few months.
Some Japanese leasing companies now securitise part of their assets through
trust banks and are searching for new methods of raising funds to ease
financial tightness.

RJ REYNOLDS Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco food and tobacco group,
announced yesterday that it plans to build a factory in Turkey to produce
cigarettes by late 1993.
The North Carolina company says the plant will have an eventual production
capacity of 10bn cigarettes a year. The 135,000 sq ft plant will be sited in
the Izmir region. The company said that it had earmarked more than Dollars
100m for investment in Turkey over the next decade.
Turkey is a big market for cigarettes, and consumption is estimated at 80bn
a year. However, it is still dominated by Tekel, the state-owned monopoly.
The market was only opened to foreign cigarettes in the mid-1980s, but
western products have taken an increasing market share. Philip Morris, RJR's
big US competitor and manufacturer of Marlboro, has been successful.
RJR, however, said that it saw opportunities for its three brands - Camel,
Winston, and Salem. It expects to employ 300 people initially at the
factory, but said employment could eventually total about 800.
Mr Dale Sisel, head of RJ Reynolds Tobacco International, said: 'It's a
large market, with significant demand for American-blend cigarettes, and
there's plenty of opportunity for us to become a major participant.'

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: A mission to cut the labours of
Hercules - Tom Gossage has been charged with refocusing the US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM GOSSAGE is a man with a mission. As the new chief executive of
Hercules, a rambling chemicals, materials and aerospace conglomerate based
in Wilmington, Delaware, he has set two goals. The first is to become
cash-positive by 1992. The second is to increase the group's return on
equity from 5 per cent to 14 per cent by the end of 1995.
His goals will not be easy to achieve. At his first board meeting last
January as chief executive, Mr Gossage told his board he had searched the US
chemical industry for a company worse than theirs for return on
shareholders' capital. He couldn't find one.
Hercules's recent past is not one that shareholders remember with fondness.
After selling a 40 per cent stake in a polypropylene joint venture to
Montedison in 1987, Hercules frittered away the Dollars 1.5bn proceeds, says
Mr Gossage.
A third disappeared in tax, a third was spent buying back stock, and a third
was used to purchase some companies that would help the group escape the
cyclical nature of the basic chemicals industry.
'Frankly, the group had been drifting,' admits Mr Gossage. 'There has been
no real enhancement of shareholder value. Hercules's efforts to break out of
cyclical businesses did not have much success.'
To achieve his goals, Mr Gossage is examining every part of the business.
'We are now returning to basics. We will operate where we can be market
leaders and we will get out of things we are not good at,' he says.
That strategy was put into practice last week when he set up a joint venture
with Imcera, the US group, to create the second largest American company in
the Dollars 2.6bn flavours and citrus specialities market. This is a sector
where Mr Gossage believes Hercules can become market leader.
Simultaneously, he also announced the sale of Hercules's Dollars 30m
turnover fragrance businesses to an unknown buyer. Mr Gossage says it was a
promising business, but one that needed substantial investment that Hercules
could not afford.
The company is undertaking a widespread and unemotional examination of its
business with a view to disposals. Both the polypropylene fibre business and
the resins operations could be available for the right price.
Although Hercules is continuing to make some investments in polypropylene
fibre, a Dollars 170m business providing material for the disposable nappies
business, Mr Gossage believes its performance has been unsatisfactory.
Similarly, the group's resins business had been 'disappointing', according
to Mr Gossage. At the beginning of the year, he told its managers that if
there was no improvement the operations would be sold. The staff has been
reduced by about half, and the division is far more aggressive about
pricing.
'The resins operations can contribute, but I still view their future as
questionable. If someone came along with a price above book value I might
sell them. We're keeping our options open,' he says.
Meanwhile, Mr Gossage is looking for strategic partners for his other
divisions. In particular, he is looking at an alliance for the advanced
materials operations which is having to reposition itself after the collapse
of the US defence market.
Previously, the division had been geared mainly towards high-value defence
contracts. It is now turning its attention to commercial aircraft projects,
such as the Boeing 777, and the sporting goods market.
Mr Gossage argues the company now has a simple clear direction. When he
visited factories earlier this year, some production supervisors were unable
to tell him whether particular products were making money.
That has changed. Mr Gossage aims to make cost management a way of life at
Hercules. To achieve that, he talks about 'empowerment' by putting
accountability on to the factory floor.
The management shake-up and sales of less profitable businesses has already
made some impact on Hercules' performance. But when Mr Gossage lists the
financial achievements of his tenure, he is forced to exclude a large hole
in his balance sheet.
Last June, the company's aerospace division had to write off Dollars 68m
after the company's solid rocket booster for the Titan missile exploded
during a test firing. The explosion has been described by one Hercules
executive as the biggest firecracker in American history. The company had
already been forced to write off Dollars 300m in 1987 for the same project,
described by Mr Gossage as the company's Achilles' heel.
Mr Gossage reels off what the impact of reorganisation and restructuring
would have been without that incident.
Operating profits this year would have been up 32 per cent. Net income would
have grown 11 per cent. And return on shareholder capital would have been
7.3 per cent, up from 5 per cent.
There is no doubt that Mr Gossage, a chemical engineer, has a preference for
chemicals. He stumbles over the name of the European airframe manufacturer,
Airbus, and does not know the title of Boeing's latest aircraft, for which
Hercules is bidding as a sub-contractor.
'I have spent a disproportionate amount of time on aerospace. It's an
imbalance I want to fix,' he says. 'Chemicals and aerospace makes a strange
mixture.'
However, before he can dispose of aerospace, he says he first needs to show
that the Titan upgrade is viable. He says he then needs to fix the rocket
booster before seeing whether the operations fit into the portfolio.
Only then will he make a decision whether to spin the operations off, form a
joint venture or just sell them.
Mr Gossage believes the targets he has set for Hercules are achievable.
'Even 14 per cent return on equity would not make us leaders - we would be
part of the pack. But the rest of the industry is proving remarkably
accommodating by bringing their results down,' he explains.
Raising the company's performance while the rest of the industry struggles
with the recession and increasing environmental costs will need considerable
skill. To achieve his aims, Mr Gossage has some difficult juggling before
him.

THE Canadian government yesterday called for private sector bids for its 53
per cent stake in Telesat Canada, which has a monopoly on the country's
satellite communications.
As with earlier privatisations, foreign ownership will be restricted, in
this case to a 20 per cent holding. The sale will be subject to review under
the Competition Act.
Telesat owns and operates six satellites and a network of about 500 earth
stations. It earned CDollars 26.4m (USDollars 23m) in fiscal 1990 from
revenues of CDollars 177.8m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERGERS and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by Japanese companies fell sharply last year,
reflecting the squeeze on liquidity due to the sluggish stock market and
declines in profits, as well as deteriorating business conditions of
companies in the US and Europe.
According to Daiwa Securities, a leading Japanese brokerage, last year's M&amp;A
deals fell 63.5 per cent by value from 1990 to Y1,297.1bn (Dollars 10.3bn).
This was because of the decline in acquisitions of foreign companies by
Japanese companies, which plunged 78.6 per cent to Y684.3bn.
Although the figure includes the Y133bn limited partnership between Toshiba,
C. Itoh and Time Warner of the US, the absence of large-value transactions
of the previous years, such as the Sony-Columbia and Matsushita Electric
Industrial-MCA deals caused the fall.
Acquisitions of US companies by Japanese corporations fell 81.3 per cent by
value to Y382.2bn, while in Europe the figure fell by 70 per cent to
Y217.2bn. In the UK, M&amp;A transactions by Japanese companies fell 81.2 per
cent to Y88.2bn.
On the other hand, Daiwa said domestic M&amp;A transactions increased by 28.4
per cent to Y434.9bn, while foreign acquisitions of Japanese companies were
eight times higher by value at Y177.9bn.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Computer piracy costs put at
Dollars 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER software piracy in western Europe cost US suppliers a
conservatively estimated Dollars 4.46bn in 1990, according to figures
collected by the Software Publishers Association and the Business Software
Alliance.
The two organisations represent the world's large personal software
companies, most of which are US-based. Their estimate of losses from piracy
are made by comparing the number of units of software sold in the year with
the number of personal computers sold.
Typically, only a fraction of a software package is apparently sold for each
personal computer, presenting compelling evidence of widespread piracy. In
Italy, for example, one of the worst offenders, only half a software package
was sold for each personal computer bought in 1990.
The SPA last year estimated that losses in the US from piracy came to
Dollars 2.4bn in 1990.
The revenues lost in both the US and western Europe has has been expressed
as the wholesale rather than retail value of the software, which explains
why the overall loss is lower than the Dollars 12bn usually quoted as the
worldwide losses experienced by software suppliers.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: DAF expects losses to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch truck-maker, made another 'very considerable' loss last year
and will incur further losses in the first half of 1992, the company warned.
However, the start of recovery in some key markets and structural cost
reductions should combine to achieve a 'significant improvement' in DAF's
financial performance for 1992 as a whole, said Mr Aart van der Padt,
chairman.
Accelerated job losses and intensified restructuring measures, against the
background of a severe slump in the UK and other key truck markets, required
increased financial provisions, he said. As a consequence, it was too early
to indicate the precise extent of the 1991 losses.
DAF, in which British Aerospace has a 16 per cent stake, plunged into a net
loss of Fl 179.1m (Dollars 102.9m) in the first six months of the year, from
a loss of Fl 32.1m in the corresponding 1990 period. It has had to raise Fl
250m in new equity to strengthen its balance sheet.
The slump in European truck sales - with the notable exception of Germany -
has changed its fortunes with bewildering rapidity. DAF's net loss for 1990
reached Fl 227.6m, including restructuring costs of Fl 78m, and it failed to
pay a dividend. Yet in 1989 it had made a record net profit of Fl 172m.
At the operating level, the second-half performance was improved compared
with the first half and the corresponding period of 1990. It was only in
December, however, that DAF made good its half-year forecast of reaching
break-even point in the final quarter.
The stringent rationalisation and productivity measures being taken
throughout the company mean that DAF will have shed some 4,600 jobs
worldwide by 1993.

marketing agreement

<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese electronics company, is in talks with ICL, the
UK-based computer manufacturer in which it has an 80 per cent stake. The
talks could lead to Fujitsu selling the ICL-designed and manufactured
personal computers in Japan.
ICL said yesterday reports that such a deal had already been concluded were
premature. However, it agreed that the two companies were discussing
possible synergies.
Although Fujitsu has a controlling interest in ICL, the two companies
operate at arms' length and marketing deals between them are struck on a
purely commercial basis. An agreement to sell ICL personal computers in
Japan would be mutually beneficial to both, ICL said.
The personal computer market in Japan is dominated by NEC. It and other
Japanese makers, including Fujitsu, sell PCs of their own design in Japan.
The world market for PCs, however, is dominated by systems of a design
(MS/DOS) popularised by International Business Machines of the US.
Japanese manufacturers now accept they will have to open their home market
to MS/DOS designs. ICL has substantial MS/DOS PC manufacturing capacity and
expertise boosted by its acquisition of the computer interests of the
Finnish company, Nokia Data, last year.
The deal would also underline the growing confidence Fujitsu is showing in
its European partner. It already markets ICL's high-performance workstations
in markets other than Japan. It said last year it intended to extend that
policy to personal computers.
ICL, which uses Fujitsu microchip and printed circuit board technology for
its mainframe computers, is now playing a part in the design of Fujitsu's
large computers.
Fujitsu has established a subsidiary in the US for the development of
communications services, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Fujitsu said the
wholly-owned company, Fujitsu Networks Industry, would be capitalised at
Dollars 8m.

FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Peak year for S&amp;P downgrades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD levels of corporate debt were last year downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, one of the main Wall Street rating agencies. The figures underline
the extent to which leverage taken on by companies in the 1980s is still
compounding the recession.
S&amp;P said yesterday downgrades covered Dollars 509.7bn of corporate debt, up
from Dollars 500.1bn in 1990. It did, however, offer some hope when it
disclosed that the ratio of downgrades to upgrades improved slightly. In
1990, 766 corporate debt issues were downgraded, while 200 were upgraded; in
1991, the figures were 696 and 220.
Although the figures cover all debt issues monitored by S&amp;P on an
international basis, the rating agency confirmed that most of the downgrades
related to US-based corporate issuers.
In large part, problems in specific sectors explained the dismal picture.
For example, S&amp;P noted that debt of the 'Big Three' car companies -
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors - together with their related entities,
amounted to Dollars 250m, nearly half the corporate debt downgraded.
In the troubled airline industry, ratings for seven of the 11 leading
carriers not already in default were reduced. And in the financial sector,
S&amp;P said that institutions 'continued to experience stress', although it
added that the pace of downgrades had slowed.
It said that 352 debt issues by commercial banks, finance companies,
insurers, and thrift and brokerage firms were downgraded last year, compared
with 394 rating reductions in the previous year. Offsetting this, there were
40 upgrades, against 44 in 1990. Big US commercial banks which saw their
ratings reduced included Wells Fargo and Security Pacific. A significant
number of Japanese, British, French and Nordic banks also suffered
downgrades.
In the troubled US life insurance industry, rating reductions outpaced
improvements by a ratio of 25:2 - with the problems blamed largely on the
quality of some investment portfolios, especially those with heavy property
exposure.
The generally poor picture was mitigated slightly by some upgradings of
former junk bond debt. The most prominent beneficiary was RJR Nabisco, the
huge tobacco and food group, where Dollars 12bn of outstanding debt moved to
investment grade status. Improvements were also seen at Safeway, the west
coast supermarket group, and Owens Illinois, the fibreglass company.
Outside the corporate sector, the rating agency noted that municipal debt
also suffered record rating reductions, with Dollars 53.1bn worth
downgraded. The number of issues downgraded increased by 29 per cent last
year, with eight states - California, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois,
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island - seeing their debt ratings
reduced.

company

<TEXT>
SACHSENMILCH, a small Dresden dairy concern, today becomes the first east
German company to have its shares quoted on the German stock market.
It is raising DM60m (Dollars 39m) through a flotation on the unlisted
section of the Stuttgart bourse.
Sachsenmilch has been brought to the market by its new parent, the
Stuttgart-based Sudmilch, which wants to raise money for the subsidiary's
future expansion.
The Dresden company, which employs 450 people, expects turnover to rise from
DM296m to DM525m by 1995, when it hopes to make its first profit of some
DM10m and pay its first dividend.
The shares of Sachsenmilch have been priced at DM80 each. The proceeds will
go towards a new dairy, costing around DM260m. After the flotation, 49 per
cent of Sachsenmilch's equity will be held by outside shareholders, with the
rest owned jointly by Sachsenmilch and local milk producers in Saxony.
Analysts noted that Sachsenmilch's efficiency had been increased by the
provision of capital and know-how from Sudmilch.
Mr Jorg Walter, general manager of the Berlin Stock Exchange, said one or
two more east German companies could be listed this year, and maybe as many
as 100 within 10 years.
'We were all more optimistic at the start of 1990 that more companies would
be listed - maybe too optimistic,' he said.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: World markets slowdown hits Carclo
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO ENGINEERING, which manufactures products for the textile, automotive
and aviation industries, suffered a 33 per cent drop in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 2.87m.
The downturn, from a previous Pounds 4.31m, was a result of the core
divisions being hit by the slowdown in world markets.
A widespread fall in demand over the six months to end-September put
pressure on margins and led to a sharp decline in operating profits to
Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 4m) on lower turnover of Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 42.4m).
Earnings per share fell to 4.9p (7.3p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.7p.
The card clothing division, which provides products used in combing fibres
in preparation for spinning to the textile and machinery industries, saw the
greatest decline in operating profit - down 36 per cent to Pounds 1m.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said the division's UK businesses did somewhat
better thanthe businesses in the Netherlands and France.
That was due to the export strength of the UK businesses which supply mills
and machinery manufacturers in English and Spanish speaking markets,
including the Middle East, the Far East and South America.
In the general engineering division, Gills, the control cables manufacturer,
was able to buck the overall trend and enjoy increased demand.
The operation saw increased demand from its main customer, Ford Motors,
where it derives 85 per cent of its turnover.
Gills supplies Ford with products for its export market where production
figures have been resilient in contrast to the depressed UK car sales
market.
Carclo is selling Bruntons, a steel wire manufacturer based in Scotland and
part of its wire division. The decision came as Bruntons incurred a loss of
Pounds 400,000 on lower sales and was based on the board's view that the
company does not fit in with its longer term strategy for the single
European market.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl pulls out of food distribution in the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNZL, the packaging distributor, plastics and cigarette filter company,
yesterday completed the closure of its Californian food distribution
activity, a further step in reversing the group's ambitious expansion in the
1980s.
The closure of Collins Foodservice and Corsaro Produce, which will eliminate
losses of about Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 275,000) a month, is the most
significant step taken by Mr Anthony Habgood since he became chief executive
in August 1991.
Mr Habgood said yesterday 'It was my decision to shut them down if there
were no buyers by the end of November.'
The group acquired the businesses in May 1987, paying a total of Dollars
40m, but will realise less than 20 per cent of that in shutting them:
Dollars 4m from stock and fixed assets and several million dollars from
outstanding trade debts.
Within three years combined turnover had fallen by more than 20 per cent to
Dollars 241m in 1990 producing losses of Dollars 7m. In the year before they
were acquired they made pre-tax profits of Dollars 6m on turnover of about
Dollars 300m and had net assets of Dollars 20.5m.
Bunzl said that a full provision for the food losses had been made in the
1990 annual accounts and in the interims to end-June 1991. It did not expect
the exit to generate further costs.
The move into food distribution was one of several unsuccessful strategies
in the past five years initiated by the previous chief executive Mr James
White, who left in November 1990.
Following its success in building a US network in paper distribution in the
mid 1980s, and anticipating the maturity of that business, the group
attempted to build US distribution networks in food, building products and
electrical products.
However, paper distribution has continued to grow strongly, in contrast to
the diversifications.
Financial constraints prompted the group to sell the electricals business in
1989, just two years after acquisition, although it realised a profit.
Building products have been hit by the severe US housing and construction
recession.
Mr Habgood said: 'I'll certainly wait for much better economic conditions to
assess the building products potential, and unlike the food companies, while
they are not making money they are not bleeding.'

<TEXT>
The Greater Manchester Commercial Fraud Squad is looking into the alleged
theft of between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 400,000 of sports and leisurewear
from a subsidiary of French Connection.
Bukta Connection, had Pounds 2.8m of exceptional costs in the six months to
July 31. These took account of the allegedly stolen stock, which includes
shell suits (lightweight shiny leisurewear) and the strips of some first
division football teams.
Bukta itself complained to Greater Manchester Police, which confirmed that
the fraud squad was looking into the alleged theft of assets by former
employees.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR GRAHAM Ferguson Lacey, the evangelical preacher who heads the group that
recently bought Land's End and John o'Groats, has become deputy chairman of
Aviva Petroleum, a Texas-based but London-quoted oil and gas company.
Mr Lacey, who made his name as a controversial entrepreneur in the 1970s, is
president and chief executive of Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp, which
increased its stake in Aviva from 17 per cent to nearly 21 per cent last
November, when Mr Lacey initially became chief executive. He is one of four
Gulf directors who occupy non-executive roles on Aviva's board.
Mr Denys Milne, who used to be a BP director and is still involved with the
Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, has been appointed
chairman of Aviva, replacing Mr Gerald John Ward, who has resigned. Mr Ron
Suttill, the only executive director, becomes president and chief executive.
'I'm now on my fourth - or is it my fifth? - chairman since 1985,' he said.
The company is involved in exploration and drilling in the US, Alberta and
Columbia. Gulf Resources has taken a much stronger interest since increasing
its stake over the equity accounting threshold. Mr Suttill said Gulf might
buy more shares, possibly through supporting a rights issue.
Aviva, which lost Dollars 3.2m (Pounds 1.75m) in the first half of 1991,
plans to seek a US listing on either the Nasdaq over-the-counter market or
the American Stock Exchange.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove may launch offer for GW Thornton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering
conglomerate, yesterday looked to be about to make an agreed bid for GW
Thornton, the Sheffield-based engineering company.
Both companies asked for their shares to be suspended, Bromsgrove 'pending
an announcement' and Thornton because of discussions which may lead to a
bid.
Bromsgrove shares were unchanged on the Friday close at 131p for a
capitalisation of Pounds 56.5m. Thornton's suspension price of 150p, again
unchanged, valued the company at Pounds 9.9m.
If the deal goes ahead, it will be Bromsgrove's second acquisition in a
month. During December it made a Pounds 2.8m cash and shares takeover of
Imbach Group, taking it into environmental engineering.
Thornton's main business is precision forgings for the aerospace industry, a
neat fit with Bromsgrove's existing aerospace engineering interests.
Bromsgrove, in its half year to last September, and Thornton, in its full
year to September, both managed to increase trading profits in aerospace
markets in spite of a general downturn in the industry.
Thornton has been expanding its interests in the orthopaedic market, a
sector where Bromsgrove has no involvement.
During the year to last September Thornton made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.6m on turnover of Pounds 12.3m. In the six months to September 30
Bromsgrove reported profits of Pounds 3.5m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds
39.4m.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fears of lower margins in higher Christmas
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE GROUP, the leisure company, yesterday began a season of retailers
reporting how they had fared over the Christmas holiday period amid signs
that many may have sacrificed margins to achieve sales.
Ladbroke said its Texas Homecare DIY subsidiary had raised sales by more
than 15 per cent in the ten days from Boxing Day to January 4. Boots should
today make a statement about its last quarter sales, and Dixons, the
electrical retailer, is due to report interim results tomorrow.
These indications of consumer confidence and spending over Christmas follow
disappointing sales at Ratners, the high street jewellers. Despite deep
pre-Christmas price discounting, the resulting increase in sales was not
sustained and the troubled retailer's share price has fallen sharply.
Mr Ron Trenter, chairman of Texas, described the sales increase as very
encouraging as it had come from only 3 per cent more space than last year.
The announcement follows a mini-price war in the DIY sector where retailers
B&amp;Q, owned by Kingfisher, and Do-it-all, owned by WH Smith and Boots, have
intensified competition in selected areas.
Mr John Richards, analyst at Smith New Court, said Texas's sales figures
should not be interpreted as a sign of a significant upturn in the DIY
market. 'The aggressive discounting that B&amp;Q and Texas have been doing
appears to have been at the expense of their weaker competitors, notably
Do-it-all.'
Analysts pointed out that hastily arranged price discounting and planned
price cutting campaigns have a markedly different impact on profitability.
When Texas cut 25 per cent from all prices for two weekends last November,
it arranged that its suppliers should swallow some of the discount in return
for higher volume. Hurriedly arranged sales after stock has been bought, on
the other hand, slice profits straight off a retailers bottom line.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Irn-Bru helps lift AG Barr
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AG BARR, the Glasgow-based soft drinks manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits
by Pounds 369,000 to Pounds 4.75m in the year to October 26, a 'more than
satisfactory result', according to Mr Robin Barr, chairman.
Trading profits were down at Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 6.03m). But lower net
interest, dividend received of Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 1.64m), and an
exceptional credit of Pounds 601,000 from a settled fire insurance claim,
boosted the pre-tax figure.
Turnover rose fractionally to Pounds 90m (Pounds 89.8m), reflecting, Mr Barr
said, a poor second half because of 'the disappointing summer weather, the
rise in VAT and the recessionary conditions'. All these factors, as well as
the fragility of consumer confidence, had an effect on the market, he said.
Sales of the Barr brands continued to grow, due to improved distribution and
the greater public awareness - particularly in the case of Irn-Bru -
resulting from higher marketing expenditure.
Below the line there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 962,000 (Pounds
511,000) representing the final cost of restructuring the company's
production and distribution arrangements.
Earnings rose to 17.28p (16.03p) and a final dividend of 4.3767p makes a
5.46p (5.2p) total.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Inveresk pays off all Pounds 25m of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERESK, the Scottish-based fine paper manufacturer, has paid off all
Pounds 25m of its senior and mezzanine debt only 15 months after its
management bought it out for Pounds 31m from US paper group Georgia-Pacific.
The company is considering a stock exchange flotation but said it would not
necessarily happen this year. Although it is now free of debt it is taking
on a Pounds 20m revolving credit facility.
Inveresk, which makes products for specialised markets such as coated board
and artists' watercolour paper at three mills in Scotland and one in
Somerset, was the subject of a management buy-out in October 1990 involving
funds totalling Pounds 40m. It was arranged by Morgan Grenfell Development
Capital and Morgan Grenfell was the lead provider of finance.
Mr Stefan Kay, managing director, said Inveresk had repaid the debt from
cash flow. It had not needed the Pounds 3.3m of mezzanine finance, he said,
and Pounds 22m of senior debt was repaid.
Morgan Grenfell is lead merchant bank in the Pounds 20m revolving facility,
supported by Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. There is an
interest rate of 1 per cent over Libor and includes the option to draw down
a further Pounds 5m.
Dr Ingram Lenton, Inveresk's chairman, said the facility was 'a prudent
measure to allow ourselves a considerable degree of protection against
exigencies of current economic conditions'.
The company expected medium-term growth principally from increased profit
margins and to a lesser extent increased volume.
Inveresk expects next month to announce pre-tax profits for 1991 of nearly
Pounds 6m. It made Pounds 3.55m on sales of Pounds 48m in the six months to
June 1.
Inveresk has invested Pounds 6m in upgrading its plants since the buy-out
and plans to invest Pounds 7m this year.
Mr Kay said that a stock exchange flotation was one options available to the
company to provide an exit route for equity shareholders. 'I wouldn't like
to put a deadline of this year on it,' he said. 'It depends on the stock
exchange climate, the business climate and the political climate.' He was
not interested in a trade sale of the company.
Inveresk has equity of Pounds 10.25m of which 20 per cent is owned by its
management. The remaining 80 per cent is held by Morgan Grenfell, County
Natwest, 3i and Prudential Venture Managers.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Mercedes to buy 31% of Avia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German car, truck and bus maker is taking a 31 per cent
stake in Avia, Czechoslovakia's third largest truck company.
The deal, the group's first significant move into eastern Europe, appears to
confirm the skill of German companies in beating competitors in the race to
acquire Czechoslovak companies.
Mercedes, part of the Daimler-Benz group, was chosen to partner Avia over
Renault of France after 18 months of negotiations.
The French carmaker recently lost a bitter contest for control of the local
carmaker Skoda which was won by Volkswagen. Siemens was last year chosen to
partner Czechoslovakia's largest engineering firm, Skoda-Pilsen, beating
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Scandinavian power group and Westinghouse of
the US.
Mercedes planned to increase its shareholding in Avia to a 'significant
majority stake' over the next three years, said Mr Vlastimil Devera, Avia's
chairman.
Mercedes will invest DM350m (Pounds 121.9m) over the next three years in
Avia's most profitable plant in Letnany, a suburb of Prague. A further
DM100m investment is planned from 1995 to 1998.
Avia is Czechoslovakia's third largest truck company, with a 1991 turnover
of Kcs4.1bn (Pounds 74.7m).
Mercedes intends to phase out Avia's production of small trucks, which
average about 17,000 a year and are built under a 1967 licence from Saviem,
now part of Renault.
Mercedes will instead manufacture two versions of its light and medium
trucks.
Final approval for the deal must come from the Czechoslovak government
before March 30.
Under Czechoslovakia's large-scale privatisation programme, other
competitive bids can still be submitted up to January 20, which explains
reluctance to disclose the price for the share in Avia.
If the deal is approved the venture would be created in July.
The country's two other truck companies, Liaz and Tatra Trucks, have begun
negotiations with potential foreign partners including Mercedes, Renault and
Iveco of Italy.
Mercedes could be a joint-venture partner in Liaz or Tatra Trucks. The
German group has also shown interest in acquiring control of Karosa, the
Czechoslovak bus and fire engines manufacturer in eastern Bohemia.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Russia 'must accept UK beef' in EC aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER, ROBERT MAUTHNER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA will have to accept British beef as part of European Community aid if
emergency food deliveries are to continue as planned, European Commission
officials said yesterday.
One senior official said Russia's rejection of the free UK beef - because of
fears it might be contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or 'mad
cow disease' - could have been prompted by rival EC beef producers seeking
future orders from the former Soviet republics, which will get EC food
credits to pay for them.
The Commission's agriculture management committee is to decide tomorrow on
new aid deliveries and 'it goes without saying that there will be further
consignments of British beef', a senior Commission official said.
Britain expressed its irritation at the delays in obtaining Russian
clearance for British beef sent as part of EC aid, and a Foreign Office
minister hinted that food aid policy to Russia might have to be
reconsidered.
Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said in a radio interview:
'If they are going to react like this we have lots of other things to do,
not only with our beef but with our time.'
Brussels is concerned that Russia's initial refusal of a 120 tonnes
consignment of UK beef could lead to a disastrous new consumer scare over
meat safety. The BSE scare was one of the main contributory factors in last
year's near collapse of the EC's saturated market for beef.
The British beef came from intervention stockpiles, financed by the EC to
keep meat prices up, and had arrived in Murmansk last night where it was due
to be canned.
It was part of the Ecu200m (Pounds 145m) emergency food aid agreed at last
month's Maastricht summit for Moscow and St Petersburg. This programme is in
addition to the Ecu250m food aid the EC has been delivering over the past
six months, and separate from the Ecu1.25bn in food credits the Community
plans for the former Soviet republics, Ecu500m of which was agreed on
December 16.
Tomorrow's management committee meeting is likely to decide that future
consignments of aid should be made of any food deemed safe for trade within
the EC. This will include British beef. However, the next delivery was not
scheduled to be from the UK, and officials hope this will offer a breathing
space to clear any obstacles to future British consignments.
Germany yesterday despatched 10 transport and distribution experts to Moscow
and St Petersburg, and called for concerted EC supervision of aid
distribution, after reports of large-scale diversion of food aid on to the
Russian black market.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the Bonn government spokesman, said the Russian
distribution system could only work 'with western help and support'.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Personal View: How to make the Budget a real budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Samuel Brittan observed last month, Treasury forecasters have achieved a
hat trick. 'They failed to foresee the inflationary boom of the late 1980s;
they failed to foresee the subsequent recession, and then they forecast a
fictitious recovery' (FT, December 19). This tragi-comedy of errors is not
just a problem of poor forecasting. It is also a consequence of the arcane
and illogical way British economic policy is made.
A key problem is the arbitrary separation of the public expenditure
decisions announced in the Autumn Statement each November from the tax
measures revealed in the Budget in March. In almost every comparable
industrialised country, the sums to be spent by government and raised in
revenue are decided at the same time. In Britain, however, the Budget is not
really a budget at all. It is merely a statement of tax changes hopefully
related to expenditure decisions announced months beforehand.
In my view this arrangement fails to encourage either the development of
coherent policies or honest debate about the economic priorities facing the
nation. It hinders medium-term assessment of public expenditure priorities
and their revenue implications, and it makes it significantly harder to
determine the overall macro-economic impact of different fiscal and
budgetary policies.
Making matters worse is the relative invisibility of the Autumn Statement in
comparison with the Budget and the famous theatrical attractions that the
latter offers to chancellors of the exchequer on the steps of Number 11
Downing Street. As a result, the electorate's awareness of vitally important
public expenditure decisions remains low while interest in possible tax
changes is kept artificially high.
A further difficulty is that reforms designed to improve parliamentary
scrutiny of public expenditure have so far achieved the opposite.
Departmental reports introduced in the last two years to replace the former
Public Spending White Paper have made it even harder to assess overall
public spending trends and priorities. And the traditional debate on public
expenditure that used to follow publication of the White Paper is soon to be
subsumed within the general economic debate that occurs after the Autumn
Statement.
The time has come, I believe, for a complete review of the way in which
major aspects of economic policy in this country are formulated and
presented to parliament.
Proposals for reform of the UK's budgetary process were made 12 years ago in
the report Budgetary Reform in the UK, published by the Institute for Fiscal
Studies. This report, prepared by a committee chaired by Lord Armstrong of
Sanderstead, recommended that revenue and expenditure decisions should be
taken together and that the government should also publish a provisional
Budget some months before the final version is presented to parliament in
March.
Of course, publication of a draft or provisional budget does raise some
difficult issues: notably the risk that proposals for tax changes given in
advance could be disruptive and encourage avoidance. Some degree of budget
secrecy, therefore, is probably inevitable. This constraint, however, need
not prevent government from taking steps to encourage, in advance of the
Budget, a more informed public and parliamentary discussion of general
economic policy options including issues of tax and expenditure policy.
Why not, for example, consider longer-term questions of tax reform, such as
the distribution of the tax burden among income groups (a subject not
especially popular with current Treasury ministers), or examine the likely
macro-economic effects of different tax changes. Public debate of this kind
might have prevented the most serious fiscal policy errors of recent years,
notably the pro-cyclical inflationary tax cuts of 1988 and the similarly
ill-timed VAT increase in last year's Budget.
The decision to link expenditure and revenues in the Budget would enable a
new role for the Autumn Statement. It could become a key statement of
overall economic policy, providing not simply a forecast, but a detailed
assessment of the options facing the economy. This new-style statement would
initiate a national dialogue on economic policy that could inform and
improve the decisions that governments eventually take in the Budget.
A further reform, not strictly related to the Budget process but long
overdue nevertheless, is to ensure the independence of the Government
Statistical Service.
The combination of expenditure cuts in the early 1980s and the Conservative
government's marked tendency to manipulate official data have seriously
damaged the integrity of British statistics. The numerous changes to the
method of compiling the numbers of unemployed and government ministers'
inconsistent use of the retail price index and measures of the underlying
rate of inflation (depending on which happens to be lowest at the time) are
probably the most glaring examples of their statistical sleight of hand.
An independent statistical service would restore public confidence in the
statistics that ultimately guide government decision taking and complement a
reformed process of budget making. Together these changes would, I believe,
not merely improve the quality of our democracy; they would also improve the
effectiveness of economic policy and contribute to better performance by the
British economy.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: Direct insurance ignores principle of the many
paying for the few
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEVIN PRATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Missing from Richard Lapper's examination of direct insurers
('Fire-eaters and contortionists', January 6) was any acknowledgement of the
vital role still played by independent insurance intermediaries.
Mr Lapper suggests that by no longer paying commission to intermediaries,
the direct writers are able to offer cheaper insurance to the public. He
fails to point out that it is the public who is paying the substantial bonus
paid to insurers' staff, including the Pounds 1.5m bonus to Mr Peter Wood of
Direct Line. Commission or bonus, it comes out of the same pockets.
The direct insurers offer cheaper insurance because they shy away from
anything other than 'standard' risks. In Mr Lapper's words, Direct Line
'rejects risks it thinks certain to produce claims'. How could an insurance
company operating on this basis fail to make money?
The issue glossed over in the article is how the difficult risks are to
obtain cover. If the direct writers force high street intermediaries out of
business while continuing to bet only on racing certainties, where will the
young, the elderly, those with convictions, those driving fast cars and any
other unusual cases turn?
Insurance is grounded on the principle that the many pay for the misfortunes
of the few. Independent intermediaries distribute the varied motor insurance
risk among a wide constituency of insurers. As a result, 'standard' risks
pay marginally more if they go through a broker in order to subsidise higher
risks drivers - and keep the entire market on an even keel.
The savings from going direct are often only a few pounds. One wonders
whether the ultimate disruption to the market as a whole is worth the cost.
After all, a standard risk can become a higher risk at any time, because of
an unavoidable claim or because of the underwriting caprice of a 'flexible'
direct insurer. It is in the interests of all drivers to maintain a market
in which all drivers can obtain insurance at reasonable cost.

<TEXT>
Sir, your article ('France to ease Sunday trading laws slightly', December
31) on the Virgin megastores' battle with the French authorities over Sunday
opening contained a couple of inaccuracies.
Far from 'angering' our own staff, we have 100 per cent support from them,
and they turned up en masse at court in support of our decision to open on
Sunday, December 29 (they know we will use only volunteers to work Sundays).
Although the court fined us, the judge said that we were right to fight for
something with such wide public support.
As a result of our stance, the French minister of employment has publicly
announced that he will meet the head of our retail division to discuss a
formula for cultural shops (records, books, etc) to be allowed to open on
Sundays.
Sunday trading is an issue that we will not 'back down over'. Patrick
Zelnick,

Sir, May a banker express a view about the letter from Mr Barry Hyman of
Marks and Spencer (Letters, January 3) in which he claims: 'There is
absolutely no evidence to suggest that the public is crying out for a
seventh day on which to purchase food or clothing.'
I am normally unable to go shopping for anything during the week and often
find it difficult to do so on Saturdays. I would like nothing better than to
visit M and S on my way home from church on a Sunday.
Nearly everybody I know feels the same - and not only as far as food and
clothing (and M and S) are concerned. There are enough pressures in modern
life without being prevented from shopping when it is convenient.
Mr Hyman's remark that 'when the law is rationalised . . . some of us may
wish to ease congestion and assist customers by opening on the occasional
Sunday' is telling in its condescension and (together with M and S's refusal
to accept other issuers' credit cards and anybody's debit cards in its
stores) suggests that his company has much to learn about assisting
customers.
While I am not suggesting that M and S (or anyone else) should break the law
by opening now on Sundays (that is a separate argument), I do wish they
would admit that there is a very real demand from the public for all kinds
of shopping on Sundays, and join the campaign to repeal the Shops Act.
And if Mr Hyman does want to attend to his banking affairs on Sundays,
perhaps he should consider moving his account to First Direct, which is
already open for retail banking 24 hours a day, seven days a week (and
which, incidentally, is not my employer). If enough bank customers want to
move their accounts to banks which do business on Sundays, I am sure the
banks which do not will soon get the message. Loans, socks - it's all the
same. Peter Wynn Williams,

Sir, Six months ago I put out for quotation by a toolmaker a drawing for a
blow-moulding tool. It took five weeks and three prodding telephone calls
before I received his quotation on the telephone which was 'around Pounds
18,000'; and the drawing would have to be amended so that the toolmakers
could make a tool which they could make.
A visit to Portugal produced an estimate within five minutes; and the
estimate was just under Pounds 7,000.
I recently asked a well-known West End optician to have my spectacle frames
polished, to which the response was 'we can't do it in England; they will
thus have to go to Germany which will take three weeks and the cost will be
Pounds 95'. In Stuttgart last weekend I walked into the first optician's
shop I came across and had the job done in a quarter of an hour for Pounds
5.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: Protecting the investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERVASE TINLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the wake of such unhappy events as the Barlow Clowes, BCCI and
Maxwell affairs the public does not view regulation to protect investors,
depositors or pensioners as being effective as it should be.
The idea of an investor's charter to crystallise the rights and obligations
of different parties in relation to investor protection has been put
forward. The suggestions that there should be a single regulator for those
who retail investment and life insurance products and services is also
receiving some support.
There is reason to believe that the general public is becoming increasingly
aware of the concept and value of polarisation expressed through independent
and tied sales outlets.
Switching to a single regulator for retailers would cause an upheaval in the
system of regulation which will not have been in force for four years until
April 1992. It would undoubtedly blur the gradually emerging distinction
between independent and tied sources of financial services.
By all means let us have a charter, but don't cause confusion by overturning
the present still fledgling structure. Gervase Tinley,

FT  07 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Early steps in education
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST tests administered to all seven-year-olds in England and Wales
last year revealed considerable cause for concern. After two years of
compulsory schooling, more than a quarter were found to have had difficulty
with reading and basic mathematics. There was considerable variation between
education authorities, with barely half those tested in some areas reaching
acceptable levels, compared with over 80 per cent in others.
The Labour party blamed 12 years of Conservative government for such low
achievement. The education secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, blamed poor
management by local education authorities (many of them Labour-controlled)
and decades of 'progressive' teaching methods (and by implication previous
Labour governments). Neither response does much to rectify what appears to
be serious weaknesses in the first stage of Britain's education system. A
child who does not learn to read, write or add up while at primary school
will gain little from the rest of his or her compulsory education.
The primary school teaching methods now blamed by Mr Clarke for poor
standards once enjoyed bipartisan support. The Plowden Report, which gave
official approval to the child-centred approach, was published in 1967,
during a Labour government. But it was set up by a Conservative secretary of
state and chaired by the Tory Lady Plowden. Mrs Thatcher, education
secretary in the early 1970s, did at least as much to implement its findings
as any Labour minister.
Essential knowledge
Nonetheless, Mr Clarke is right to question the teaching methods encouraged
by Plowden - necessary though they were as an antidote to learning by rote.
Encouraging pupils to learn through group work on topic-based projects can
all too easily neglect the acquisition of essential knowledge. And there is
evidence that it fails to challenge sufficiently many children of both below
and above average ability.
Mr Clarke's preferred solution is to encourage more formal teaching methods
('whole class teaching'), greater subject specialisation by teachers and
streaming of older children according to ability. He has commissioned an
inquiry into primary school teaching methods from a team which seems likely
to endorse his views and which has been given less than two months to
report. This deadline suggests that there will be none of the research or
consensus-building which made the Plowden Report so influential.
Co-operation
Such haste could be a serious weakness in Mr Clarke's admirable desire to
sharpen up teaching methods in primary schools. The UK education secretary
rightly has no power to dictate teaching methods. He does have some power to
influence the teacher training system, but it would take many years to
create a new generation of teachers to implement his reforms. If he wishes
to change teaching methods, therefore, Mr Clarke must win the co-operation
of teachers.
That may not be easy as schools struggle to digest a series of reforms from
the national curriculum and testing to the local management of school
budgets. And teachers are unlikely to be impressed with a report prepared in
under eight weeks to justify overturning 20 years of classroom practice. If
Mr Clarke is serious about raising standards in primary education, he will
need a more persuasive touch with the professionals than he exhibited as
health secretary.
One of Mr Clarke's strengths has been his ability to tell powerful
professional groups that they must do better, without demanding endless
increases in their budgets.
His weakness is that in combative pursuit of this insight, he is sometimes
less than thorough in identifying places where funds are genuinely needed.
The teaching methods he favours require different classroom designs and
equipment. Intensive remedial reading programmes call for more teachers and
large-scale retraining. And if teachers are to be better motivated in a
period of dramatic change, he will need to view with a sympathetic eye the
forthcoming pay review body report.
This is the second of a series on British education policy.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Royal Festival Hall and Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New Year always begins in these columns with The Nutcracker, and like a
galley-slave at ease with his shackles, I find a nostalgic familiarity in
the routine of excited tots in the audience, drifting snow-flakes on stage,
and the ring of the celesta as the Sugar Plum Fairy appears. This year there
have been a couple of vivid interpretations to banish the doldrums I
associate with a role that is usually a drag rather than a dragee. The Sugar
Plum Fairy's assignment amounts to little more than a pas de deux - but how
much more that little can seem when cast with a true ballerina. Thus it was
when Ludmila Semenyaka led English National Ballet's performance on Thursday
afternoon, and when Darcey Bussell appeared with the Royal Ballet on Friday
night.
I saw Semenyaka in The Nutcracker at her Paris debut with the Bolshoy Ballet
in 1973. Then, the exquisite purity of her Kirov training, made the dance
seem so fresh, so pure, that one might have been seeing the ballet and
hearing the music for the first time. Today, her style remains unflawed,
crystalline, yet every least moment is now imbued with a noble authority,
that rarest of dance blessings. Like Markova - great original of this role
for Western audiences - she appears as a child's dream of a fairy,
infinitely gracious and charming, made of spun sugar, magical. But there is
a dignity, an inevitability of style, that sharpens and focusses the lines
of the choreography. So the glorious adagio pours out its descending scales,
and in Semenyaka's dancing we see a no less heart-stirring grandeur. In the
celesta variation, the precision of her phrasing, the delicate radiance of
her personality, born of the music, are impeccable. It is exemplary
classical artistry.
I hold little brief for ENB's staging, which is strongly orientated towards
a youthful audience - vulgar slapstick in the party scene; epidemic
winsomeness in the Kingdom of Sweets - but anything is bearable when
Semenyaka and her cavalier, the Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta, are on stage.
Acosta is a new and excellent recruit to ENB's impressive roster of male
dancers. Only 20 years old, he has a technique already powerful, well
schooled, well rounded, and he is a fine partner. His personality is wholly
engaging: he possesses a joie de danser that illuminates everything he does.
The dance looks happy.
At Covent Garden, Peter Wright's Nutcracker redresses every error of the ENB
production. The Christmas party has genuine gaiety as well as good manners;
the wonders of transformations and the drama of the mouse-battle are
imaginatively shown; the ensemble playing - from company and students - is
beautifully judged. The Nutcracker's genius lies both in its score and in
its Ivanov choreography. On Friday night the patterns of the snowflakes's
waltz were ravishing, and in the grand pas de deux, Darcey Bussell displayed
a bewitching sincerity. Lovely the way she took the stage, setting out the
movement so lucidly that it looked newly made for her. Her partner, Zoltan
Solymosi, was attentive, eager to dazzle us in his variation, but it was
Bussell's generous dancing and her unaffected grace that gave the duet its
effulgence. From Stephen Wicks as Drosselmeyer, from Iain Webb as the
Nutcracker, from the entire cast, excellent performances.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: Patronage should be appreciated - Christie's and
Sotheby's January exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each January in what is the close season in the salerooms, Sotheby's and
Christie's make over their empty galleries to a worthy cause. This time the
beneficiary at Christie's (King Street, St James's SW1, until January 24) is
the National Art Collections Fund which, since the beginning of the century,
has been raising money entirely by private subscription to help our national
collections acquire those objects and works of art that are their raison
d'etre.
Since the passage of such things supplies the host's own raison d'etre, such
help treads the nicest line between disinterest and natural sympathy. But it
cannot be emphasised too strongly that the NACF, in these straitened and
philistine times, needs all the help it can get.
Yet with The New Patrons, (sponsored by Nuclear Electric, with help in kind
from Momart and Lowndes Lambert Cargo), rather than blow its own trumpet,
the NACF has chosen to make the further point: that true patronage is never
the preserve of the public body. The best support the artist can be offered
is the most direct: the commission or purchase of his work, not out of any
sense of public duty but rather for immediate pleasure and appreciation it
affords. Patronage and self-interest indeed march easily together.
The New Patrons of the title are those companies and corporations that have
bought contemporary works or art for offices and boardrooms, for the
enhancement, as the jargon has it, of the working environment. Not that the
workers always appreciate this, but then a remark of the late David Donald,
responsible for the development of the collection of Scottish art at Robert
Fleming Holdings, the best such in private hands, should be remembered. He
said that complaints were usual at first but it was best to ignore them, for
they would be fiercer when the time came for a rehang and the work's
removal. My own experience here at the Financial Times, bears out the truth
of it.
The fact is that it is both a joy and a privilege to live and work, not with
the shadow and reproduction of a work of art, but with the thing itself. But
privilege has its duties, and works of art require time and attention if
they are to give up their secrets. That attention need not be direct, indeed
is likely to be the deeper for being subconscious. I doubt that any of the
companies represented in this exhibition, or those many more that would
willingly have taken part had there been room, once committed to a
collection has had the least reservation or regret.
Each collection has its own reason, its founding purpose, its rationale.
Many were born of the plausible excuse, argued significantly often by a
single enthusiastic chairman or director - Lord Croft at De Beers', Lord
Drogheda at the FT, Cob Stenham at Unilever, Mr Donald at Flemings - of a
new building to furnish and decorate. Some grew out of personal and family
interests - Baring Brothers; some were put together almost at once with the
professional advice of the Contemporary Art Society - Unilever, De Beer's;
some grew slowly and are now largely static - the FT; some continue
spectacularly to grow - Flemings; some are barely begun - InterCity. There
is no pattern, nor should there be.
The show itself is a wonderfully heterodox compendium of 20th century
British art, as various in its taste and interests as the companies
concerned. In the particular it offers works of the highest quality, of the
earlier periods especially, by such as Peploe, Fergusson and Cadell, by
Wadsworth and Roberts, Sickert and Redpath, Burra, Lamb, Nicholson, Vaughan,
Auerbach, Freud. That so many of them should have been picked up for more or
less a song and are now worth at least an opera or two, should only serve to
encourage them all, even like Robert Hiscox (Hiscox Holdings) in defiance of
his accountants, to keep on collecting, and every other company too. From
Auerbach and Bellany to Rego and Wonnacott, there is an awful lot of good
British art about.
The show at Sotheby's is given over not to a good cause as such, but to an
artist not so much neglected as tucked up in his tight technical box and so
put critically to one side. Lawrence Whistler is now 80, and celebrates with
a small but fully representative and exquisitely chosen retrospective of his
work as an engraver on glass (34 New Bond Street W1, until January 24). The
imagery speaks of the generation which formed him as an artist, neo-romantic
with a touch of surrealism, with all the close focus and density of detail
of the pre-war British print.
Yet convincing and enchanting as these images are of an ideal and visionary
world, the more intriguing aspect of the work is the formal invention and
technical command that allow those images expression. To establish a
convincing pictorial space on a plane surface is problem enough: to do so on
the concave inside of a goblet, and further to exploit the thickness of the
glass itself by working the outer convex surface, boggles any thought of
imitation. Any bending or twisting surface is bad enough, but given a
reasonably consistent viewpoint, as with a fresco high up in the cupola of a
church, the problem is not irresolvable. But a goblet or bowl presents
itself to us every way, and its profile changes as it swoops down and up
again the other side. And yet the image it carries hovers bright and
consistent before us, oddly like a hologram in the darkness. Quite
remarkable.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: The band strikes up again - A revival on disc of the
Gershwin brothers' musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were at least three versions of the Gershwin brothers' musical Strike
Up the Band. The first in 1927 was a resounding flop. It folded in
Philadelphia after two weeks. George S. Kaufman's satirical book lampooned
war - a dangerous subject to try to be funny about even then. Today the
show's underlying whimsy, whereby the US declares war on Switzerland, with
yodelling as a secret weapon, seems quaintly off-key. 'Oh, this is such a
charming war,/ Whoops] what a charming war]/ It keeps you out in the
open-air' sings the chorus of soldiers in one of Ira Gershwin's lyrics.
In the 1930 version Kaufman's book was drastically re-jigged by the
comedy-writer Morrie Ryskind, who structured the show around the popular
vaudeville duo of Clark and McCullough. In this form it had a respectable
Broadway run of 191 performances and then petered out - only to be
re-written once again in a 1940 film version with Judy Garland and Mickey
Rooney for which not even the most ardent fans of Busby Berkeley, its
director, have a good word to say.
Meanwhile a couple of numbers from the show - the title song, a spritely
military march, and the evergreen 'The Man I Love', acquired a life of their
own. The latter had been popping in and out of various Gershwin shows for
some years until it settled down as a self-contained torch song variously
interpreted by Ella Fitzgerald, Liza Minnelli and many other singers.
Now, thanks to a welcome recording project Strike up the Band (Elektra
Nonesuch 7559-79273-2), stemming from the Gershwin archive preserved in the
Library of Congress, we have the opportunity to hear the song as a duet with
its counterpart, 'The Girl I Love'. In the event it is less effective here
and completely eclipsed by another duet about first love, sung by Jason
Graae and Juliet Lambert, entitled '17 &amp; 21'. These two artistes are not at
all well known to us. But like their colleagues on the disc - Don Chastain
in the principal part of a millionaire cheese-manufacturer and Brent Barrett
as the sceptical newspaperman, with Rebecca Luker and Beth Fowler as their
womenfolk - they are thoroughly at home responding to the testing demands of
the stage musical. They breath fresh life into words full of dated jokes and
references, lines written when lyricists were permitted some pretty tortuous
rhymes.
Mercifully, there is no attempt to turn the show into an operetta as in some
recent recordings of more recent musicals. Here a specially recruited
orchestra conducted by John Mauceri with a complete cast and chorus are
content to do a lively job of period reconstruction. On two CDs lasting
almost two hours they sing all the numbers from the original 1927 version,
frequently cued in by its spoken dialogue, and then they give us some
additional items from the second version, including its hit song 'I've got a
crush on you'. This 1930 version of Strike Up the Band has also been
recorded in full and will be released later.
The production has been planned by Tommy Krasker, the Gershwin archivist
appointed by the trustees of the Estate under the aegis of Mrs Leonore
Gershwin. Krasker's scholarly approach to the task comes at a time when
there is a universal revival of interest in American musicals of the 1920s.
In one or two songs here where the original orchestrations have been
preserved these have been re-created; in the majority fresh orchestrations
have been commissioned from people who know how to dispense the authentic
period sound.
A troupe of dancers was in addition assembled for this recording. Under the
lead of Randy Skinner, some dazzling tap routines ring out as if they were
being performed on the floor one's room. Anyone who has the recordings
released two years ago of Of Thee I Sing and Let Them Eat Cake, two other
shows in the same pre-Porgy and Bess style when the brothers were trying to
compose a la D'Oyly Carte, will certainly want to have this set as well.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When British is best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British banks, subject to much criticism for their treatment of small
firms in recent months, score better than their German counterparts in a new
comparison of bank charges in the two countries.
The British banks won by four points to three in a survey carried out by
Small Business Perspective, a new bi-monthly newsletter.*
Most British banks publish their tariffs while in Germany, tariffs are
generally only made known to private, but not to business customers, the
newsletter notes. The situation in Germany is beginning to change, however.
The British banks also do well on deposit account rates, offering instant
access accounts with interest rates varying between 6.75 per cent and 7.625
per cent for sums over Pounds 5,000. The German banks offer only 0.5 per
cent to 3 per cent on deposits of DM20,000 (Pounds 7,000) and more. All
rates were calculated at the beginning of December.
In two other areas, German banks rate more highly. Their standing charges
are usually lower, generally less than DM2.90 (Pounds 1) compared with
Pounds 2.50 to Pounds 5 from most UK banks. Their charges for credit entries
and cheques are also lower at 35pfg to 60pfg per item (12p to 20p), compared
with 60p to 74p in the UK.
In a separate survey of banking services in France, Germany and the UK,
carried out by Bossard Consultants and reported in the newsletter, German
companies emerged as having longer term relationships with their banks.
Fewer German firms had ended a banking relationship in the past three years
than was the case in the UK or France.
Thirty per cent of British companies had a business relationship with a
subsidiary of a foreign bank compared with 23 per cent in France and 17 per
cent in Germany.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Back to basics for the
key to survival - Big issues facing small firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new year has started on a sombre note for Britain's smaller companies.
There will be little respite, in the first few months at least, from the
continuing battle to withstand the pressures of the recession.
Even if the economy starts to improve, the likelihood is that failure rates
will continue to rise for a further 12 to 18 months.
For some firms, an upturn in their order books may just make matters worse.
Financing new orders could prove the last straw for overstretched
businesses. The first rule for 1992 will, therefore, be to keep a close eye
on cash flow.
Businesses will need to review every step in their sales and production
cycle to see if the time taken can be reduced, if each stage could be
started earlier or the system reorganised to limit the amount of money tied
up.
Success, or survival, will depend very much on this return to the basics but
prospects for the small firms sector are also subject to other influences.
Government policies, the activities of business support organisations and
the effectiveness of the small business lobby groups all play their part.
The key issues which will determine the prosperity of the small firms sector
in 1992 and beyond are:
The attitude of the banks. Many of the large banks have produced 'business
charters' intended to lay down clear guidelines for their dealings with
business clients.
But suspicions still remain among small business organisations about the
degree to which the banks have changed their attitudes.
The large provisions which the banks have made on loan losses have made them
tighten up on their lending policies.
Just how the banks will reconcile the need to avoid losses with their desire
to present a more kindly face to their small business customers has yet to
be revealed.
The next 12 months will show whether they are capable of establishing a new
relationship.
Government-backed schemes to channel funds to small businesses. Several
small firms' lobby groups have been lobbying for the creation of a special
fund to provide low-cost, long-term loans to smaller businesses.
The lobbyists believe government is now more positive about their proposals
and they hope for action in the Conservative party's election manifesto.
Traditionally, however, the government has been sceptical of any special
form of small business finance and there have been no official signals of a
change of heart. Meanwhile, the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which guarantees most
of the risk of a bank loan to businesses which cannot meet normal security
criteria, is undergoing review.
The guarantee scheme has not turned out to be a particularly popular means
by which small firms raise finance. Nor is it a source of cheap funding. The
cost of the guarantee means it is usually more expensive than a normal bank
loan.
Government policy on late payments. The past year has seen growing pressure
from credit rating groups, debt collection agencies and the banks for action
on the late payments question.
Small firms in the UK wait on average 81 days to be paid, far longer than
their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.
The government has for many years resisted a change in the law but its
attempts at exhortation have clearly failed. The clamour for legislative
action, or for a change in court procedures for the collection of debt, is
increasing.
The administration of VAT. Dealing with VAT is a significant burden for many
businesses and the penalties for making a mistake - let alone deliberate
attempts to avoid payment - are severe.
Customs &amp; Excise is currently reviewing suggestions for an easing of its
'serious misdeclaration' penalty and business and accountancy organisations
hope a less draconian regime will emerge later this year.
A second VAT issue with important implications for business is the decision
to decentralise the handling of routine queries to regional VAT offices.
Customs believes this will speed up the process of providing answers but
some business organisations fear it will lead to less consistency.
The effects of decentralisation will show through as the year progresses.
Training and Enterprise Councils and chambers of commerce. These two
important providers of business support services are both at cross-roads.
Many of the TECs are still struggling to get established and to devise an
effective network of small business support in their area.
They face the prospect of further upheaval later this year when the civil
servants who make up the bulk of the staff in many TECs decide whether to
opt for the private sector terms and conditions being offered by the TECs or
whether to move back into another civil service department. If too many
leave, the ability of the TECs to provide services will be hit.
Whatever happens to civil service staffers, many of the TECs will have to
readjust their approach to take into account the realities of their local
economies and of travel-to-work areas, rather than the administrative
boundaries on which they are based.
Some TECs are already starting to work together but many more will need to
do so if they are to provide a useful response to local and regional needs.
One existing business support network with which the TECs will need to
co-operate is the chambers of commerce. Talks are already under way between
the two groups. But the chambers themselves are also on the threshold of
change as they beef themselves up to provide a more effective service to the
business community. How successful they are remains to be seen.
Quality. Businesses will have to decide whether they need to register for
the British quality assurance standard BS5750. Some firms will have no
choice because large companies are starting to insist that all their
suppliers conform to BS5750.
Registering to this standard can be costly and time-consuming while the
benefits only show through over the medium to long term. There is some
pressure for a simplified version to be devised for the very small business
but many companies will simply have to grit their teeth.
Finally, 1992 itself - the year of the single European market. In fact, the
barriers are not due to come down until December 31 and many may take well
into 1993 to be dismantled. Surveys indicate that many smaller British
companies have still not realised the likely implications of the single
market for them.
No one can predict with any degree of accuracy what a single market will do
for many of the sectors, such as services, where small firms are
particularly active.
But there are few areas of business life which have not already been touched
by one European Community directive or another.
Even those companies which have decided that there is nothing they can do to
prepare themselves in advance need to keep a close eye on the single market
as it develops. Staying close to their customers, their suppliers and their
competitors is likely to give them an earlier indication of change than any
formal sources of advice.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Shot in the arm boosts profits - How drug
companies are coming closer to developing an all-in-one vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vaccine production, for long a sleepy sideline of the pharmaceutical
industry, is being rejuvenated through a combination of new technology and
corporate restructuring.
With the help of biotechnology, researchers are developing vaccines for
diseases against which there is no protection today, from malaria to Aids.
At the same time they are working to combine existing vaccines and
ultimately achieve the World Health Organisation's goal of an 'ideal
children's vaccine' which would deliver immunity against all serious
childhood illnesses in a single dose shortly after birth.
The corporate background to vaccine development is changing as fast as the
science, through mergers and alliances which are transforming a patchwork of
national vaccine companies into a handful of global players.
The most important event was the Dollars 785m (Pounds 430m) takeover of
Connaught of Canada by Institut Merieux of France at the end of 1989. That
boosted Merieux's worldwide vaccine sales to Dollars 300m a year - well
ahead of its three leading competitors, Lederle (Cyanamid) and Merck of the
US, and SmithKline Beecham whose vaccine business is based in Belgium.
Together the top four companies account for half of the Dollars 1.3bn a year
world vaccines market.
Meanwhile the single-country vaccine companies are gradually selling out.
For example, Wellcome sold its century-old UK vaccine business to Medeva for
Pounds 20m at the beginning of this year, making Medeva the country's only
commercial vaccine producer.
The next moves on the world stage are likely to be strategic alliances
between the leading companies. Merieux and Merck recently signed a letter of
intent to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines
for the US market and they are waiting for the Federal Trade Commission to
approve the agreement.
'If we get the green light from the FTC, I'm convinced we will then go
further with Merck,' says Alain Merieux, chief executive of the French
company. And there is speculation in the pharmaceutical industry that
Lederle and SmithKline Beecham are planning a vaccines alliance to balance
the link-up between Merieux and Merck.
The primary reason for these alliances, according to Alain Merieux, is that
'the future lies in combined vaccines with multiple antigens'. (Antigens are
the proteins produced by viruses and bacteria which stimulate the immune
system to make protective antibodies.) No single company has enough antigens
to make a good all-in-one vaccine on its own.
Two triple childhood vaccines are already used routinely: DTP against
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) and MMR against measles,
mumps and rubella. Jacques Armand, Merieux's vaccine development and
production director, says it will be feasible within two years to expand DTP
into a six-fold vaccine, by adding polio, hepatitis B and haemophilus
influenzae b (the latter is a relatively new vaccine which protects against
a common form of bacterial meningitis).
Researchers are developing methods for combining vaccines in a stable
mixture. 'If there is incompatibility between ingredients, we could use a
dual-barrelled syringe in which some ingredients are kept separate in two
compartments,' Armand adds.
A more serious obstacle to combining childhood vaccines is that the current
strains need to be given at different ages to provoke the best immune
response. It would be impossible for example to add the current measles
vaccine - given at 12 to 15 months - to DTP which is generally given in
three doses at two, three and four months. So the search is on for new
strains that will confer immunity soon after birth.
In the long run, the best hope for a multiple vaccine may lie in genetic
engineering. The favourite approach is to add antigen genes from several
different germs to a single 'Christmas tree' micro-organism. Most
researchers are using viruses of the pox family, which contain large amounts
of genetic material and are therefore attractive targets for genetic
manipulation. They also have a long history as vaccines; the successful WHO
campaign to eradicate smallpox was based on vaccination with cowpox
(vaccinia).
Merieux researchers have chosen canary pox, which normally infects birds, as
their already carried out clinical trials of a new rabies vaccine, made from
canary pox genetically engineered to incorporate rabies antigens.
Animal tests show that a genetically engineered pox vaccine can induce
immunity against several diseases, though the approach is unlikely to
produce a commercial human vaccine for several years. 'A few years ago this
was just a dream, now it's at least part of the way towards reality,' says
Armand.
Multiple vaccines will help the WHO and Unicef (the United Nations
Children's Fund) to achieve their goal of universal childhood vaccination.
Already 80 per cent of the world's children have been immunised against six
leading childhood diseases - measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus,
polio and tuberculosis - compared with only 10 per cent a decade ago. This
has required health workers to make five separate visits and administer
eight doses of vaccine to each child. Combining them into a one-shot vaccine
would bring operational advantages not only to hard-pressed health workers
in the third world but to parents in developed countries who sometimes lose
track of their children's vaccination schedule.
Although the first priority is to improve and combine existing vaccines,
'new vaccines are a close second priority,' says Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO
director-general. Only about 20 diseases have commercially available
vaccines. There are none yet for many diseases that cause widespread death,
including dengue, rotavirus diarrhoea, hepatitis A and E, acute respiratory
infections, meningococcal meningitis, malaria and Aids.
Charles Merieux, honorary chairman of Institut Merieux, believes Aids and
malaria are the two greatest challenges facing the industry. 'An Aids
vaccine is the most exciting scientific challenge and malaria is most
important for helping people,' he says. The worldwide effort to produce a
vaccine against malaria - which kills about 2m people a year, mostly African
children - will be successful within five years, Merieux believes.
Although genetic engineering plays a vital role in making new vaccines,
'there is still plenty of juice left in classical vaccine development,' says
Stanley Plotkin, Merieux medical and scientific director. 'All the different
approaches to an Aids vaccine depend on genetic engineering, but it doesn't
play much of a role in hepatitis A, for example.'
Non-genetic techniques will also improve existing vaccines. WHO is
particularly keen on micro-encapsulation, a new delivery system based on
tiny biodegradable capsules which release vaccine slowly into the
bloodstream in a way that mimics repeated injections.
In the industrialised world, a priority is to produce a new whooping cough
vaccine. The existing one is more likely to provoke damaging side-effects
than any other childhood vaccine. Manufacturers are therefore anxious to
replace the current vaccine, which is based on whole cells of the pertussis
bacteria, with an 'acellular' vaccine containing the most important
antigens.
Although an acellular pertussis vaccine is used routinely in Japan, western
health authorities do not like it because it cannot be administered until
the child is two years old. Large-scale field trials of acellular vaccines
suitable for babies are expected to start in Sweden this year.

<TEXT>
Institut Merieux is an archetypal French pharmaceutical company, with its
complex corporate structure and mixture of private and public ownership.
Rhone-Poulenc, the state-owned chemical group, directly owns 50.8 per cent
of Institut Merieux. It owns a further 43 per cent of Merieux's human health
care subsidiary, Pasteur Merieux Serums et Vaccins, which includes
Connaught, the Canadian vaccine company bought two years ago.
Therefore the French government's overall stake in the Merieux vaccine
business is 72 per cent. Rhone-Poulenc makes itself felt through the
presence of Igor Landau, the group's health care director, on the Institut
Merieux board. It has decisions such as mergers and acquisitions.
The founding family now owns only 17.7 per cent of Institut Merieux but
executive control remains in its hands. Marcel Merieux, a student of Louis
Pasteur, started the business in 1897 and handed it on to his son Charles in
1937. Since 1967 the company has been run by Marcel's grandson Alain.
At the age of 85, Charles remains honorary chairman and stays in close touch
with developments through daily telephone conversations with his son. 'My
father gives me a booster call every morning, wherever I am in the world,'
Alain says.
Charles Merieux makes no secret of his hope that Alain's son Christophe, who
qualifies as a doctor this year, will take over in due course. Alain is more
circumspect when asked about the succession and insists that it will not be
up to him.
However, Alain Merieux also believes that the combination of family
tradition with Rhone-Poulenc's majority ownership gives the company
long-term stability. 'We have no risk of takeover and can devote our efforts
to biology. It is clear that we need to become more profitable but we are
not forced to emphasise profitability in the short term'.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Confessions of a magazine junkie - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a confession to make. I am a computer magazine addict. Fortunately
for me, if not my bank manager, publishers seem hell bent on satisfying my
craving.
At the latest count my local WH Smith had no less than 39 computer magazines
on its shelves including 10 samples of what I describe as the PC generic
magazines which cover the IBM PC compatible market.
By a rough calculation to buy all 10 generic titles each month would cost
Pounds 16.93 or Pounds 203.16 a year - or about half the cost of a basic
Amstrad PC. Indeed the most blindingly obvious trend played out in the
advertising pages of the computer press is the inexorable decline in PC
hardware prices and the parallel surge in performance. If you bought a PC a
year ago you could now either buy the same for half the price or get twice
the performance and speed for the same price.
What passed a year ago for an acceptable entry-level machine, say a computer
based on Intel's 80286 chip running at 12Mhz with 1 megabyte of Ram and a
20Mb hard disc, now looks sluggish and small.
However, although hardware prices are plunging, they are not falling by as
much as most manufacturers/assemblers in the computer magazines' advertising
pages would have us all believe. Computer manufacturers insist on
advertising their products exclusive of Value Added Tax. Thus what appears
to be a system costing Pounds 1,500 will actually cost Pounds 1,762.5 for
customers except those - like businesses - who can reclaim the Vat.
There are one or two honourable exceptions, like mail order supplier
Eversham Micros, which list both the Vat exclusive and inclusive prices, but
most advertisers appear determined to disguise if not mislead. Often the
words 'plus Vat' only appear in the small type at the foot of the page.
Perhaps there is nothing to be done about such sales tactics. However there
seems little excuse for computer magazines which perpetuate such myths by
quoting Vat exclusive prices in their editorial copy.
One example among many comes from the December PC Plus. An article entitled
'How Much Power Can Pounds 1,500 Buy?' proceeds to list and evaluate 11
machines with nominal price tags of less than Pounds 1,500. However, once
Vat is added on all but one of the machines would cost more than Pounds
1,500, and the magazine's 'recommended' system, the Elonex PC-420X, would
cost Pounds 1,733.12 in the configuration tested.
An annoying feature of PC advertising is a growing tendency to strip what is
on offer down to the minimum specification. Some advertisers claim this is
to give the buyer the maximum choice, assuming that they want, or have the
patience, to plough through columns of figures and options to 'build' a
working system. A cynic might argue such tricks are actually designed to
make the 'headline' price seem as small as possible.
Some manufacturers advertise PC systems 'from Pounds X'. Often this price
does not include a screen or a hard disc - without which the machine is
functionally useless - let alone sufficient power and storage for today's
software.
Some magazines make an attempt to overcome price comparison problems by
specifying 'standard' or 'target' systems in their listings, usually at the
back of the magazine. But these listings, helpful though they are, can have
drawbacks. Because prices and specifications are changing so quickly, they
are often out of date by the time the magazine is printed, and they do not
always include cheaper machines assembled by smaller direct sales companies.
Deciding which PC to buy based on advertisments in the computer press is a
difficult business - but 'window shopping' through the pages can still be a
useful experience.

FT  07 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Recruitment techniques likely to be
exported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH approach to the selection of job candidates is likely to be
exported to other European countries as companies increasingly recruit
across national boundaries, according to British psychologists.
There are large differences in recruitment methods among European countries.
The French, for instance, rely heavily on graphology - the analysis of
candidates' hand-writing.
Only 2 per cent of British companies use graphology, according to a survey
of nearly 1,000 organisations cited yesterday at the annual occupational
psychology conference in Liverpool of the British Psychological Society.
Nearly two thirds of British companies use ability tests and more than a
third use personality testing. Almost half use assessment centres and 'task
simulation' to evaluate job applicants' potential, according to the survey.
Mr Roger Holdsworth, from one of the leading publishers of psychometric
tests, Saville and Holdsworth, said at the conference that French
subsidiaries of British companies were having to adopt more rigorous methods
of selecting job candidates, using, for example, personality and ability
tests.
According to Mr Holdsworth, the British 'go a bundle on empirical evidence.
The French don't operate like that and are more likely to employ pure
Cartesian reasoning. They don't require vast studies, as we would, to
establish that handwriting analysis actually works.'
The Germans have been less successful than the British in integrating
psychological testing in the recruitment process because of the greater
'professional elitism' of psychologists in Germany, said Mr Holdsworth.
Germans are more likely to rely on interviews and candidates' track records.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England sold Pounds 1.32bn of government gilt-edged securities
in November, according to official figures released yesterday, Peter Norman
writes. This prompted City analysts to suggest that the government is close
to funding the public sector borrowing requirement for 1991-92.
The Bank's final monetary statistics for November showed large purchases of
Pounds 1.1bn of gilts by the non-bank private sector during the month,
pointing to strong investor interest among institutions.
According to Mr Don Smith, a UK economist for Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged,
the government may have to sell only another Pounds 500m of gilts to fully
fund the Pounds 10.5bn PSBR for 1991-92 forecast in the Treasury's Autumn
Statement.
The Bank revised down slightly its estimate of bank and building society
lending in November - to Pounds 5.5bn from Pounds 5.7bn in provisional
figures published last month.

FT  07 JAN 92 / US urged to slash N-arsenal: Report backs nuclear weapons as
deterrent to third world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US should cut its strategic nuclear arsenal by 60 per cent and
completely revise its missile targeting strategy, according to a report by a
high-level Pentagon advisory panel.
The panel recommends cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to
around 5,000, roughly half the level that would be permitted by the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed last year by the US and the Soviet
Union.
It advocates, however, using the nuclear threat not only to deter nuclear
aggression but also as a deterrent to third world countries which might
possess chemical or biological weapons, and as a symbol of US power in the
world.
The recommendations would represent a significant shift in US nuclear
strategy, but still fall some way short of the changes that some analysts
have suggested in light of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
President George Bush announced in September a series of unilateral measures
that significantly cut the number of tactical nuclear weapons deployed by
the US, but some critics in Congress and outside have urged him to go
further in cutting strategic weapons.
According to reports in the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, the
panel, chaired by former air force secretary Mr Thomas Reed, recommends
preserving a nuclear arsenal that remains larger than the combined total of
warheads possessed by China, France and the UK.
It also argues that maintaining a substantial nuclear deterrent helps
discourage Japan and Germany from developing their own nuclear weapons.
Defence analysts noted yesterday that the report's emphasis on preserving a
nuclear deterrent against third world threats, now that the Soviet threat
has diminished so dramatically, parallels the arguments made by the Defence
Department for keeping weapons systems which were originally designed with
Cold War objectives in mind.
The B2 stealth bomber, for example, was originally devised to penetrate
Soviet air defences. Its backers have faced an increasingly difficult task
in persuading Congress to maintain funding, but have argued that the success
of the F117 stealth fighter in Operation Desert Storm justifies preserving
the B2 for conventional missions.
The report argues for abandoning the US's 1979 pledge not to use its
missiles against third world countries that do not themselves possess
nuclear weapons. It says the nuclear arsenal could be used as a deterrent
against a wide range of threats, such as the annihilation of countries such
as Israel and Taiwan, the seizure of vital raw materials or foreign
domination of a segment of space.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem has called on Britain to accept
international arbitration to settle the two countries' rival claims to the
Falkland Islands.
Over the weekend, Mr Menem said Argentina's decision last year to refer a
border dispute with Chile to a panel of international jurists was a valid
precedent for settling the Falklands question. However, Argentina's Foreign
Ministry yesterday 'clarified' the president's statement, denying that it
implied a formal government commitment.
The ministry said it intended to pursue with 'imagination and firmness all
possible alternatives' in its negotiations with Britain. The ministry said
arbitration would be only one of several options.
However, British officials cut short any talk of arbitration. The embassy in
Buenos Aires said: 'We have no doubt about our sovereignty'.
Inflation in Argentina fell to 84 per cent in 1991, the lowest since 1986,
after reaching 1,344 per cent in 1990. December inflation was 0.6 per cent.

FT  07 JAN 92 / AT&amp;T unveils video phone

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday unveiled what it claims is the
world's first mass-market video-telephone - a machine costing Dollars 1,499
(Pounds 824) that can be used in the home over existing phone lines and
deliver full colour, moving images of a caller.
Video communications are now virtually limited to the business market,
employing systems which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Most rely on
video-conferencing rooms and special digital telecommunications networks.
Rival manufacturers in both the US and Japan have also been developing
inexpensive models for the home market, but AT&amp;T is thought to be the first
to bring a product to market and back it up with its immense marketing
strength. The company is the leading US provider of long-distance telephone
calls and a big global maker of telecommunications equipment.
The AT&amp;T equipment, which requires no special installation, uses a standard
sized telephone and a fold-up 3.3 inch liquid crystal display video screen
and camera lens. Callers who want privacy can close a shutter over the lens.
It will cost the same to use as a normal telephone call.
The AT&amp;T telephone gives a slow motion picture of a caller which is out of
synchronisation with the speaking voice - a big problem with delivering
video services to the home using current technology.
However, Mr Kenneth Bertaccini, president of AT&amp;T consumer products, said
consumers involved in trials of the equipment found its variable picture
motion, between two and 10 frames a second, adequate for their personal
communications.
The company will begin selling the equipment, called VideoPhone 2500, in the
US in May and will also rent out the equipment for under Dollars 30 a day.
It also intends to offer a service for public areas, such as airports and
hotel lobbies, later this year.
The company plans eventually to market the equipment internationally, and is
discussing licensing agreements with a number of companies.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Westinghouse calls on US federal court to drop bribery
charges: Philippines Nuclear Power Allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric of the US has called on a US federal court to drop
bribery and corruption charges against it in connection with a nuclear power
project in the Philippines.
The Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 596m) civil action was brought against
Westinghouse and consultants Burns &amp; Roe, also of the US, by the Philippines
government and the National Power Corporation of the Philippines. Last
autumn, the companies were committed to face trial by jury, which is
scheduled to begin on February 3.
The appeal follows an unexpected judgment by the International Chamber of
Commerce in Geneva, which is hearing aspects of the case. The ICC, shortly
before Christmas, found that the case against Westinghouse was
circumstantial and without merit.
The allegations stem from a contract awarded to Westinghouse in 1976 to
supply the Philippines with a 620 MW nuclear power station. The allegations
claimed that Dollars 17m in consultancy fees paid to Mr Herminio Disini, a
Manila businessman, were passed on to then-president Ferdinand Marcos to
secure the deal. The nuclear station was completed, after several delays, in
1986, shortly before the fall of the Marcos government. It was mothballed
before being put into service by the government of Mrs Corazon Aquino.
A number of issues relating to the performance of the contract were turned
over to the ICC arbitration tribunal in Geneva, but part of the ICC's brief
was to consider the bribery and corruption allegations.
To the surprise of both the defendants and the plaintiffs, the ICC judgment
came down strongly in favour of the US companies.
The judgment said:
' ..There is no direct evidence that Marcos supported Westinghouse because
he expected to benefit (from commission payments to an intermediary). The
circumstantial evidence also fails to prove that Marcos promoted
Westinghouse because he expected to receive (commission payments from an
intermediary). There is no evidence either of any agreement between Marcos
and Westinghouse or (that the intermediary) acted as agent for Marcos.
'Although (the Philippine) parties argue that the circumstantial evidence
establishes that Marcos must have received a share of the commissions (from
the intermediary), the tribunal is not persuaded.'
A Westinghouse official said that the company was delighted with the news as
it 'vindicates the position which Westinghouse has taken for over 14 years,
that is, that not one dime was ever paid by Westinghouse to President
Marcos.'
The company now hopes Judge Dickinson Debevoise, the New Jersey federal
court judge, will drop charges. In his decision to order the jury trial, he
said he found 'ample evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that the
Disini commissions were intended to be paid in whole or in part to President
Marcos.'
According to US legal officials, he now will have to weigh his findings
against those of the ICC. He is expected to rule on the Westinghouse appeal
following oral hearings on January 24. Judge Debevoise will be the presiding
magistrate at the jury trial should it still go ahead.
A spokesman for the plaintiffs said the Philippines government was
considering an appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Arabs await UN response over Israel's Palestinian expulsions

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB leaders continued their talks on the fate of the US-sponsored Middle
East peace process yesterday as they awaited the reaction of the UN Security
Council to Israel's expulsion order against 12 Palestinians living in the
occupied territories.
The three Arab delegations, which had been due to resume negotiations with
Israel in Washington today, have put off their departure for the US in
protest at the Israeli action.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
arrived in Damascus yesterday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad of
Syria following discussions in Cairo and Amman. One of the proposals under
consideration is a mini-summit involving leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and the PLO. The five permanent members of the Security Council have
all individually condemned Israel's action against the 12 Palestinians and
held informal consultations last night on the possible wording of a
resolution. The US is thought likely to support a resolution denouncing the
expulsions if it does not go beyond that issue.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, did nothing to prompt a
different US response yesterday as he defended both the expulsion of
Palestinians and the extra funds which have been voted for building new
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
The US has repeatedly condemned construction of new settlements, describing
the policy as an obstruction to the peace process.
'I know that expulsions must deter terrorist acts ..(and) peace talks have
to bring an end to terror,' Mr Shamir said yesterday after addressing the
parliamentary foreign affairs and defence committee.
Mr Shamir also defended extra funding for Jewish settlement in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, pledged to small right-wing parties to win their
support for the 1992 state budget last week.
'I don't think it has anything to do with the peace talks and I don't see
any contradiction between establishing some settlements and the continuation
of the peace process,' he said.
Asked how he would feel about a condemnation in the Security Council, even
if backed by the US, Mr Shamir said, 'I'd have to say we'd be unhappy about
it.'

JAPAN will probably have to set import targets for US cars and car parts to
satisfy American demands, Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and
industry minister, said yesterday, ahead of President Bush's four-day visit,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The minister was due to appeal to Japan's car industry to boost purchases of
US cars and components.
'I must ask for your co-operation to make (Mr Bush's) visit a success,' he
told industry officials.
Car trade friction and Japan's trade surplus with the US will be high on Mr
Bush's agenda. Japan's big carmakers have announced plans to boost purchases
of foreign-made cars, but some said there were limits to what they could do.
Toyota and Nissan said yesterday they might boost imports further. Sales of
US-made vehicles in Japan for January-November 1991 totalled 27,754, out of
180,852 imported vehicles sold there in the same 11 months.

<TEXT>
MORE talks are expected today between the EC and US over the troubled Gatt
trade negotiations, a European Commission spokesman said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, is likely to raise
problems on Gatt when he meets Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, in
Washington, he said.
Mr Andriessen is expected to hold talks with Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, during his trip, which is mainly to discuss aid to the
former Soviet Union.
Separately, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, was expected to phone Mr
Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, today, the spokesman added.
He gave no details of subjects likely to be raised at the discussions. These
follow failure of EC-US talks last month to reach a deal unblocking the
five-year-old Uruguay Round, deadlocked mainly by disagreement between the
world's two biggest farm exporters on how far and fast to cut farm support.
The EC has also rejected a draft plan put forward by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt
director-general, on December 20. EC trade and farm ministers said the plan
posed many problems, particularly in agriculture.
These ministers are due to meet on January 11 to finalise the EC position,
two days before the deadline for all responses to Mr Dunkel's proposals.
In another newspaper yesterday, Mr Andriessen said it was difficult to say
what the prospects now were for a settlement. 'If there is no deal, both
sides will be responsible,' he was quoted as saying.
Mr MacSharry said last month that bilateral talks were over and that the
process of seeking a farm subsidy compromise would have to continue through
Gatt channels.
Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture minister, said on Sunday he was
confident EC members would continue to refuse further compromise.

US companies and trade industry groups handling Chinese imports yesterday
urged Washington to exempt them from the punitive duties it proposes on any
such items.
'Penalising Tsingtao beer would be fatal to Monarch,' Mr Glen Steinman,
president of Monarch Import Company, founded in 1978 to import the beer,
said in a grim Congressional hearing.
The company has invested Dollars 25m (Pounds 13.7m) in the product, which
would be lost if Tsingtao were chosen to be a casualty of the US-Chinese
eight-month dispute over intellectual property rights.
In Beijing, vice-foreign trade minister Wu Yi said talks on protecting US
copyrights, trademarks and patents could succeed if the US showed more
flexibility.
Wu Yi is China's chief negotiator at the talks. In seeming reaction to US
pressure, China has begun publishing some foreign trade rules. Wu Yi and
assistant US trade representative Joseph Massey are shortly to meet in
Washington, in one last attempt to reach agreement before January 16, the
'firm deadline' set by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative.
Without agreement, 'the US Customs Service will implement any decision to
collect increased tariffs very shortly after that date,' Mrs Hills said. The
US complains about China's copyright law, mainly its poor protection for
computer programmes and sound recordings, and failure to safeguard copyright
for US works first published elsewhere.
The row yesterday focused on the impact of retaliation on US companies and
the US economy. A 'hit-list' of imports worth Dollars 1.5bn has been
selected, to be at least halved if final sanctions are imposed. Trade
officials have said they will try to focus retaliation on China's state-run
factories.
Mr Steinman stressed that Qingdao Brewery, producer of Tsingtao beer, is
owned by the city of Qingdao, which has been seeking improved intellectual
property rights protection. Other targets may include leather goods,
textiles, watches, apparel, electronics and bauxite.
Mr J Sy Hoying, president of the North American Processing Company, said his
small business would be crushed if aluminium tariffs were imposed. The
company, which began selling Chinese bauxite products in 1990, employs 25
workers in West Virginia in an area 'devastated' by unemployment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S four leading parties have called new talks tomorrow to deal with
the soaring numbers of asylum-seekers in the country, amid signs that their
previous compromise is falling apart.
The issue threatens once again to explode politically, with an arson attack
on a refugee hostel in the Black Forest on Sunday night leaving a Lebanese
immigrant critically ill.
At the same time, publication of statistics for 1991 showed the number of
asylum-seekers in Germany reached 256,112, almost 33 per cent higher than a
year earlier. The figures were boosted by a sharp increase in the number of
refugees fleeing the civil war in Yugoslavia, and those from eastern Europe.
The latest cross-party talks between the ruling coalition and the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) come amid reports that their previous agreement, to
protect refugees by gathering them in large camps and to accelerate
procedures for dealing with asylum applications, cannot be put into effect
for months, if at all.
The Christian Democrats (CDU), senior partners in the ruling coalition,
maintain the vast majority of asylum-seekers are, in reality, economic
migrants seeking work. They want an amendment to the German constitution to
allow immigration officials to stop such applicants at the border and send
them home.
The SPD and the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition reject changes in the
constitution as too drastic and insist the problem can be dealt with by
improving procedures to process asylum-seekers.
Only one federal state - Baden-Wurttemberg - has adequate capacity to house
refugees in the proposed 'collection camps,' according to a spokesman for
the Interior Ministry.
There are still not enough legally trained personnel to process the flood of
asylum applications within six weeks, as the parties had agreed. And legal
amendments are still required to the asylum law to speed up application
procedures from the current average of about 12 months to only six weeks.
The asylum issue remains acutely sensitive at a time of rising discontent
over higher taxes to pay for German unification, and the inflow of
immigrants of both German and non-German origin.
The latest attack was on a hostel housing some 40 refugees at Waldkirch in
Breisgau, near Freiburg in the country's prosperous south-west.
Both entrances to the hostel were on fire when the police and fire-brigade
arrived at 1am, and the inmates had retreated to the third floor. Twenty
were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, and one man was
reported yesterday still to be in a critical condition.
Skinhead gangs have carried out a string of attacks on immigrant hostels
over the past six months, although they have been condemned by all political
parties except the extreme right.
Yesterday saw a spontaneous demonstration by about 400 people in Waldkirch,
protesting against 'hostility to foreigners.'
Publication of the latest asylum statistics seems certain to heighten
debate, however. They show that almost 77 per cent of applications were
rejected as unfounded, another 16 per cent were withdrawn, and only 6.9 per
cent were deemed to be genuine cases for political asylum under Germany's
liberal laws.
Of the total, 74,854 came from Yugoslavia, 40,504 from Romania, 23,877 from
Turkey and 12,056 from Bulgaria.

FT  07 JAN 92 / European Diary (Czechoslovakia): Monastery tempts Prague's
elite with taste of Hell

<TEXT>
LATE in the evening, when most of Prague is asleep, black Mercedes and BMWs
make their way to the 800-year-old Strahov monastery on a hill above the
baroque capital.
A hand-made sign swings from a tree at the main gate. It reads Peklo or
'Hell'.
The monastery, confiscated along with all church property by the communist
authorities in the 1950s, was recently returned to the Roman Catholic
church. The abbot of the monastery, Father Opat, has found ingenious ways to
raise money for much-needed restoration.
Five metres underground, in cellars where monks did penance in earlier
centuries, the local nouveau-riche mingle on a disco dance floor with
ambassadors and foreign visitors. At dawn all is quiet again, and the sign
is taken down.
'I think he just believed me when I said the club would not hamper the
monastery's life,' says Mr Doriano Maltaliati, the club's manager, speaking
of his arrangement with Father Opat.
Mr Maltaliati, an Italian who owns six restaurants in Milan, had to do some
hard bargaining with the priest to secure the three-year rental contract. Fr
Opat was considering offers from about 10 other western investors.
'This is going to be a private elitist club, for members only and without
any shabby business going on,' the Italian businessman explains.
Not a note can be heard outside the cellars; parties take place between 12th
century walls, moist with four natural underground water sources.
'In July we were wearing winter coats to come down here. Everything was damp
and not a single light could be lit. It was a complete ruin. Forty-three
permits from various ministries were needed to restore it.'
Mr Maltaliati points to the elegant black steel lamps hanging on the walls.
'I designed everything. Czech entrepreneurs made it all.'
Fr Opat, meanwhile, is making a small fortune renting the floor space at a
price which rivals Paris or Milan. Hell is raising profits.
The priest is also planning to rent some of the monastery grounds to a
foreign company which wants to build a hotel.
Mr Maltaliati runs a restaurant within the club, but getting the right food
has not been easy. 'It's really hell,' he admits, laughing. Every day I have
to send one person to go around the city to find just lettuce.'
He says most goods have to be imported from Italy in small quantities, to
get through the borders. 'Officially, samples of imported food products
should be left at the Agriculture Ministry for approval but it would take
months.'
In a dark enclave next to the dance floor, the young waiter wearing a black
tie says he earns twice the average local salary, and then asks: 'You mean
officially or unofficially?'
Mr Maltaliati's ambitions do not stop with Hell. He is buying a restaurant
at the foot of the medieval Charles bridge in the heart of Prague. It will
specialise in traditional Czech cuisine, a rarity in the city judging from
uniform menus offering the same five or six dishes.
Plans also include a cafe serving espresso coffee and croissants, and a
showroom next to the Old Theatre which will offer luxurious bathroom
equipment.
'I was making more money in Milan but Prague has a special air about it,'
says Mr Maltaliati.
'You can just do crazy things here you could never afford in other western
towns.'

'PLEASE pardon the disturbance,' said a slogan pasted in white on an
armoured personnel carrier on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue yesterday.
To call the fighting in the streets of the city in the last two weeks a
'disturbance' is a distinctly un-Georgian understatement. Civilians had been
unable to walk along the city's main street for two weeks as it was
transformed into a battlefield. They had not even been able to walk through
surrounding streets without frequently dashing for cover from stray bullets
while machine gun fire and explosions rent the air.
Yesterday they picked their way somewhat sombrely through the ruins of what
was previously an elegant tree-lined avenue, with broken glass and pieces of
masonry crunching underfoot.
'Our heart has been destroyed,' said Gogi, a student of international law.
'The heart of Tbilisi is our heart and it is crying out. This vandal, this
dictator, caused all this but it was worth it to gain our freedom. He was a
monster, I guarantee you.'
Earlier, an opposition soldier perched on top of an armoured personnel
carrier had sprayed his comrades with champagne, the pop of the cork
followed by a deafening victory salute of machine gun fire in the air.
Stubble covered cheeks brushed together as men in flak jackets kissed one
another.
However, the civilian population was less exuberant, displaying only a sense
of relief that the shooting had stopped.
There was little celebration of the opposition victory but neither were
Gamsakhurdia supporters to be found shedding tears about his departure.
Perhaps they were too scared.
Tbilisi had paid a high price for the ousting of the man the opposition
liked to call Satan.
The colonnaded frontage of the government building was pockmarked with
bullet holes, some of its columns almost shot through by the howitzer which
was laying abandoned on the other side of the street.
Thick smoke billowed from the northern wing of the building, as flames
licked round the window.
Opposition soldiers and early civilian arrivals seized almost anything they
could move, ripping the radios out of the crumpled cars on the street,
carrying television sets out of the basement and rifling through desk
drawers in the offices.
We followed them into the abandoned basement where only the previous day Mr
Gamsakhurdia had met the media, while soldiers sat and smoked and played
chess.
Now much of it was in pitch darkness. There seemed to be more tables around
than before - trip wires, it was suggested. We quickly left.
Other buildings around the square included blackened wrecks - School Number
1 founded in 1802 and the most famous in Georgia, founded in 1802, where Mr
Gamsakhurdia and Mr Tengiz Kitovani, a rebel leader, both studied.
Where there had been a line of tents which housed the fervent supporters of
a Mr Gamsakhurdia outside the parliament for more than three months there
were piles of ashes.
On a table a chess set had somehow survived the fires. One old woman tutted
angrily as she surveyed the scene.
'Nothing good will come of this,' she muttered, before displaying the
ambivalent attitude towards dictatorship typical of her generation. 'Stalin
would never have allowed all this.'

THE SWISS, it seems, like to tax themselves to pay for projects to improve
the environment. They willingly pay extra for batteries to cover the high
cost of recycling them, and in some cantons they pay higher taxes if their
cars do not have catalytic converters.
Now the Zurcher Kantonal Bank, one of the country's largest mortgage
lenders, is trying to capitalise on this unusual enthusiasm, launching what
it calls an environment savings account.
The idea is that the customer will take a 1.5 per cent cut in the normal
interest rate he would receive, and the bank will reduce the interest it
charges on loans for environmental projects.
Mr Stephan Barth, chief clerk in the bank's liability management department,
said yesterday the idea came mainly from customers. 'They want us to do
something,' he said. It had nothing to do with the fact that the bank, like
other mortgage lenders in Switzerland, was suffering a severe squeeze on its
margins.
Mr Barth pointed out that it was not entirely an innovation. In November,
1990, Alternative Bank Schweiz was established at Olten committed to lend
only to companies making environmentally friendly products. It offers lower
interest rates for both borrowers and lenders, and has managed to attract
more than 5,000 customers from all over the country and build up total
assets of SFr55m (Pounds 21.6m).
Zurcher Kantonal Bank has established what it considers to be a modest
target for the environment savings accounts, hoping to attract some SFr10m
in deposits this year.
Mr Barth said he expected that the bulk of the money would to come from
individuals who would put just a portion of their savings into one. 'We
wanted to set up an investment trust, but when we thought about it, we
realised that it would be difficult deciding in what shares to invest. So we
dropped the idea.'

FT  06 JAN 92 / Iraq spurns 'colonial' UN conditions for sale of oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ said yesterday it would never accept United Nations resolutions
imposing 'colonial' conditions on its sale of oil, agencies report.
'Iraq's position towards Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 is fixed
and will never change,' the Foreign Ministry told the Iraqi News Agency.
Iraqi and UN experts are to meet in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss possible
export of Iraqi oil, still banned by a Gulf war trade embargo.
The UN offered last year to let Iraq sell oil worth Dollars 1.6bn, under
terms which would deny Baghdad control of the income and allocate part of it
for war reparations. Baghdad rejects the conditions set out in the
resolution for the sale of its oil, saying that strict UN monitoring of the
transactions and the presence of UN and foreign oil company supervisors were
an insult to Iraqi sovereignty.
US and British diplomats on the council have said they are prepared to be
flexible about many of the resolutions' terms but that basic guidelines,
including UN monitoring of sales and proceeds, could not be altered.
While Baghdad is suffering from the embargo, the UN also needs money derived
from oil sales to pay for relief supplies it distributes in Iraq as well as
for the commission destroying or removing Iraq's nuclear, chemical,
biological and ballistic weapons.
UN sources say the following issues are expected to be raised. Some will
need formal or informal approval from the Security Council or its sanctions
committee.
Pipeline: Iraq has indicated it wants to sell oil to pre-war Asian clients,
mainly Japan, through its Mina al-Bakr oil terminal. A secretary general's
report accepted by the council said the oil should run through the northern
pipeline to Turkey, the only one operating at the end of the war. Security
Council sources said there would be no objections to Mina al-Bakr, but only
if proper monitoring were possible.
Contracts: Iraq wants guarantees that it would be able to make long-term
contracts, which would enable its state oil company to establish itself
again in international markets. Council sources said this was a possibility.
Monitoring: Baghdad wants 'transparency' in all financial transactions so
that it can see where the proceeds are going and how humanitarian goods are
bought and delivered. Under the resolutions, Iraq markets the oil but the UN
has to approve all contracts, open an escrow account and then supervise
Iraqi purchases and distribution of food and other supplies. The monitoring
of oil sales is to be done by officials from Norway's state oil company. It
is expected the council would be flexible on this demand if UN officials
work out the technicalities.

<TEXT>
FRANCE is to withdraw its troops from Chad now that government forces have
crushed a rebellion by troops loyal to deposed president Hissene Habre,
foreign minister Roland Dumas said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
France sent 450 paratroopers to Chad from bases in France and nearby African
states to boost its 1,200-man permanent garrison in Chad, and protect the
3,000 French nationals there, because of a rebel offensive against the
capital N'Djamena last week.
Saying the Chad government had the situation under control, Mr Dumas told
Radio France-Info: 'The presence of the reinforcements we sent will no
longer be justified if the situation is confirmed. It is a question of a few
days or of a few weeks.'
The Chad government said on Saturday its forces had crushed the rebellion by
Habre forces, killing 425 rebels including six of his top aides.
An official communique on state radio said government troops suffered 25
dead and 70 wounded in fierce fighting to recapture four garrison towns in
the Lake Chad area west of N'Djamena.

<TEXT>
THE once-mighty Soviet army is striving to avoid being dragged into the
fighting in Georgia in spite of increasing attacks on its men which are
severely testing its patience, Reuter reports from Tbilisi.
The army, reduced to virtual helplessness after 70 years of Soviet rule in
Georgia, remains neutral in fighting between President Zviad Gamsakhurdia
and rebel groups besieging him in his parliament.
Colonel Vassily Belchenko, aide to the commander of the army's
Transcaucasian district, said
four soldiers and one officer had been killed by gunmen since fighting began
in late December.
The army, now effectively controlled by Russian president Boris Yeltsin,
fights back where it can.
But any serious intervention by army forces, whether sanctioned by Moscow or
the result of an internal mutiny, could have disastrous consequences for
efforts to create a Commonwealth of Independent States from the ruins of the
old Soviet Union.
The Russian-dominated army is still seen by most republics as a central
threat.
Meanwhile the Tbilisi garrison can only sit and watch as a few hundred or at
most a few thousand men and youths destroy the picturesque city centre
building by building.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Moscow bank saved from closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOSCOW NARODNY bank has satisfied the Bank of England that it has adequate
capital, following the injection of new funds from Vnesheconombank, the
former Soviet trade bank.
The new funds have prevented the possible closure of MNB, which has been
threatened by the mounting economic crisis in the former Soviet Union.
Vnesheconombank has transferred Pounds 70m to Moscow Narodny, raising its
total capital to Pounds 190m, an increase of 58 per cent.
The injection follows a commitment by the Russian government at the end of
November to provide sufficient financial support for MNB to meet its
obligations. This followed talks with the Bank of England, which was
concerned about possible withdrawal of deposits by western banks in response
to the economic crisis in the former Soviet Union.
The new funds will allow MNB to make additional charges against loans to the
former Soviet Union and eastern European states.
'We are raising capital to guard against contingencies,' Mr William Newman,
assistant general manager of MNB, said at the weekend. MNB's shareholders
have already channeled new funds to the bank. In June 1990 it received
Pounds 17m and in February 1991 it received Pounds 26m to help write off its
Bulgarian debts.
MNB is 51 per cent owned by Gosbank, the former Soviet central bank and
Vnesheconombank, which is under the administrative control of the Russian
central bank. Talks are underway about the transfer of the Vnesheconombank
and Gosbank stakes to the Russian central and foreign trade banks.
The Russian government has made a commitment to central banks to provide
backing for the Soviet-owned Banque Commerciale de l'Europe du Nord in
Paris, the Ost-west Handelsbank in Frankfurt, the East West United Bank in
Luexmbourg and Donau Bank in Austria.
These banks were required to clarify their position with their regulatory
authorities under an agreement by the Group of Seven industrial countries to
defer Soviet debt repayments. The G7 was concerned that a liquidity crisis
at one of Vnesheconombank's western subsidiaries would damage the west's
financial system.
MNB, which has operated as a Soviet-UK trade bank in London since 1919, is
thought to have a continuing role in financing trade and investment for
Russia.
At the end of 1990, it had deposits of Pounds 1.5bn, roughly divided between
Vnesheconombank and western banks.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Ratner returns to UK amid mounting concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD RATNER, controversial chairman of Ratners Group, last night flew
back from New York to London to confront mounting concern about the
financial future of the jewellery company he built up from a small family
business into the UK's biggest chain.
Ratners is expected to make a statement about the company's prospects
following what is believed to have been a dismal Christmas trading period.
Mr Ratner said last night that a board meeting was being held today at which
Christmas trading would be discussed and an announcement would be made
later. It is thought the group's pre-Christmas aggressive discounting failed
to stimulate sales sufficiently to avoid a massive erosion of margins.
City analysts are bracing themselves for bad news and suggest the company's
losses may have deepened following the Pounds 17.7m deficit at the interim
stage. Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 112.1m.
If trading has been as weak as feared, Ratners may be in danger of breaching
its banking covenants and may be forced into seeking a restructuring of its
unwieldy short-term debt.
In the past Ratners has toyed with the idea of floating part of its US
operations or selling assets in the UK to raise cash. But this would be
difficult given market conditions on both sides of the Atlantic.
The group's problems have been exacerbated in the US where Zale, the
country's biggest chain, seems to be heading towards seeking protection from
its creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy laws. Sales at Ratners's
1,000 Sterling and Kay stores have been hit as Zale has dumped stock on the
market at greatly reduced prices.
Ratners' shares have fallen heavily over the past year from a high of 191p
to 22p. The company has a market value of Pounds 64.5m.
For several months Ratners has been looking to recruit a chairman to help
restore confidence and allow Mr Ratner to split the positions of chairman
and managing director.
Several big institutional investors have sold their shareholdings in recent
months as the recession and Ratners' high borrowings took their toll.
The company has also suffered from adverse publicity after Mr Ratner's
remark last April that a cheap sherry decanter set sold well because it was
'total crap'.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Factory pay down as productivity rises: Optimism from CBI
contrasts with printing industry forecast of 'double-dip' recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS are reporting a sharp increase in productivity and a downturn
in pay settlements for the second half of 1991, a trend which is expected to
be accentuated this year, according to the Confederation of British
Industry.
The CBI's findings will be welcomed by ministers as further evidence that
the recession is bringing wage inflation under control.
However, the CBI's optimism contrasts sharply with a report from the British
Printing Industries Federation which says the results of its latest trends
survey are 'frightening' and show the printing industry heading for a
'double-dip recession'.
The CBI's Pay Databank, which has in the past produced productivity
statistics more optimistic than the official data, says manufacturers which
made pay awards in the third quarter of 1991 reported annual productivity
gains of 5.5 per cent, compared with 3.4 per cent in the previous two
quarters.
According to the labour market statistics published by the Department of
Employment last month the increase in manufacturing output per head in the
third quarter of 1991 was only 1.7 per cent higher than in the same period a
year earlier.
In the current year the CBI expects manufacturing productivity to rise 6.4
per cent. Economists say some increase in productivity is to be expected
while the economy is pulling out of a recession as output starts to recover
while companies are still shedding labour.
On pay, the CBI notes a continuing decline in average settlements in
manufacturing. The third-quarter figure averaged 5.4 per cent compared with
an average of 6.3 per cent in the previous quarter and 8.8 per cent a year
before. Settlements in service companies averaged 6.4 per cent in the second
half of 1991 compared with 7.1 per cent in the first half of 1991 and 8.9
per cent in the second half of 1990.
Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said: 'With productivity in UK
manufacturing industry rising, and pay settlements now below the level of
those in Germany and closing on those in France, the outlook for the
competitiveness of British businesses, for inflation, and  - in the longer
term for interest rates  - is good.'
The British Printing Industries Federation survey was markedly more
depressed about the economic outlook. The BPIF said that 'the small light at
the end of the tunnel seems to have been extinguished'.
The trends survey found that 89 per cent of companies had order books below
the seasonal norm at Christmas and only 7 per cent of companies believe that
conditions will ease in the first quarter of 1992. Seventy per cent believe
that trading will stay at the present depressed levels and 23 per cent see a
further decline.
Mr Nick Winks, chairman of the federation's government and industry
committee, said of the survey: 'The results are very frightening. The
printing industry . . . is clearly facing a double-dip recession.'
About 80 per cent of larger print companies and 20 per cent of smaller ones
have reduced employment and many plan to do so again in the opening months
of 1992, says the federation.

<TEXT>
THE FOUNDER of Hyundai, the leading South Korean industrial group, has
announced that he is to retire from business and form a new political party
to oppose the government.
The decision by Mr Chung Ju Yung, one of the country's leading
industrialists, will widen a developing rift in the traditionally close
relationship between government and the big conglomerates at the heart of
the Korean economy.
The move follows Mr Chung's announcement on Friday that he was retiring from
business after a career in which he transformed Hyundai from a small
construction company into a conglomerate with annual sales of Dollars 40bn.
His political ambitions will add to the problems facing the ruling
Democratic Liberal party as it prepares for a series of important elections
this year, culminating in a presidential poll.
An official at Hyundai, Korea's largest car manufacturer and biggest
shipbuilder, said Mr Chung was aiming to field candidates in parliamentary
elections due by early May. Mr Chung would also offer his support to a
candidate for presidential elections due by the end of the year, the
official said.
His plans are the latest development in the increasingly tense relationship
between the government and the industrial conglomerates which dominate the
economy. Hyundai, which Mr Chung founded in 1947, is now involved in
electronics, petrochemicals and financial services as well as cars and
shipbuilding.
A party formed by Mr Chung would face the difficult task of overcoming
growing public resentment towards big business. Its initial objective would
be to win a minimum of 20 of the 299 seats in the national assembly.
But a party headed by the charismatic business leader would be a thorn in
the side of the DLP. The ruling party, which holds two-thirds of the seats
in the national assembly, has seen its popularity eroded by a host of
economic problems, ranging from double digit inflation to a rapidly
expanding trade deficit. It is also threatened by increased friction between
the three factions in the party.
Mr Chung, a vocal critic of government economic policies, has clashed with
the administration of President Roh Tae Woo on several occasions. In
September, Mr Chung, members of his family, and subsidiaries of the Hyundai
group were levied penalty taxes of won 136.1bn (USDollars 181.5m) for
evasion of inheritance taxes and irregular share transactions.
Details of Mr Chung's political ambitions and policies are expected to be
announced later this month.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Outlook bleak for US retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOURTH-QUARTER earnings prospects for US retailers have been hit by figures
showing disappointing sales for many chains in December, including the
critically important pre-Christmas period.
The figures provide further evidence that US consumer confidence remains
depressed and is unlikely to provide an engine for recovery from national
recession in the immediate future.
Shares in many retailing companies dipped on Friday following the release of
the figures, moving contrary to a rise on the day of almost 30 points in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
An index of year-on-year sales at leading retailers, compiled by brokers
Alex Brown &amp; Sons, gained just 1.8 for the month, against expectations of 3
per cent, and on an inflation-adjusted basis fell 1 per cent.
However, the misery was not equally shared. The Gap, a fast-growing clothing
chain, produced a 14 per cent year-on-year increase in sales on a
'same-store' basis  - that is, sales from stores which have been open for
more than a year. Including new stores, sales jumped 30 per cent to Dollars
2.34bn (Pounds 1.28bn).
Wal-Mart Stores, a rapidly expanding southern cut-price chain, saw a 26 per
cent rise in overall sales to Dollars 5.86bn, though this was trimmed to 5
per cent on a same-store basis.
But traditional department store chains fared less well. Sears, Roebuck  -
the largest US retailing group  - saw a 1.8 per cent drop in same-store
sales, while overall sales fell 2 per cent to Dollars 3.81bn. JC Penney
produced a 0.1 per cent increase in same-store sales and a 1.4 per cent rise
in overall sales, to Dollars 2.44bn.
Analysts said weak sales, combined with strong price-cutting over the past
month to attract Christmas trade, would probably mean lower fourth-quarter
profits for several large retailing groups.
The poor retailing climate, which is expected to continue well into this
year, will also increase the threat of bankruptcy hanging over some large
and many small chains.
Last Friday saw Seaman Furniture, the largest furniture retailer in the
north-eastern US, file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the courts,
blaming a 'severe and prolonged recession' in its markets. The north-east
has been particularly hard hit by recession.
Seaman was the subject of a 1988 leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg, Kravis &amp;
Roberts (KKR), the biggest of the US buy-out investment groups which emerged
in the 1980s, and had to undergo a financial reconstruction the following
year because of debt repayment difficulties.
Earlier in the week Zales, the largest US jewellery chain, announced plans
for a restructuring, including the closure of 400 of its 2,000 stores and
the cessation of payment to creditors. Its creditors want to have it placed
in involuntary bankruptcy.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Opec catches a winter chill: Deborah Hargreaves says tough
decisions lie ahead for oil exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When ministers from the world's leading oil-exporting nations meet in Geneva
in six weeks, they face difficult decisions over production cuts if they are
to stem a further steep slide in oil prices by the spring. Prices for North
Sea Brent crude have slipped by Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 18.50 in the
past month in an already weak world market, prompting calls from some
smaller producers for emergency action when the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (Opec) meets.
Algeria has been vociferous in its calls for an emergency Opec meeting after
seeing its oil revenues eroded by oil prices as low as Dollars 16-Dollars 17
a barrel  - Dollars 5 a barrel shy of Opec's target price.
It is an unusual situation for the time of year: when the weather turns
frosty in the western hemisphere, world oil prices usually reach their peak,
but this year prices have not followed form. Several reasons lie behind the
price decline, the most important being that traders had anticipated a cold
winter and a continuing drop in deliveries from the former Soviet Union, and
thus a strong call on available oil supplies. In addition, they were banking
on a substantial pick-up in demand as the world economy headed for recovery.
When oil prices rose to about Dollars 23 a barrel in early November, many
industry observers speculated that the traditional winter peak had come too
soon. They seem to have been proved right. The weather has remained
relatively warm and the dip in Soviet production has not been as great as
expected. At the same time, the US, UK and other western economies have been
much slower to recover than expected, with the result that oil consumption
has failed to show much of an increase.
Stagnant demand has prompted the International Energy Agency, the west's oil
watchdog, to revise downwards its estimate for OECD usage in the first
quarter of 1992 from 39.2m barrels a day (b/d) to 39m b/d  - a rise of just
1 per cent over the same period in 1991.
The outlook for the market has been made even more gloomy by the action of
11 of Opec's 13 members, which have continued to produce as much as they can
despite flat demand. This excess production has more than made up for the
radically reduced output from Iraq and Kuwait: Iraq is still restricted from
exporting oil by UN sanctions imposed after the Gulf war, while Kuwait is
rebuilding its oil industry after the devastation wrought by Iraqi troops.
The consuming nations have looked to Opec to pump as much oil as it can to
compensate for the absence of these two big exporters since the onset of the
Gulf crisis in August 1990. This flat-out production by Opec stretched its
production capacity and caused oil prices to rise as companies built stocks
in anticipation of any shortfall in supply.
Consumers now believe that they may have overdone their cautious
stockpiling. 'I would say the market is now over-supplied with oil,' said Mr
Peter Bogin, oil consultant at Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
'Company stocks are high and demand is low.'
Cold weather in coming months could still give a short-term fillip to the
oil price, but the weakness of the underlying trend has shifted the focus on
to Opec and the need to introduce concrete cuts in production. The
organisation is currently producing some 24m b/d, but needs to cut this by
at least 2m b/d by the second quarter of next year if it is to stabilise
prices.
Without swift Opec action, some smaller producers fear the market could
collapse in the same way that North Sea oil prices plunged from about
Dollars 30 to Dollars 9 a barrel in the spring of 1986. This sharp drop
prompted many US and UK companies to slash investment plans  - a move which
has only been reversed in the past two years.
Producer countries were also hit badly by the slump in prices. Yet five
years on ministers from the richer Opec members  - notably Saudi Arabia,
despite its pressing budget problems caused by its contribution to the cost
of the Gulf war  - are more sanguine about the outlook and have resisted
calls for an emergency meeting before the regular one scheduled for February
12.
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are unwilling to commit themselves to a
formula for cutting output before trying to thrash out a compromise in the
discreet talks that surround Opec meetings.
'There is a recognition of the need to make some adjustment to production at
the next meeting, but we will face many problems about how to do it,' one
Gulf source commented. The producers face tough battles in trying to reach a
consensus on how high they expect market demand to be in the second quarter
of this year; they will also be hard-pressed to convince other members of
their own actual capacity levels which many try to artificially inflate in
order to gain a higher production quota.
Saudi Arabia has increased its dominance in the stormy producers' club since
the Gulf war under Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister. He is unwilling
to relinquish the country's 35 per cent share of Opec's overall export
market. Saudi Arabia has boosted production from 5.4m b/d before the Gulf
crisis to 8.5m b/d at great additional expense and is unlikely to agree to a
reduction much below 7m b/d.
'The Saudis want a deal that gives them the maximum flexibility to call the
shots and cut production at their own discretion,' said Mr Fareed Mohamedi,
senior economist at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based
consultancy.
February's meeting could steer clear of a return to formal production quotas
in a bid to cut output, as has happened at several Opec meetings since the
Gulf war. A more likely outcome in Geneva is that producers will agree a
formula such as an all-round cut of 5 per cent to 7 per cent in each
producer's output. There is likely to be a great deal of wrangling over how
this can be achieved.
Whether this formula will be enough to stem the decline on world oil markets
is not clear. Mr Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies believes that Opec continually acts to stave off a short-term crisis
without giving much thought to long-term trends in the market.
'Opec could lose its credibility as a crisis-management organisation by
failing to think far enough ahead,' he said. For instance the organisation
will have to accommodate the full return of Kuwait and the possible re-entry
of Iraq to the market later this year. This should entail further cuts by
producers if prices are to remain stable, but ministers shy away from
discussing the issue until market crises force them to do so. They disclose
little beyond hoping that demand will rise later in the year to absorb all
the oil on the market.
Traders know Opec has the power to influence prices, but the longer it
refrains from using it, the more the market will test its will by pushing
prices downwards. 'Opec's more subtle approach to market management is
definitely riskier,' said Mr Mohamedi.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Incentives get a boost - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is certain to be a very hard year for arts sponsorship, probably the
hardest in the history of a business which has enjoyed unbroken growth since
its origins in the mid 1970s.
The majority of companies link their expenditure on sponsorship, along with
charitable giving, environmental aid, and good works generally, to their
profitability. With profits down last year virtually across the board, the
tithe for the arts will be reduced. The exception will be those companies
which are committed to sponsorship  - either as an act of faith or because
they know it makes good business sense.
The minister for the arts, Tim Renton, has acknowledged the possibility of a
crisis by allocating most of the extra Pounds 1m he wheedled out of the
Treasury for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (bringing it to
Pounds 4.5m a year) to those long-term sponsors of the arts who have kept
the faith.
In the past the BSIS has been geared towards first-time sponsors. That
element remains but from April companies returning for a second helping
qualify for Pounds 1 in Government money for every Pounds 2 they give,
instead of Pounds 1 for every Pounds 4 as at present, and sponsors for a
fourth year now qualify for a top up  - Pounds 1 for every Pounds 4 they
contribute. This should encourage large multinationals, the hard pressed
group most likely to reduce their sponsorship in 1992, to maintain their
involvement. This hunt for new applicants suggests that ABSA (Association
Business Sponsorship Arts), which administers the scheme, does not expect to
be overwhelmed with sponsors.
The BSIS scheme has attracted over the years 2,000 new sponsors who have
poured Pounds 30m into the arts and attracted Pounds 15m from the
government. Renton is allocating some of the additional Pounds 1m to the
opening of an ABSA office in the north of England.
Last month the London Mozart Players launched its promotional video aimed at
sponsors, an impressive advertisement in which Prince Edward, the LMP's
patron, acted as anchor man to an enthusiastic gathering of possible
contacts. The LMP played and the champagne flowed. The event took place in
an empty office suite in Mayfair.
The party was hosted by the suite's developers, the Imry Group and Speyhawk,
which also invited to the concert prospective tenants of its development. It
was yet another example of the synergy that the property crisis has
encouraged, using the arts to draw in visitors who, without the incentive of
a concert or an art show, would probably not bother to give the offices a
first glance.
A month or so ago another property company, Lynton, in an attempt to
stimulate interest in its Eversholt Street development, commissioned a 25 ft
high reproduction of a painting by the American artist Robert Heindel, which
depicts Jane Sanig, a principal dancer with London City Ballet, and which is
entitled 'Pursued by a Beast called Passion'.
Any tenant taking space in the building is presented with a year's free
corporate membership of the LCB, worth Pounds 1,000, plus a limited edition
print by Heindel. Also in with a potential gain from the deal is the Halcyon
Gallery of Birmingham which exhibits the artist.
The area which has tried to cash in most on the arts is Docklands. The
Canary Wharf development has its own concert hall and a costly programme of
free events for the pioneer office workers there. During the summer many
Dockland developments, from Tower Bridge Piazza to the Tobacco Dock shopping
mall, were giving over empty space for art shows, sometimes to art school
students, sometimes to professional artists  - all in an effort to bring
some life to dead developments and to lure potential tenants.
The Quinlan Terry development over Charing Cross station, a work of art in
itself, has played host to numerous events, including an art show organised
by the gallery Pomeroy Purdy. This year, in a further turn of the
roundabout, even more property developers will be looking to arts
organisations for promotional help, rather than vice versa.
Arts organisations have not exploited Gift Aid to its full potential  - not
that there is much potential in this Treasury-thwarted scheme to offer tax
incentives for charitable givers. But the Tate Gallery has just received
Pounds 90,000 from a private patron using Gift Aid. The money will pay for
an archivist to investigate the Kenneth Clark archive which the gallery
received in lieu of death duties. Earlier this year the Tate was able to
purchase a Wright of Derby painting, thanks in part to Pounds 100,000 in
Gift Aid contributed by property man John Ritblat.
Arts organisations have been slow to approach companies with money-raising
alternatives in addition to direct sponsorship. They have been especially
unimaginative in getting sponsors to pay for services which could in their
turn unlock sizeable sums of money. One of the Tate's brightest initiatives
in 1991 was to persuade Tate &amp; Lyle, which after all shares with it a
funding millionaire, to renew its connection with the gallery and sponsor a
three-year membership drive for more Friends of the Tate.
The company financed new leaflets, an advertising campaign, and a Friend's
desk in the gallery. This has already added 2,500 Friends, which at Pounds
25 a time, makes a useful contribution towards the fund to purchase new
acquisitions.
The record companies are notoriously stingy sponsors, given their dependence
on musical creativity for their profits. But Thorn-EMI is digging deeply
into its pocket to pay for a European tour by Beethoven's piano.
The instrument was given to the composer in 1817 by its maker, Thomas
Broadwood, and is now in a museum in Budapest. It will be played as it
travels around the Continent, ending up in the UK in the early summer. EMI
artist Melvyn Tan will perform on the piano, which is insured for Pounds 5m,
in Bath and at the Barbican, and recordings will inevitably be made.
The National Maritime Museum is the most entrepreneurial of our important
national museums, the one which at least thinks about an existence without
government subsidy. It plans to open a new gallery in the summer dedicated
to 'Seapower in the 20th century', thanks to a Pounds 400,000 sponsorship
from the Evergreen Group, a Taiwan-based shipping company. The gallery is
the first step in a Pounds 4m refurbishment of the museum's south-west wing.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Divided it fell, but united it should rise - As 1992
dawns, Colin Amery stresses the importance of rebuilding Berlin as a whole
city again / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week an editorial in the FT spoke of the differing political visions
that are vying for supremacy in the construction of the new Europe.
Naturally enough it was concerned about international perspectives for the
new community and the prospects for political and economic progress.
Architecture was not mentioned, but it does have an important role, both as
visible evidence of material progress and as an outward sign of historical
and cultural values.
1992 is the year for architects to take advantage of the opening up of the
single market, and British architects would be well advised to look both at
the enormous opportunities and the strength of the architectural
competition. Two particular countries demonstrate these facets of the
situation very clearly. One is the newly united Germany; the other is the
recently democratised Spain.
At a conference recently held at the Bauhaus called Berlin scenarios of
development, one speaker summed up the opportunities for Berlin. 'Berlin is
like a gigantic zip being pulled together again as quickly as possible . . .
not only through streets and squares . . . transport links, telephone lines
. . . but first and foremost in the stomach, the heart and the head.' The
zip also has to reunite ancient centres with development that has happened
since the last war in the pulsating western sector around the
Kurfurstendamm. How long will it take to remove the scars of communism, to
resolve the curious paradoxes and contrasts that exist particularly in what
was East Berlin ?
Take a walk down the Unter den Linden and pass, as you now can, through the
Brandenberg Gate going east and you are faced with one of the most
paradoxical views in Europe. Just before reunification the East German
government refurbished Karl Friedrich Schinkel's bridge, the Neue
Schlossbrucke, reinstating the massive statues and the beautiful ironwork.
But the view from this masterly neo-classical monument is of the hideous
Palace of the Republic  - a monument to communism which was built on the
site of the gutted Royal palace. It is said that even Krushchev was
astounded by the ugliness of this 1950s monster and deplored the demolition
of the palace, which could have been restored.
The decision to move the government of Germany from Bonn to Berlin
guarantees big architectural opportunities. Will they be seized? How will
any new plans embrace the ideologies of the past that linger so strongly?
Last year the Deutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt invited 17
international practices to explore ideas for the architectural reunification
of Berlin. The competition's mood was summed up by the brief: to find 'an
architecture for a City of Tolerance.'
Hitler tried to plan a Berlin, with his architect Albert Speer, that would
rival the Rome of the emperors: axial routes were to focus on glorious state
buildings, all of them large enough to defy any rational sense of
proportion. Some of the internationally famous architects in last year's
competition produced schemes of a scale and fatuousness that perhaps only
Speer would have understood. Zaha Hadid simply developed the axial ideas
into a motorised monster of a city designed as a focal 'star of routes.'
Norman Foster, on the other hand, saw that what the city needed is a
peaceful centre. He planned to make the site of the Berlin Wall into a park
 - a green calm ribbon on the site of so much death and sacrifice. Robert
Venturi and Denise Scott Brown extended the Kursouthern boundary of the
Tiergarten  - rather like a long New York style Fifth Avenue alongside a
park. It was probably the German architect OM Ungers whose ideas were
closest to the spirit of the city. He proposed islands of monuments and
imposing buildings that could read as icons, or important markers, in a
largely suburban city.
Anyone who has visited Berlin when it was divided will have experienced that
curious sense of being on a series of urban islands. When you reached
Potsdam, or sat on a beach by the Wannsee, this sense of being remote but at
the heart of something large and important is very palpable. Berlin is as
much trees, water and gardens as it is monuments and good public housing.
British architects and developers are gradually rising to the prospects of
work in the city; let us hope that they first co-operate to create an
efficient but humane infrastructure that ties up the city's wounds before
imposing any rash of international hotels and uniformly mediocre commercial
blocks.
It is in Barcelona that the urge to give democratic Spain a modern
international face is most visible.
The Japanese architect Arata Isosaki's Olympic Stadium, now that it copes
with the rain, promises to be a successful and stylish venue for the games.
But it is architects in the Catalan region who have recently produced a
whole range of subtle new buildings that combine the best of the
Mediterranean and the modern.
The most well known architect working in Spain, Rafael Moneo, is also one of
the very best in Europe. His museum for Roman antiquities in Merida has that
rare quality, architectural good manners.
What are we to make of the gigantic conference centre at Salamanca designed
by Juan Navarro Baldeweg? In some ways its great dome rising from a cube is
reminiscent of the neo-classical design of the monument for Frederick the
Great that Gilly produced and which so inspired Schinkel. Has the
neo-classical wheel come full circle in Spain rather than in Berlin?
Architecture is the built language of the times, which today are complex and
contradictory. As the new Europe settles down to 1992, I shall be writing
about how things progress in Berlin and Spain.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Management: Fire-eaters and contortionists / A look at the
lengths direct writers go to - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A casual visitor to the Bristol offices of The Insurance Service would be
surprised. The company's 120 telephone sales staff are organised in teams
calling themselves the Reeboks, the Fire Eaters and the Contortionists.
Their motto is 'we bend over backwards to serve you', and they compete
fiercely both to sell motor policies and service claims quickly, producing a
buzz not usually associated with the insurance industry.
Yet the energy immediately detectable at TIS, Direct Line, Churchill or any
of the other half a dozen direct writers, is more than superficial.
Direct writers are a growing success story in an industry currently
suffering its worst ever losses. They use a combination of computerisation,
telesales and sophisticated mass media advertising to sell insurance. They
are building up a growing share of the UK's Pounds 5bn a year motor
insurance market and their innovative organisation and management techniques
are making waves in the staid world of UK insurance.
Direct Line, the longest established direct writer established by the Royal
Bank of Scotland in 1985, has already made a fortune for its founder  -
Peter Wood  - whose salary last year after bonuses amounted to Pounds 1.8m,
making him one of the best paid people in the country.
Direct Line's last reported profits of Pounds 10.5m stand out like a beacon
in an industry drowning in a sea of red ink and Direct Line's rivals  - in
particular Churchill, a subsidiary of Winterthur, the Swiss company, and
TIS, which is owned by Royal Insurance, appear set to emulate its
achievement.
Martin Long, managing director of Churchill, attributes the success of
direct writers to radical rethink of 'the way things were done' in the
insurance industry. 'We have taken an entirely different view of what
customers want', he says.
One of the most decisive moves has been the decision to sell direct to
customers rather than via the high street brokers who have historically
dominated insurance retailing. By paying less money in commission (brokerage
commission typically amounts to 10-15 per cent of premiums) direct writers
can offer more competitive rates to their customers at the expense of
insurance brokers who have traditionally dominated UK insurance retailing.
At the same time much of the duplication of paper work  - the despatch of a
cover note separate from an insurance certificate for example  - has been
eliminated.
But there is more to their success than cutting out the middleman. Within
their own organisations the direct writers have broken decisively with the
bureaucratic systems developed by the UK composites and are adopting flat
management structures and flexible work organisation which allow them to
reduce costs, improve quality and obtain better underwriting results than
rivals clinging to conventional methods.
In discussions with the managers of direct writers two themes emerge again
and again: control and quality of service.
Typically insurance companies employ large numbers of people who are
technically proficient often with a long professional training in skills
like underwriting (assessing a risk and deciding what premium should be
attached to it) and claims management.
By contrast, at the direct writers underwriting decisions are incorporated
in the computer software used by the telesales personnel when they sell the
policy. A caller is simply asked for his or her details (how old they are,
where they live, what car they drive, and so on) and this is keyed into the
software program which automatically produces a quotation.
As well as allowing very rapid response to customer inquiries and a good
quality of service, computerisation gives management a much greater degree
of control over their underwriting than in a typical insurance company.
While Direct Line often rejects risks that it thinks certain to produce
claims  - comprehensive cover for a young driver of fast car living in an
inner-city area for example  - companies selling policies through brokers
have much less control over the business they accept.
Direct writers can more quickly change the rating of risks that produce
losses. Prices can be adjusted much more frequently than a traditional
company. Richard Hill, managing director of The Insurance Service, says that
he can change prices within four days, up to a month in advance of his
rivals.
The management structures of direct writers are flat, with three or at the
most four layers of management compared with perhaps 10 in a typical
insurance company.
The managers like Long and Hill make much of their accessibility. 'I still
talk to the staff, and they still talk to me,' says Long. This more open and
fluid environment allows for quicker decision-making but also poses more
demands on both management and staff. In the non-hierarchical environment
managers have to earn status and position, says one manager. 'It's not given
to you.' Information flows are more fluid. 'It's simply not possible to use
information as part of a power game.'
Within this context the main skill required of the telesales operator - who
make up up to two thirds of a typical direct writer's staff  - is the soft
sell. 'We don't force products on people,' says one manager. Staff have to
attach equal importance to providing the right kind of policies and helping
customers to fill out application forms, for example. 'The customer has to
think that there is someone intelligent on the other end of the line,' says
one manager.
Martin Bateman, who spearheaded the Danish company Top UK's drive into the
UK motor market, says he looks to recruit telesales staff from Marks and
Spencer and Bodyshop. 'Up to two-thirds of our staff spend their time
talking to customers,' he says.
'I don't want anyone who's worked for an insurance company. We recruit 'up
people' . . . Exciting people. You can't teach people to smile,' says Long.
Most telesales staff at TIS are in their early 20s, with some older women
working part-time.
Whereas pay in insurance companies is tied to management grade and promotion
conditioned by time in the job as well as ability, pay in the direct writers
is more closely related to both individual performance.
Typically telesales staff might earn a basic wage of between Pounds 8,000
and Pounds 10,000 a year. This can be increased  - usually by between 20 and
30 per cent  - by a range of bonuses relating to things like the number of
calls answered and the number of quotes made. In one company as many as 10
per cent of staff are doubling their wages to Pounds 20,000 and one
high-flyer earns as much as Pounds 30,000 a year, although this involved
working substantial periods of overtime.
Supervisors  - who are in charge of a team of perhaps ten to twelve
telesales personnel  - earn more and earn up to half their pay in the form
of bonuses with the level reflecting the team's achievement.
Indeed the management of the direct writers has more in common with the
retail business than financial services, with a strong emphasis on quality
of service. Long compares the direct writers with fast-food outlets. 'I'm
running the company on industrial lines rather than insurance lines,' says
Long.
Flexibility is a major feature of work organisation, partially because
companies are still experimenting and refining advertising techniques
measuring the public's response to advertisement campaigns and adapting
systems quickly to respond. Extra staff are needed to respond to the extra
workload and great use is made of casual and part-time labour.
This is one of the main reasons why trades unions have not been invited to
represent any of the telesales staffs. According to Bateman: 'Union
representation would make it difficult to organise shift patterns. It would
involve very much more management time to do this in a more structured way.'
Long says unions are not needed and that his staff have made no demands. 'It
is a rewarding and demanding atmosphere. Most insurance companies are
neither demanding nor rewarding.'

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): London weighting improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-SERVING London staff at Yorkshire Building Society have become one of
the first groups of employees to be paid more than Pounds 4,000 a year extra
for working in the capital.
The deal, which means staff with five years' service in the capital will
enjoy a weighting allowance of Pounds 4,110, will add impetus to union
campaigns for London workers to receive higher allowances.
The new top rate at Yorkshire, which is available to staff within five miles
of central London, compares with rates of between Pounds 3,200 and Pounds
3,600 paid by the big four clearing banks.
Central London staff at Yorkshire with less than two years' service will be
paid Pounds 3,420 (previously Pounds 3,318) extra and those with between two
and five years' service will be paid Pounds 3,759 (Pounds 3.651).
The previous rate for staff with five years' service was Pounds 3,984.
Financial services companies have traditionally set the pace in raising
London weighting. In recent years rises have been small as the recession has
eased the recruitment and retention problems companies experienced in the
late 1980s.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Muted response to Clarke proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, to demolish the current
structure of graduate teacher training in favour of a mainly classroom-based
system have received a surprisingly muted response from the teaching unions
and the Labour party.
Most union leaders argued with some aspects of Mr Clarke's plan and
emphasised the importance of adequate funding. But they did not disagree
with the principle of shifting more training to the classroom.
The harshest criticism came from Mr David Harrison, chairman of the
committee of vice-chancellors and principals. He said there was no evidence
that secondary-school training was failing. The main problem continued to be
shortages of teachers in key areas.
Mr Clarke's plan would shift the ratio of classroom to academic training
from 40:60 to 80:20 and would transfer the financing and administration of
training to selected schools.
A report at the weekend from the schools inspectorate on school-based
training, also published at the weekend, said the principle was sound. But
it cast doubt on the practicality of Mr Clarke's plan by stating: 'The prime
purpose of schools, and the one to which governors and head teachers give
priority, is to teach pupils, not to train students.'
Mr Clarke's plan, due to be introduced in the autumn, has a strongly
political dimension. It will probably form the centrepiece of the education
proposals in the Conservative manifesto and is part of the government's
attempt to blame falling educational standards on the 'progressive'
educational theories supported in many teacher-training colleges.
But the union response suggests that it is unlikely to turn into a populist
election issue for the government with Labour and the unions on the side of
the 'experts' and the Conservatives backing 'ordinary parents'.
Even the National Union of Teachers, the most militant of the teaching
unions, said the government's plan would not alarm teachers 'provided it is
properly prepared and planned and given the necessary resources'.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said Mr Clarke was pushing a good
idea too far and proposed equal shares for classroom and academic training.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Revival in mergers and acquisitions predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER and acquisition activity should revive this year as financial
pressures make companies more willing to dispose of non-core assets,
according to a review of corporate finance activity by Robert Fleming, the
merchant bank.
The bank said disposals slid to Pounds 9.97bn last year from Pounds 16.5bn
in 1990 as values were depressed by the recession.
As a result companies were forced to rely heavily on rights issues to raise
cash. The unwillingness of companies to dispose of assets was also one
reason behind the further fall in mergers, with successful acquisitions of
private and public companies falling to Pounds 11.27bn from Pounds 16.09bn
in 1990.
The bank said, however, it believed companies would be pushed more towards
disposals this year.
Institutional liquidity would be stretched by the higher public-sector
borrowing requirement as well as reduced insurance premiums and pension
contributions. That would mean less cash available for subscription to
rights issues. Competition for equity finance would increase, the bank said.
Debt markets were likely to remain tight as banks continued to be reluctant
lenders given the recent scale of corporate failures and consequent
write-offs. A total of Pounds 940m was spent on management buy-outs during
the final quarter of last year, according to a survey published today.
The figure was the highest quarterly total since the market peaked in the
third quarter of 1989, figures from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm,
show.
The total spent on buy-outs has fallen since the third quarter of 1989,
reaching a low of Pounds 300m at the start of last year.
However, the total for the fourth quarter of last year was still well below
the highest-ever total of Pounds 3.57bn, and the total for the whole of last
year was less than was spent in each of the past four years.
Mr Chris Beresford, head of KPMG's management buy-out section, said: 'It
seems that while most figures from the recession are getting worse, MBOs are
to some extent counter-cyclical.'
He believed the high level of activity would continue this year and would
beat the Pounds 2.6bn spent last year. The uncertainty caused by the general
election was forcing the pace in some buy-outs where the management was keen
to complete before the election.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Sharp rise in number of profit-related pay schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies with profit-related pay schemes rose to 1,277 in the
first quarter of last year, representing 350,000 employees, government
statistics show.
Increases in personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings
accounts (Tessas) and trends in taxable benefits are among the other
elements highlighted in the Inland Revenue's annual statistical compendium.
The number of employees covered by profit-related pay schemes rose 90 per
cent between March 1989 and March 1990 after the threshold for tax relief on
profit-related pay was increased to Pounds 3,000 in the 1989 Budget. It grew
51 per cent in the 12 months to April 1991, just after the threshold was
increased to Pounds 4,000.
Tessas, the five-year accounts which were launched a year ago, contained
Pounds 6,427m held in 2.47m accounts by the end of June last year.
That represents an average deposit of Pounds 2,528 in each account against a
maximum of Pounds 3,000 permissible during the first year of operation.
About two thirds of both the number of Tessa accounts and the money the
accounts contained were held with building societies, and the remainder were
held in banks.
Personal equity plans, which waive capital gains tax and income tax on
dividends within certain limits for investors in UK shares, had been taken
out by 1.47m individuals to a value of Pounds 3.88bn by the end of the
1990-91 tax year.
The number of companies benefiting from the government's Business Expansion
Scheme, introduced in 1983 to provide tax relief on new equity investment in
unquoted UK companies, rose to 6,050 in 1989-90, representing Pounds 1.41bn.
Mortgage interest relief cost the Exchequer Pounds 6.38bn at current prices
in 1988-89 and is projected to rise to Pounds 7.7bn for 1990-91 on behalf of
9.4m claimants.
Taxable benefits were Pounds 3.86bn for the 1988-89 tax year, which incurred
liabilities of Pounds 1.21bn. Cars were the most common benefit,
representing 1.75m people, followed by private medical insurance (970,000
people), fuel (950,000) and home telephones (420,000).
The number of income-tax payers for the current year is estimated to be
25.1m, with 355,000 paying corporation tax, 165,000 paying capital gains tax
and 30,000 paying inheritance tax.
Total tax collected by the Revenue rose 7 per cent to Pounds 82.32bn in the
1990-91 fiscal year, representing 59 per cent of all central government tax
revenue.
Most of the remainder came from Customs and Excise.
This is expected to rise by 12 per cent to Pounds 62.2bn in 1991-92,
reducing the contribution of the Revenue to 56 per cent of all government
tax revenue.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Researcher finds Gazza better than
Godzilla
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES that workers give their machines could provide factory managers with
clues about boosting productivity, say occupational psychologists.
Workers who give their machines menacing nicknames such as Frankenstein,
Godzilla or Big Brother are likely to feel controlled by the technology,
express lower job satisfaction and be less productive, the researchers say.
Those who give their machines more friendly names, such as Winston, R2D2,
Bob or Mildred, are likely to feel greater job satisfaction and be more
productive workers.
The study, on psychology and work, is being presented today to the annual
conference of the British Psychological Society. It was carried out among
skilled manufacturing workers in engineering and electronics plants.
All those studied were using advanced computer-based technology and almost
all personalised their machines with pet names.
The less scope the machines left workers to set their own pace or decide
their own working methods, the more likely it was that negative or
authoritarian-sounding names would be given.
The more affectionate names were reserved for machines that allowed greater
room for initiative and which perhaps sometimes performed less than
perfectly.
One worker said he called his machine Gazza because it 'sometimes breaks
down and leaks cooling fluid'.
Dr Martin Corbett of Warwick University Business School, who wrote the
report, said workers with the least job satisfaction felt the machines in
their factories were treated more humanely than the people.
When the machines performed well the credit went to the technology; when
machines went wrong workers were blamed.
His study concludes that supervisors need to make a conscious effort to
praise work done well by humans.
Dr Corbett said managers who found their workers were giving negative names
to their machines should examine job design, otherwise they risked losing
out on productivity as well as experiencing unnecessary turnover of skilled
staff.
'Managers over-emphasise the importance of getting the technology right at
the expense of the people issues,' he added.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Howard seeks better EC-wide job
notification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will seek to improve the system for notifying job vacancies
on an EC-wide basis during the UK's presidency of the Community in the
second half of this year.
Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, will also use the UK's six-month
presidency to review services offered by public employment agencies
throughout the EC.
Progress on health and safety and the free movement of workers are are also
likely to be among the priorities for the government during the UK's
presidency.
The government hopes to use the presidency to persuade ministers from other
EC governments of the validity of its employment policies.
The government is keen to make clear the importance it attaches to social
affairs following the UK's refusal to accept an extension of EC power in the
employment field at the Maastricht summit in December. Social affairs has
been chosen for one of only seven informal ministerial meetings planned for
the presidency.
In spite of some suggestions that the Maastricht decisions could embarrass
the UK during its presidency, officials now seem to expect less difficulty
from that than from the continuing disagreements about the proposed
Community directive on a 48-hour ceiling for the working week.
On health and safety, government plans include progress on a directive about
the protection of workers in the coal and North Sea oil industries, and
progress on setting up an EC institute of occupational safety and health,
which the UK has urged should be sited in Edinburgh.
An international conference on risk assessment is planned, and that would
tie in with the European year of health and safety beginning in March.
Work to resolve social security issues relating to the movement of workers,
such as portable pensions, will also be high on the agenda. Much of what has
been proposed for the UK presidency would continue if Labour won the coming
general election.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday that a Labour
government would create a better climate for the discussions with an early
commitment that the UK would accept the social chapter.
UK employers will not be able to opt out of the social chapter because union
negotiators will incorporate its precepts into their bargaining, according
to Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union.
Mr Edmonds said at a weekend conference in Oxford: 'British employees will
not put up with second-class status, and they are looking to their trade
unions to negotiate equal conditions with Europeans.'

FT  06 JAN 92 / Welsh Development Agency steps up its drive to reclaim old
coal-mining tips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Welsh Development Agency is stepping up its drive to reclaim old
coal-mining tips, Anthony Moreton writes. South Wales in particular had
thousands of tips, the result of more than two centuries of dumping pit
waste next to collieries. After the 1966 Aberfan disaster, when a tip slid
on to a school killing 116 children and 28 adults, a campaign began to
remove tips or make them environmentally more acceptable. About 19,000 acres
of derelict land, an area bigger than Cardiff, have been reclaimed and much
of it has been used to build factories, houses, shops and sports fields.
Many tips can be mined and their coal waste turned into a saleable product.
British Coal has a 15m-tonne scheme to reclaim coal in Merthyr Tydfil. Mr
Gwyn Griffiths, director of land reclamation at the agency, said: 'Our
target is to clear all major industrial eyesores by the mid 1990s. This will
involve the reclamation of 30,000 acres of land.' Almost a fifth of the
agency's Pounds 150m budget goes towards land reclamation. More than 70 of
the reclaimed sites have been used for industry.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Miners shift their efforts to fresh fields / A report on one
county's campaign to compensate for the loss of its pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY this year a group of leading employers will go underground at one of
County Durham's collieries.
The visit, arranged by British Coal Enterprise, the state-owned company's
job-creation arm, is intended to prove that the image of pitmen as primitive
militants, grimly hacking at the coalface with picks, is a myth. Modern
miners, the message runs, are skilled teamworkers operating machinery worth
millions of pounds.
The trip has been organised because today's miners in this former colliery
heartland are tomorrow's unemployed. In the Durham coalfield, which in 1951
employed 104,000 men in 129 pits, just 5,000 now work in four collieries,
two in Tyne and Wear and two on the east Durham coast.
East Durham lost two of its last pits, Dawdon and Murton, last year. Few
locals would bet on the last survivors, Easington and Vane Tempest/Seaham,
continuing for long. Mr Brian Wright, brought in from south Wales as British
Coal's new north-east director, has been dubbed 'Terminator Two' by Durham
miners.
Staff at the British Coal Enterprise Job Shop in Dawdon are bracing
themselves for long queues after the holiday break. 'Get a job' will be many
local ex-miners' new year resolution. British Coal's announcement last week
that its supplementary redundancy payments of up to Pounds 10,000 per head
are to end in March has increased the likelihood that most of the 929 men at
Murton, which closed five weeks ago, will opt to leave the industry rather
than transfer to pits with an uncertain future.
Battered by the loss of more than 10,000 mining jobs in the last decade,
east Durham's Easington district epitomises the difficulties facing
Britain's declining coalfields.
Although the postwar development of Peterlee new town has helped boost
manufacturing employment locally by 2,500 jobs since 1981, the pace of job
creation has lagged behind mining job losses. The district has 6,000 fewer
jobs than in 1981 and a male unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent. The
recession and the knock-on effects of mining's rundown are biting too.
Mining has bequeathed environmental scars  - once-golden beaches have been
reduced to black quagmires by the dumping of colliery spoil, sludge and
sewage. Its ebb is leaving rundown villages and dereliction.
Because decline has been gradual the area has missed out on the special
government help focused on communities affected by more dramatic closures.
East Durham is also handicapped by powerful competition for inward
investment from government-backed development corporations in neighbouring
Tyne and Wear and Teesside.
Alarmed at the area's 'death by a thousand cuts', Durham County Council
spearheaded the launch of the East Durham Task Force in September last year.
It is pressing for Pounds 158m over the next decade to revitalise the
economy and environment.
Mr Kingsley Smith, Durham County Council's chief executive and the
task-force chairman, said: 'We believe it is essential that 8,000 new jobs
are created over the next 10 years if the area is to have any chance of
recovery.'
But Professor Ray Hudson of Durham University has suggested in a report on
Easington district that even Pounds 158m and 8,000 new jobs might not be
enough.
And one of the task force's main hopes of finance  - the European
Commission's money for regenerating former mining areas  - is still held up
by a dispute between the government and Brussels.
British Coal Enterprise remains optimistic, however. Since 1984 it has
invested Pounds 7.5m in 261 job-creating projects in the Durham coalfield,
and is spending Pounds 1m a year on redundancy counselling and training for
Durham's ex-miners. It estimates that of 1,000 who sought its help in 1989
and 1990, 91 per cent were resettled in work or training. Because of the
recession the 1991 figure will fall to about 80 per cent.
British Coal Enterprise's determined push to resettle ex-miners may be bad
news for other job seekers. Mr Ron Lee, BCE's Dawdon manager, said: 'Even
the Jobcentre will say we offer very stiff competition for them. It's a
vicious world and we're in at the deep end.'
The hardest men to place, he said, were those wanting to work locally. 'They
picture a nice steady little job, nipping home for lunch  - these jobs don't
exist.'
Mr Benny Salmon, who worked for 28 years as an underground maintenance
worker and was made redundant a year ago, will vouch for that, after writing
in vain to 327 Durham-based companies. Mr Salmon, aged 45, has two plastic
bags of rejection letters and thinks age must be against him.
Last year was not without triumphs: he learned to cook and iron well, raised
a family of pigs on his allotment and paid off the mortgage on his former
council house in Seaham, using some of his Pounds 30,000 redundancy money.
But his goal, a modestly paid job in his home area, still eludes him.
He said: 'I thought if I went with the first wave from Dawdon I would have
better prospects of getting a job, before everybody else went. But the
prospects are very grim.'

FT  06 JAN 92 / Squeeze forecast for credit-card issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALLER credit-card issuers are likely to be squeezed out of the market in
the next few years, according to Barclaycard, the largest UK payment-card
issuer.
Barclaycard says the presence in the UK of 76 credit-card schemes means
there is overcapacity. Some cards will be sold to larger issuers and others
may disappear completely, it adds.
Barclaycard says that the pressure on smaller issuers was illustrated
recently by the decision of Halifax building society to increase the
interest rate on its card from 1.8 per cent a month to 1.95 per cent from
January 3.
It predicts that new entrants to the payment cards market, such as the
building societies, will issue debit cards such as Switch or the Visa Delta
card rather than credit cards.
Debit-card usage is set to grow by more than 30 per cent this year, mostly
at the expense of cash and cheques.
The more mature credit-card market is also growing, but at a slower rate.
Barclaycard forecasts that it will grow by about 5 per cent this year. It
says the credit-card market has been boosted by a recent decision by J.
Sainsbury, the food retailer, to accept credit cards.
Marks and Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership are now the only large
retailers which do not accept credit cards.
Barclaycard forecasts that large issuers will have to find additional
incentives to ensure that their customers remain loyal to them. These will
include:
purchase protection insurance cover;
Ecu-based accounts for customers who travel frequently in Europe;
improved international cash machine networks to enable cardholders to obtain
cash from virtually any machine in any country.
Barclaycard says it plans to expand its operations in the European card
market. It already issues cards in Germany, France and Spain.
It warns, however, that fraud is growing and banks will have to step up
their co-operation against fraud.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Fall in Abta membership last year was a record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GULF war and the recession led last year to the UK's biggest annual net
loss of travel agents and tour operators, according to figures published
today by the Association of British Travel Agents.
Abta said it granted membership to 180 travel agents last year but 346 went
out of business, resulting in a net loss of 166. The most common reason for
leaving Abta was financial failure, although 77 of the travel agents were
taken over or merged with other companies.
Seventy tour operators became Abta members, but 110 went out of business,
including Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group, which was then
Britain's second-largest travel company.
Abta said the rate of failures slowed during the year. In the fourth quarter
67 travel agents and 19 tour operators closed  - the lowest level since the
summer of 1990.
Abta said it expected the number of travel companies to continue to fall
this year in spite of a 20 per cent increase in demand for winter breaks and
an 8 per cent rise in summer holiday bookings.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Rise in bank loans to small business seen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS have doubled the amount of money they lend to small businesses since
the mid-1980s, a survey published today shows.
The survey, conducted for National Westminster Bank by Graham Bannock and
Partners, a consultancy, says more than Pounds 40bn is being lent to small
businesses by banks.
The banks are anxious to defend their commitment to small businesses after a
year of intense criticism in which part of the blame for the financial
problems of small companies was laid at their door.
Critics complained that instead of passing on interest rate cuts the banks
were increasing the cost of loans and other bank charges. Many small
businesses believed banks were increasing profit margins at their expense.
The survey suggests that the growth in bank lending has reduced problems in
raising relatively small sums for long-term investment. Banks are now more
willing to provide funds at fixed rates and terms, making it less necessary
for small businesses to turn to other funding sources.
Ms Jane Bradford, head of Small Business Services at NatWest, said: 'Much of
the rapid growth among small firms over the last decade has been financed by
banks.'
The report also says, however, that small businesses are often unwilling to
bring in outside investors, who might wish to influence the way a company is
run, and venture-capital groups and other potential investors are not keen
on small investments which could prove expensive to monitor.
Banks lend Pounds 1 for every Pounds 2 invested in small businesses by their
owners, the survey found.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Lamont admits growth forecast 'over-optimistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday admitted that the government's
most recent forecast of economic growth was over-optimistic and he went
further than before in ruling out a realignment of currencies in the
European Monetary System.
The chancellor, in an interview on TV-am, appeared to rule out any move by
European finance ministers to change parities in the EMS exchange rate
mechanism.
'There won't be a realignment conference,' Mr Lamont said. Realignment was
another word for devaluation and he had made 'crystal clear' that there
would be no devaluation of the pound. Instead, companies should adjust their
costs to sterling's exchange rate.
Mr Lamont admitted that the forecast of 2 1/4 per cent growth for this year
in November's Autumn Statement 'will prove to have been somewhat
over-optimistic'.
The strength of growth around the world had slowed since June. US forecasts
on recovery had 'gone out the window' and Germany had moved into recession.
He believed recovery in Britain would take place, however. Growth would be
gradual at first, but accelerate towards the end of 1992.
Last year's interest rate cuts, rising real incomes, and the repayment of
debt would all encourage people to start spending again. 'What we need is
confidence,' the chancellor said. He was encouraged by the recent strength
of Wall Street and predicted that confidence would rise in Britain as the US
economy improved.
Mr Lamont said the UK would be in a strong position once recovery was under
way. Britain's share of world trade was stable and the economy would benefit
from the large investments made in the late 1980s. There were also more
small companies  - making for a more dynamic economy  - while Britain's
strike record was 'better than ever before'.
The chancellor defended his policies, saying that he would not have done
anything different over the past 12 months.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Even the bad times are good for somebody: Tim Lawrence
reports on how industrial auction houses have benefited from the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Mr John Major, the prime minister, was saying last week that the
economy was showing the first signs of recovery, industrial auctioneers were
praying quietly that the bad times were here to stay.
Mr Brian Grainger, a professional services consultant at the Incorporated
Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, says: 'The recession has given auction
houses a new lease of life.'
According to Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
the accountancy firm, the number of companies which went into receivership
last year is expected to exceed 6,000  - more than four times the 1989
total. That means boom-time for auction houses called in to sell off assets.
Auctioneers are moving into bigger premises, profits are up and staff are
being recruited.
Henry Butcher, the plant and machinery specialist, is a typical beneficiary.
In 1989 the company held 57 sale days. There were 92 in 1990 and more than
190 sale days last year.
According to Mr John Judson, principal auctioneer at Henry Butcher, the mid
1980s were a buoyant time, with healthy prices and about 60 sale days a
year. But there is nothing like a downturn to boost income for auctioneers.
'The past year has been even better than 1982, with more sales at a higher
value. Items are not fetching as good a price as in the late 80s, but the
increased number of sales has added significantly to our income,' Mr Judson
says.
Profits are also up at the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith,
the plant and machinery auctioneer. Stickley &amp; Kent, which handles property
repossessions, has tripled its auction staff, and the department is moving
to larger offices in central London. The auction department at Edward
Rushton, the international valuers and surveyors, says it has never been
busier.
Different sales attract different people, but they share one trait: the
desire to buy cheap. Specialist plant and machinery auctions appeal almost
exclusively to dealers and industrialists. Other sales, such as a recent
Henry Butcher auction for Prudential at which 1,600 IBM computers were sold
for about Pounds 400 each, are more likely to attract the general public.
The auctions are often heady affairs. More than 1,000 people attend the big
sales and takings can easily exceed Pounds 1m  - from which the auction
houses usually take a 10 per cent cut.
Auctioneers can also profit from the inexperience of bidders and the
excitement of the occasion, which can lead bidders to pay more for a lot
than its market price. At a recent Henry Butcher auction for a large
property developer, the managing director's Bentley sold for Pounds 33,000,
Pounds 6,000 more than its trade value.
Mr Judson stops the bidding when it gets ridiculous. 'People often get
carried away, especially when a couple of them have got it in for one
another, but if they overbid it makes it difficult to collect any payment,'
he says.
While industrial salerooms thrive during recessions, they are keen to shed
their image of being industrial vultures.
Auctioneers claim they are contributing to the preservation of Britain's
manufacturing base by helping businesses which are strapped for cash to buy
quality products at a bargain price.
The auctions, they say, are an effective way for receivers to realise
capital when assets have to be sold.
Environmental arguments are also put forward by the auctioneers, who argue
that the sales provide an effective method of recycling equipment, machinery
and premises.
But the recession has not brought unmitigated prosperity for the sales
houses, with the severity of the downturn posing a few problems. In some
areas, for example, the market has been flooded  - there are several
night-clubs for sale in Oxfordshire at the moment  - which makes it
difficult to raise a realistic price.
Mr John Liddiment, head of the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp;
Smith, says that customers are less bid-happy than they were in the late
1980s. In 1988 lots were being bid for at an average of 120 per hour at
auctions. Last year it was down to 90.
Mr Edwin Kirker, head of insolvency at accountants Pannell Kerr Forster,
says: 'People are not flocking to auctions with money and it is difficult to
make money because there is so much stuff on the market. A buyer can usually
turn to at least two or three receivers to get what he wants.'
Some auction houses are struggling. Property auctioneers are selling more
houses than ever before, but prices have plummeted. At Barnard Marcus, the
estate agent and property auctioneer, houses are selling for Pounds 30,000
to Pounds 100,000 rather than up to Pounds 500,000. Overheads have gone up
as well as turnover, and overall takings are down by 50 per cent.
The art auctions are also struggling. The three big money-spinners  -
Impressionist, Modern and American contemporary works  - have all fallen
flat. Sotheby's and Christie's have experienced a sharp fall in turnover and
profits.
Henry Butcher might not like it, but in some quarters at least, a recovery
would be good news.

FT  06 JAN 92 / European real interest rates rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BURDEN of record levels of personal indebtedness and high real interest
rates has weighed heavily on both US and UK consumers over the year. In the
US there are signs that the gloom is beginning to lift: confidence about the
future turned up in December. But UK consumers remain pessimistic.
One reason for the recent falls in UK consumer confidence is the
persistently high level of UK real interest rates. While short-term real
interest rates in the US fell sharply in 1991, UK real interest rates remain
at least as high as in 1990. As a result, the gap between US and UK real
interest rates is now wider than at any time in the past two decades.
It is not possible precisely to measure the current level of real interest
rates. The real rate over the next year is equal to the current nominal
interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation over the same period. The
higher inflation is, the smaller will be the real value of the principal
that must be repaid, and thus the cheaper is the expected real cost of
borrowing at current nominal rates.
The difficulty is how to measure the inflation rate that borrowers expect in
the future. Up to 1990, the chart uses annual averages of three-month
nominal interest rates minus the actual inflation rate over the following
year as a proxy for expected inflation. For 1991 and the latest figure, it
uses OECD inflation estimates.
The chart has two striking features: the general rise of real interest rates
in the 1980s compared to the previous decade for all the six largest
industrialised countries; and the amount of variation in short rates across
countries at any one time, and for each country from year to year.
Over periods of a decade or more, the level of real interest rates is not
determined by the rate of growth of money but instead by the supply and
demand for investment funds. In part the trend rise in real interest rates
reflects the fall in the supply of private savings in the 1980s and the
growth of first the US and now the German fiscal deficits; but studies have
shown that the effect of government dis-saving on world real interest rates
is much exaggerated. Probably more important was the rise in the demand for
capital in the 1980s as profit rates rose.
Yet monetary policy does have a decisive impact on the level of real
interest rates in the short-run, perhaps up to four years. For example, the
sharp rise in real rates between 1978 and 1981 reflects a general tightening
of monetary policy.
The divergence in real rates over the past year is caused by the different
directions of monetary policy between Europe, and the US and Japan. US
short-term interest rates have halved since 1990, while inflation is
expected to remain low, reducing the real rate to below 1 per cent. Japanese
real rates have fallen for the same reason.
The recent rise in German interest rates has pushed real European rates in
the opposite direction. German real rates have stabilised because inflation
is also expected to rise. But inflation is expected to fall in the UK,
France and Italy. Consequently, the recent rise in French and Italian
interest rates, and the expectation of a UK rise, have forced up real rates
in all these countries, to the dismay of their recession-weary consumers.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Bush faces a tough finale on Asian tour: Concerns over US
security role likely to have been allayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US President George Bush embarked on the more politically sensitive part of
his Asian tour yesterday with his arrival in South Korea, to be followed
tomorrow by a visit to Japan.
The president needs to convince voters at home that he is effectively
seeking broader markets for US goods while at the same time cementing
relationships with America's key north Asian allies.
Concerns in Asia about continued US commitment to its 'balancing wheel' role
in regional security will have been allayed by Mr Bush's visit to Singapore,
where he won approval in principle for relocating a US Navy logistics
command from the Philippines.
In Seoul, Mr Bush is expected to reaffirm that the US would not withdraw
more troops from South Korea until a dispute over North Korea's nuclear
programme was fully resolved.
Washington has withdrawn battlefield nuclear weapons and 6,000 troops in
recent months. But the withdrawal of about 6,000 more of the 39,000 troops
remaining is on hold.
However, greater attention is likely to be focused on trade issues, even
though South Korea has economic problems, including a widening current
account deficit. Mr Bush was expected to urge South Korea to open its
markets more to US goods.
'With a growth rate of 6.7 per cent, our pitch is they're becoming a very
mature economy,' one US official was quoted as saying yesterday. However,
Korean officials said the most explosive political issue in South Korea  -
opening its rice market to US imports  - would be sidestepped.
The highest expectations in the US are focused on the Japanese leg of the
tour, following inclusion in the president's entourage of 21 leading
businessmen. His mission is seen as securing commitments from Tokyo to take
concrete measures to reduce the Dollars 41bn (Pounds 22.5bn) US trade
deficit with Japan.
Mr Beverly Dolan, chairman of Textron, the aerospace group, said: 'It would
seem to me that the Japanese would recognise that this isn't going to go on
forever, and it would surely be in their best interest to suggest ways to
cure the trade imbalance, rather than the US to mandate it.
'The thrust of this trip is to try to enlighten them to change their
direction themselves, of their own free will,' he said.
Mr Bush told a news conference on Saturday that he was not going to Japan in
an aggressive frame of mind and pointed out that security and other issues
would also be topics of discussion.
Mr Robert Galvin, chairman of the executive committee of Motorola, the US
electronics group, said he believed Mr Bush needed to obtain Japanese
agreement on a set of steps to accelerate balancing the trade deficit.
'I think we're going to set new directions and new paces,' Mr Galvin said.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Algerian government starts to play for time / A look at
reactions to the fundamentalists' strong election showing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the six months which followed his appointment as Algerian prime minister
last June, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali seemed to pop up in an endless stream of
interviews, meetings and chat-shows  - lionised to an extent never before
seen in this country.
Since Algerians cast their votes on December 26 in the first round of the
country's first multi-party general election, their prime minister has all
but disappeared from the public scene, emerging only to attack the lay
opposition parties in a brief appearance on French television and, last
night, to tell Algiers radio that he was disappointed by the turn-out in the
polls.
By any standards, such behaviour is extraordinary. Rumours of a military
coup are two a penny, the local press is full of articles explaining in
elaborate detail that the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), whose candidates
won 47.3 per cent of all votes cast, 'manipulated' the election and that the
walis (provincial governors) failed to ensure a 'fair' poll.
Meanwhile, senior members of the cabinet map out their strategy to chosen
members of the foreign press. The Constitutional Court, they explain, which
is looking at alleged fraud in 145 constituencies, might annul the election
of 50-70 newly-elected deputies, all of whom will inevitably be members of
the FIS. New elections will then have to be organised in those
constituencies within three months, a tactic which might give the government
a breathing space.
All of this looks like hukkumat mikki (Mickey Mouse government), the
expression ordinary Algerians have come to use for those who govern them.
The name of Mr Ghozali, whose reputation until June rested on his successful
management in the 1970s of the state oil company, Sonatrach, between 1976
and 1979, is now best not mentioned among the many engineers and middle
management of the company.
Many are people who have never been given their due, or are worried about
what the future holds for their children.
Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, leader of the main lay opposition party, the Front des
Forces Socialistes, pointed out a few days ago that cancelling the second
round makes the country look like a banana republic. A military coup would
bring Algeria back to square one but might become unavoidable if pressure
mounts, at home, or if the FIS is 'deprived' of its majority.
The King of Morocco cannot view with any sympathy the idea of a regime
competing with his brand of 'Islamic legitimacy'. The behaviour of the FIS,
whatever its rulers may say today, risks being dictated by its supporters,
the have-nots and castaways of Algerian society. These people have many
kindred spirits in Morocco for whom the king's title of Amin al Mouminine
(Descendant of the Prophet Mohammed) weighs little against the harsh daily
grind. The Tunisians, for their part, are desperately worried.
Meanwhile, a few hundred (or maybe even a few thousand) 'Afghans'  -
Algerians trained in the camps around Peshawar in Pakistan, who fought the
Russians in Afghanistan in the name of Allah  - lie low. They were
responsible for the recent attack on military barracks in south-east
Algeria. The resulting shoot-out cost 24 lives. Many of the weapons stolen
from the police during the riots of October 1988 have never been recovered.
No modern conflict is free of the vengeful hands of old ghosts, but in a
country on which modern history has inflicted much suffering, they pull the
strings of the current fray with inordinate and perilous force.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Mauroy is expected to announce his resignation as head of the
French Socialist party this week, heralding a reshuffle of senior figures in
the party in an attempt to revive its prospects for re-election.
Socialist party officials would not confirm reports of the resignation
yesterday, first leaked in the daily newspaper Liberation, which is close to
the Socialist leadership.
However, Mr Mauroy, a former prime minister, is believed to have already
told President Francois Mitterrand of his decision to resign and is expected
to make a public announcement tomorrow.
Mr Mauroy is believed to be disillusioned with party infighting. Press
reports said he wanted his job to go to an ally of a man widely seen as a
leading contender to succeed Mr Mitterrand, European Commission head Jacques
Delors.
Mr Laurent Fabius, another former French prime minister, and Mr Michel
Delebarre, minister of towns, have been mooted as the likeliest contenders
to succeed him as head of the party. Mr Fabius, now president of the
national assembly, has made no secret of his hopes of securing the position.
Mr Delebarre is regarded as Mr Mauroy's own favoured candidate.
However, Mr Mauroy's surprise departure would be likely to pave the way for
a wider-ranging changes among the socialist hierarchy. The party is
desperately trying to regain popularity in the approach to both this year's
regional elections and to the national elections in 1993.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Virgin backs down on Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle over the sanctity of Sunday in France took a new turn at the
weekend when Virgin, the London-based leisure group, succumbed to political
pressure by deciding not to open its French stores illegally yesterday,
Alice Rawsthorn writes.
The decision by Virgin, which was fined FFr500,000 (Pounds 51,300) last week
for opening the previous Sunday, is seen as a placatory gesture to the
French government, which is preparing for a national debate on Sunday
trading restrictions.
On Wednesday, government representatives will meet trade unionists to
discuss the issue. The liberalisation of Sunday trading has long been
controversial in France because of the special role of Sunday in a Roman
Catholic culture and opposition by the unions.
One of the most powerful opponents of Virgin's Sunday trading campaign is
its chief competitor, FNAC.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Arabs debate stance on Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX RODENBECK and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE East peace talks scheduled to resume in Washington tomorrow have been
put in jeopardy as Arab participants debate how to respond to Israel's
decision to deport 12 Palestinian activists.
Palestinian, Jordanian, Syrian and Lebanese negotiators have postponed
attendance in response to the Israeli move.
Palestinian leaders say their attendance could hinge on the outcome of a
United Nations Security Council session to be held today, which is expected
to condemn the Israeli action.
Israeli officials confirmed yesterday that their delegation would leave for
Washington as planned, and dismissed the possibility of dropping the
expulsion, which has drawn unusually harsh condemnation from the US, Russia,
Britain, France and the EC.
Diplomats in Washington said the US was likely to support a resolution
condemning the deportations as long as it was limited to that issue and did
not turn into a more generalised condemnation of Israel.
Such a resolution would go some way towards assuaging Palestinian anger, and
officials said it could help ensure that the delay in the peace talks would
be brief, perhaps as short as two or three days.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said
in Cairo after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that a final
decision on whether to boycott the talks had not yet been reached.
Mr Arafat then flew to Jordan for talks with King Hussein on the fate of the
peace talks. Jordan and Palestinians from the Israeli-held territories have
formed a joint delegation to get round the Jewish state's refusal to talk to
the PLO.
Israeli newspapers yesterday quoted Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Mr
Arafat, as saying that Palestinians would not boycott the talks, a move
demanded in emotional appeals by families of the 12 men awaiting expulsion.
But other Palestinian spokesmen made it clear they would attend only if
Israel suspended the deportation order.
The expulsions were in reprisal for the murder of a Jewish settler in the
Gaza Strip. The 12 have appealed to the Israeli army against the deportation
orders.
Unidentified gunmen killed a security official of the PLO in Lebanon's
southern port city of Sidon yesterday, Reuter reports.
Mr Hussein Sulaiman, an official in Force 17  - the security network of Mr
Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement  - was hit by two bullets as he left his
house.
Reuter adds from Washington: Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, a leading US
Democratic presidential candidate, yesterday backed granting Israel up to
Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to finance the immigration of Soviet Jews.
President George Bush postponed the decision in an effort to launch the
peace talks. He has to decide this month whether to seek further delay or
request the guarantees from Congress.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Poland's new prime minister hints he may resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND's new centre-right government, formed just before Christmas after two
months' political manoeuvring, is already looking fragile after a series of
clashes with President Lech Walesa, the recently-elected parliament, and the
trade unions, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
Mr Jan Olszewski, prime minister, hinted over the weekend he would resign if
both the Solidarity trade union movement and the former communist OPZZ union
movement acted on threats to strike in protest against a near-doubling in
energy and central-heating prices on January 1.
The OPZZ has said it will call a token national stoppage on January 16, and
Solidarity has threatened action unless the rises are suspended.
Adding to the government's woes is a row with Mr Walesa over the decision
last week by Mr Jan Parys, Poland's first post-war civilian defence
minister, to pension off his predecessor, Admiral Piotr Kolodziejczyk. The
move has angered Mr Walesa, commander of the armed forces. The president,
who last year opposed Mr Olszewski's appointment as prime minister, wanted
to keep the admiral in a senior military post to reassure a nervous officer
class, despite his Warsaw Pact communist background.
The row with Mr Walesa and union opposition to phasing out energy subsidies
have underlined the fragility of Mr Olszewski's position as leader of a
coalition government with only tenuous support.
The new parliament, elected at the end of October, has shown little
enthusiasm for approving welfare cuts demanded by the government in an
interim budget for the first quarter of the year. Last week, the government
announced a 20 per cent increase in alcohol and tobacco prices to shore up
collapsing budget revenues.
Tax revenues from the ailing state sector have declined sharply in line with
two years' rapid fall in state-sector production and a slower-than-hoped
rate of privatisation.
To trim a budget deficit which exceeds targets originally agreed with the
IMF, the outgoing government aimed to cut plans for government spending by a
third.
On Saturday, Mr Karol Lutkowski, finance minister, asked parliament to
approve the interim budget without amendment. This assumes a Zl 17,600bn
(Pounds 890m) deficit for the first three months, and forecasts inflation
rising by 15 per cent for the quarter, against 60 per cent over the whole of
1991.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Serb enclave rejects UN troops plan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav army and Croatian forces held to a ceasefire yesterday but Serb
leaders of a key region appeared set to spell trouble for UN plans to deploy
peace-keeping forces, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
The leader of the Serb enclave of Krajina, standard-bearer of Serb
resistance in Croatia, rejected deployment of UN troops in the territory
itself, saying they could be stationed only on its borders.
Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, said in a message sent to the UN envoy,
Mr Cyrus Vance, and the Security Council, that Serb irregulars there would
not lay down their arms while Croatia's National Guard retained theirs.
He also questioned why units of the Serb-led federal army had to be
withdrawn  - another key element in the peace plan.
'We would remind everyone that the internal arrangement and the maintenance
of public order is exclusively within the competence of. . . Krajina and no
one has any right to settle those matters in a different way,' Mr Babic
said.
Krajina, a wedge of territory in the heart of Croatia, unilaterally declared
independence from the republic last month and now styles itself 'the Serbian
Republic of Krajina'.
Under the UN plan, 'Blue Helmet' troops would be deployed in Krajina and
other Serb enclaves in Croatia, irregular forces would be disarmed and units
of the army and Croatian National Guard would be withdrawn.
Mr Babic's opposition touched off a row with the political leadership of
Serbia and the federal presidency which, with Croatia, have accepted the
plan.
Mr Borisav Jovic, the Serbian member of the presidency, accused Krajina
leaders of backtracking after initially agreeing with Serbia to accept the
terms of the UN plan.
Mr Vance says he will recommend deployment of the UN force if a Friday night
ceasefire between the Yugoslav federal army and the Croatian National Guard
really takes hold.
Both the army and Croatian forces yesterday reported the quietest night for
months, with no serious violations of the ceasefire and all battlefronts
quiet yesterday.
More than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting since Croatia declared
independence from Yugoslavia last June.
In New York, Mr Vance discussed prospects for a peace-keeping force with Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. He later said he hoped the new
ceasefire, the 15th in the conflict, would hold and indicated any deployment
of UN troops might be weeks away.
'One can tell if you watch over a period of days, and perhaps even weeks, as
to whether or not it is going to stick,' he said.
His recommendations to the Security Council this week will be crucial.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Russians may be without fuel soon: Republic's power stations
using up reserve stocks of coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWER stations in Russia, the world's biggest oil producer, are running out
of fuel and may have to cut energy supplies to industry and the public, an
official was quoted as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Stanislav Rura, deputy chief engineer of the Far East Power Association,
said coal shortages were to blame. 'We are faced with the real necessity of
halting the supply of energy to industrial enterprises,' he told Tass news
agency. 'The reason is the acute shortage of fuel. Miners in the Maritime
Region (around Vladivostok) are not providing for the power-engineering
workers' requirements, and there aren't any deliveries from other areas.
'Power stations are already using up reserve stocks of coal. Unless urgent
measures are taken, the question of stopping the population's heat supply
will also arise.'
Many enterprises have been feeling the effects of a fall in Russian energy
supplies for some time. Radio Russia said that Siberian oil extraction fell
50m tonnes to 305m in 1991. It quoted Mr Yury Lisovoy, deputy head of the
Tyumen Regional Economic Affairs Board, as telling the Russian Information
Agency production was expected to drop further in 1992.
Soviet oil production, of which Russia accounts for about 90 per cent, fell
to about 500m tonnes in 1991 from a 1988 peak of 624m. But Mr Lisovoy held
out hopes that greater local control over locally-produced oil in the coming
year would boost output.
'Experts say that all Tyumen's oil fields, with their worn-out and obsolete
equipment, need modernising without delay,' the radio said. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was reported to have decreed that from 1992 the
Tyumen region and its oil enterprises would control the sale of 20 per cent
of its oil exports.
Tass said northern Russian officials had halted unloading of nuclear fuel
from decommissioned submarines from yesterday. 'It has emerged the military
have been conducting ecologically dangerous operations without warning civil
authorities or the public.'

CHINA and Tajikistan yesterday established formal diplomatic links as
Beijing continued to form ties with the successor-states to the Soviet
Union, especially those on its sensitive border, Reuter reports from
Beijing.
The New China News Agency reported that a joint communique was signed in
Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital, to establish relations at ambassadorial
level.
Tajikistan is one of three republics bordering China's Moslem-minority
region of Xinjiang in the north-west. Beijing still has to establish ties
with Kirgizia in order to have relations with all members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on its immediate border.
China and Russia set up ties at ambassadorial level on December 27. Beijing
subsequently set up full ties with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine.
China has recognised all republics of the commonwealth, and Georgia, which
has not yet joined the CIS, but has said it will negotiate full ties with
each individually.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Clash over tax policies as parties step up poll battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFLICT between Labour and the Conservatives over the economy intensified
yesterday, as both parties heightened the atmosphere of election campaigning
with attacks on each other's taxation policies.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, left open the possibility of tax cuts in
this year's Budget, while pledging he would take no risks with the economy.
In an interview on TV-am, the breakfast television station, he also claimed
that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, could not be trusted to run a free
enterprise economy.
Mr Kinnock, in a separate interview, promised that a Labour government would
reverse any Budget tax rate cut, and accused the Tories of 'mischievous and
completely misleading' efforts to convince the public that everyone
currently paying the 40 per cent tax rate would pay 50 per cent under
Labour.
Speaking less than a week before he is due to start drawing up the
government's Budget strategy with senior Treasury officials, the chancellor
refused to endorse remarks made last October by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, that tax cuts would be 'fool's gold' and unwise.
Instead, he underlined that he would agree to 'no artificial or
inappropriate' stimulus for the economy in the Budget. He would make his
assessment of what was needed in the coming weeks. 'If it were necessary to
put up taxes, I would put them up,' he said.
But he came under heavy fire from both Labour and the Liberal Democrats for
'paralysis' in the face of the downturn, while senior Labour spokesmen
reacted swiftly to his attack on Mr Kinnock, saying the chancellor was
'peddling dishonesty' over Labour's plans.
On BBC radio yesterday, Mr Kinnock emphasised that Labour's proposed 50 per
cent top tax rate would affect only people on 'well over Pounds 30,000 a
year'. Labour's plans to remove the ceiling on national insurance (NI)
contributions would affect only the 12 per cent of NI contributors who were
on Pounds 20,240 a year and over and paying the contributions on all their
income.
He also renewed Labour's promise to introduce policies 'that will be
combating unemployment and recession directly, and at the same time building
foundations for future economic growth'.
Those two themes will be highlighted further this week. At tomorrow's shadow
cabinet meeting before the House of Commons resumes next week, Labour's
senior spokespeople will discuss campaigning and the party's plan to
accelerate recovery. On Wednesday the party will publish a document on
Labour's long-term strategy for the economy.
Today the Tories begin a further campaign against Labour's taxation policy,
headed by Mr Lamont and Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman. This
follows the claim at the weekend by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment
secretary, that Labour's tax plans would send the housing market 'into a
nosedive'.
The Liberal Democrats will launch on Thursday their plans for first steps to
be taken after the election. The party will aim to build momentum with a
rally in London on Saturday.

<TEXT>
GEORGIA'S beleaguered president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, said yesterday he
was prepared to hold a referendum on whether he should continue in power.
Speaking at a news conference inside the bunker beneath the Georgian
parliament in the capital Tbilisi, where he was beginning a third week as a
virtual prisoner of opposition forces demanding his resignation, Mr
Gamsakhurdia indicated for the first time that he was prepared to put his
popularity to the test.
'If the opposition seeks my resignation as president, it must be by
referendum. I am ready but they don't want it. They know that they will be
defeated,' he said.
Mr Gamsakhurdia did not rule out that United Nations observers might
supervise such a referendum, but said he was not sure the UN would agree to
this as Georgia was not a member.
Earlier, Mr Gamsakhurdia had met about half his 85 personally appointed
regional officials to discuss the formation of local detachments of his
supporters to keep order and stop the spread of weapons.
A crowd of more than 1,000 defied an opposition ban on public meetings and
demonstrated in support of Mr Gamsakhurdia outside Tbilisi's central
station. There was no repeat of the violence outside the Didube suburban
station on Friday, when masked opposition gunmen fired on a crowd of
Gamsakhurdia supporters.
Four people are now believed to have died in Friday's incident, with more
than 30 injured.
Mr Gamsakhurdia repeated his appeal to other nations to defend his
democratically elected government against a 'violent coup d'etat by a junta
of terrorists'.
He said, however, that as he had no telephone links, he had not been able to
talk directly with any western country or former Soviet republics.
While maintaining his defiant tone, and dismissing an opposition attack on
the government building as 'impossible', Mr Gamsakhurdia was subdued and
showed more signs of stress than when he met a small group of reporters last
Thursday.
He admitted that he may have made mistakes during his presidency. He also
said the lack of direct communication posed severe problems for his
government, and spoke for the first time of the difficulties of life in the
bunker.
'The conditions are very bad. Many people are sleeping on chairs or on the
floor, and it is very hard to bring in food. We are kept going by our faith
and our love of Georgia and the Georgian people,' he said.
A priest performs daily services for the hundreds of people in the basement
complex.
The opposition leaders retreated over the weekend from earlier threats that
they would storm the parliament building, saying they preferred to wait for
Mr Gamsakhurdia to give himself up.
Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the leaders of the opposition military council
which claims to have seized power in the country, said yesterday that his
forces controlled 80 per cent of Tbilisi.
But the opposition blockade of the government remains incomplete, with
several streets south of the building still passable, although they are
vulnerable to snipers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has stepped up its battle with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea
fleet, with a warning that any unilateral takeover of Soviet armed forces
could kill the fledgling Commonwealth of Independent States.
A group of 15 prominent Russian deputies warned at the weekend that
Ukrainian plans to make Soviet military personnel swear allegiance to the
Ukrainian state and to raise the Ukrainian flag over the Black Sea fleet
violated agreements establishing the commonwealth.
Ukraine's introduction on Friday of the oath of allegiance confronted many
officers in Ukraine with a harsh choice: to take the oath, or leave the
republic, giving up housing and better food supplies than are available
elsewhere.
Interfax news agency reported that a helicopter regiment stationed in the
Ukrainian town of Alexandria had already refused to take the oath until
there was an agreement defining the total strength of Ukrainian armed
forces.
Russia and Ukraine form the backbone of the commonwealth and their
falling-out would spell the end of the fledgling organisation. The 11 member
states agreed at their meeting in Minsk a week ago to submit all strategic
forces to a unified command. But while Russia says the fleet, which has 300
ships, counts as strategic, Ukraine says it does not.
In an indication of how deeply Russian feelings run, both vice-president
Alexander Rutskoi, an air force general who wants strong rule, and Mr
Vladimir Lukin, the liberal who chairs the Russian parliament's foreign
affairs committee, backed an appeal to the Ukrainian parliament to clarify
the situation.
Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee, warned
yesterday: 'This is playing with fire . . . it could also become a weapon in
the hands of conservatives.'
He said Russia might have to use force if the two sides failed to agree. But
he added that a solution was still possible, saying the issue was best
tackled at the highest level, by President Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian
counterpart, Mr Leonid Kravchuk.
In Kiev Mr Vasily Durdinets, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament defence
committee, said more negotiations were needed because of differences over
the size of the fleet to be transferred to Ukraine.

FT  06 JAN 92 / No harm in wishful thinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the European heads of government undertook, at their summit in
Maastricht last month, to develop a common foreign and security policy, many
people sniggered incredulously. The programme for Economic and Monetary
Union might be over-ambitious, but at least the target was definable. A
common foreign policy, by contrast, is impossible to define in advance, and
its development is wholly contingent on unpredictable events.
Moreover, the objective seemed at variance with the national interests or
historic reflexes of the member states. They had been at odds over the Gulf
war, and they were still at odds over the recognition of Croatia.
And yet the 12 proceeded almost immediately to adopt a common doctrine of
the principles which would in future govern their recognition of foreign
states. It is particularly surprising because these principles are quite
different from those normally applied.
Western governments have in the past tended to treat recognition as a
factual, rather than as a moral question. A state which appears to be
reliably in control of pretty well all its territory, within recognised
borders, can normally expect to be recognised by other governments. It may
be a nice state or it may be nasty, but it exists; it is a fact.
By contrast, the new Community doctrine lays down five political/moral
preconditions for recognition: observance of the UN Charter and the Helsinki
Final Act; guarantees of the rights of ethnic and national minorities;
respect for national frontiers; acceptance of existing commitments on
disarmament and non-proliferation; and a commitment to settle by negotiation
the problems of successor states or regional differences.
This new doctrine can be explained on two levels. First, the French wanted
to restrain German impatience to recognise Croatia, or at least to clothe it
in a general policy. Second, Yugoslavia was seen as a portent of the
disintegration of the Soviet Union. This would spawn new countries, and the
12 needed to agree some principles for responding to the situation.
In principle, all European countries are already committed, through the
Helsinki process, to certain standards of civilised behaviour. The Community
is entitled to point this out, therefore, at a time when a dozen new
countries are reaching for state-hood.
But the doctrine contains a most extraordinarily ambitious hidden agenda,
for it implies an intention to follow through with some form of intervention
if the conditions are not met.
Let us suppose that Ukraine, for example, fails to satisfy the Community's
five conditions. There are then two options. The first is that the 12 will
refuse to acknowledge Ukraine's existence. The second is that the 12 will
try to persuade, or compel, it to meet the conditions.
The first option is obviously absurd. In theory, the Community could ignore
Montenegro; it could not conceivably ignore Ukraine with more than 50m
inhabitants, a seat in the UN, and quite possibly a large nuclear arsenal as
well.
The inference must be that the Community would be prepared to exert pressure
on Ukraine to compel it to meet the conditions; but if moral suasion, the
withholding of aid, or a trade embargo failed to do the trick, what then?
It is obvious that none of the five principles is being observed in
Yugoslavia. This is not preventing German, and later general Community,
recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Yet the inconsistency is not
necessarily fatal for the purposes of the Community doctrine, because the
real test of whether the 12 mean what they say will come with the ex-Soviet
Union.
The critical question is that of arms control. The commonsense
interpretation of the Community's new doctrine, is that the
newly-independent republics must take over the obligations of the former
Soviet Union to reduce the level of conventional and strategic nuclear
weapons under the CFE and Start treaties.
We do not yet know if the new Republics want to carry out these arms control
agreements, because their attention is focused much more on each other than
on the west. Ukrainian leaders have made ambivalent and contradictory
statements about the nuclear weapons on their territory; but statements made
in the context of inter-republic bargaining in the formation of the new
Commonwealth do not necessarily imply settled long-term objectives.
In fact, the new republics almost certainly cannot take over the Soviet
Union's arms control commitments, legally, politically or physically.
The Start and CFE treaties were not ratified by the Soviet Union; therefore,
they cannot be taken over by the republics. On the other hand, the
Non-Proliferation Treaty was ratified; so perhaps all the Republics are
legally nuclear weapons states.
Conventional arms control is just as difficult, because the geographic zones
agreed in the CFE treaty were only valid for the Soviet Union. They are
manifestly inapplicable to the new situation, because the territorial areas
do not correspond with national frontiers, let alone with national
ambitions.
If Start and CFE have no legal force, the rest of the world has two options:
hope that the republics agree terms between themselves which we can live
with; or demand a negotiation of new treaties. Neither option looks
promising until there is real stability in the east; and that may take
years.
It looks, therefore, as though there may be a quite unusually large dose of
wishful thinking in the Community's five principles. This is not a
condemnation of the principles; on the contrary, the Community today, like
the US 200 years ago, must be built on principles. But we need to remember
that a common foreign policy will not be built in a day.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Your mind is but a pandemonium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am regularly transported by works of philosophy. This Christmas, the good
deed was performed by Consciousness Explained,* the effervescent latest
offering from Daniel Dennett, the American philosopher of mind. Within a few
pages I was once again questioning the world's priorities. Why do we spend
such an inordinate time analysing trivia such as elections, recessions and
bank frauds while virtually ignoring the fantastic philosophical mysteries
of human life?
Consciousness may seem as untroubling a concept as rain or money: it is what
happens when you wake up each morning. The difficulty lies in finding a
place for it in a scientific description of the world. Most of us are
unthinking materialists. Without fully comprehending the intricacies of
modern physics, we believe the world is composed of particles of some kind -
particles that if split will unleash huge amounts of energy. We believe in
science because it works: it conquers diseases, builds bridges and puts men
on the moon.
But now consider your own inner mental life. Imagine a beautiful sunset. How
is this image consistent with the objective world of science? How could a
collection of particles - or anything physical - constitute a mental image
of a sunset? And where, indeed, does that image reside? It is not literally
in our heads: it could not be found by a brain surgeon. Yet neither is it in
the external physical world.
Descartes proposed a famous solution: dualism. The world consists of two
types of substance: physical objects (including our brains), and minds. He
even speculated that the pineal gland in the brain provides a direct link to
the non-physical mind. But dualism seems a hopelessly flawed theory. How can
non-physical thoughts gain any purchase on the physical world? They are not
streams of sub-atomic particles or anything else physical, so how can they
influence brain cells? It is like expecting a shadow to lift a weight.
Believing they could not doubt their inner mental lives, Schopenhauer and
other German idealists took one logical route: they denied the reality of
the physical world. Most of us are not prepared to make that bold leap:
hence the vexed search for a physical explanation of consciousness.
In Consciousness Explained, Mr Dennett argues that Cartesian dualism,
although discredited, has left an unfortunate legacy: we no longer believe
the pineal gland is a 'fax machine to the soul' but we have unconsciously
absorbed Descartes's assumption that perceptual information is ordered and
processed by a mysterious central entity - 'I'. Mr Dennett claims there is
no inner sanctum, no 'Oval Office', nothing that corresponds to our ordinary
notion of personal identity.
Instead he puts forward a 'pandemonium' theory of consciousness. Information
of different kinds is bombarding different parts of the brain all the time.
It is processed in parallel by millions of separate specialist circuits -
none of which is intelligent or conscious - and subject to continual
revision. The circuits dealing with words he calls 'language demons'. But
evolution has thrown up hosts of others, such as our automatic tendency to
duck when objects loom before our eyes. What we think of as consciousness is
the product of 'competition among the many concurrent contentful events in
the brain'. He contrasts this view of consciousness as a democratic society
of competing perceptual agents with Descartes's 'bureaucratic model' of a
central processor - the mysterious soul - controlling everything.
Mr Dennett admits his theory is little more than a suggestive sketch. But it
has the virtue of actually trying to explain something. Positing a soul or
central agency merely avoids the difficult questions: how is IT able to
function as a conscious agent? Mr Dennett's pandemonium model rings true to
personal experience. When I write - or think - I find ideas and images
bubbling up in an uncontrollable fashion exactly as he suggests. It helps
explain how we can answer questions without planning what we are going to
say. Writing in 1739, David Hume, the Scottish philosopher, put it thus:
'For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always
stumble on some particular perception or other . . . I never can catch
myself at any time without a perception, and I can never observe anything
but the perception . . .'
You may think something is missing. How can a heap of circuitry be conscious
of itself? Mr Dennett's answer is that the individual bits of the brain,
built to perceive the external world, cannot help 'perceiving' each other:
hence our confused image of our own identity. It follows that a sufficiently
complex computer could be as conscious as you or I. Mr Dennett is unruffled
by this thought: if you are already a materialist and thus accept that flesh
and blood can be conscious, why should you baulk at a conscious heap of
silicon?
I find Mr Dennett's theories about personal identity stimulating, if not
entirely comprehensible. But I am less certain the book justifies its title.
Go back to the mental image of a sunset. How can this really have a physical
explanation? Mr Dennett's answer is that an explanation is valid only if it
goes beyond the thing to be explained. Thus a proper theory of consciousness
should not allude to mental images. I remain mystified and intend to make
matters worse by listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony - surely not a
collection of sub-atomic particles.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Monday Interview: Militant beneath the bourgeois -
Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the Front National, speaks to Ian Davidson and
William Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large pair of blackamoor figures, bearing candelabra lampstands, take
pride of place in the sitting room of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the one-eyed
ex-paratrooper who runs France's Front National (FN).
They strike an ironic note, given the anti-immigrant policies of Mr Le Pen,
president of Europe's largest extreme right-wing political party. But then
everything about Mr Le Pen's comfortably bourgeois image, from his dark
suits to his smoothly persuasive speech, contrasts with the content of his
policies, which were condemned recently as an 'enemy of democracy' by Mrs
Edith Cresson, the prime minister.
Mr Le Pen runs his party - which he denies is extreme right wing - from a
large and rambling second empire villa in an exclusive suburban enclave on
the hills of St Cloud, looking out on a fine north-easterly view of Paris.
Mr Le Pen did unexpectedly well in the 1988 presidential elections, with
more than 14 per cent of the vote. His party - especially strong in the
south-east of France and in areas with a large migrant population - looks
like doing even better in next March's regional election, in which Mr Le Pen
claims that the FN will secure more than 20 per cent of the vote. 'If the
establishment had solved the problems facing the people, the people would
feel content and would vote for the establishment,' he says.
Indeed, Mr Le Pen seems to be so successful in his campaign to mobilise both
the anti-immigrant and protest votes, that the traditional conservative
parties have started to move sharply to the right in his wake. Central to
his platform are anti-immigrant themes, similar to those pushed by like
minded parties across Europe, such as Vlaams Blok, the Flemish nationalist
party in Belgium and the neo-Nazi movement in Germany. Yet Mr Le Pen denies
being a racist or xenophobe.
Mr Le Pen is a large, fair-haired man, who was born in Britanny, where his
father was a fishing skipper. Upstairs, in Mr Le Pen's comfortable study,
reminders of his Breton origins are everywhere.
The bookshelves are crowded with naval memorabilia, including models of a
three-masted sailing ship and an Arab dhow. There is an outsize pair of
coastguard binoculars on a tripod, which could be pointing in the direction
of the presidential Elysee palace.
On the mantlepiece are two handbound red volumes recording the many libel
suits Mr Le Pen has fought and won. He has also lost some, and last year
paid FFr1.4m (Pounds 143,000) damages and costs - a record in France - to
groups representing concentration camp survivors and descendants, for having
publicly dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as 'a detail of history'.
In the rough and tumble of his early political career, which started in the
1950s with the Poujadists, the populist shopkeepers' party founded by Pierre
Poujade, Mr Le Pen used to sport a black eye patch and khaki fatigues.
Today, the military look has been discarded and Mr Le Pen projects an image
of comfortable civilian respectability.
Discoursing easily, with grandiose Gallic gestures, he attributes the FN's
appeal to the crises of joblessness, industrial decline and urban violence,
but above all to immigration. Mainstream parties have failed to tackle
France's ills, he argues.
'Objectively, things are not all right in a country where you have 4m real
unemployed, for to the 2.9m officially unemployed, you must add 1.1m who
find themselves without productive work, in various traineeships, passing
from an apprenticeship in knitting to an apprenticeship in English.
'Four million immigrants, 6m, no-one knows within a million. Their presence
is felt in a negative way by the French because it is one of the causes of
unemployment, but also of insecurity and more generally, of urban
overpopulation, of the Babelisation of schools, and of the social security
deficit.' He puts the cost of immigration at FFr250bn and the cost of
unemployment at FFr300bn, without indicating where these figures come from
or what they mean.
Mr Le Pen's argument rambles on hypnotically, taking emotional rather than
logical turns. The immigration burden has contributed to an economic
decline, he repeats. 'One sees clearly that whole sectors of the economy
have collapsed in our country; factories have been closed one after the
other; the mines, steel, metal working, shipyards, the merchant navy, port
traffic have all disappeared. Now electronics and office equipment are in
collapse; tomorrow cars and aerospace will be under threat. The building
industry is in trouble.
'The Socialist government has said for several years: 'don't worry, the
recovery will come from the US'. Well and good, let's wait. Then it doesn't
come - and it won't come, at least not tomorrow. What is going well, and
advancing with giant strides, is the most terrible scourge of all time:
Aids. Your compatriot, Jimmy Goldsmith, by the way shares my conviction that
this is the most important phenomenon of the millennium  - so important that
perhaps there will not be another. There is also the exponential growth of
drugs.'
He returns to immigration - Mr Le Pen's main stock in trade. 'We do not want
to allow ourselves to be submerged by foreign immigration. It is clear that
France is not a country of immigration,' he argues, meaning that France has
never been accustomed to accept large numbers of arrivals.
He goes on: 'We will undertake before the people to reverse the flow of
immigration. That is to say we will organise the return to their own
countries, in the most positive manner possible, those foreigners whom
France neither needs nor wants.'
In another proposal to reverse the immigrant flow, Mr Le Pen would tighten
France's nationality laws, so that citizenship could only be inherited from
a French parent, or acquired by naturalisation. This would have to be 'asked
for, earned and granted'. He would thus revoke the right to citizenship
which comes from being born in France.
It is a mark of the way in which the respectable French right has swung
behind the FN on immigration that former President Mr Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, now leader of the centre-right UDF group, advocates a policy on
French nationality law - both on parentage and naturalisation - similar to
that of Mr Le Pen.
Mr Le Pen's claim that France is not a country of immigration does not
square with the historical facts. The proportion of immigrants to the whole
population - roughly 6 per cent - is broadly what it was between the wars
and at the end of the last century; many of these earlier generations of
immigrants became French. As a result, according to a recent calculation by
Insee, the national statistical office, there are probably about 14m people
in France who are either immigrants or have immigrant parents or
grandparents; and 10m of them have French nationality.
Whatever the actual number, Mr Le Pen claims that most of the immigrants in
France have no right to stay because they entered the country illegally as a
result of the laxity or complicity of successive governments over the years.
There are 4.1m immigrants in France, of whom 1.3m have French nationality,
say the latest official estimates. There are also believed to be significant
numbers of illegal immigrants, for which there are, of course, no official
statistics; a recent estimate puts the number in the Paris region at
200,000.
Mr Le Pen's other stock in trade is defence of national sovereignty against
the growing integration of the European Community. He lost his seat in the
French national assembly in 1988, but has kept his seat in the European
Parliament, as leader of the ultra-nationalist European Rights Group.
He indignantly rejects President Francois Mitterrand's aspirations for a
federal future in Europe, and in the name of the nation state denounces the
agreements recently concluded in Maastricht. 'For me, the Socialist federal
Europe, which I call the Europe of federasts, is a double perversity.
'The federal Europe which Maastricht is preparing for us in a sly and
undemocratic manner, would perhaps have been a good idea in the middle of
the 19th century. Today it is an undertaking which is obviously obsolete and
absurd, since the two big world empires are in the process of breaking up.'
He argues that it is easier to join a federation than to leave, and cites
the case of Yugoslavia. 'The Europeans are obviously in disagreement over
any issue of foreign policy,' says Mr Le Pen, 'and their divergences can
only get worse'.
On a recent visit to London he was heckled by left-wing demonstrators. But
Mr Le Pen claims that he encountered many expressions of sympathy - and
fellow feeling - from the British. He thought that a party like his would do
well there, if it were not for the 'castrating' electoral system in Britain;
and he confesses to feeling quite close to Mrs Thatcher.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Sterling faces test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING will face the true test of its late rally last week, as the markets
gather in full force after the new year holiday.
Its moves in a thin market last week were dismissed as exaggerated and
misleading by many traders.
There was some speculation that the pound would come under renewed pressure,
although dealers believed that the Bank of England would be more visible in
supporting the UK currency than in recent weeks. 'The bank has sufficient
reserves to fend off a fairly good downwards push on the pound,' said Mr
David Dean, assistant chief dealer at Barclays.
The pressure for a rise in interest rates had been eased somewhat by
sterling's strength. 'At the moment things are looking comfortable,' said
one senior dealer.
Sterling, along with the dollar, had become a safe haven for investors
fleeing the D-Mark. But traders said were expecting a reappraisal of the
pound and the dollar this week.
In the US, investors will be watching the outcome of President George Bush's
visit to Tokyo this week, where it is likely that he will win some
concessions to keep the yen firm.
President Bush arrives in Tokyo on Tuesday.
The urgency of his efforts to put some life into a moribund economy will be
highlighted by the employment report due out this Friday.
'We will find out just how awful the US economy really is,' said Dr Mark
Austin, economist with Hongkong Bank.
The Federal Reserve has been debating the need for a further cut in its fund
rate as a last-ditch measure to spark economic recovery before the election.

Another continent - South America - has been added to BOVIS INTERNATIONAL'S
site list with the company's new project management contract to renovate the
listed Copacabana Palace Hotel (pictured) in Rio de Janeiro for Companhia
Hoteis Palace, a subsidiary of Sea Containers.
A team from Bovis International has already spent two months in Rio carrying
out a technical audit on the existing buildings and preparing various
different options for the planned USDollars 25m (Pounds 13.6m) renovation.
The renovation programme will increase the number of rooms in the main

FT  06 JAN 92 / Appointments: No answers at Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spotting a successor to Sir Jeremy Morse, Britain's longest serving clearing
bank chairman, has been made no easier following the latest reshuffle in the
Lloyds Bank boardroom. Eric Swainson, a director since 1986 and a regional
board member from 1979, will become a vice-chairman following the annual
general meeting in April. The 65-year-old Swainson, a former managing
director of IMI, is a well-known Midlands businessman, but he is just one of
several vice and deputy chairmen and two years older than Sir Jeremy who is
expected to stand down within the next couple of years.
Meanwhile, Sir John Hedley Greenborough is retiring as a deputy chairman and
Sir William Harding as adviser on international affairs. Both men will
remain on the board but Geoffrey Kent, a former chief executive of Imperial
group, is stepping down as a director on reaching the age of 70.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Appointments: Cowan moves to Jardine Matheson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Price Waterhouse partner who led the firm's audit of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, Christopher Cowan, is to leave the firm for JARDINE
MATHESON, the Hong Kong-based trading group.
The timing of the move could be difficult for Price Waterhouse, which is in
the midst of one of the toughest battles in its history to defend its audit
of the failed bank. He leaves to become finance director of Jardine in May -
barely giving him time to defend Price Waterhouse before the UK official
enquiry into BCCI, which is not expected to be completed before the middle
of the year. The firm insisted yesterday that Cowan had not been asked to
leave, and that he would be sorely missed.
A 45-year-old audit partner in the firm's London financial institutions
group, Cowan had been working virtually full- time on BCCI in the two years
before it was closed in July.
The move to Jardine to take over from Peter Collins, who retires after 18
years with the group, is said to have been under discussion for some time
before BCCI's problems exploded into public view last July. Cowan had first
acted for Jardine while a PW partner on secondment in Hong Kong between 1982
and 1985.

Results due
LONG regarded as one of the stock market's favourite 'recovery plays',
Dixons is likely to disappoint some followers by emitting cautious noises
about the state of the electrical goods retailing market when it reports
interim results on Wednesday.
Pre-tax profits may have fallen to Pounds 20m from Pounds 27m. Christmas,
which falls after the end of the interim period, is also not expected to
have been as buoyant as previously hoped.
The UK retailing division should have continued its profits improvement, but
any advances will have been dragged down by losses at Silo, in the US, and
reduced contributions from property and interest.
Securicor, the security and parcels delivery company, and its 51 per cent
controlled sister, Security Services, report full-year earnings on Thursday.
The figures are likely to reflect an improvement from the companies' 40 per
cent stake in Cellnet, the mobile telephone network, which disappointed at
the half-year.
The companies are still dominated by Cellnet earnings. While Cellnet has
suffered from a higher rate of disconnection than its main competitor,
Vodafone, profits are likely to have benefited from a recession-induced cut
in capital spending.
Securicor is estimated to have made pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m (Pounds
51.9m).
The pre-tax figure for Security Services, which is consolidated, is expected
to be Pounds 21m (Pounds 36.1m).

FT  06 JAN 92 / The Week Ahead: US employment data may lead Fed to cut rates
again - Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION will focus this week on the extent to which the pound's position
in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is affected by increased
activity on foreign exchange markets following the holiday break.
Analysts will also be looking for a run of employment data from the US and
Germany. These will provide clues as to the degree to which both economies
may be slowing down, possibly pushing the world economy as a whole nearer to
recession.
Sterling has been under pressure since just before Christmas, when all the
other ERM countries raised interest rates, following Germany's lead.
So far, the UK government has weathered the storm, as the pound has failed
to slip close enough to its effective ERM floor to require either a
politically damaging increase in borrowing rates, or official intervention
to boost the currency.
However, all this could change later today as trading in currencies picks up
following the thin volumes of the past two weeks. Coming to the UK
government's support might be signs of a weakening in the D-Mark, which
would take the pressure off the pound and also other ERM currencies,
including the French franc and the Italian lire, which have also showed
signs of fragility.
The employment data in the US in particular will be watched for any
indications that the Federal Reserve might feel moved to cut US borrowing
rates once more, after the 1 percentage point cut last month, in an effort
to revive the flagging economy.
The Bundesbank council meets in Frankfurt on Thursday. But in the absence of
any shows of masochism by its members, the council is thought unlikely to
opt for any further increase in German rates.
Highlights of the week ahead, with forecasts in brackets from MMS
International, a financial information company, include:
Today: US, car sales in final week of December (6.2m); UK, final figures for
money supply in November; Switzerland, December consumer price index (up 0.1
per cent on month, 5.6 per cent on year); Australia, current account deficit
in November (ADollars 1.2bn, seasonally adjusted); Japan, foreign exchange
reserves last month; Canada, building permits in October.
Tomorrow: UK, 3rd quarter 1991 savings ratio and growth in real personal
disposable incomes; Canada, leading economic indicators for October.
Wednesday: US, November increase in consumer credit (Dollars 100m);
Australia, November building permits.
Thursday: US, December producer price index (flat month-on-month), index
excluding food and energy (up 0.2 per cent), initial claims for week ending
December 28 (447,500), money supply data for week ending December 30;
Germany, regular Bundesbank council meeting, unemployment (up 2,500) and
vacancies for west Germany in December, employment in west Germany in
November (down 5,000), unemployment in east Germany in December, not
seasonally adjusted (up 30,000); UK, November housing starts.
Friday: US, December unemployment rate, non-farm payrolls (down 50,000),
manufacturing payroll (down 32,500) hourly earnings, average workweek;
Canada, December employment and jobless figures.
During the week: Germany, November industrial and manufacturing production
(down 0.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent on month) and manufacturing orders
(flat), November visible trade surplus and current account deficit (DM2.5bn
and DM1bn), October producer price index for east Germany.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Tesco superstore scheme in Dudley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 9.1m superstore and petrol filling station for Tesco is being built
and fitted out by TARMAC CONSTRUCTION.
The store and petrol station at Dudley in the west Midlands is being built
for Tarmac Properties, and fitted out for Tesco. Work on the project is
expected to be completed in July.
Tarmac Properties is negotiating for a DIY store and fast food outlet on the
site, situated at the busy junction of the main roads to Birmingham,
Wolverhampton and Dudley.
The store is among contracts worth a total of Pounds 13m awarded to Tarmac
Construction.
Other projects are alterations and refurbishment to a four-storey block of

the construction of 40 flatlets and six flats at Rotherham for Anchor
Housing Association for Pounds 950,000.
Two hospital schemes are also included, a revised contract increased to
Pounds 1m for further improvements and extensions to provide wards and

on the site at Sunnyside, Liverpool, for Liver Housing Association at a cost
of Pounds 950,000; convert 44 flats at Manchester for Broughton Park Jewish
Housing Association (Pounds 620,000); repair 45 houses at Oldbury for
Sandwell Council (Pounds 640,000); and modernise 20 houses for Bradford
Metropolitan Council (Pounds 550,000).

FT  06 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Association of International
Bond Dealers officially changes it name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On January 1, the Association of International Bond Dealers, which regulates
secondary market activity in international securities, officially changed
its name to the International Securities Market Association, writes Tracy
Corrigan.
The new name, chosen at the association's annual general meeting in Hong
Kong last May, reflects the broadening of the group's membership in recent
years.
Established in 1969 as a Eurobond market trade association, the organisation
now represents 900 institutions, including fund managers, brokers and
dealers.

FT  06 JAN 92 / International Swaps: Europe contributes to buoyant activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the international swap market remained buoyant in 1991,
according to a survey by the International Swap Dealers Association.
The survey of swap dealers, conducted on the ISDA's behalf by Arthur
Andersen, shows the notional principal amount of interest rate and currency
swaps written in the first half of 1991 totalled Dollars 923bn, a 41 per
cent increase over the first half of 1990. Figures for the second half of
the year are not yet available.
Interest rate swaps accounted for Dollars 762bn and currency swaps for
Dollars 161bn (equivalent) of the total, representing increases of 36 per
cent and 70 per cent respectively over comparable levels in 1990.
Although dollar swaps still represent the largest portion of the market,
dealers reported continued growth in other areas, such as Swiss francs and
French francs. Italian lira interest rate swap activity increased by 452 per
cent, compared with the first half of 1990.
Activity in related products - caps, floors, collars and swap options
(swaptions) - totalled just under Dollars 200bn, an increase of 44 per cent
over the same period in 1990.
The World Bank has awarded the mandate to arrange its next global bond
offering to Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch. The deal, totalling Dollars
1.5bn, and will have a maturity of 10 years. The bond offering is expected
to be launched on Wednesday, for pricing on Thursday.
Demand for dollar securities is strong, due to the lack of supply during the
market's rally over Christmas. This lack of supply caused Eurobond yield
spreads to tighten to historically very narrow levels, despite the price
rally in the government bond market.
The World Bank's outstanding 8 1/8 per cent bonds due 2001 are currently bid
at 22 basis points above the comparable US Treasury, but that deal is
trading at a substantial premium to par. The new global deal is expected to
be priced at a spread of less than 20 basis points above the Treasury yield
curve.
Yamaichi International, the London-based arm of the Japanese securities
house, plans to make a market in Ecu Eurobonds from today, as part of a
programme of expansion of its bond market activities.
The latest addition to the ranks of Ecu Eurobond market-makers will bring
the total number to 41 dealers. Most houses now see Ecu trading as a key
strategic market, and are keen to establish a foothold.

FT  06 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Contrasting views fuel bullishness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE THE US capital markets suffering from a bad bout of split personality?
The question is prompted by the bullish behaviour of both stock and bond
markets over the past few weeks, with the equity rally apparently
underpinned by an optimistic view of the US economy, but the fixed-income
rally by a pessimistic one. The stock market surge which began just before
Christmas took the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 3,200 barrier on
Friday for the first time - a level which is assuming a lot of good
corporate news in 1992 and 1993.
A year-long upswing also continued in the bond market, where prices tend to
rise on bad economic news, which implies a diminution of the inflation which
undermines the value of fixed-income securities. Yet the most recent rally
in Treasury prices lost a little of its momentum, yielding to a bout of
profit-taking. The short and medium-term sectors suffered small price
declines, with the 10-year Treasury note ending the week down  1/8 .
However, the benchmark 30-year bond gained about half a point on the week,
dropping the yield from 7.51 to 7.47 and helping to flatten the extremely
steep yield curve. The spread between the 30 and 10-year issues narrowed
from 70 basis points to 65.
The primary stimulus behind the equity and bond market rallies was the
dramatic easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve on December 20,
when the discount rate was dropped by a full point to 3.5 per cent in an
effort to jump-start the economy out of its prolonged recession, with the
target for the key Fed funds rate dropping to 4 per cent.
The Wall Street consensus is that while the first two quarters of 1992 could
see little economic upswing, by the middle of the year the US may begin
growing again at an annual rate of around 3 per cent - extremely modest by
the standards of past recoveries.
The recovery will be impeded by a deteriorating international economic
outlook, high levels of personal and corporate debt, and severely undermined
consumer confidence.
However, while the stock market is focusing on the apparently better -
although still highly uncertain - prospects for the second half of 1992 and
1993, the bond market is concentrating on the problems likely over the next
six months and prospects for yet Certainly the economic indicators released
over the past week have done little to dispel the economic gloom. The index
of manufacturing activity produced by the National Association of Purchasing
Managers dipped below 50 per cent in December for the first time since June.
This suggests the sector is contracting again.
This Friday will bring employment figures for December, and these are
expected to show a further deterioration.
Against this background, many analysts are expecting further Fed easing
during the current quarter, with the Fed funds rate dropping to 3.75 per
cent or even 3.5 before its monetary stance begins to tighten.
That in turn should feed through to much lower rates at the long end of the
maturity spectrum, since two of the factors which have most unsettled the
bond market recently now seem less of a threat.
One is politics, where talk of stimulative fiscal packages by Congress
repeatedly unsettled Wall Street last autumn. Given that this is a
presidential election year, some action is inevitable in Washington. However
the market is growing increasingly confident that this will involve more
showmanship than substance, with neither President Bush nor Congress willing
to significantly increase the already bloated federal budget deficit.
The other benign factor is the trend of inflation, which is likely to
decelerate further over the next few months, thanks to the continued
economic stagnation.
And it is in their expectations for low inflation, coupled with some kind of
second-half economic recovery, that the bond and equity markets find some
common ground for their collective optimism.
Whether this is justified is another matter. The bond market team at
brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette argues that the inflation rate will
be no less than 4 per cent over the next few years, on the grounds that
capacity utilisation is already relatively high, the unemployment rate is
not that low by past standards, and the top concern of the monetary
authorities is a restimulation of economic activity.
Certainly, inflation is likely to seem more of a threat as the year
proceeds, and the yield on the long bond, which some expect to touch 7 per
cent in the first half, could be back on a rising trend by mid-year.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Gilts: Investors keep close eye on sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YIELDS on gilt-edged securities edged down as market-makers late last week
bought the bonds, which were buoyed by a stronger pound and reassurances by
government ministers that devaluation was not an option.
However, any signs of weakness by sterling today as traders return in force
from the holiday break are likely to scare off potential gilt investors,
damping a further rise in the market.
Pension funds and other large institutions were not much in evidence as
buyers last week. Purchases were mainly left to market-makers, many of whom
were short of stock following the poor spell for the market over the past
month.
As sterling moved higher at the end of last week, the gilt market recovered.
Sterling drifted up on Friday to DM2.8550, about 10 pfennigs below its
central rate of DM2.95 in the exchange rate mechanism, and comfortably above
its lower effective limit of about DM2.84.
Aided by the stronger pound, prices for many types of gilt rose by about 1
percentage point on Thursday, with the momentum continuing on Friday. That
lifted the market for the week, with yields pushed down by roughly 10 basis
points (0.1 percentage points) at the long end of the market and slightly
more for shorter-dated gilts.
Those investors who were active in the market took advantage of generally
low prices due to the under-performance in December of gilts against other
leading European government bonds, much of this due to nervousness about
sterling and the UK government's election prospects.
Little has happened in the past two weeks to shake the general belief that
the UK recovery will be slow and weak. This should help the gilt market by
damping inflationary pressures and keeping up long-term downward pressure on
interest rates.
However, the negative point for the market is that the poor outlook for the
economy will probably diminish the popularity of the Conservative
government. That, in turn, may undermine sterling, making it harder for the
government to make the cut in UK interest rates which many believe is
necessary to revive the economy.
Disappointingly for many business people, consumers and politicians, base
rates have been stuck for four months at 10.5 per cent, after coming down at
half-point intervals between February and September by a total of 3.5
percentage points.
'The government is still looking for a way out of the vicious circle in the
effort to get interest rates down,' said Mr Robin Marshall, UK economist at
Chase Manhattan, the US investment bank.
As for the gilts market, much will depend on whether the pound suffers
serious selling pressure this week. If investors decide that the higher
interest rates in Germany and other European countries are sufficient to
tempt them to shift funds out of sterling, the government might be forced to
bite the bullet and increase rates, in precisely the wrong direction from
the one that would aid the economy. That, in turn, could send the Tories'
opinion poll ratings plummeting, increasing selling pressure on gilts.
Even without comments last week by the prime minister, the chancellor and
the Bank of England governor that the pound would stay within its ERM bands,
many onlookers believe a devaluation is highly unlikely. Such a move,
however, may be called for as an alternative to a rate rise, should the
pound fall too close to its effective ERM floor.
In the gilt market last week, the overall weak tone was illustrated by the
little interest being shown by investors in a tap stock issued by the Bank
in mid-December of Pounds 1bn worth of 8.5 per cent Treasury bonds maturing
in 2007. One estimate on Friday was that only about a third of this had been
taken up by market-makers and investing institutions, with nervousness about
the next few weeks for both sterling and gilts well to the fore.

FT  06 JAN 92 / European Futures: Volatile conditions boost trading levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL futures trading in Europe reached record levels in 1991, as
volatile market conditions encouraged more market participants to use
futures and options to take positions and to hedge exposure.
European bond markets became increasingly futures-driven, as institutional
investors made use of liquid stock index and bond futures and options to
shift the composition of their portfolios.
New products were plentiful. Italian bond futures met an enthusiastic
welcome, while the reception for pan-European stock index futures and
options was positively frosty. Competition between exchanges for new
products intensified, as exchanges launched competing contracts and rushed
to grab new markets.
Rivalry was most intense between the London International Financial Futures
Exchange (Liffe), the Matif in Paris, and the Deutsche Terminborse in
Frankfurt, part of a wider battle for pre-eminence as Europe's financial
centre.
In addition, two new exchanges were established: Belfox, the Belgian futures
and options exchange, started trading futures on the Belgian government bond
market in December and plans to launch options on six Belgian stocks and
futures and options on its Bel-20 Beglian stock index this year; Otob, the
Austrian exchange, also plans to add to its initially successful options
contracts on five companies.
Liffe won the battle for trading volume in 1991 by a surprisingly small
margin over the Matif. Liffe traded a record 38.6bn contracts in 1991,
compared with 37.1bn, also a record, for the Matif. Average daily volume
rose 13 per cent on Liffe, compared with 30 per cent for the Matif.
Each won a round of the fight for dominance of two new contracts - Ecu and
Italian bond futures - with London recording a decisive win with its
successful Italian bond contract, while Paris gained the upper hand on the
Ecu bond contract, which, although not yet heavily traded, could soon be the
most important European contract.
But the fiercest contest has been for dominance of the heavily-traded Bund
futures market. The DTB, backed by the German banks, put its full weight
behind efforts to attract Bund futures trading from Liffe. The DTB, which
traded 15.4bn contracts in 1991, was partially successful in winning
business back, but not without prompting accusations of unfair tactics, such
as the setting of minimum trading levels by some members, which the DTB
denied.
In equity options trading, the DTB overtook the European Options Exchange as
the leading European exchange in traded options. Volume in options contracts
reached 11.6bn on the DTB, up from 6.7bn, compared with 10.5 for the EOE,
virtually unchanged from the previous year.
Among other exchanges, Soffex, the Swiss exchange, traded 10.3bn contracts,
up 14 per cent, while OM, the Swedish exchange, recorded volume of 9.2bn
contracts.
Competition between European exchanges, and increasingly with their US
counterparts, is likely to mount this year. In a few months, the merger of
Liffe and the London Traded Options Market, will make the new exchange, the
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffoe), the
third largest in the world after the two in Chicago.
The battle for dominance of various European contracts is set to continue,
as the number of new contracts emerging slows. One of the few contracts
expected to emerge this year is a short-term lira contract.
Meanwhile, the Italians are planning to win back futures business on Italian
government bonds, when they launch their own screen based trading system,
planned for June.
With Globex, the global electronic trading system created jointly by the
Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, set to
go on trial in January, for launch in the summer, the trend could be set for
a shift away from open-outcry trading. A number of European exchanges are
already considering further automation. Liffoe will have to decide whether
to shift stock options trading on to a screen-based system in resuscitate
the market.

FT  06 JAN 92 / International Equity Issues: Balance sheet repairs and
privatisations revive sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT WAS the year in which equity markets sprang back to life
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and which brought a new burst of equity issues in the international market
place.
The value of international share issues in 1991, at Dollars 20.3bn, was more
than 50 per cent up on the previous 12 months. And with the US stock market
roaring ahead, dragging others behind it, the queue of issuers waiting to
raise fresh equity capital points to a record start to 1992.
Demand for international equity investment bounced back in 1991, after a
year in which institutional investors had largely turned their backs on the
stock markets. There was plenty of supply on tap: companies in the US and
UK, seeking to rebuild their balance sheets after the debt-laden 1980s, and
global privatisation offerings from countries which had barely tapped the
international markets before, led the list of new issues.
During 1990, net cross-border equity flows reached just Dollars 11bn,
according to Salomon Brothers. In 1991, by contrast, the US investment bank
estimates that net flows topped Dollars 50bn. US and continental European
investors have led the new wave of international investment, taking over
from the UK and Japanese investors, who were behind the previous boom in
international investment at the end of the 1980s.
Early in 1991, demand focused largely on convertible issues, rather than
straight equity. Offers from leading UK and US companies, including Hanson
and American Brands, helped take the issuance of convertibles in the
international market in the first six months to nearly Dollars 6bn, more
than the whole of any of the previous three years.
A steady flow of new shares from US companies, at more than double 1990's
Dollars 2.5bn, was the dominant factor behind the strong supply of equity
last year. The continuing supply of UK shares in the international market,
accounted for largely by the Dollars 2bn international tranche in the BT
privatisation during the autumn, was also notable.
However, it was the newcomers to the international market place which stole
the show. Foremost among them was Mexico, which confirmed its return to
favour among international investors with Dollars 3.5bn of new issues.
A Dollars 2.2bn transaction from Telmex led the way, followed later in the
year by deals from Televisa and Vitro. Other unfamiliar issuers came from
South Africa, Israel and New Zealand. Bankers report that issuers from other
so-called emerging markets - including India, Pakistan, Brazil and Argentina
 -are likely to come to the international market next year. Other countries
which generated substantial new issues included France and Italy. The
international offerings from French companies Elf and Total, and the sale by
the Italian investment group, IRI, of holdings in Stet and Credito Italiano,
also pointed towards further international issues from these countries in
the coming year.
This list of companies gives some idea of the sectors which commanded the
interest of international equity investors: telecommunications and energy,
with a considerable volume of issues for food and drinks groups as well.
Each is seen by investors as a sound defensive sector in times of
uncertainty. Telecommunication issues dominated, with utilities from the UK,
Italy, New Zealand and Mexico all mounting substantial international offers.
Given the volume of new issues from the US, and the importance of US
investors in driving international investment, it is perhaps not surprising
to see US investment banks dominate the league tables of lead managers last
year. However, this alone cannot account for the remarkable 32 per cent
market share achieved by Goldman Sachs, which was recorded by Euromoney -
nor the strong performance of Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers International,
Salomon Brothers, and Morgan Stanley.
Rather, the investment made by these institutions in developing their
international investment banking divisions in recent years has clearly begun
to pay off. These five banks were responsible for no less than 60 per cent
of the new international equity issues last year - up from around 30 per
cent during the much quieter 1990.
Only Credit Suisse First Boston, with a market share of 11 per cent, putting
it second to Goldman, could challenge this US dominance.

FT  06 JAN 92 / International Medium-Term Note Issues: European market rises
strongly as focus shifts from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic conditions which favoured the world's bond markets in 1991 also
proved a turning point for the international medium-term note (MTN) market.
After years of languishing in the shadow of the US medium-term note market,
the European market rose strongly in 1991, with new programmes up from
Dollars 31bn in 1990 to Dollars 42bn.
Last year, the substantial shift of investors' funds out of the US into
Europe created a dearth of fixed-income European assets forcing investors to
look again at the MTN market, which they had shunned on the grounds of
illiquidity. At the same time, the liberalisation of regulations governing
MTN issuance in a number of European currencies facilitated the creation of
supply in a range of currencies.
At the same time as investor interest in MTNs grew, borrowers were becoming
increasingly keen to lock in longer-term funding, in an effort to extend the
maturity profile of their debt, and diversify their sources of funding. Many
borrowers had been reluctant to set up MTN programmes, because they were
unwilling to assume the start-up costs while uncertain whether they would be
able to issue a reasonable volume of paper.
Once significant investor interest appeared, cost savings available in the
market proved enticing, particularly for borrowers with regular but smallish
funding requirements which suited the markets ability to absorb small
tranches of notes. The MTN market has largely usurped the position formerly
held by the private placement sector of the Eurobond market, as it has
proved a cheap and convenient channel for structured deals - that is, notes
designed to fit the specific requirements of a given investor. In
particular, a substantial portion of MTNs have been placed in Japan.
However, straightforward issuance is expected to increase due to growing
supply from banks and companies. Many banks which do not have programmes are
waking up to the notion that the market could provide an opportunistic means
of funding. They are not prepared to pay floating-rate interest above Libor,
in order to tap the FRN market, and access to the Eurobond market has become
trickier.
The sterling market, which has been rather slow to evolve since its opening
in 1990, was boosted by the creation of programmes by four UK building
societies, led by the Halifax. But the sterling market has not had the
benefit of Japanese demand, and the investor base remains narrow.
Among other key programmes last year, Abbey National raised its Dollars
1.5bn programme to Dollars 5bn, and now has around Dollars 3bn of notes
outstanding globally, around half in Europe. In August, IBM International
Finance launched an Ecu2bn MTN programme. Although a number of
Ecu-denominated programmes have been set up, the volume of Ecu paper has
been limited because of oversupply of Ecu bonds.

group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROGAL, the Portuguese oil group and the country's largest company, is to
be 90 per cent privatised. An initial 51 per cent stake will be sold this
year.
The government hopes to raise about Esc130bn (Dollars 967m) from the
privatisation. Under terms it approved last week, the privatisation will be
divided into several tranches, with an initial sale of 25 per cent. This
will include a capital increase of around Esc20bn, representing 20 per cent
of the company's share capital, and the direct sale of another 5 per cent
stake.
This first stage of privatisation will be on the basis of competitive bids.
The winner will be chosen during a special session of the stock exchange.
The new shareholders will have preferential rights over the purchase of
another 26 per cent stake later.
The government intends to keep a 10 per cent holding in the company because
of its strategic importance in the economy. Around 20 per cent will be
reserved for employees; 10 per cent for Sonangol, the Angolan oil company
which is an important supplier of oil to Petrogal; and 9 per cent for the
Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, a diversified Portuguese private investment
group. Foreign shareholders will be limited to a maximum 40 per cent
holding.
The new shareholders must also undertake to fulfil commitments and contracts
already agreed by the company, including the modernisation of its large
refinery in Sines, on the southern Atlantic coast, which is expected to cost
about Esc60bn.
In 1990, Petrogal had sales worth Esc419bn and profits of Esc3.5bn. However,
it has suffered increasingly from uncompetitive production costs and
overmanning, and is expected to return a loss in 1991.

charge

WEYERHAEUSER, the forest products group based in Washington state, is
planning to take year-end special charges totalling around Dollars 344m
which will push it into an annual and quarterly loss.
The company, whose profits have been depressed by a cyclical downturn in the
forest products industry, said factors behind the charges included the
length of the economic recession, which had resulted in real estate losses.
In addition, the withdrawal of the supply of timber from public lands in its
north-western heartland would mean some plants would close early and there
would be contractual losses. The amount of logging allowed on public lands
in the area is being curtailed because of environmental concern over a
species of endangered owl.
The company is also moving to implement a new accounting standard for
employees' post-retirement health benefits, which will cost Dollars 125m.
However, new accounting methods for taxation will partly offset that,
producing a Dollars 64m credit.
Mr John Creighton, chief executive, said: 'These actions should put a number
of uncertainties behind us and allow the company to begin 1992 with a clean
slate.'
The company said it had already cut overhead costs by between 10 per cent
and 15 per cent at the corporate level since a refocusing of operations led
by Mr Creighton in 1989. It sold or closed nearly two dozen businesses and
consolidated operations during the reorganisation.
Weyerhaeuser's real estate subsidiary lost Dollars 6.8m in the third
quarter, linked to further weakening in the southern California market and
the nationwide housing recession.

FT  06 JAN 92 / International Company News: Tenneco chief aims to repeat the
turnround trick - Martin Dickson examines the dramatic changes under way at
one of the few remaining large US conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to describe Mr Michael Walsh, the new chief executive of
troubled US conglomerate Tenneco, as 'Action Man,' except that Mr Walsh
hates the tough guy label which Wall Street and the press have hung around
his neck.
'Its so macho, so superficial,' he says. 'Its not a question of being tough,
or not tough, its a question of being realistic.'
Nevertheless, Mr Walsh, an athletic 49-year-old who confesses to playing
rock music louder than his children, has unleashed a whirl of change since
he arrived at the staid Houston company last autumn, including a six-point
'action plan' to strengthen its highly leveraged balance sheet and improve
profits.
The plan, announced just 10 days after his arrival, also owes something to
Tenneco's chairman since 1978, Mr James Ketelsen. But it is to Mr Walsh, who
will become chairman next May, that the group is looking for a turnround
from the lacklustre performance of the past few years - including severe
losses at its JI Case agricultural and construction equipment business.
The hope is that Mr Walsh can repeat the trick he performed between 1986 and
last August as chairman of Union Pacific's railroad business, where he
nearly doubled profits through a shake-up of a mature, traditional business.
He cut costs aggressively, pushed decision-making down the line, removed
bureaucracy and stressed teamwork and innovation.
Tenneco, which ranks 26th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest US
industrial companies, certainly needs shaking up. One of the few remaining
large American conglomerates, its origins lie in the gas pipeline business
which remains its largest income earner.
However, diversification in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, means that its
interests also span automotive components, shipbuilding - submarines and
aircraft carriers - packaging and chemicals, as well as agricultural
equipment.
In 1988, in a move which amazed Wall Street, it sold its huge oil industry
assets for Dollars 7.4bn, so that it could reduce debt, repurchase its
stock, and counter rumours of a break-up bid. The company was in effect
staking its future on an improved performance by Case, the number two US
agricultural equipment maker behind Deere &amp; Co, but which lost money every
year between 1983 and 1988.
In 1989 and 1990 Case, which accounts for some 35 per cent of Tenneco's
revenues, did indeed move strongly into the black, thanks to an upswing in
the volatile tractor cycle. But the past year has been an unmitigated
disaster.
This is partly due to general economic conditions - the farm market has
grown soft, while the construction industry is in deep recession - but Case
also allowed its inventories to get badly out of hand. And as it brings them
under control, it has had to slash both prices and production.
In the first nine months of this year Case produced an operating loss of
Dollars 439m and, in the third quarter, it had to take a Dollars 413m
restructuring charge to cover 4,000 job cuts, plant closures and product
rationalisations.
Tenneco's other businesses are reasonably well regarded, though they have
not fared particularly well during the current recession, with even the gas
pipeline business suffering from a spell of unusually warm weather. And by
last summer, with debt accounting for some 63 per cent of total capital and
on a rising trend, it was clear that strong action was needed to bolster the
group's balance sheet.
The action plan, which was essentially completed by early December, goes
some way to achieving that. It includes a 50 per cent cut in the dividend, a
25 per cent (Dollars 250m) reduction in 1992 capital spending, and the sale
of Dollars 1.05bn of non-core assets, including Tenneco's natural gas
liquids business, which fetched Dollars 632m. It will cut costs by Dollars
250m a year, partly through a further 2,000 job losses, and the group has
also raised Dollars 516m through an offering of preferred stock.
This all looks eye-catchingly dynamic, but it is only the first part of a
turnround which will take much longer to achieve, as Mr Walsh is well aware.
The second stage, he says, involves a much improved financial performance
across the group in 1992. He has set much tougher operating targets for each
of the businesses, with the aim of returning Tenneco to 'respectable levels
of profitability'.
And he makes clear that the ability of subsidiaries to meet these targets
will play a role in the third stage of his plan - which is to determine what
businesses have a place in the long-term future of Tenneco. 'In my mind,' he
says, 'the ability to perform against commitment is an important part of
earning strategic respect.'
He appears to have no strong feelings for or against the conglomerate
structure as such. He says that one advantage of a conglomerate, at least
theoretically, is that you should be able to take profits during the
up-cycle in one part of the business and invest in the down-cycle of another
part; and he points out that single product companies are hardly
problem-free.
'In my book there's one rule that matters: if it works, its good, if it
doesn't work its bad.' He acknowledges that it is hard for a complete
outsider like him to plunge into a complex business like Tenneco and
'overhaul the ship without the luxury of putting it in dry-dock'.
'What you bring to it is a fresh perspective, but you need to be able to
build a bridge to existing management and win their confidence or you don't
have a prayer.' And that means getting out and shaking an awful lot of
hands.
His financial goal is to cut the ratio of debt to total capital to around 50
per cent over the next few years and improve the equity base 'not just
because the rating agencies insist on it, but because its the way I want to
run the company'.
Much will depend on his ability to turn Case around. Mr Walsh acknowledges
that this is not going to be easy, or done 'all in one bite'. But he says
that a lot of inventory has been run off in the fourth quarter and the
market may be sufficiently firm for the company to raise prices and cut its
discounts in 1992.
The division also has a new chief to replace Mr James Ashford, who was once
seen as a potential successor to Mr Ketelsen but resigned abruptly last
March, as Case's problems mounted. The new man is Mr Robert Carlson, whose
past employers included United Technologies, the large Connecticut
technology group, and Deere, where he worked for over 25 years and enjoyed a
good reputation.
Wall Street thinks Tenneco would love to rid itself of Case, but Mr Walsh
refuses to be drawn on the subject, or on persistent rumours that it may
have been discussing a deal or joint venture involving a Japanese company.
All he will say is that 'the world's obviously getting smaller and people
are looking for alliances that make sense'.
Whatever is afoot at Case, dramatic change seems certain across Tenneco. Mr
Walsh says that Mr Tom Peters, a leading US management expert, studied his
techniques at Union Pacific and came to the conclusion that his
across-the-board approach to change works better than incremental fiddling.
'If you don't do this,' says Mr Walsh, 'the organisation will wear you out,
or wait you out, or both. And the idea these organisations are fragile -
like flowers in the late spring - is just something I have found to be not
true.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEAN &amp; BOWES, public house refurbisher, which last year disposed of its
loss-making furniture making and sinage businesses, has acquired Giles &amp; Co,
a Sussex-based holiday centre and hotel construction company.
Dean &amp; Bowes, which acquired EJ Reilley, snooker table manufacturer, last
December for Pounds 1.7m, announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds
1.71m to Pounds 301,000 in the first half of 1991. Mr Stephen Dean,
chairman, said at the time of the results that there ' was no chance we
would announce a loss' for the year, but he thought the group would only
break even.
The Giles deal involves a payment of 3 per cent of the next three years'
turnover which is expected to amount to some Pounds 5m.
The payment will be spread over the three-year period and the acquisition is
expected to add some Pounds 350,000 to net profits of Dean &amp; Bowes over this
time.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Steetley expects to hold dividend despite
profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEETLEY, the building materials group facing a Pounds 595m hostile bid from
Redland, one of its bigger rivals, has promised to maintain the dividend for
1991 despite an estimated 62 per cent fall in pre-tax profit.
The expected profit figure of Pounds 32.5m, shown in Steetley's defence
document, sent out on Saturday, compares with Pounds 85.2m in 1990.
The 14p total dividend would not be covered by estimated earnings per share
of 12.9p. A plan to at least maintain the dividend again in 1992 was
defended as prudent by Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's managing director
yesterday, because of the group's strong cash flow.
Redland said the document focused on the past, and criticised Steetley for
taking Pounds 15.1m of extraordinary costs - half of them for the bid
defence. However, Mr David Donne, Steetley chairman, retorted: 'This is just
clutter in radar terms. We are talking about more fundamental issues, such
as weaving a focused business.'
The bid defence document stresses Steetley's growth record in the five years
to 1990, when operating profit went up by a compound 22 per cent a year. The
profit peak came in 1989 with Pounds 110.9 pre-tax.
In the same period, it says the predator's operating profit and earnings per
share grew more slowly, and its share price performed less well. Redland
countered that in the most recent five years, its pre-tax profit and
earnings did better.
Steetley accuses Redland of trying to grab valuable assets 'in the trough of
a recession for well below their proper worth'. The 85-for-100 all-share
offer values the target's shares at just over 372p, about 29 times the
estimated 1991 earnings but only 8.1 times the 1989 peak.
Among the long-term prospects highlighted in the defence document are the
market positions Steetley has built up in France and Spain. In 1990,
overseas activities contributed 52 per cent of operating profits, although a
hard continental winter, the Gulf war and recession in Canada took their
toll in the first half of 1991.
Steetley also stresses the advantages of the joint venture planned with
Tarmac before the bid jeopardised it. The venture aims to reduce
brick-making capacity and to make savings of up to Pounds 10m.
It would continue Steetley's efforts to cope with the falling UK brick
market, down from 4.5bn units in 1988 to about 3.1bn last year.
The defence document also goes on the offensive against the efficiency of
Redland's UK brick factories, saying that costs are greater and a high level
of stock is being carried. Redland replied that it made more profit per
brick.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Project that posed a real banking challenge
 -The complexities of financing the Lesotho Highlands water scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Maastricht summit was a picnic in comparison with getting this project
financed said Mr Perry Farmar, lighting his seventh cigarette in less than
an hour.
One had to wonder whether he was a smoker until his bank, Chartered WestLB,
took on the task almost four years ago of finance adviser to the Dollars
2.5bn (Pounds 1.37bn) Lesotho Highlands Water Project.
It is not the size of the project that makes it unique. Nor even that the
country paying for it is not the country responsible for the project.
But mix these complexities with the fact that the two countries - Lesotho
and South Africa - involved had to count among the world's worst investment
risks when the project was mooted five years ago, and you have a unique
financing challenge.
When financing was finally sealed late last year, the offshore funding alone
involved 25 different facilities co-ordinated by seven lead banks in six
currencies, five multilateral agencies and five government aid programmes.
At least five South African banks are providing the bulk of R4.4bn (Pounds
870m) of commercial loans and export credits.
'The complexity of the loans, by their terms, characteristics and
inter-relationships, has been a real banking challenge,' says Mr Farmar, the
director at Chartered WestLB who has been most closely involved in its role
as project finance adviser. And this is just Phase 1A of the project.
By the late 1970s South Africa was anxious at the prospect of running short
of water by the mid-1990s. The best long-term new source lay in the gushing
streams and rivers of Lesotho's Maluti highlands. That was when the World
Bank first began looking at the project, at the request of the Lesotho
government.
More than a decade later, the first stage of a project is taking shape which
will enable Lesotho to meet its own water needs, to become self sufficient
in electricity and to sell South Africa all the water it needs.
South Africa is footing most of the bill. In resource-poor Lesotho, the
water is called 'white gold'.
Phase 1A of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project involves two consortia
comprising 12 international companies.
The consortium led by Impreglio of Italy will build a 180-metre-high dam at
Katse, to be the highest dam in sub-Saharan Africa. The second consortium,
led by Spie Batignolles of France, will construct 70km of tunnels.
Long term plans, stretching to the year 2020, involve four dams.
The first task in mounting the project was to ensure Lesotho rather than
South Africa was responsible for the project. As one of the world's poorer
countries, its status in attracting concessional aid and financing terms was
essential. But Lesotho had none of the collateral needed to guarantee loans.
The problem for Chartered WestLB, then called Standard Chartered Merchant
Bank, was to persuade potential lenders to cough up long-term funds for a
project whose sole customer was to be South Africa, which not only had acute
debt problems of its own, but was also shunned for political reasons by the
international financial community.
The result: what is probably a unique arrangement where providers of funds
will be repaid not by the South African government, but by a London-based
trust.
Despite early headaches with the trust approach - not least among them that
trusts are almost wholly unknown among German and French banks - it offered
several advantages:
it provided a safe buffer for banks uncomfortable about a direct
relationship with South Africa.
it put all lenders on an identical footing in terms of rights to repayment.
it meant that if South Africa were to default on debt service payments, it
would automatically fall foul of all lenders - including the World Bank and
national export credit agencies.
A second original aspect of Chartered WestLB's approach was to require
contractors bidding for the work to come to the table with organised
financing, while at the same time holding a separate 'beauty contest' of
banks interested and able to lead the funding of the project.
These banks were then introduced, without commitment, to the bidding
consortia. This saved time, and gave appropriate emphasis to the importance
of the financing package in selecting the preferred bid.
It is probably no accident that the five banks who 'won' the beauty contest
became the lead banks for the project - Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais of France, Dresdner Bank and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau from
Germany, and Hill Samuel from the UK.
Alongside them were the multilateral agencies - principally the World Bank,
which lent Pounds 110m, and Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation,
which has loaned Pounds 20.7m.
In the hope of attracting the best possible financing package, Chartered
WestLB won agreement for a 'more the merrier' approach to initial bids. This
'post-qualification' of bidders, contrasting with the normal World Bank
requirement for pre-qualification, meant that 35 bidding groups initially
threw a bid into the ring. This was filtered to 12 groups, and finally to
five serious bidding consortia.
This process added to the time taken to appoint the winning contractors, but
created competitive pressures that probably succeeded in securing better
financing terms. A full percentage point was pared from rates by use of
'competitive pressures'. Commercial loan periods stretched to six years.
Another two months, and the whole project would have been in jeopardy.
Long-term OECD consensus interest rates of 8.3 per cent, agreed at the
outset because of Lesotho's status as one of the world's poorest countries,
would have had to have been revised upwards in line with prevailing
consensus lending rates if funding had not been agreed by December.
Even now, long-term rand financing has to be finalised. The small local
financing market was first wooed for R135m, with this bridging loan then
being replaced by a larger facility of R750m. The final facilities, in which
South African banks take the lead, should be signed this month. A total of
R4.4bn has been raised.
'It has been a huge undertaking, and taken longer than anything else we have
done,' recalls Mr Farmar. 'Our original contract was for 18 months, but even
after three weeks I knew it would take at least two and a half years. In the
end, it has taken three and a half.'
The reward was clearly a handsome fee. But on that Mr Farmar remains coy.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BAe acts to calm fears over Saudi project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE yesterday attempted to calm City fears that all was not
well with negotiations for the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence
project in Saudi Arabia on which the group's future heavily depends.
This phase is estimated to be worth up to Pounds 2.5bn to BAe and the
contract already provides substantial cash flow for the cash-hungry group.
City concern was reflected in a 10 per cent drop in BAe's share price last
week in the first two trading days of 1992 at a time when the market was
rising sharply.
BAe said of the Al Yamamah contract: 'Talks are going very well indeed and
we expect it will not be long before we hear about some future business.'
Fears were sparked because last October Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi
ambassador to the US, said firm orders for the Pounds 10bn contract were on
their way to British contractors and that the second phase of the Al Yamamah
contract would be agreed by the end of the year.
'The City has been taking far too literally Prince Bandar's comments about
signing by the end of 1991,' BAe said last night. 'Nobody is insisting on
exact timing with a contract as complicated as this one.'
The second phase follows the Al Yamamah contract signed between the Saudi
and British governments in 1973.
BAe's share price last week was also affected by comments reported in a
private note circulated by Nomura, the Japanese securities house, made by
Sir Peter Levene, former head of Britain's defence procurement and now in
charge of the London office of Wasserstein Perella, the US buy-out
specialists.
According to Nomura, Sir Peter delivered a 'pretty bleak analysis' of BAe's
prospects. Apart from discussing the Al Yamamah contract, Sir Peter also
referred to reports that the Germans would pull out of the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) programme. BAe last night pointed out that the Pounds 4.5bn
EFA programme was totally funded up to and including the production phase
and none of the partners could withdraw.
BAe, which is investing Pounds 1.8bn for a one-third share of the work,
pointed out that the Royal Air Force remained 'totally committed' to the EFA
project.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: An appropriate mix of exits and entries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EARLY new year international mergers and acquisitions included an
appropriate number of exits and entries, writes Brian Bollen.
UK retailing group Sears announced the disposal of its last remaining
interests in the US, the Miss Erika women's fashion wholesaling business.
Sears is pursuing a policy of concentrating on its core European retailing
interests. Barclays said it sold its Barclays Danmark financing and leasing
operation because it did not fit in with its core activities.
French electronic payments concern Sligos is belatedly entering the UK for
the first time with its purchase of 51 per cent of Nexus Payment Systems.
Swedish furniture retailer Ikea's first acquisition in the US is a
Californian home furnishings chain, Stor.
German electrical and electronics group Siemens beat off its rivals to take
control of a division of Skoda, Czechoslovakia's biggest engineering
company. Under the deal, Siemens will acquire 51 per cent of Skoda's
transport division.
Grand Metropolitan's decision to buy the 75 per cent of Italian drinks
company Cinzano it did not already own will give it more direct control over
the international marketing and distribution of its own brands.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Liffe lifts trading to new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES and options trading on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange (Liffe) reached a new high of 39m contracts in 1991, slightly ahead
of the Matif, its French rival.
In its ninth successive record year, Liffe recorded average daily volume of
more than 150,000 contracts, up 13 per cent on 1990. Volume in the most
actively traded contract, the German government bond (Bund) future, exceeded
10m, in spite of an aggressive counter-attack by the DTB, the German futures
exchange.
Liffe's Italian government bond (BTP) future was the most successful of the
six new contracts launched last year, trading nearly 500,000 contracts since
its launch in September, and beating off a rival contract from the Matif.
However, Liffe failed to make up crucial ground on the Matif's Ecu bond
future contract launched the previous year. Volume in Liffe's Ecu bond
contract, which began trading in March, dwindled to five contracts in
December. The rival contract on the Matif, while less than a raging success
with average daily volume of just over 2,000 contracts, has at least gained
a crucial foothold in a market which could soon be Europe's largest.
Once its merger with the London Traded Options Market is completed in a few
months, Liffe will have to concentrate its efforts on reviving London's
moribund stock option market.
So far, the exchange has been unable to attract enough potential market
makers in equity options to create a viable market-making system, and may be
forced to consider a move to screen-based trading of stock options.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Hauled down the merger aisle: The Krupp-Hoesch wedding is no
love match
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unsuspecting bride-to-be needed a sharp kick to get her through the
church door. She thought her friend had brought her somewhere quiet to talk
about their future. Marriage was not in the forefront of her mind. But the
groom had other ideas.
Thus, with an armlock on his intended, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of
Krupp, hauled Mr Kajo Neukirchen, head of Hoesch, down the aisle to endure
the formalities of what has become popularly known as 'the elephants'
wedding'.
Two of the oldest and proudest names in German steel and engineering are to
be joined, provided the high priests of competition policy in Brussels and
the Berlin cartel office give their blessing.
It is not a love match. 'Unfriendly,' said Mr Neukirchen, on receiving his
first forceful prompting - news out of the blue in October that Krupp had
scooped up 24.9 per cent of Hoesch stock.
But the negotiations on co-operation, which had been continuing on and off
since the 1970s, carried on uninterrupted. The balance, however, had
shifted, and most of the pressure to co-operate was on Hoesch. Apart from
its purchases, Krupp had won the support of banks and institutions holding
55 per cent of its target's stock.
Forceful rather than hostile, a takeover by arrangement - no formal bid has
been tabled - rather than a negotiated merger of convenience, Krupp's move
against its Dortmund neighbour differs from other recent intra-German
link-ups mainly in the measure of blatant coercion and apparent guile
brought to bear by Mr Cromme.
Covert stock purchases on such a scale are untypical of German mergers, and
Krupp's claim that it bought its initial stake because of 'rumours about a
takeover of Hoesch from abroad' smacks more of pandering to xenophobia than
a reflection of the realities of life in the incestuous German takeover
market.
A leading candidate, the rumour-mill said, was British Steel. Its chairman,
Sir Robert Scholey, pleads not guilty. Krupp's plan was 'a clever chess
move', he said in a recent German interview. But as for British Steel's
bidding for Hoesch: 'That was a rumour put about to hide the truth.'
Personalities have also played an unusually large role. Both company leaders
are relatively young men by German business standards, out to make their
mark in flagship companies.
Mr Cromme, 52, the former head of Krupp's steel business, who can be best
characterised as a tactician with teeth, has so far won the public relations
battle with carefully placed statements and interviews.
He flatly rejects suggestions that he is making an opportunistic bid, taking
advantage of newcomer Mr Neukirchen, 49, who had been at Hoesch for only
three months when Krupp pounced.
Mr Neukirchen, who made his reputation reshaping the Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz
engineering group, may understandably have wanted time to attempt the same
at Hoesch. The hurried publication in November of a wholesale restructuring
strategy entitled Hoesch 2000, outlined his ambitious proposals for the
development of nine strategic divisions.
But Mr Cromme, looking outwards to the threatening crisis in the
international steel industry, and the impending opening of the single
European market, feels more radical and urgent action is required. 'In the
long run, neither of us has a real chance of survival alone,' he said
recently.
He has otherwise adhered faithfully to the indigenous merger formula. He
has, for example, dutifully made his case in all the necessary political,
financial and social circles.
There are deep-seated traditional rivalries between companies and the
workforces who identify closely with them - Dortmund is Hoeschianer
territory and Essen belongs to the Kruppianers - and they are regarded with
the utmost respect. Local pride demands as much consideration in Germany as
shareholder sensitivities in Britain.
Politicians also often wield considerable power through state holdings in
regional banks and institutions which tend to have large stakes in local
companies.
Early in the tussle, Mr Johannes Rau, prime minister of North Rhine
Westphalia, home state to both companies, declared diplomatically that the
state government had no role to play in the decision.
He added, however, that nothing would happen to the 12 per cent of Hoesch
held by the local WestLB bank until an overall strategic plan for the new
'partnership' had been presented.
Even though he was clearly shaken by the initial Krupp stake, Mr Neukirchen
and his board carried forward the negotiations about the benefits and
possibility of achieving a 'merger", and there have been no more public
protests since then.
There was not a murmur when Krupp applied the stick again just before
Christmas with the announcement that it had taken its holding to 51 per cent
and claimed the deal would be completed by this summer.
Tossing a carrot to other shareholders, it added that talks had revealed
synergies from the combination of the groups which would show savings of
'several hundred million D-Marks'.
The full merger proposal, agreed between the two companies, was sent off to
the competition authorities in Brussels and Berlin over Christmas, with
Krupp as confident as ever that no objections were expected.
Details are also understood to have been made known to the WestLB bank and
others among the holders of the 45 per cent of stock not already owned by or
pledged to persuasive Krupp. The aim is to avoid any need for overt
aggression which might in the last resort have to be used to overturn
Hoesch's anti-takeover voting limits.
Clear-cut hostility still has no place in the German takeover code. To date,
Mr Cromme has demonstrated an ability to apply just the right amount of
persuasive force at the right time.
He has been careful not to break the mould of corporate courtship in
Germany, but has shown that a good shaking can work wonders.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Economics Notebook: News from the north lightens British
gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the celebrations, the hangover. As far as the British economy is
concerned this seasonal observation holds truer at the start of this year
than most.
Economic forecasters have been revising down their projections of growth in
1992 as fast as their computers will let them. The number of company
failures looks poised to rise further from last year's record total.
Employment prospects are bleak, especially in the service industries.
But look north, away from the recession-battered south east, and there are
signs of hope amid the gloom. The latest Institute of Directors' bi-monthly
poll of 300 business leaders found that company bosses in the north were
more optimistic about the economy than elsewhere in the UK. Directors in the
north and midlands were significantly more inclined to increase investment
and employment than those in the south.
A survey of 500 chief executives and finance directors of owner-managed
businesses conducted by MORI for business and financial advisers Ernst &amp;
Young found a similar trend. Only 54 per cent of respondents in London and
the south east were confident of an economic recovery this year, while in
other regions between 66 per cent and 70 per cent were optimistic.
A Huddersfield-based stock broker - BWD Rensburg - said last week that part
of the north stretching from the Lake District to North Yorkshire was
becoming one of England's most prosperous areas. Disposable incomes were
often as high as in the south while lower outgoings made people better off.
Such a claim would come as no surprise to the Reward Group, which compiles a
quality-of-life index for middle managers on a regional basis. This index,
based on the cost of living and average salaries, puts Scotland first among
the British regions last year, followed by the north and Yorkshire and
Humberside. The south east and greater London were at the bottom of the
table.
Economists increasingly believe the more distant regions of Britain will
fare better than the south east this year. Mr Simon Briscoe of Midland
Montagu sees a 'multi-track Britain' in 1992 with recovery beginning in
Scotland and the north of England only to reach the south east sometime
later.
Mr David Kern, National Westminster Bank's chief economist, expects the
south east's economic performance will lag behind the UK for the third year
running and fail to catch up with the national average in the five years to
1996.
Mr Kern believes gross domestic product in the south east (including
London), the south west and East Anglia declined between 2.8 per cent and
3.2 per cent in 1991 compared with his forecast of a 2.3 per cent fall in
economic output for the UK. The numbers out of work in the south have risen
so rapidly in the past 18 months the three southern regions now have more
jobless people than the north, north west, Yorkshire and Humberside and
Scotland combined, he points out.
Does this mean Britain's north-south divide will disappear?
Figures for 1990 issued last week by the Central Statistical Office suggest
it is too early to write off the south. GDP per head of Pounds 10,400 in
London was 27 per cent higher than the national average and still further
ahead of the north of England's Pounds 7,230, Wales's Pounds 6,960 and
per-capita GDP of Pounds 6,200 in Northern Ireland, the poorest UK region.
One problem is the sheer weight of Greater London and the south east in the
UK's centralised economy. Together, these areas accounted for 36 per cent of
GDP in 1990. So long as the economy in the south remains depressed, the
whole UK economy is likely to experience subdued growth.
However, Mr Simon Briscoe of Midland Montagu argues that the north and
Scotland should reap the benefits of often painful economic restructuring in
the 1980s. While the south east is experiencing post-boom retrenchment in
the financial services sector, with adverse effects for the housing market
and construction, more distant parts of Britain frequently have a varied
manufacturing base and growing service industries.
Regions outside the south east have been the greatest beneficiaries of
inward investment from Japan, the US and Germany. Public sector employment
contributes more to GDP in the regions and so acts as a cushion against
recession.
On the other hand, NatWest's Mr David Kern sees some element of the
traditional north-south divide remaining a feature of the UK economy over
the next five years in spite of a reduced gap in regional growth rates
compared with the 1980s.
He believes the northern regions should sustain an improvement in confidence
apparent in recent years and so attract successful businesses. However, he
expects East Anglia, the south west and the central regions of the east and
west Midlands and Wales will be the areas of strongest growth in the next
few years as businesses relocate from the congested south east.
In spite of the generally improved outlook for Britain's regions, a new
discussion paper* from the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge
University argues that there is 'a pressing need for a coherent and
well-resourced regional policy' in the UK.
Its authors, Mr Ron Martin and Mr Peter Tyler, say government policies since
1979 towards the UK's depressed regions have not cured their fundamental
problem of a weak industrial structure.
'There is little evidence that Thatcherism unleashed and fostered an
enterprise revolution in the depressed regions,' they say. Instead, new and
growing sectors continued to concentrate in the south east throughout the
1980s.
Messrs Martin and Tyler say the government should spend more on Britain's
regions because they are likely to face increased competitive pressures as
Europe integrates.
It is unlikely theirs will be the last such call. By agreeing at Maastricht
that 'the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of
development of the various regions and the backwardness of the
least-favoured regions', EC leaders have ensured that pressures will grow
for more active regional policies throughout the community.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Port sell-off plan faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's port privatisation programme will face a crucial test this
week when the management team which failed in its bid to buy the Tees and
Hartlepool port challenges the decision.
Mr John Hackney, who led the management-employee team, is seeking an urgent
meeting with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, in a last-ditch
attempt to persuade him to reverse the decision.
If he does not, Mr Hackney said his team would seek a judicial review of the
decision taken by the Tees and Hartlepool Port Authority. Mr Rifkind has to
approve the authority's decision.
Mr Hackney said: 'We have taken legal advice and the view is that there are
certainly grounds for a judicial review.'
The management's challenge to the decision to sell the port to a consortium
led by Powell Duffryn, the engineering group, will be closely watched by
executives at other ports planning privatisation.
Three other ports - Clyde, Medway and Tilbury - have put themselves up for
sale under the 1991 Ports Act which allows the privatisation of the 114
trust ports. The challenge to the outcome of the Tees and Hartlepool sale
comes at a critical time for the three other privatisations. Potential
buyers have until the end of this week to indicate their interest in the
Clyde port. The winner of the Medway bid is expected to be announced in
early February, while the successful bidder for Tilbury is due to be decided
by late next month.
The government has already responded to criticism of the Tees and Hartlepool
decision by allowing Forth Port Authority to consider a stock market
flotation rather than a sale through competitive tendering.
The Tees and Hartlepool sale was conducted by the port authority, subject to
government approval. The authority announced just before Christmas that
Teesside Holdings, a consortium made up of Powell Duffryn, the venture
capital concern 3i and Humberside Holdings, a private company, had won with
a bid of Pounds 180m.
There were three unsuccessful bidders: Maritime Transport Services with a
Pounds 210m offer; Ocean Group with Pounds 155m; and the management-employee
team with Pounds 148m.
Mr Rifkind has said he is 'minded' to accept the authority's recommendation
and is expected to give his verdict on January 14.
Mr Hackney, chief executive of the port authority, said yesterday that the
authority contravened the sale procedure agreed with the Department of
Transport. Sales objectives outlined in the initial bid documents were not
applied at the final bid, he said. In particular, it was a stated objective
that 'all or a substantial proportion' of the privatised company should be
held by employees and management.
'We took this at face value and it reduced the size of our bid because we
had to use mainly loan finance rather than equity,' Mr Hackney said.
He said Teesside Holdings would allocate only 5 per cent to employees and
management. 'There is no way this can be described as substantial.'

FT  06 JAN 92 / Panic, and other kinds of policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the long run up to the 1967 devaluation of sterling, Mr Harold Wilson was
fond of saying that he was not going to take the easy way out. In the end,
he provoked The Economist into asking the obvious question: If there is an
easy way out, why on earth not take it?
He did, of course (though it was not, in fact, easy). So when present-day
leaders announce that they are not going to adopt panic policies -
presumably to distinguish themselves from politicians who announce that they
are going to adopt panic policies - wise men check over their survival kits.
If ministers are panicking, why shouldn't they?
The wrong answer is to recite cliches about the darkest hours coming just
before the dawn. The history of credit bubbles shows that once confidence
has vanished, it takes some years to recover. Even in the 1970s, when rapid
inflation devalued debt at such a rate that property prices could fall by
more than a third in real terms without triggering more than a handful of
defaults, lenders remained cautious for about a decade.
This time round, the banks' losses are still growing, as each round of
failures drags more companies down with unpaid bills; we don't yet know when
the darkest hour will come. The course was chosen when the government
decided to mount a fierce squeeze against inflation just as the bubble
burst, thus taking the adjustment through bankruptcies rather than the
general default which follows when debts are devalued. Such a policy could
be seen as bold, or at worst foolhardy, if ministers were frank about its
meaning. When they waffle of green shoots, it just looks stupid.
As for the depression which results from an over-valued currency, there is
no time limit at all. It is, as we will be reminded ad nauseam, 500 years
since Columbus landed in the New World. The resultant influx of gold and
silver into Spain dealt that economy a blow from which it is only now
recovering, for men will never work and produce when there is an idle
alternative. British uncompetitiveness first appeared troubling more than a
century ago, when earnings from overseas investment provided about a 10th of
our consumption. Two world wars dissipated that capital, but we still suffer
from old bad habits.
Adjustment to the disciplines of the ERM is meant to complete that process,
and should not take quite so long, but it is not easy. That is shown by the
long slowdown in France, the current near-panic in Italy (long the most
dynamic of the European economies), and the possibly terminal decline of the
Irish Republic, where the brightest and best are simply emigrating. Indeed,
such an adjustment is like sports training: strengthening if it is
manageable, but possibly fatal if you overdo it.
So it is reasonable to ask whether the regime the UK has adopted is
manageable or dangerously debilitating. The panic lies in refusing to face
such an uncomfortable issue at all. The one country which seems to recognise
this is the one for which the question is academic: Germany. It is no secret
that the Germans regard some partner currencies as dangerously over-valued.
The Bundesbank is currently the victim of much spiteful comment from
countries which find its current credit policy uncomfortable; but its
president, Dr Karl Schlesinger, in a little-reported new year interview,
defended his stance as necessary for Germany and pointedly remarked: 'The
ERM is not a fixed exchange rate system.' In other words, the UK is victim
not of German choices, but of its own.
It would be reassuring to be able to forecast with confidence, as an
increasing number in the City do, that this is just a burst of pre-election
folly, and that an ERM realignment will quickly follow the British and
Italian elections. Unhappily, it can't be taken for granted. Neither
election looks likely to produce a strong, self-confident government; and
for weak politicians there is a tempting populist alternative.
Nobody is openly talking protectionism yet, but the smell is in the air.
President Bush, after suffering Australian protests about US farm subsidies,
is arriving in Tokyo ready for a trade confrontation. He is soft-pedalling
his proposed North American Free Trade Area - his most solid real
achievement - in face of protests about exporting American jobs to Mexico.
The French are blocking the Gatt agreement apparently to pacify their
farmers; but if French car workers soon protest at cheap Fiats and
Volkswagens from Czechoslovakia and Poland, they will no doubt get a
sympathetic hearing too.
Allowing this trend to develop, however stealthily, would be a real panic
measure. It would mean that the country is running away from problems it
does know how to solve - currency misalignments, and inadequate investment
demand - to court others that might have no peaceful solution at all. The
television news editors here show more sense than the leaders. They fill
screens with reports from the ex-communist economies at a time when hardly
any politicians have anything serious to say.
Yet this is by far the most important policy challenge for the next decade
and more. It demands that not only some aid in filling food shelves is
provided now, but above all a future opportunity for these economies to earn
their living. If aid is provided, they could in due course emulate the
miracles we have seen in the war-devastated economies of Europe and Japan.
If they are blocked, a tidal wave of refugees looks the likeliest result;
but, given that these are militarised and nuclear-armed countries, it is by
no means the worst that can be imagined.
If this analysis is right, the biggest employment problem of 1992 is an
unfilled vacancy: a leader to turn our attention from our domestic
discomforts to the huge problems and opportunities of a bigger world.
Chancellor Kohl has made some of the right noises; President Mitterrand
could do with a world role; a re-elected President Bush might get the right
advice from ex-President Nixon.
Major? Kinnock? It is surely more realistic to adopt the Micawber pose, and
hope that somebody turns up.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Too much of the debate on non-executive directors (NEDs) and their role
in helping Great Britain plc improve its performance is centred on the top
500-1,000 companies.
The well known, and usually demanding, candidates for NEDs at this level can
have their effectiveness reduced by being starved of or smothered with paper
and having their access to internal or external sources of alternative views
restricted, but they are clearly using their undoubted clout with increasing
authority.
The governance problem is at the next level, in the 10,000 private and
public companies, employing 200 to 2,000 staff or more, that have external
shareholders - whether institutional, family, ex-directors or others - and a
narrow corporate culture.
They probably have one or even two NEDs (excluding ex-chairmen and family
trustees) on their boards, but such directors are unlikely to have the
breadth of experience to handle all the accounting, finance, remuneration
and industry technical/competitive issues the boards need to discuss.
In the absence of independent advice on issues that trouble them, they will
feel it necessary, for reasons of solidarity, to go along with the
management view. This is the key problem in the NED approach to good
corporate governance.
It is no good trying to cajole boards into having more or more powerful NEDs
than they want, but boards are increasingly willing to allow NEDs to call on
independent personal advisers on issues of strategy, finance and
remuneration. It is by increasing access to such information that
non-executive directors will be effective, not just as watch dogs, but as
champions of the alternative policies that boards need to consider.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Forecast 1992: Watershed ahead - A turnaround for east
Europe's output is near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN FLEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, 1991 saw expectations lowered and
hopes deferred. But 1992 has the potential to rekindle both in these three
countries - the fastest reforming ones of eastern Europe - and, through
their example, in those that follow them. What is needed is internal and
external political stability: stable government in Poland; harmonious
relations between Czechs and Slovaks; and co-operation within the new
Commonwealth of Independent States, formerly the Soviet Union.
The European Community is playing a modestly supportive role. Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia signed association agreements with the EC in
December. The agreements disappoint earlier hopes of rapid movement to free
access and full membership. But they do represent significant advances
towards relaxing constraints on sensitive imports of agricultural products,
textiles, steel and chemicals. They also reiterate the goal of membership.
Developments to their south and east underline the importance of western
markets to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Markets in Yugoslavia,
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania are diminishing or dislocated. Meanwhile, the
problems of smoothing trade between the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States must place a big question mark over sales in that region
for a while.
Domestic markets in reforming countries will continue to be limited by the
need to balance budgets and contain inflation. In both these respects,
however, Czechoslovakia is living up to its long-established reputation for
stability. Yet even its official forecast for 1992 does not predict the the
zero inflation achieved for several months in 1991.
Hungary's inflation rate has increased to nearly 40 per cent, partly because
the needs of debt service (and its low foreign exchange reserves) made a
competitive exchange rate take priority over exchange rate stabilisation as
a counter-inflationary anchor. A tougher policy is probable in 1992, so that
inflation should fall.
Meanwhile, the Polish budget has pursued an erratic path, influenced by
fiscal retrenchment and swings in the profitability of state-owned
enterprises. With output still falling, immediate prospects are disturbing;
heightened inflation is a real possibility.
All these countries have adopted a crawling adjustment of the exchange rate
against an explicit basket of hard currencies. This policy should allow
reconciliation of positive real domestic interest rates and lower nominal
hard currency interest rates, with more realistic exchange rate
expectations.
A crawling exchange rate is more credible and reassuring to markets than
either a vague commitment to hold a particular rate for an uncertain period,
or no more than a partial accommodation of differential cost movements. The
latter would make the recovery of lost competitiveness depend on getting
inflation below that in the EC and North America. The implausibility of this
achievement adds to the discouragement attendant on recent trends in output
 -falling at about 10 per cent a year.
These recessionary forces explain rising unemployment, now beginning to
exceed 10 per cent in the reforming countries. They also complicate both
privatisation, as more enterprises become unprofitable and difficult to
sell, and restructuring, which typically involves labour shedding - a
politically fraught development when unemployment is high.
Typically, governments have recognised that restructuring cannot be left
entirely to new owners after privatisation, either because privatisation is
going to be delayed, or because new owners face problems in controlling
managements historically beholden to their employees. The exception is
Czechoslovakia, which has not been discouraged from issuing to the people
vouchers which can be exchanged for shares in state enterprises.
Poland has substantially reduced the list of enterprises to be privatised
through share distributions to the population. It also continues to see a
role for special intermediaries. These intermediaries are expected to
reconcile the need to concentrate the functions of ownership with the very
wide ownership implied, at least initially, by mass distribution.
Hungary, by contrast, continues to rely on conventional channels for its
more gradual privatisation, which has been made easier by steps taken over
the previous two decades to introduce market forces and market mechanisms.
Hungary has also benefited from more developed financial markets. Its long
experience with market mechanisms is reflected in Hungary's success in
attracting about a half of all the foreign direct investment in 1991.
A total of about Dollars 3bn in such investment is modest in relation to the
area's needs, but uncertainty about property rights, about the solvency of
trading partners, about economic institutions and even about political
stability, all act to reduce the inflow.
The role of the capital market in the finance of the area's industry remains
unclear. In due course, stock markets will allow active trading in shares of
mass-privatised enterprises. But most commentators also see merit in active
finance by banks, which might also take small equity stakes, on the German
or Japanese model. Even though these bank share holdings would not be large
enough for control, banks could play a role in guiding and monitoring
management.
With output having fallen by about 20 per cent over two years, the turning
point is seen to be near by several international agencies - most recently
by the OECD, which places it within the next two years. But since
restructuring is likely to stimulate a growth of productivity, unemployment
will go on rising. This will feed pressures for migration. Since full EC
membership would entail freedom of movement, rising unemployment might well
defer that prospect.
In the meantime, the greater the access to its markets the west allows, the
greater the benefits to both parties. If the west wishes to offer assistance
to obsolescent western industries that suffer from eastern competition it
should do so in forms, like retraining, that do not frustrate the trade or
exhaust its benefits. Eastern countries should be encouraged to liberalise
imports rapidly if they can devise and finance means, such as retraining and
temporary employment subsidies, to assist their industrial adjustment.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: A pawn in a European soviet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL LEES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US/UK special relationship
in the political/military sphere could have led on to fame and fortune. In
getting on the conveyor belt to irreversible European union in Maastricht,
we have cut that link. Germany's unilateral recognition of Croatia and the
virtual certainty that chancellor Kohl's clutch of European ducklings,
including the ugly British, will follow, involves betrayal of the Serbian
people. Worse, it is proof that John Major has reduced us to a pawn in a
European soviet which will be exploited by the Germans to expand in the
east, riding rough-shod over its partners' interests. We could have stated
any terms we wanted. Instead we fudged and are now a third-rate power.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Institutional shareholder takes issue with Fisons'
investor relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RC JOHNSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Fisons' recent revelations about its difficulties in complying with the
new US Food and Drug Administration manufacturing requirements seems to
demonstrate once again the board's failure to manage effectively both its
business and its investor relations.
The City's reaction to the bombshells has been clearly reflected in the
dramatic fall in share price.
As an institutional shareholder in Fisons, my concern at the mishandling of
the group's corporate relations is not just confined to the failures of the
last few weeks. For some considerable time I have been anxious over Fison's
attitude towards peat extraction from sites of scientific interest and have
been involved in lengthy and protracted correspondence with the company over
the issue.
Despite leading retailers such as Do-It-All, Texas Homecare, B &amp; Q, and
Sainsbury's Homebase agreeing not to sell products dug from environmentally
sensitive sites, the company's director of corporate affairs stated that
relations between Fisons and its big customers were an operational matter
and not a matter for comment to shareholders.
Earlier in the year, you will recall, Fisons had been represented on the
Confederation of British Industry working party looking at communications
with small shareholders.
Presumably, the board of Fisons considers that its appalling track record
over Opticrom and Imferon and the FDA is an operational matter as well and,
therefore, not of importance to shareholders either.
One leading stockbroker said recently that the company is clearly like a
patient on a stretcher at the moment. I prefer to think of it as a board
whose members are sinking slowly up to their necks in a deep peat bog.
Whether they can dig themselves out of the mire in time for the annual
general meeting is another matter and one that I would urge every single
shareholder in Fisons to give very serious thought to.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Letter: Lebanon defends efforts to regulate car imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAHMOUD HAMMOUD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was deeply disturbing to those interested in the reconstruction of
the Lebanon to learn from your article ('Chariots of Tyre', December 13)
that the Lebanon is a haven for stolen cars.
That the article describes the retrieval of stolen goods from the Lebanon as
'a knottier problem than releasing hostages from Lebanon' denotes an
appalling lack of understanding of all successful measures taken by the
Lebanese authorities to bring the country - except for the area occupied by
Israel - under the rule of law and order.
We were surprised that the writer misunderstood the laws governing car
imports to the Lebanon. This is a highly regulated matter. A car cannot be
imported into the Lebanon unless it is accompanied by documents including a
registration certificate or an export invoice from the country where it was
bought, or a certified bill of sale, and all of the legal shipping
documents.
Where does responsibility for the stolen goods lie in the first place? Is it
in the country of original theft, or in the country receiving the stolen
vehicles?
If the police computers referred to in your article can trace stolen cars
being re-imported to the country of original theft, why can't they trace
vehicles being exported?
Lebanon is a party to the Interpol agreement. If there is any proof of a
stolen car being shipped to the Lebanon, the original owner can claim
through appropriate police channels - in which case the Lebanese authorities
would do their utmost to retrieve the vehicle, no matter how or where it had
entered the country.

FT  06 JAN 92 / How to learn from the debt delusion: Martin Wolf argues that
government attempts to avoid a depression must not lead to another damaging
bout of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public psychology of going into debt for gain passes through several . .
. phases: (a) the lure of big prospective dividends or gains in income in
the remote future; (b) the hope of selling at a profit, and realising a
capital gain in the immediate future; (c) the vogue of restless promotions .
. . ; (d) the development of downright fraud.
Ending with the BCCI, Maxwell and Polly Peck frauds, the boom of the 1980s
has lovingly retraced the course mapped out by the celebrated American
economist, Irving Fisher, in an article occasioned by the great depression.
1
If the indebtedness of the 1980s had such similarities with that of the
1920s, must the 1990s be like the 1930s? Are the sluggishness of the
American economy and last month's cut in the Discount Rate, to just 3.5 per
cent, a harbinger of a new great depression? Is the tight-money European
block centred on Germany an echo of the gold-block of the 1930s? Would the
collapse of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations inflict the
same damage as the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930?
The answer should be no. In the path from debt-deflation (a downturn in
spending caused by the servicing of high levels of debt) to depression one
essential step - a general price collapse - should now be absent. Price
deflation can occur - indeed, is occurring - in some markets, such as those
for property. But declines in one market, however important, should not
precipitate a general depression, providing governments do not permit any
consequent collapse of the financial system, as happened in the 1930s.
The immediate danger is not a general depression. It is, if anything, its
opposite: that attempts to avoid a depression, shown already in the
accelerating growth of narrow money in the US and Japan, will rekindle
inflation.
The facts of rising overall indebtedness in the 1980s, notably in the US,
are clear. As is shown in the chart, the ratio of debt to gross national
product in the US rose between 1980 and 1990 at a rate not seen since the
early 1930s, to reach levels also not seen since that unhappy time.
In the US indebtedness increased within all the main sectors of the economy:
government, corporate and household. In the UK, by contrast, it was the
household sector whose indebtedness increased most sharply (as is also shown
in the chart). Similar increases in household indebtedness have occurred in
Japan, but not in those of other members of the group of seven industrial
countries, according to the the OECD Economic Outlook published last month.
The public sectors of both Japan and the UK enjoy strong financial
positions. In addition, in neither case is the corporate sector as a whole
in serious difficulty.
Yet where debt is accumulated may matter less than its overall level. The
fundamental feature of these three economies has been excess growth of
credit in relation to GNP. Between 1982 and 1988, for example, real
non-financial debt (nominal debt, adjusted by the consumer price index) grew
by 57.3 per cent in real terms in the US, while GNP grew by 26.9 per cent;
for Japan real domestic credit rose by 55.9 per cent, while GNP rose by 28.3
per cent; for the UK, real bank and building society lending rose by 117.4
per cent, while GNP rose by no more than 24.1 per cent.
Why should such huge increases in indebtedness matter? After all, every
debtor has a corresponding creditor. The reason is that both creditors and
debtors will feel poorer than they expected if their borrowing and lending
turns out to be based on unrealistically optimistic assumptions.
Suppose that, at a time of optimism like the late-1980s, someone borrowed
Pounds 100,000 at a nominal rate of interest of 10 per cent in the
conviction that the asset he intended to purchase would increase in value by
20 per cent. If the calculation were correct, the asset could be sold (or
refinanced) a year hence for Pounds 120,000, so paying the interest of
Pounds 10,000 and clearing a profit of the same amount. If no gain were to
occur, however, the asset could be sold for only Pounds 100,000. The debtor
must pay the interest from elsewhere and would then be forced at best to
retrenchment and at worst into bankruptcy. Meanwhile if creditors' belief in
the solvency of their debtors were to be ill-founded, their wealth would be
less secure than supposed. They would feel obliged to reduce their spending.
That the net asset position of the household sectors of the US, UK and Japan
did not deteriorate in the 1980s provides little comfort, the mistake being
that of false aggregation. If many debtors are in serious trouble and much
debt is insecure as a result, the apparently comfortable position of many
others is irrelevant. A net contraction in spending will ensue.
Fisher himself detailed nine stages on the path to depression:
debt liquidation, leading to distress selling;
contraction of deposit currency;
a fall in the level of prices;
a still greater fall in the net worth of business;
a like fall in profits;
a reduction in output, in trade, and in employment of labour;
pessimism and loss of confidence;
hoarding and slowing down still more of the velocity of circulation;
a fall in the nominal, or money, rates and a rise in the real, or commodity,
rates of interest.
An essential element in Fisher's story is the fall in prices. 'It is always
economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression,' he said,
'simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which
outstanding debts were contracted . . . and then maintaining that level
unchanged'. Since all modern economies possess central banks determined to
secure positive commodity inflation, a general depression would seem to be
ruled out.
Is this view correct? That depends on why the general fall in prices
matters. Falling prices in the 1930s reflected the banking collapses in the
US and the resulting decline in the money supply, which shrank by a third. 2
But the falling price level also had a causal role, because it raised the
real rate of interest. The real rate of interest (the nominal rate adjusted
for price inflation) plays a fundamental role in both the build-up and
subsequent liquidation of debt, as has been stressed by Tim Congdon, now at
Gerrard and National. 3
In 1931, for example, the average treasury bill rate in the UK was 3.6 per
cent; in the US the corresponding rate was 1.4 per cent. These may appear to
be comfortably low rates of interest. But, adjusted for the falling overall
price level, real rates of interest were over 10 per cent in both countries.
In these circumstances, debtors found themselves getting deeper into debt
however hard they tried to pay off their debts.
The nominal rate of interest on money can never be below zero (since there
is always the alternative of cash). Thus, a falling price level guarantees
positive real rates of interest, and the more rapidly the price level falls,
the higher will be the real rate of interest.
The effect on the real rate of interest is the reason why Fisher was right
to stress the causal role of falling prices in the debt-deflation of the
1930s. But this suggests that problems can arise, even though nominal prices
are not falling, if real rates of interest are high (as was true throughout
the 1980s and early 1990s). High nominal rates of interest tend to lower the
amount of debt in an economy, because of the high carrying costs they
impose. But, for debtors, the combination of high nominal interest rates
with high real rates of interest may be worst of all, as borrowers
discovered in many Latin American countries in the 1980s.
The real rate of interest then is the key. Here the current picture is good
only in part. Defined in relation to changes in the general price level,
real rates of interest no longer look high in the US, where they have been
reduced to little more than 1 per cent. In Europe, by contrast, short-term
real rates of interest - not far from 7 per cent in France, Italy and the UK
 -look cripplingly high for this stage of the cycle. Japanese real rates
fall between those of the US and Europe, but have been moving towards the
American end of the spectrum.
Unfortunately, even this picture may flatter to deceive. Recent increases in
indebtedness have largely been the counterpart of borrowing to purchase
assets whose prices were expected to rise at least as fast as the rate of
interest.
For much of the 1980s, real rates of interest for the purchase of many
assets were negative, even though real rates of interest defined in relation
to consumer prices were positive (see chart). No wonder borrowing seemed a
good idea. But with falling nominal asset prices, the relevant real rates of
interest have become exceptionally high. Those who borrowed to acquire
property, for example, are running to stand still.
The conclusion seems to be that governments might be forced to stabilise not
prices in general, but asset prices in particular. The conclusion is
unwarranted, partly because there is a limit to how far asset prices can
fall if commodity prices are stabilised. But the main reason is that the
debt purge, however painful, is needed.
The question, after all, is why such a huge run-up in private debt occurred
during a decade when real rates of interest appeared to be highly positive.
The short answer is that opportunities appeared exceptional, for three
reasons:
the buoyancy of economic activity;
the low initial level of asset prices, a result of the stagflation of the
1970s;
the tendency to assume that low nominal rate of interest were an opportunity
to borrow assets whose prices would then rise faster than prices in general.
The legacy of the 1980s is a delicate balancing act for governments in the
1990s. They must prevent the debt-deflation from inflicting irreparable
damage on the financial system, so causing a true depression. For that
purpose they will need to provide liquidity. They may even find themselves
assuming parts of the private indebtedness, so turning the immediate problem
of private debt into an aggravation of the long-term difficulties over
public debt (as is already happening in the case of the savings and loans
institutions in the US).
At the same time, they must avoid validating the most perverse legacy of the
1960s and 1970s, the assumption that one can never be too indebted. For just
as the general assumption that prices would tend to be stable underpinned
the stable growth of the 1950s and 1960s; so the assumption that inflation
is always around the corner has increased economic instability in the 1970s
and 1980s.
The real rates of interest of the 1980s were too high for comfort and have
now to be lowered by changes in monetary and, still more, fiscal policies.
But the lesson they are belatedly teaching must not be wasted. A stable
market economy is incompatible with the belief that one can never borrow too
much. That lesson is being relearned. Perhaps it will endure another 60
years.

<DATELINE>
   THE STRENGTHS and weaknesses of the UK's education system
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the politicians who seek to influence it - were well illustrated in two
weekend news stories.
On Friday, government and opposition vied to claim authorship of plans to
improve reading standards based on schemes which have achieved remarkable
results in New Zealand. The determination of both parties to give priority
to reading and increase funds for raising standards is a welcome sign of the
new consensus emerging across the party divide.
That consensus covers much of the education field. Targets, standards and
regular pupil testing are here to stay. There is agreement on the need to
pay teachers adequately, the importance of developing an effective
'vocational' route through school and college, and the urgency of improving
staying-on rates at 16 and at 18. After 20 years of chopping and changing,
much of it dogma-driven, teachers and parents might feel that they can look
forward to greater consistency of approach, whichever party is in
government.
Any such belief must have been rudely shattered on Saturday, when Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the education secretary, announced his proposals for an upheaval in
the teacher training system. He wants to shift the burden for training
teachers from the colleges to the schools - already struggling to digest a
series of changes from the national curriculum and testing to the local
management of their budgets. There is certainly no consensus for these
proposals, which have been roundly attacked by the opposition and appear to
enjoy only qualified support from the inspectorate.
Failure to consult
Other recent pronouncements show a similar failure to consult widely or
consider expert opinion.
In November 1980, Mr Clarke introduced a bill to restore collective
bargaining to teachers. Without public notice or consultation, it was
withdrawn in April. A substitute bill was rushed through to set up a pay
review body.
In May, it was announced (again without consultation) that further education
colleges were to be divorced from local education authorities. The main aim,
it seemed, was to reduce council spending rather than improve further
education.
In the summer, Mr Clarke set up a two-month inquiry into the future of Her
Majesty's Inspectorate. He refused to publish its report, and is
implementing with extraordinary haste a scheme for privatising the
inspection of schools which reportedly differs significantly from that
recommended by his own inquiry.
Last month he set up an inquiry into under-11 teaching - and gave it just
two months to turn the primary school world upside down.
Panicky electioneering
This all reeks of panicky electioneering. It insults the professionalism of
the teachers without whose co-operation no education reforms can succeed.
And - in the long run, perhaps most damaging of all - it creates conflict
and dissension where, with a calmer and more consensual approach, it could
be minimised.
The priority now is to stop making endless policy on the hoof, and find a
way of establishing a firm consensus which can take the UK into the 21st
century. The future shape of UK's education provision needs to be examined,
fully and calmly, taking evidence from all in the field, and looking abroad
in the process.
Two of the broad issues which need to be addressed are these: to what extent
should the education system be planned and run by the state? And how should
it be financed?
The safeguarding of basic educational standards and opportunities must, of
course, be a state responsibility. But it is not coincidental that the most
successful parts of the system are those in which Whitehall and Westminster
have interfered least - the universities, the independent schools and local
authority nursery schools. The first two also happen to be the best
resourced - which ought to lead to some searching questions beyond the
election.
This is the first in a series on British education policy

FT  06 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Aid and reform in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When General Ibrahim Babangida called for debt relief last week, he was
throwing down the gauntlet. Help me, or take responsibility for Nigeria's
recovery programme buckling under the weight of service payments on its
Dollars 34bn external debt, his budget address implied. Nigeria's partners
should take up the challenge, but not in the way Mr Babangida may expect.
The president made an important point: running a large current account
surplus in order to service external debt is incompatible with economic
recovery. Generous concessional treatment of debt-burdened African economies
is essential if the continent's development crisis is to end.
But debt write-offs and other assistance should be linked to good
government, a policy put to such good effect in Kenya recently. Like
President Daniel arap Moi, General Babangida must first set his house in
order before qualifying for help: this means curbing corruption, ending
human rights abuses and improving Nigeria's faltering economic management.
Mr Babangida deserved approval for the reform programme introduced in 1986,
a year after the coup that brought him to power. Measures which include
trade liberalisation, a more realistic exchange rate, a privatisation plan
that affects nearly 100 companies, and agricultural reforms, have improved
Nigeria's economic prospects.
Erratic process
But it has been an erratic process, delayed by weak management, poor
implementation, uncertain political will and endemic corruption. Last year
progress again stalled. An over-expansionary fiscal policy, heavy reliance
on domestic bank borrowing, a growing gap between the official and parallel
exchange rates, saw Nigeria fail a mid-term review of a 15-month
International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement.
Meanwhile there remain unanswered questions about the size and allocation of
Nigeria's oil earnings, in particular the windfall from the price surge
during the Gulf war. Manifestly uneconomic projects have been pursued, such
as the disastrous Ajaokuta steel plant. Lavish spending on the new federal
capital, Abuja, is at odds with economic realities.
Nor is all well on the political front. President Babangida has won praise
for his commitment to a phased return to civilian rule, made well before the
new winds of democratic change swept across Africa. But the transition
process, due to conclude with presidential elections by the end of this
year, is deeply flawed.
Queuing system
The government banned all independent parties and created two of its own.
Both had their manifestos written by government officials. Voting takes
place under the queuing system - dropped by Kenya in response to domestic
and international criticism - which entails a public count of voters lined
up according to their choice of candidate. Thousands of would-be candidates
were banned from all but the last stages of the transition because of their
association with past administrations.
Nigeria's record on a broader human rights front is arguably worse than
Kenya's. Offences range from the razing of a Lagos slum in 1990 which left
thousands of families homeless, to preventing a civil rights lawyer from
attending last October's Commonwealth conference in Harare. Military decrees
override the authority of the courts. Students have been arrested and
detained without charge, trade unions have been harassed, a leading
newspaper closed down for ten days, and journalists arrested.
Throughout this period, there has been barely a squeak of protest from
Nigeria's main partners. The World Bank, Britain and the United States, so
forthright in their criticism of Kenya, have been curiously restrained when
it comes to Nigeria. Yet their influence is considerable. The World Bank and
its affiliates have committed more than Dollars 6bn to Nigeria. Britain is
supporting Nigeria's request for help under the Trinidad terms, which offer
big write-offs of official debt. Mr Babangida should be told that sauce for
the Kenyan goose is also sauce for the Nigerian gander.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why must the next UK general election be held on a Thursday? An election can
in law take place on any weekday. In 1924, for instance, the voters of
Britain went to the polls on a Wednesday, and in 1931 the date was a
Tuesday. But since 1935, general elections have always been held on a
Thursday.
According to David Butler, the well-known psephologist, Thursday is
generally considered to be the least inconvenient day of the week for the
purpose of an election. However, others have suggested that it may have
something to do with the fact that it is the day before pay-day, and in
olden times the lower orders would not have any money to spend on rival
distractions to the polling booth.
Whatever the reason, the next general election may well be the last to be
held on a Thursday. The vast majority of Britain's EC partners hold theirs
on a Sunday and no doubt Brussels will soon be arguing for a common
electoral policy requiring Britain to hold elections at weekends.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the reasons governors of the Bank of England are so reluctant to be
interviewed on TV is an understandable fear that any incautious comment on
their part could return to haunt them.
Hence the interest in Robin Leigh-Pemberton's remarks about sterling on
Channel 4 last week. 'There seems immediately no need to raise rates, and I
hope in the medium term there won't be either.'
The form of words bore an uncanny resemblance to a statement by one of the
governor's more distinguished predecessors, Montagu Norman: 'We may well be
thankful to have escaped war, certainly for a short, and, I hope, for a long
period.'
The occasion: a letter to Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank,
shortly after the signing of the Munich agreement in September 1938.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Friends Provident, Britain's third biggest mutually-owned life office,
was quoted on the stock market it would not survive three months, says its
deputy managing director, 56-year-old Michael Doerr. There are plenty of
continental and US predators who would be prepared to gobble up a quality
company like his, for Pounds 1.5bn plus, if they had the chance.
So does this mean that the 160-year-old insurer is going to remain forever
protected by its cosy mutual status? 'We will not demutualise for the sake
of demutualising' says Doerr, but then coyly refuses to dismiss the
possibility out of hand. It could happen, for example, if Friends Provident
were to become part of a bigger financial services grouping.
Doerr, who takes over from Fred Cotton as chief executive in May, is an
actuary, and not normally in the speculating business. For the moment he and
Cotton are pinning their faith on developing an alliance with continental
insurance partners, a strategy which is already being copied by Britain's
Royal Insurance, Germany's AMB and Italy's La Fondiaria.
However, if the history of such alliances in European banking - EBIC,
Abecor, SFE, Inter-Alpha et al - is any guide, then their effectiveness is
limited. Even Friends Provident may find that in the long run it needs
something more permanent than a few new continental pen-friends.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a touch of irony about the dismissal of Robson Rhodes as auditors
of Yorkshire textile group John Foster &amp; Son. Although the board had
previously requested the accountancy firm to resign, it refused on the
highly principled grounds that auditors are responsible to shareholders, not
directors.
Yet when shareholders turned up at the group's AGM last July, a certain
party was noticeable only by its absence. The Robson Rhodes partner due to
attend had put the wrong date in his diary and failed to show. As a result,
the auditors' report to shareholders had to be read out by Foster's finance
director]
The change of auditors nevertheless raises the question of how four of the
Big Six firms invited to tender as replacements could offer audit fees at
about 65 per cent of their predecessor's level. After all, their charge-out
rates are presumably not much different from those of Robson Rhodes, 14th by
fee income.
So what's the answer - a cut in hours . . . reallocation of the work to
lower-grade staff . . . ? Surely they couldn't have been offering a
loss-leader on such an important function.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Cracking the Morse code
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more interesting banking riddles at the moment centres on who is
going to replace Sir Jeremy Morse and Brian Pitman, the chairman and chief
executive of Lloyds Bank, Britain's second biggest financial services group.
They are the longest serving - and most successful - duo at the top of their
trade. But their time is coming to an end.
Until Michael Hepher's surprise decision to swop the chairmanship of Lloyds
Abbey Life for the number two job at British Telecom, he seemed the
favourite to replace 60-year-old Pitman. Even so, several younger Lloyds'
bankers are training by Pitman's side and his replacement is nowhere near as
hard to spot as Sir Jeremy's.
The easiest solution would be for Pitman to replace 63-year-old Morse.
Pitman has done a first-rate job transforming Lloyds into the best regarded
of the big four banks and deserves to be rewarded. But a strong chief
executive can find it hard to stop interfering on being kicked upstairs. Sir
Jeremy, and his predecessor Sir Eric Faulkner, came from outside, and both
proved excellent choices.
There is no obvious future chairman amongst Lloyds' current crop of
non-executives. But as Sir Jeremy lists problems and puzzles amongst his
favourite recreations in Who's Who, it would be surprising if he blotted his
record by failing to pick the right successor.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: The Dedication Orchestra - 100 Club, Oxford St
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Treating a New Year's hangover with full tilt avant-garde jazz in a smoky
basement club with a relative humidity of 99 per cent would not be the
average citizen's cup of purgative, but the grimy 100 Club in Oxford Street
was full to the rafters anyway. That's because the Dedication Orchestra,
which employs some of the country's most liberated improvisers, was
performing there and for a good cause.
The musicians involved have all collaborated at some time with South African
jazz refugees The Blue Notes - Johnny Dyani, Mongezi Feza, Chris McGregor,
Louis Moholo and Dudu Pukwana - who arrived here in the 1960s. Only Moholo
remains, the others have all died.
But such was the lasting effect on the London jazz composing scene of the
characters that their peers have established a bursary, The Spirits Rejoice
Foundation, to help fund young South African musicians' study in Europe. All
proceeds from the concert, and sales of the CD to follow, will go into the
fund.
When the Blue Notes first arrived in London from South Africa in 1965
(multi-racial music making was not possible at home), their fiery
township-inspired impro was unlike anything the trad or bop fraternity here
was used to.
The sound of the Dedication Orchestra is not yet easy listening. Pianist
Keith Tippett, who with his lamb chop sideburns, collarless shirt and
waistcoat looks like a refugee from the Onedin Line, often leaves his stool
to tinker beneath the instrument's lid with wooden blocks.
His wife Julie, with whom he once had a band called Ovary Lodge, is so
involved a vocalist her violent spasms seem likely to carry her off the
stand.
They are but one-twelfth of the ensemble and the whole makes a formidable
sound. The horns include the crazed sopranos of Lol Coxhill and Evan Parker,
with Django Bates directing from behind a tenor horn. The brass features
Kenny Wheeler, absent for the set I caught, amply compensated for by Harry
Beckett and Jim Dvorak while Louis Moholo, the surviving Blue Note, grins
out from behind a quivering kit.
Original Blue Note compositions all, the material is arranged in an
invigoratingly shambolic way by current personnel. Out of this crafted chaos
comes the sounds of Soweto rhythms and swing big bands, as in 'Manja' (now),
written by Chris McGregor and arranged by Mike Westbrook.
In 'Dancing Damon' trombone slides bristle vigorously while in 'Sonja' Evan
Parker shows uncharacteristic restraint and melody with the ballad,
sometimes actually breathing between notes.
The Dedication Orchestra will never rival Paul Simon in popularising South
African rhythms but the CD deserves to be a success, for historical as well
as charitable reasons.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Arts: Docklands Sinfonietta - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the few cultural enterprises that grew up in the London Docklands
during the last decade is the Docklands Sinfonietta, founded in 1989. The
orchestra was set up to bring music to the development area and its
programme this season includes a series of summer concerts there, but for
the big dates it is already starting to venture further afield.
Whatever the setbacks being experienced in property and other business
interests in the Docklands enterprise zone at the moment, this particular
enterprise would seem to be flourishing. Friday's concert was well attended
and well played.
The group is relatively small (20 strings arranged 6-4-4-4-2) so there is
nowhere for timid players to hide. But under Edward Downes's experienced
baton the class of the individual musicians told.
The programme was restricted to strings and percussion (though a Barbican
concert next week will provide an opportunity to judge the wind and brass
sections that have been assembled).
In the first half Arvo Part's Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten and
Bartok's Music for strings, percussion and celeste were agreeably
lightweight, clear, sharp in profile - no question of the rich string
sonorities that one would hear from, say, the Academy of St
Martin-in-the-Fields.
Instead Downes stressed other qualities. There is always a special pleasure
to be gained when a chamber-sized group of talented string players is
brought together and it was that extra degree of fiery attack and individual
eloquence that came to the fore both in their Bartok and, after the
interval, in a concentrated performance of Shostakovich's Symphony No 14.
There the only reservation was that the two soloists, though admirable in
every other respect, were not native Russian speakers. Sarah Walker is able
to produce the right sort of Slavic edge to the voice. Willard White, noble,
honest, suggesting a deep-seated stability at heart, had the vocal demands
of the music well within his compass; but I missed the spirit of rebellious
sarcasm with which this symphony openly mocks authority.
Two decades (and a revolution) on, it remains a remarkably powerful work. As
a study of man in isolation, whether of the lone prisoner pacing his cell or
the poet who speaks out against dictatorship, this symphony is Shostakovich
at his most painfully articulate and it is that aspect which Downes and his
players caught so well. The solo cellos singing their poignant threnody in
'Oh, Delvig' were particularly fine.

with a programme about breast cancer (8.10 BBC2). Wildlife On One, starts
another series with a film about chimpanzees in west Africa, claiming to
show the 'true' life of these higher primates for the first time (8.30
BBC1).
World In Action comes back with a programme about Borneo being denuded of
hardwood trees for the sake of Japanese industry while Japan protects its
own trees (8.30 ITV). The tediously trendy American series thirtysomething
returns for what, according to Channel 4, 'seems to be' its final episodes
(10.00). Otherwise Engaged promises to report on conversation in the women's
lavatories of south Wales dance halls. You have been warned (10.55 C4).

FT  06 JAN 92 / Management: Protecting the secretary bird
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD SEVERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As more about Robert Maxwell's misdeeds and misbehaviour becomes known,
everybody is asking: how could it all have happened? Why didn't his
accountants, bankers and auditors stand up to him? And what can be done to
make it easier to expose business tyrants in the future?
A starting point could be to give more support to the company secretary.
They are, or should be, privy to all the confidential deliberations and
secrets of the board and the company. They are therefore in the best
possible place to see malpractice at its very beginning.
There is a great deal of ignorance of what the company secretary is or does,
and the job description has traditionally been one of the most difficult to
write.
The secretary is the most senior executive in the company below board level.
The secretary's status has changed greatly in the last 100 years. At the end
of last century he was considered a mere servant, did what he was told, and
had no authority to represent anything at all. In 1948 Parliament recognised
him by statute, and that year's Companies Act provided for the first time
that every company had to have a secretary. In 1971 Lord Denning treated the
secretary as the chief administrative officer of the company, and the
Companies Act of 1980 took another step forward in providing that every
public company must have a properly qualified secretary, as defined in the
Act.
Today, the secretary is sometimes thought of as 'the conscience of the
company'. Among his responsibilities, which include ensuring compliance with
the law, is a duty to guide his board, collectively and individually.
Most chairmen and directors do not have to be challenged. But there are
exceptions, largely unknown outside a comparatively small circle. They
contain the scandals of tomorrow.
Company secretaries have mortgages, families and responsibilities. They know
that the likely consequence of telling an overpowering chairman that he
cannot do what he is proposing to do is the loss of their job. Tyrannical
tycoons are, by definition, hirers and firers, not accustomed to being
frustrated by employees and easily capable of removing the cause of the
obstruction.
Nevertheless, the secretary could be in the ideal position to stop, or at
least reduce, the possibility of boardroom malpractice. But they do need the
kind of legal protection given to directors and auditors.
In principle, company directors and auditors can only be removed from their
respective positions by a vote of shareholders in general meeting. A
proposal to remove either of these officers has to be made to the company
concerned by a shareholder, and the company must then give notice to all the
other shareholders that such a resolution is to be proposed at an annual or
extraordinary general meeting.
The protection against removal goes further. Upon receiving notice of a
resolution to remove a director or the auditor, the company must send a copy
of that notice to the person involved. That person is then allowed to be
heard at the meeting in his own defence, and also to circulate to all
shareholders written representations on his own behalf, stating his case.
This naturally means publicity,
These statutory provisions are to safeguard independence. It is not to be
supposed that if the law were altered there would be a spate of general
meetings to remove secretaries.
Indeed, the very opposite would be the case. The mere existence of legal
protection would in itself provide the sanction against removal in public,
and would give the secretary the security he at present lacks when advising
strongly against what he knows or believes to be wrong.
The emblem of the Institute of Qualified Company Secretaries is a secretary
bird. I suggest that, for the benefit of the business world, it should
become a protected species.

BIDS CLOSE today for consortia hoping to buy the state-owned British
Technology Group (BTG), with offers expected from management and staff,
trade unions and universities.
Potential foreign buyers are expected to feature among the bidders, none of
which will be permitted to own more than 15 per cent of the group.
The government decided to rule out a sale to a single buyer after fears from
universities that BTG, which plays a key role in commercialising their
research, would neglect the long-term needs of the academic world. BTG,
which makes its money on patents, saw profits fall 32 per cent last year to
Pounds 6.5m on revenues of Pounds 30.7m.
Among organisations that have expressed an interest in BTG are 3i, the UK
venture capital group, and a group of contract research organisations headed
by Sir Ronald Mason, former Ministry of Defence chief scientist.

FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Increase reported in use of
performance pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE pay is gradually filtering down organisations from executives to
the shopfloor, according to a survey by Incomes Data Services, the pay
analysis organisation.
IDS remains sceptical about many aspects of performance pay and says pay
policies designed for a period of competitive expansion may not be suitable
for harsher times.
A survey of IDS's subscribers shows that 25 per cent of companies have an
element of merit pay for manual workers. For salaried staff, more than 80
per cent use merit awards.
IDS says a surprising number of companies have a uniform 'general plus
merit' policy for all employees but few companies have wanted, or been able,
to introduce an entirely merit-based approach.
This contrasts sharply with France where companies have adopted merit pay on
such a scale that less than half the manual workers covered by the annual
Ministry of Labour survey receive a standard general increase. Nine out of
10 of France's biggest companies had a 'general plus merit' policy in 1990.
In Britain merit pay systems introduced for manual workers focus on skills
assessment and acquisition, usually associated with new working methods.

KASHMIRI political groups in Pakistan held rallies and marches yesterday,
demanding a United Nations-mandated plebiscite in their disputed Himalayan
state to decide its future, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Kashmiri sources said a complete strike was observed in Pakistani-ruled Azad
(free) Kashmir to protest against the failure to implement UN resolutions
calling for a plebiscite in the region, two-thirds of which is under Indian
control.
Protesters burned the Indian flag in the Pakistani town of Rawalpindi, near
Islamabad. They accused India of committing atrocities in Kashmir while
trying to crush a Moslem independence campaign.
Kashmiri groups in Pakistan designated yesterday a 'self-determination day'
to commemorate a 1949 resolution of a UN commission for India and Pakistan
that called for a plebiscite in Kashmir.
Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum, Azad Kashmir's prime minister, called on Kashmiris
to be prepared to take up arms to 'take revenge for every drop of (Kashmiri)
blood'.
He accused India of failing to move towards a political settlement and told
a rally in the state capital of Muzaffarabad: 'If India insists on a
military solution to the Kashmir problem, we are ready for that as well.'
Two of the three wars between India and Pakistan since independence from
Britain in 1947 were fought over Kashmir.
More than 5,000 people have died in the Moslem rebellion in Indian Kashmir
since early 1990.
Islamabad has denied Indian charges that it is training and arming Kashmiri
militants.

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS efforts to bring peace and humanitarian assistance to
war-ravaged Somalia appeared destined for failure last night after a special
envoy completed a three-day tour of the country without reaching agreement
on a ceasefire or relief efforts.
The failure, in the face of objections by Somalia's battling factions, is
bound to lead to further clan warfare and worsen the plight of hundreds of
thousands of Somali civilians.
Mr James Jonah, UN undersecretary general, said there was no common ground
between the two battling warlords - Mohamed Farah Aideed and Ali Mahdi
Mohamed - in the shell-blasted capital, Mogadishu.
Fighting continued during Mr Jonah's trip, despite assurances that a de
facto ceasefire was in place. Mr Jonah said Mr Ali Mahdi had asked the UN to
send a peacekeeping force into Mogadishu and attempt to broker a
reconciliation. Both proposals were ruled out by Mr Aideed. At least 5,000
people have been killed and 11,000 wounded since the latest bout of clan
warfare erupted last November.
The failure of the UN - which was absent from Mogadishu for most of last
year - will lead to initiatives by other bodies. The Arab League, of which
Somalia is a member, agreed at an emergency meeting yesterday to appoint a
ministerial committee to attempt to reconcile the factions.
Mr Meles Zenawi, the transitional president of Ethiopia, has also given his
support to calls for an international force to enter Somalia to facilitate
humanitarian operations.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Rift caused by conflict in Tbilisi could be hard to heal:
Georgians are starting to wonder if either side is capable of bringing
democracy to the republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGY is not the sort of man you would expect to find standing on Tbilisi's
Rustaveli Avenue dressed in mirrored sun-glasses and camouflage jacket and
holding a Kalashnikov. He is an ordained priest in the Georgian Orthodox
Church.
He claims to have a religious reason for his opposition to Georgia's
president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 'He is Satan,' Georgy says simply. 'I am
fighting against the anti-Christ.'
The severity of the fighting in Tbilisi in the past two weeks has been more
than matched by the near-hysterical language used by each side. The
opposition is especially fond of religious and diabolical imagery to
describe a man who says he prays twice a day.
'This is a man with three sixes on his head,' Mr Tengiz Kitovani, one of the
two leaders of the opposition's military council, told reporters last week,
in reference to the Great Beast of the biblical Revelations.
Mr Gamsakhurdia is only slightly more measured in his denunciation of the
opposition, referring to them variously as terrorists, criminals, hooligans,
bandits, agents of Moscow and Mafiosi.
This kind of propaganda, and the fiery Georgian temperament and tendency
towards exaggeration, are all playing their part in inflaming conflict. As
fighting enters its third week, both sides have made mistakes, both sides
have told lies and both have fired on unarmed civilians. Georgians are
starting to wonder if either side is capable of bringing democracy to the
republic.
Strangely, their leaders are neither career politicians nor soldiers. Mr
Kitovani and Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, heads of the opposition's military
council, are a former sculptor and a professor of dramatic art.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, meanwhile, is the son of Georgia's most famous 20th century
writer, Konstantin Gamsakhurdia, and a former English lecturer.
All three were imprisoned as dissidents under Soviet rule and participated
in the movement to 'liberate' Georgia from the Soviet Union in recent years.
Mr Gamsakhurdia and Mr Kitovani were in the same class at school and until
last year were close friends.
Only Mr Tengiz Sigua, the former prime minister, and now appointed
alternative prime minister by the opposition, lacks an artistic, dissident
background. He is a former engineer.
The issue which divides the opposition and Mr Gamsakhurdia is their charge
that he has attempted to become a dictator. While he does not deserve to be
compared with the likes of Ceausescu or Saddam Hussein, his rule does bear
many of the hallmarks of a dictatorship.
After his election with 87 per cent of the vote in May last year, Mr
Gamsakhurdia broke his election promises to liberalise the economy and allow
private ownership of land.
In addition, the opposition claims, he took over the KGB and used a network
of 85 directly-appointed prefects to impose absolute rule in the republic.
Opposition deputies and former members of the government accuse him of
refusing to heed other's opinions, appointing unsuitable and incompetent
ministers, and ultimately attempting to rule without parliament.
Mr Gamsakhurdia has also imprisoned several political opponents, including
Mr Iosseliani, closed newspapers and attempted to control state television,
prompting a strike among journalists.
But his biggest crime in the eyes of the opposition was his ambiguous
reaction to last August's attempted coup in Moscow when he obeyed
instructions from the coup leaders to disarm the Georgian national guard. He
refused to denounce the coup and publicly censured deputies who did.
Defying the order to disarm, Mr Kitovani, founder of the national guard, led
rebel soldiers into hiding outside Tbilisi. Mr Sigua resigned.
Both went into opposition, forming a loose alliance with a range of
political parties and armed groups, and the slide towards civil conflict
began.
That conflict could continue for some time. The opposition has begun to
retreat from its recent threat to storm the government building where Mr
Gamsakhurdia is under siege, perhaps realising that it lacks the firepower
to be certain of victory.
They may fear a popular backlash against any action resulting in heavy
bloodshed.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, while short of weapons and ammunition, apparently has more
trained troops at his disposal than the opposition. He has also been
bequeathed by Georgia's former Communist leaders a fortified bunker with
electricity and running water. Supply lines from outside are still open.
The opposition hopes he will give himself up or be forced out by those
around him. Certainly, he has cracked under pressure before when, as a
political prisoner, he was persuaded by the KGB to denounce
fellow-dissidents on television in return for a reduced sentence.
Whatever the fate of the president, the question of whether the opposition
can successfully seize power and hold new elections without the conflict
escalating into civil war depends on the level of support for the two sides
in the provinces.
There has so far been little response to the president's call for a general
strike, but some observers suggest the rifts between fellow-Georgians caused
by the ugly situation in Tbilisi may be difficult to heal.

FT  06 JAN 92 / West gives ex-Soviet republics respite on Dollars 3.2bn debt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN creditor nations have agreed to give the republics of the former
Soviet Union breathing space to the end of this year to repay loans
totalling Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.75bn), Reuter reports from Paris.
The agreement by 17 rich industrial nations at the weekend confirmed in
detail an earlier accord struck at the end of November by the Group of Seven
industrialised countries.
'The participating countries decided. . . to grant a deferral of payments on
principal only, on medium- and long-term external debts contracted before
January 1 1991, falling due from December 5 1991 to the end of 1992,' a
statement said.
The creditors said they would review at the end of March whether the former
Soviet republics were implementing economic reforms drawn up with the help
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The deferral would continue if they met conditions which included keeping up
to date with the repayment of debts excluded from the agreement.
A senior French official said the group estimated that the former Soviet
Union owes Dollars 65bn, considerably below earlier public estimates of
Dollars 80bn, to the outside world in debts. Of the Dollars 65bn, about
Dollars 32bn is owed to the 17 nations that agreed to the deferral, the
official said.
The basis for the agreement was a pledge by eight of the republics to accept
shared responsibility for Soviet debt.
The agreement, which does not apply to short-term loans, follows a similar
one reached last month by commercial banks.
The western creditors urged other republics to follow suit. 'The
participating countries (in the Paris meeting) expect that all other
successors in the former USSR will rapidly join in this memorandum,' the
Paris statement said.
It made clear that if they do not agree to share the responsibility, they
risk being cut off from vital western trade credits they need to revive
their shattered economies.
'The countries stated that when considering whether to provide additional
export credits to the republics, they would take into account whether the
republics' had agreed to help shoulder the debt, the statement added.
A senior French official said the group of creditors did not expect the
former Soviet Union to need a full-blown rescheduling of its debt because it
was manageable, considering the potential wealth of the country.
The political significance of the accord dwarfed important debt
reschedulings in the past such as those for Mexico and Brazil, the official
added. 'In many respects, it's the most important we've ever had.'

ITALY, the first EC country to drop a US-led trade embargo against Vietnam,
said yesterday Rome would give Hanoi Dollars 70m (Pounds 38.4m) in new
grants and soft loans for 1993 and 1994, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister, said at the end of a
one-day visit to Hanoi that the aid, which follows Dollars 140m granted to
Vietnam in 1990-1992, would be used mostly to develop telecommunications and
electricity.
'We are opening the way, paving the way for the other European countries,'
Mr de Michelis said. 'We thought the time was ripe for changing the European
position.'
In December 1989 Italy broke ranks with other western countries by offering
Vietnam the Dollars 140m aid package.

FT  06 JAN 92 / Bush seeks big cuts in defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is seeking further big cuts in US defence spending to
pay for 'middle class' tax cuts and other measures to revive the economy and
bolster his campaign for re-election this year.
The 'peace dividend' - to be combined with changes in the budget deficit
reduction agreement - is likely to be the centrepiece of Mr Bush's State of
the Union address to Congress later this month.
Mr Bush is also studying proposals for tax credits to help Americans buy
health insurance, a Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098) tax credit for first-time
home buyers and tax relief for US companies investing in plant and
equipment.
The president has faced sharp criticism from Democrats and members of his
own Republican party for neglecting domestic issues and failing to produce a
growth package to restore public confidence in the economy.
Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, said in a television
interview yesterday that the president had ordered the Pentagon to try to
find cuts beyond the 25 per cent reduction in forces planned by 1995.
Mr Skinner suggested that further defence savings were likely because the
Pentagon's five-year budget was based on assumptions made before the
collapse of the former Soviet Union. 'The threat (to the US) has changed,'
he said.
The defence cuts, which could save up to Dollars 50bn, would be made
gradually, starting next year with heavier reductions at the end of the
five-year cycle, a senior US official said last month.
Major weapons systems such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, the Seawolf attack
submarine and the number of active US army divisions, tactical fighter wings
and aircraft carrier groups face the axe.
These defence cuts would be combined with a request to Congress to modify
the 1990 budget deficit reduction agreement which sets spending ceilings for
defence, foreign aid and domestic categories.
Mr Bush would ask Congress to allow funds to be shifted from defence to
domestic initiatives, with some money going to deficit reduction. But the
president would insist on maintaining existing caps on total spending, Mr
Skinner said.
A growing number of influential Democrats and Republicans favour making the
budget agreement more flexible. But it is unclear what price the Democratic
majority in Congress will demand for allowing Mr Bush to reopen the budget
agreement. At the very least, Democrats are likely to seek to increase
domestic spending beyond what Mr Bush envisages and to press for higher
taxes on the wealthy.
One White House counter-option is to introduce means testing for health care
benefits, making affluent Americans pay more for federal entitlements, such
as the government-funded Medicare programme.
The New York Times reported yesterday that Americans earning more than
Dollars 125,000 a year could find their Medicare premiums tripled, while
other government programmes such as farm price supports for the wealthy
could be trimmed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and Tajikistan yesterday established formal diplomatic links as
Beijing continued to form ties with the successor-states to the Soviet
Union, especially those on its sensitive border, Reuter reports from
Beijing.
The New China News Agency reported that a joint communique was signed in
Dushanbe, Tajikistan's capital, to establish relations at ambassadorial
level.
Tajikistan is one of three republics bordering China's Moslem-minority
region of Xinjiang in the north-west.
Beijing still has to establish ties with Kirgizia in order to have relations
with all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on its
immediate border.
China and Russia set up ties at ambassadorial level on December 27. Beijing
subsequently set up full ties with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine.
China has recognised all republics of the CIS and Georgia, which has not yet
joined the commonwealth, but has said it will negotiate full ties with each
individually.
A senior official in China's remote north-west on the border with the three
republics has urged the region's ethnic minorities to improve inter-ethnic
unity and national defence.
Mr Keyum Bawudun, deputy chairman of the predominantly-Moslem Xinjiang
province, made the plea because Beijing views with alarm the possibility of
Moslems on both sides of the border making common cause.
'Xinjiang, as the north-west gateway of the motherland, is very important in
terms of its strategic position,' Keyum was quoted as saying on Xinjiang
television on Saturday.
'Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education in national defence
among all ethnic groups in the region, to enhance solidarity between the
army and the people, and to increase inter-ethnic unity,' he was quoted as
saying.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: World seeks to break a spell of
recession - Leading economist Peter Oppenheimer forsees a difficult 1992 for
financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER OPPENHEIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR AGO recession was an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon. The North American,
British and Australian economies had ground to a halt but expansion was
still vigorous in Japan, in south east Asia and in much of continental
Europe, especially Germany. For the first time since the 1960s, the business
cycle appeared to be de-synchronised across countries - a welcome
development since de-synchronisation had been a big help to world economic
stability in that decade.
The deepening gloom at the onset of 1992 stems from a perception that the
magic formula of the 1960s has not been re-discovered. Japan and continental
Europe have slowed down, without expansion resuming in America and Britain.
The Anglo-Saxon economies remain plagued by weak external competitiveness
and by the aftermath of financial mis-management on the grand scale in the
later 1980s - ill-judged deregulation, wild lending policies, absence of
prudential restraints.
In the US, the Fed has responded belatedly by bringing down interest rates
to a reasonably low level, and the strength of equity prices is a good omen.
Japan is following suit on interest rates; but its equity market still looks
fragile and remains over-dependent on foreigners for business.
Nonetheless, investors who like to swim against the tide should be taking
(or have taken) profits on Wall Street, while maintaining or enlarging their
stake in the Far East.
Europe is demonstrating more clearly than ever that fixed exchange parities
in the ERM in the absence of a European Federal Reserve System means
subservience to the Bundesbank. France, Italy and the rest of the EC have to
swallow additional unemployment in order that German trade unions moderate
their wage claims.
Not that Germany is especially to blame. German abhorrence of even moderate
inflation is hardly news and it has been clear for some time that
re-unification would impose particular strains on the German economy.
A dose of unwanted deflation is the price which the French are now paying
for having successfully opposed the Bundesbank's wish to up-value the D-mark
within the ERM two and three years ago.
A precisely analogous mistake was committed by Britain when it joined the
ERM in the autumn of 1990 at a central rate at least 10 per cent too high
from the point of view of external competitiveness. To be sure, ERM
membership has helped to subdue inflationary psychology in Britain. But so
it would have done if the parity chosen had been 10 per cent lower - and so
it will do, even if the government decides, either before or after the
election, that a lower parity is appropriate.
Increasingly frantic Tory politicians are urging the Chancellor to follow-up
on the emergency package for the housing market with income tax cuts in the
Budget. Given the myopia and gullibility of the British electorate, such
measures are tempting - even though a boost to domestic demand without
regard to the country's external trade position would be economic folly. By
contrast, devaluation would be economically respectable and probably better
for the stock market.
Another area of uncertainty for international business relations is
commercial policy, including the continued failure to bring the Uruguay
Round of Gatt negotiations to a successful conclusion. The difficulty is to
decide how seriously to take this.
There have been numerous chicken wars and other trans-Atlantic trade
squabbles in the past 20 years. The proliferation over that time of
voluntary export restraints and other protectionist devices contrary to the
spirit and sometimes to the letter of Gatt has not prevented world trade
from continuing to expand at a healthy rate, certainly faster than world
output.
And the spread of multinationals provides an on-going counter-force to
industrial protectionism. Talk of 'fortress Europe' inspired by the Single
European Act helped to attract additional Japanese and US investment to the
EC - perhaps the most conspicuous benefit of the 1992 programme.
On the other hand, US exasperation at its bilateral trade deficits with
whichever Far Eastern country is currently in major surplus seems to be
growing. The US deficit is quintessentially home-made, a reflection of low
domestic saving and of the budget deficits established by President Reagan's
tax cuts a decade ago. Yet the US Congress is once again spawning absurd
legislative proposals, for example requiring the Japanese to reduce their
bilateral surplus with the US by 20 per cent a year for the next five years
or face a trade war.
Even more important is the question of eastern Europe and Russia. Free
access to western export markets is vitally necessary if economic reforms in
these countries are to have a chance of making rapid headway. Political
revolution in the east should have been matched by radical commercial
measures in the European Community. Instead, protectionist lobbies in
Brussels and elsewhere have manoeuvred to delay and limit market access for
the eastern countries through much of the 1990s.
If economic discontent aggravates political instability and encourages the
emergence of new forms of authoritarianism in eastern Europe, Brussels will
have its share of responsibility; and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange will not
be the only loser.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Tennis: The year Seles ruled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE outstanding tennis player of the year in 1991 was a woman. The
double-barrelled power of Monica Seles brought the 18-year-old Yugoslav
left-hander ten titles including all three grand slam championships she
contested (Australia, France and the US), plus the season-ending Virginia
Slims.
In a remarkably consistent year she reached the final of every tournament
she entered and could be criticised only for the manner of her mysterious
withdrawal from Wimbledon. As a result of the storm of controversy that
surrounded her silence on the subject, she will be a wiser woman in 1992.
Stefan Edberg's claim to top spot among the men is not so clear-cut. As in
1990, the four grand slam titles were won by four different players. Boris
Becker, after winning his first Australian title, had a spell atop the
computer rankings and rose briefly to that position again following his
passage to the Wimbledon final.
Michael Stich's victory that day was an astonishing performance for a man
who had only one tournament success to his name, and the psychological
damage he inflicted on Becker seemed to affect his fellow German for the
rest of the year.
Jim Courier, the American in Paris, whose forceful top-spin brought him
victories over Edberg, Stich and Andre Agassi on the slow red clay to earn
him a first grand slam crown, was also a finalist in New York, but he was
crushed there by Edberg.
The year had started badly for Stefan with a semi-final loss to Ivan Lendl
in Australia after the Swede had served a double-fault at match point.
Things did not improve in Paris where he fell to the groundstroke power of
Courier, and at Wimbledon there was that frustrating semi-final loss to
Stich when the German never broke his serve but won three tie-break sets
after losing the first.
Edberg finally stamped his authority on the year in New York. His crushing
wins over Lendl and Courier in the last two rounds brought him his fourth
title of 1991, a total he later extended to six with wins in Sydney and
Tokyo. Only Guy Forget, one of the heroes of France's emotional Davis Cup
success against the Americans in Lyon, could claim as many titles in 1991.
Courier leaps from near obscurity to the No 2 spot. He was not far from
dislodging Edberg from No 1. He had lost to the Swede in Melbourne but
balanced that by gaining revenge in Paris, and would have overtaken him if
he had won their final in New York.
The 21-year-old double-hander is a gritty competitor who makes the most of
his physical strength. With the help of his coach, Jose Higueras, Courier is
a much more patient player and his three tournament wins, plus an appearance
in the final of the ATP Tour championships in Frankfurt, gives him the edge
over Becker.
Stich's Wimbledon triumph alone would have given him preference over Ivan
Lendl, but before that the 23-year-old newcomer had been a semi-finalist in
Paris; afterwards, he claimed the titles in Stuttgart, Vienna and
Schenectady, New York to underline his rising status. With a second serve
the equal of most men's first delivery, a beautifully-timed backhand of
great penetration and a growing awareness of his latent ability, we could
see greater things from this intelligent and likeable man in 1992.
After a dramatic loss to Becker in the Australian final, Lendl's year was
marred by an infection on his playing hand following an operation to remove
hard skin. He missed the French Open and did not recover his best form at
Wimbledon or in New York. However, he did garner three tournament wins and
performed better in major Championships than Forget.
Below Seles there was little difficulty in rating the next four women.
Steffi Graf reclaimed her Wimbledon crown in a nail-biting finish against
Gabriela Sabatini and could forget the family problems that had so affected
her in 1990. However, she is unlikely ever to forget the humiliation of a
6-2 6-0 loss to Arantxa Sanchez in the semi-finals in Paris, her worst
defeat at a major Championship.
By reaching the final at Wimbledon, the semi-finals in Paris and the last
eight at the Australian and US Opens, Sabatini had a marginally better year
than Martina Navratilova who did not challenge in Melbourne or Paris but did
reach the final in New York.
Navratilova lost her Wimbledon title at the quarter-final stage when
Jennifer Capriati, belying her 15 years, produced an extraordinarily mature
performance to win in two close sets. This was one of the best matches of
the year but Capriati gave us an even greater thrill in New York by taking
Seles to the brink of defeat in a heroic semi-final that ended in a third
set tie-break of unbearable tension.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Boxing: Lewis shows the moves of a champion - Keith Wheatley
meets a serious British heavyweight contender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW British sportsmen are looking forward to 1992 as much as Lennox Lewis.
If the dice roll his way, the Kent-based heavyweight could be fighting for
the world heavyweight title before the year ends. Furthermore, there are
grounds for believing that Lewis could be the first Brit to hold that title
since Bob Fitzsimons in 1897.
Should that happen, his earnings would make those of Frank Bruno look like
pantomime takings. Boxing may not enjoy the profile or support it once did.
Yet one should not underestimate the fervour that would surge behind a
Briton who made it - not least in America.
'England is seen here as the birthplace of boxing and with nearly 100 years
since there was a British champion, Lennox is beginning to tap into that
wave of sentiment,' explained John Hornewer, a young Chicago attorney and
Lewis's lawyer, friend and confidante. 'Since he did so well in his last
fight, he's beginning to have a big profile here.'
That fight, two months ago in Atlanta, saw Lewis achieve a controlled and
capable three-round demolition of contender Tyrell Biggs. Producers at Home
Box Office, who have Lewis under contract for two more fights, were thrilled
at what they saw as his entertainment value. What inspired Lewis himself
that night was less the sight of Biggs hitting the canvas than the later,
main bout between Evander Holyfield and Bert Cooper.
Holyfield looked a less-than-worthy champion, taking seven struggling rounds
to stop Cooper, a journeyman pro who accepted the fight at six days' notice.
'Having watched him against Cooper, I know I can beat Holyfield,' said Lewis
immediately after that fight. 'The problem is that a lot of other fighters
will be thinking the same thing and there'll be a queue to get into the ring
with him. I want to be first.'
At this point, lawyers and an alleged rape enter the picture.
Dozens of lawyers are petitioning in Indianapolis, trying to persuade Judge
Patricia Gifford to postpone Mike Tyson's trial on rape charges. In March he
is contracted to fight Holyfield in a Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.4m) match at
Las Vegas.
If Tyson cannot beat the rap, hoteliers and promoters are anxious that he
should at least delay it.
'Everything depends on Tyson,' observed Holyfield's promoter, Dan Duva. 'We
can't make plans with Lewis or anyone else until we know whether Tyson will
be fighting again. If he's not in jail, we have to stick to our contract.'
Lennox Lewis has become used to lawyers in the background of his life. His
principal backer and financial adviser is Roger Levitt, the disgraced and
bankrupt financial services entrepreneur currently on bail in London over 24
criminal charges and facing personal claims of around Pounds 50m.
Lewis was a principal component of the Levitt Group's plan to develop and
manage a string of high-earning international athletes to match those of the
International Management Group. It was Levitt who flew the boxer and
Hornewer over from Canada - where Lewis lived until 1989 - and offered him a
car, house, Dollars 200,000 signing-on fee, and even a job for his mother.
Hornewer concedes that the terms were absurdly generous, but says they
reflected the passion of the boxing-mad tycoon to 'breed' a British
champion. 'The deal is personality-based. Levitt had to have Lennox Lewis,
whatever it cost,' says the attorney.
Lewis, 26, is one of the most pleasant, intelligent and articulate sportsmen
you could wish to meet. If Bruno is Ian Botham, Lewis is David Gower. He
describes himself as 'just another buppy' (black urban professional) who
wants to earn a fortune from boxing and get out as fast as possible. In
spite of his connection with Levitt, it is hard to see him dropping into any
kind of shady milieu in the way that Tyson and promoter Don King fit so
cosily together.
Although born in London, Lennox Lewis grew up in Canada, for which country
he won an Olympic gold medal in 1988. A streak of sentiment, Levitt gold and
a hunch that Britain might offer a fairer face to a hungry black boxer than
North America brought him back home.
In Toronto, they still tell the story of how boxing promoter Irving
Ungerman, who made his fortune in the chicken business, offered to take the
young gold-medal winner, about to turn pro, into his stable, which had once
included contender George Chuvalo.
Lewis listened attentively and then noted that Ungerman Donovan Boucher, a
black welterweight who had ended the career of white hope Shawn O'Sullivan
some months earlier.
'Mr Ungerman,' Lewis observed, with the utmost courtesy, 'you manage Donovan
Boucher and he knocked out Shawn O'Sullivan who made all those chicken
commercials for Swiss Chalet. And you sell the chickens to Swiss Chalet, so
now how come Donovan Boucher isn't making any commercials?' For once, the
loquacious Ungerman was dumbstruck.
One cannot help thinking that a 23-year-old who can handle a chicken magnate

FT  04 JAN 92 / Gardening: How to keep your plants contained - The pots,
tubs, urns and bags that are available to gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS little new about container gardening except, perhaps, the name and
the facilities that are available for carrying it out. But gardeners have
always grown some plants in pots, tubs, boxes, urns and many other
containers which could be moved about readily, maybe brought under cover
when the weather was bad or the plants were out of season or, more likely
nowadays when so many container plants are cheaply raised from seed, simply
discarded and replaced with something new.
Le Notre made great use of containers in France in the 17th century. The
Versailles tubs which he used are still one of the most elegant designs.
They are particularly suitable for large plants such as orange bushes -
which is what Le Notre wanted them for - camellias, hydrangeas or
rhododendrons.
At the other extreme of utility without beauty is the growing bag. This is a
fairly recent innovation which scored an instant success as a convenient way
of growing tomatoes, cucumbers and other crops that are susceptible to
soil-borne pests and diseases.
Anything that makes it easy to use fresh growing composts for each crop, and
to dispose easily and with certainty what has already been used, must be
attractive to growers.
It was soon clear that such bags had uses for ornamental plants but it took
manufacturers a surprisingly long time to realise that these required bags
more attractive in appearance than the plain black, or even worse, the
advertisement-covered bags used for commercial crops.
Really good containers should be attractive in their own right so that they
can be used as ornaments even when nothing is growing in them.
There are two main ways in which ornamental plants may be used in
containers, one to maintain a constantly changing display, largely of plants
grown from seed and discarded after a single season of display; the other
for more permanent cultivation mainly of shrubs and perennials, some of
which may need protection during the winter.
There is no doubt that it is the seed-raised plants, many of them raised
professionally and marketed when just coming into flower, that are making
the greatest advance in sales at the moment and are being marketed in vast
numbers for hanging baskets, window boxes, pots and ornamental containers of
many kinds.
The rise in popularity of patio and terrace gardens, and the increasing use
of balconies for growing plants, have all contributed to this increase in
using containers, and growers have been quick to seize on the opportunity to
market plants in convenient packs suitable for making successive displays.
There are two main danger areas in container gardening whatever its precise
purpose and material. These are watering and feeding. They are closely
related since plants can only take in food in solution, which is one good
reason for mixing the food, whether organic or inorganic, with water.
It is just as easy, and as harmful, to overfeed and overwater as to do the
reverse and the two guidelines I regard as most helpful are to use feeds
according to label instructions erring, if at all, on understrength, and to
give water, with or without food, until it starts to trickle out of the
drainage holes or slits, or through the moss used to line hanging baskets,
and then to give no more until it is needed - and that is the hardest thing
of all to judge.
Eye and touch are still the best guides but these are skills that require
practice. Moisture guages are available but I have not found them
particularly helpful.
As to what to put in containers, many garden centres and nurseries have
excellent display areas with frequently changing container plantings and
much can be learnt from them.
An excellent book called Container Gardening by Malcolm Hillier, published
by Dorling Kindersley, at Pounds 14.99, is worth obtaining.
It could prove very valuable to inexperienced gardeners not only for its
sensible text but also for its many excellent colour pictures.
They show a great variety of containers, both conventional and
unconventional, ways of using them and of associating plants in them.
At the moment terracotta appears to be the most favoured material for
containers. Even my local petrol station maintains an excellent selection of
them and, because of its porocity, it is a material that plants like.
Terracotta is only the up-market name for what in humbler circumstances is
just a clay pot - and most old gardeners still maintain that plants feel
more at home in clay than in plastic because clay breathes and also allows
movement of water.
When plants are to be changed frequently I would always prefer peat-based
composts which are clean and easy to handle.
For more permanent planting there is a good case to be made for
old-fashioned soil-based composts of the John Innes type, but I find that
many of those sold under that name contain too little humus and so get too
impervious to air and water after a few months.
The remedy is to add more peat, leaf mould, old mushroom compost or whatever
is available that will keep the mixture porous for a long time.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Motoring: Is there a cure for this illness? - Stuart
Marshall gets a peculiar complaint every time he drives a hot hatchback . .
.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM suffering from a complaint you will not find in medical books. It comes
on every time I slide behind the wheel of a hot hatchback. I call it
motoring writer's schizophrenia.
It affects many people in my trade. The symptoms begin with exhilaration,
which develops into euphoria, accompanied by sharpened reactions and
heightened self-esteem.
During an attack there may be phases of over-confidence followed by moments
of acute apprehension. Once the attack is over the patient suffers feelings
of guilt.
I have had several of them recently. The first was in France, when Peugeot
let me loose in its new 106 TSi. It is a muscular little beast with a 100
horsepower, 1.4 litre engine under its shoebox-sized bonnet.
Next was in Wales when trying Fiat's 148 horsepower, 2-litre Tipo 16v. Then
I had further attacks when living for a week at a time with the Renault Clio
16v (1.8 litres, 137 bhp) and Ford's latest manifestation of the Escort, the
2-litre, 150 bhp, 16-valve engined RS 2000.
Normally, I am not what you would call a fast driver. I aim to cover the
ground reasonably quickly but above all smoothly, as a chauffeur might when
hurrying with the governor to Heathrow to catch Concorde.
I confess to not taking the 70 mph (113 kph) British motorway limit too
seriously when traffic is light and the road dry. But I think most urban 30
mph (48 kph) and 40 mph (64 kph) limits are about right and 30 mph can be
much too fast when, say, the schools are turning out.
Dammit, I do not even approve of self-styled fast drivers - the kind which
squeak tyres as they leap away from traffic lights, look no further ahead
than the back of the car they are tailgating and rely on heavy braking to
keep them out of trouble.
They drive with all the finesse of a bulldozer uprooting a hedge.
Now, really fast drivers - people I have been privileged to ride with like
former rally ace Erik Carlsson - are another matter.
On the road they do not seem fast but manage to progress incredibly quickly
while making you feel totally safe.
But I am wandering away from my point. Why do hot hatchbacks spark off
attacks of motoring writer's schizophrenia?
Why should they make one drive in a manner that can be hugely enjoyable but
which one knows, deep down, is wrong and out of character?
They are, all of them, attractive cars. Their power is seductive. Driving
them is flatteringly easy because they are instantly responsive. True, the
Clio's clutch was a muscle builder and the non-power steered Peugeot 104
felt a bit heavy to park. The Fiat was a flier on the open road, a gentle
thing in town. I thought the Ford RS 2000 spectacularly good; the best
version of the latest Escort by far.
Maximum speeds are irrelevant nowadays though the slowest of the quartet is
the 118 mph (190 kph) Peugeot 106TSi; all the others are good for 130 mph
(210kph). Standing-start acceleration and pick-up in third or fourth gears
are impressive.
So impressive that the temptation to head the pack is irresistible, even if
it does mean overtaking lines of slower vehicles where it may be safe, but
not always courteous, to do so. Firmed-up suspension and wide, higher
speed-rated tyres encourage fast driving on winding roads. Brakes are
uprated and sometimes have an anti-lock system.
Let me be honest. Exploiting most of a hot hatchback's performance, handling
and roadholding in, say, the Brecon Beacons or the Scottish Highlands is as
exciting as giving a good horse its head across open country. But it
certainly is not legal. Is it responsible? A small, still voice has often
told me afterwards that it is not.
Of course, one does not have to drive a hot hatchback hard enough to offend
the law or antagonise other road users. But if one is not going to make use
of the extra acceleration and higher cornering and braking limits, why have
one at all?
For all their desirability, hot hatchbacks have their downside. They ride
harder and less comfortably than humbler models in the range.
They use more fuel and are more likely to be stolen or at least driven away
and possibly wrecked by those mis-named criminal pests, the joyriders.
The current generation of hot hatchbacks started with the Golf GTi of the
mid-1970s.
But the first off-the-peg small car that could run rings round expensive
sporting machines was the Mini-Cooper 1275 S of 1965 - and it was in a
Mini-Cooper S that I felt the first twinges of the sickness I have suffered
from ever since.
But a cure for motoring writer's schizophrenia may be in sight. The hot
hatchback, like the white rhino, is a threatened species.
Insurance companies hate them, especially when they are owned by the young.
Premiums are now high enough to put ownership beyond the financial reach of
many a covetous under 30-year-old, especially if they have had a couple of
accident claims. Because of this, demand for used ones has fallen away.
They now tend to depreciate at a similar rate to large engined executive
saloons, some of which are worth only 50 per cent of their list price after
one year.
It may be only a matter of time before hardening police and public attitudes
to aggressive driving and flagrant speeding administer a coup de grace.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cuts reflect poor returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER cuts in with-profits life policy bonuses were announced this week,
in the wake of the trend-setting 9 per cent reductions announced by Norwich
Union in December.
The bonus cuts reflect the poor investment returns achieved by life
insurance companies in the late 1980s. The more buoyant stock market
conditions of the early 1980s, and competitive pressures in the life
industry, had previously pushed up bonus rates.
But as Chris Dell, assistant general manager (life) of Clerical Medical
said, 'since 1987 stock markets have been relatively flat and looking ahead,
I have no expectation that, in the short term, it will be possible to match
the investment returns of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The consequence is
a reduction in maturity values for most policies, particularly for shorter
terms.'
Although the traditional structure of annual (reversionary) and maturity
(terminal) bonuses might already seem complicated enough, Clerical Medical
has followed Norwich Union in switching to two kinds of reversionary bonus.
Previously, bonuses were paid as a percentage of the sum assured plus any
attaching bonuses that had already been declared. Now, those elements have
been separated, with the bonus on the sum assured being cut from 5.1 per
cent to 4 per cent, and that on the previous bonuses being increased to 7
per cent.
The effect will be to push the growth in value of the policy towards the
later years. The maturity value of longer term policies also benefits from
the stronger share prices of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
So at Clerical Medical, a male (30 years old at outset) paying premiums of
Pounds 30 a month, will see a January 1992 maturity value on a 10 year
policy of Pounds 7,576, a 5.7 per cent fall from last year. On a 25 year
policy, the drop is just 0.9 per cent (to Pounds 61,283 from Pounds 61,789).
At General Accident, the returns on 20 and 25 year policies are actually
being increased, although cuts are being made on 10 and 15 year policies. A
male, 29 at outset, who paid Pounds 30 a month, will see a maturity value of
Pounds 65,255 on a 25 year policy, up 3.4 per cent on 1991. But the same man
with a 15 year policy will receive just Pounds 17,141, down 2.7 per cent on
last year.
Standing against the trend is Sun Alliance, which is maintaining its bonus
rates this year after making small cuts in both 1988 and 1990.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Recession fails to coolpassion for exotic pets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT even the recession, it seems, can deter the British passion for pets. In
fact, the worse things get the more exotic the pets they want.
News that Ariadne, the poisonous, locust-eating Guatemalan spider was stolen
this week from a London house confirms this growing trend.
Regent's Reptiles, the country's largest supplier of snakes, reptiles and a
range of creepy-crawlies, has found that far from curtailing trade, the
economic gloom has often sent hard-pressed collectors out for more pets to
cheer themselves up.
Mr Steve Parkinson, co-owner of the north London shop, says: 'People
sometimes trade down a bit, but the specialist collectors continue to buy.
They give up something else rather than their hobby.'
The shop can offer up to 3,000 species of the most uncuddly pets imaginable,
ranging from a hissing cockroach at Pounds 5 or a chameleon for Pounds 125
to a golden python for up to Pounds 2,500. The bigger pythons cost between
Pounds 4 and Pounds 5 a week to feed with a couple of rabbits or chickens or
a piglet.
Mr Dan Reynolds of Surrey Water Gardens and Pet Centre near Guildford also
finds that keen pet keepers have not changed their habits because of the
recession, but some big purchases, such as an aviary or water display, have
been postponed.
The scale of the exotic pet trade is impossible to estimate as no accurate
statistics are kept, but it is thought to be growing fast.
At least 180,000 exotic birds a year are imported into the UK, and according
to the RSPCA, the number of small mammals, reptiles and amphibians traded
each year runs into the hundreds of thousands and tropical fish into
millions.
The RSPCA frowns on the keeping of exotic animals as domestic pets. Dr
Arthur Lindley, head of the wildlife departments, says: 'We accept that some
can be kept by the right people in the right conditions, but the problems
associated with wellbeing of exotics are bound to be more than with normal
domestic pets.'
The trade argues there is no problem, provided the pets are sold through
trained dealers who are able to provide after-care service and who vet the
suitability of customers.
One of the problems the pet trade faces is legislation covering dangerous
and exotic animals, which includes a list of protected and rare species
drawn up by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
Anyone wanting to buy a rare animal has to get a licence from a local
authority, but the cost varies enormously. The high cost of the licence also
leads to evasion.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Labour plans radical scheme to regain control of National
Grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party plans sweeping changes to the government's remaining
electricity holdings in order to regain control of the National Grid without
increasing public spending.
In a policy initiative in the run-up to this year's general election, the
party said it was prepared to give up part, or all, of the government's 40
per cent stake in the UK's two non-nuclear electricity generating companies.
The proposals emerged as Labour renewed its attack on electricity
privatisation, claiming that it was 'a legalised racket'. Despite huge
profits, customers had been overcharged and executives were being overpaid.
There was also an absence of real competition, the party said.
Labour is considering giving part or all of the government's remaining
holding in PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators, to the
12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales in return for their
shares in the National Grid.
The combined market capitalisation of the two generators is just over Pounds
4.5bn.
The deal would enable Labour to meet one of its main energy policy
objectives without exposing it to Tory accusations of extravagant spending
pledges. Labour has promised to renationalise the National Grid 'in order
that government can play the necessary strategic role in the industry'.
Labour is committed to paying a 'fair market price' for any equity or other
ownership rights it might wish to acquire 'in the public interest' in any of
the privatised utilities.
The deal would also forge a financial link between the electricity
distributors and the generators. The party argues that such vertical
integration would promote energy conservation. Under the current structure,
distributors are building power plants to compete with the generators. The
proposed swap is one of a number of options under consideration. Another
would be to exchange some of the Pounds 2.8bn debt owed to the government by
the regional electricity companies for sufficient equity in the National
Grid to reassert state control.
The proposals were greeted with incredulity by many in the electricity
industry. 'I don't want shares in the generators: I want to see them broken
up,' said one chairman of a regional electricity company.
Labour's initiative is also tied to its commitments to the coal industry.
The generators must renegotiate their contracts with British Coal by 1993
and Labour is keen to secure a market for domestic coal which costs more
than imports.
If elected, the party has said that it would immediately designate all major
utilities as 'public interest companies' and establish a regulatory
commission for each industry, with more powers than the current regulatory
bodies.
Meanwhile, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, yesterday projected
that the combined annual profits of the 16 electricity companies - including
the two generators, the National Grid and Nuclear Electric - would total
more than Pounds 3.4bn in the current financial year.
The 12 regional electricity companies were 'coining it' at the expense of
captive customers, he said, noting that poorer parts of the country tended
to have the highest unit charges.
Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, said the Labour attack was 'invalid'. He
said prices were controlled by a regulator and higher profits were due to
increased efficiency.
'Domestic electricity prices - after adjusting for inflation - have remained
about the same over the last five years and have fallen by 2 per cent over
the last seven,' he said.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Palestinian negotiators angered by expulsions: Israeli
action jeopardises resumption of Middle East peace talks

ANGRY Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories yesterday suspended
plans to travel to Washington for next week's scheduled resumption of Middle
East peace talks in protest over Israel's decision to deport 12 Palestinian
activists.
The US was quick to condemn the Israeli action. 'We have urged Israel at the
highest levels to reconsider and rescind its decision,' said Mr Richard
Boucher, a State Department official. 'We believe deportations are a form of
retaliation and are not a remedy, nor are they a deterrent to violence.'
In Jerusalem, Mr Moshe Arens, the Israeli defence minister, said US pressure
would not persuade Israel to go back on its decision , while Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, the premier, played down criticism of the deportations. 'I think
everyone in the world understands that Israel is doing these things only
when things reach a boiling point,' he said.
In Jerusalem, a meeting of top Palestinian negotiators, led by Mr Faisal
Husseini, stopped short of breaking off the Middle East peace talks, leaving
a final decision to the exiled PLO leadership meeting last night in Tunis.
Mr Ahmed Abdul Rahman, the PLO's chief spokesman, said in Tunis the talks
could be in jeopardy unless the US and UN acted to force Israel to rescind
the deportations. But later Mr Bassam Abu Sharif, an aide to PLO leader
Yassir Arafat, said he believed the Palestinians would finally agree to
attend.
Palestinian delegates at yesterday's meeting in Jerusalem, the principal
Palestinian representatives to the talks, were less sanguine. They said
there was a growing feeling that a recent series of actions by the Israelis,
culminating in the deportations, made their continued participation in the
Mr Sari Nusseibeh, the delegation's chief strategist, said: 'The feeling was
that we can't go on with this decision in the background.' Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian segment of the joint
Jordanian-Palestinian team, said: 'We cannot negotiate while such conditions
prevail.'
The Palestinian delegation desperately wants some early tangible return from
the peace process - such as a freeze on further settlements - to show the
talks are worth pursuing. Two rounds of bilateral talks in Madrid and
Washington have yielded nothing, in Palestinian eyes.
US officials sought yesterday to persuade Palestinians that abandoning the
talks would play into the hands of the hardline Israeli government.
A Palestinian was killed and two Israeli soldiers were wounded in an armed
clash in the occupied West Bank yesterday. The incident came after the
bodies of three suspected Arab informers, apparently killed by Palestinian
militants, were found in the occupied territories.

FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong achieves
another record high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A generally firm day for the region, Hong Kong stood out on interest rate
optimism. Tokyo, Taiwan and New Zealand remained closed.
HONG KONG rose to its fourth consecutive record high, buoyed by hopes of a
reduction in local interest rates. The prime rate, at 8.5 per cent, was
expected to be cut by a half-point at the Hong Kong Association of Banks
meeting later in the day.
The Hang Seng index rose 5.35 to 4,307.13, up 1.7 per cent on the week, in
turnover of just HKDollars 966m against Thursday's HKDollars 1bn. Trading,
already light because of the absence of many fund managers, was further
thinned by anxiety over the US-Sino trade tensions.
Most actively traded were Cheung Kong, unchanged at HKDollars 19.80, HSBC
Holdings, up 25 cents at HKDollars 36.00 and China Light, up 30 cents at
HKDollars 23.50.
SEOUL ended sharply higher on active buying by foreign investors who were
allowed to invest directly in the local market for the first time yesterday.
Foreign investors were estimated to have placed buy orders worth Won100bn,
most of the session's turnover, which totalled Won104.17bn against Won366bn
on December 26, the previous full day's session. The composite index rose
13.31 to 624.23, up 2.2 per cent on the week.
Foreign investor interest focused mainly on smaller-capitalisation issues.
Buying pressure was further concentrated by investment ceilings of not more
than 10 per cent imposed on foreign holdings of South Korean stocks.
Only 780 Korea Mobile Telecommunications shares changed hands before the
issue hit its day limit-up of Won2,500 and activity ceased. It ended at
Won78,900. Similar cases were Lotte Confectionery, up Won1,300 to Won36,900
and Ankuk Fire and Marine Insurance Co, also up Won1,300 at Won39,400.
AUSTRALIA started lower, then rebounded on expectations that the Reserve
Bank will cut cash rates by one percentage point to 7.5 per cent, probably
after a board meeting on Monday. The All Ordinaries index rose 12.0 to
1,659.9, 4.1 per cent higher on the week, in turnover of ADollars 114.2m.
A weaker currency gave resource shares an added lift with the miner CRA
gaining 34 cents or 2.8 per cent to ADollars 12.54. CRA also benefited from
its Hamersley Iron unit which announced a record 50.17m tonnes of iron ore
production for 1991 compared with 43.87m a year earlier.
SINGAPORE closed higher on late bargain hunting in blue chips. The Straits
Times Industrial index closed at 1,480.89, up 1.54 on the day and 0.9 per
cent on the week. Share volume was a moderate 30.73m, nearly half of this
generated in the last hour of trading, against 24.45m on Thursday.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered in the afternoon to close mixed in thin trading. The
composite index ended 0.83 higher at 552.99, fractionally higher on the
week.
MANILA was encouraged by the positive sentiment prevailing at home and on
Wall Street. The composite index rose 4.1 per cent or 48.38 to 1,221.16, the
highest since November 1989 and 6 per cent higher on the week.
BANGKOK saw heavy trade in banking shares. The SET index ended 0.21 lower at
711.81, up 1.3 per cent on the week, supported by the firm banking sector.
Turnover was Bt3.46bn.
Bangkok Bank was the most active stock, ending Bt28 higher at BT468 with
Bt538m worth traded. Robinson, a department store chain which made its debut
yesterday, was the second most active issue with Bt321m changing hands. The
share finished at Bt95.50 against its offer price of Bt50.
BOMBAY broke through 2,000 on the BSE index to a new high of 2,007.22 before
it closed 27.34 higher at 1,996.50.

FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rises to six-week high
in quiet continental trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIAL situations enlivened a quiet Friday on the Continent, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS achieved its best close since mid-November, driven higher by a firm
bond market, Wall Street and demand for Total and Michelin. The CAC-40 index
rose 20.39 or 1.2 per cent to 1,770.30, up 2.9 per cent on the week, in
volume of FFr1.5bn.
Total added FFr48 or 4.8 per cent to FFr1,033 with 175,975 shares traded
following the overnight gains of its ADS's on Wall Street on renewed
optimism about the company's Colombian oil find.
Michelin rose FFr5.20 or 4.3 0 shares traded ahead of Monday's launch of its
'green' tyre at the Detroit motor show. But some analysts dismissed the talk
as 'old hat'.
Paribas, one of the worst performers last year, jumped FFr17.70 or 5.7 per
cent to FFr327.50 as investors picked up cheap stocks.
FRANKFURT ran into profit-taking which left it marginally better on the day,
but 2.6 per cent up on the week measured by both FAZ and DAX indices which
closed up 1.27 at 653.19, and 1.74 at 1,603.62 respectively. Volume was
thin.
Retailers fell on fears of disappointing Christmas sales. Asko dropped
another DM15 to DM610 and Karstadt DM8 to DM630.
In cars, Volkswagen fell DM4 to DM302.60 after its chairman, Mr Carl Hahn,
told a magazine that 1991 production of Golf cars was below capacity.
Porsche recovered DM27 to DM567, supported by a weak D-Mark.
MILAN came off the day's lows on late demand for telecoms. The Comit index
ended 0.38 higher at 507.81, up 2.2 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to
L40bn from Thursday's pathetic L32bn. The bourse will be closed on Monday.
The telecoms sector rose 0.48 per cent on foreign buying, with Sip and Stet
adding L25 to L1,407 and L2,100 respectively.
MADRID bounced on bargain hunting, with banks leading the rise. The general
index closed 4.72 or 2 per cent higher at 243.65, up 2.7 per cent on the
week.
Bilbao Vizcaya rose Pta110 or 4.3 per cent to Pta2,660 and Banco Popular by
Pta430 to Pta10,700. In oils and construction, Repsol gained Pta90 to
Pta2,480 and Asland Pta75 to Pta1,830.
BRUSSELS was upset by a trading error in this week's star performer, the
retailer Delhaize. Delhaize closed down BFr360 at BFr8,550 francs after an
erroneous sell order sent the price plummeting to BFr7,650 at the market's
midsession.
The Bel20 index fell 5.36 to 1,103.10 but was up 1.9 per cent on the week.
OSLO was encouraged by foreign gains and the all-share index rose 8.14 to
427.07 in turnover worth NKr271m.
All important sectors ended higher, and even the depressed banking sector
managed a modest increase.

FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow closes at record high for
sixth day running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

Wall Street
US stock markets, continuing the remarkable rally of the past two weeks,
surged strongly upwards again yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average moving for the first time through the 3,200 barrier in afternoon
trading to close at a record high for the sixth consecutive day, writes
Martin Dickson in New York.
The Dow ended the day at 3,201.48, up 29.07. Trading on the New York Stock
Exchange was heavy, with some 222m shares changing hands, and advancing
shares outnumbered declining ones by 1,074 to 651. The broader Standard &amp;
Poors 500 Index closed at 419.34, up 2.08, while the Nasdaq composite index
of over-the-counter stocks finished at 592.65, up 6.20.
The government bond market saw a continuation of Thursday's sell-off, but
this was attributed mainly to profit-taking rather than a change in the
market's generally bullish mood of the past few weeks.
A 0.6 per cent rise in factory orders in November was brushed aside. The
market was more interested in the release of weekly money supply data,
expected later in the afternoon.
The benchmark long bond was quoted near the close at 106 1/8 , down 1/4 to
yield 7.48, while the 10-year note was quoted at 104 21/32 , down  15/32 ,
to yield 6.83.
On the New York Stock Exchange, stocks dipped at the opening, turned higher,
and retreated again before moving more firmly higher in late morning, with
buyers moving in on each sign of weakness. Traders said the late afternoon
surge through 3,200 was due in part to program trading and short covering,
but was supported by firm institutional buying throughout the day.
The three big US car manufacturers were strong performers, apparently thanks
to a rating upgrade from an analyst at brokers Dean Witter Reynolds. General
Motors, which is rationalising, closed up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 32 1/2 ,
Chrysler was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 13 3/8 , while Ford was up Dollars 1
1/8 at Dollars 30 3/8 .
The rise came in spite of Thursday's announcement that mid-December car
sales slumped to the lowest level in an already poor year. However, some
informal reports from dealers suggest that the Federal Reserve's sharp
December 20 cut in interest rates - the driving force behind the current
stock market rally - may have given a fillip to late December car sales.
IBM closed at Dollars 90 3/8 , up Dollars  1/8 , while General Electric was
at Dollars 76 1/4 , down Dollars  3/8 . American Telephone and Telegraph
closed at Dollars 39 5/8 , up Dollars  3/8 .
Many leading US retailers produced sales figures for the crucial December
period yesterday and Wal-Mart, the fast-expanding Southern group, which
reported a 5 per cent rise on a same-store basis, was one of the day's most
heavily traded stocks. It closed at Dollars 57 3/4 , down Dollars 1 3/8 .
Gap, the fashion clothes retailer, was up Dollars 3 at Dollars 58 3/4 after
reporting a 14 per cent rise in same store sales. Sears dropped Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 38 1/2 after reporting a 1.8 per cent drop in same-store sales.
Canada
TORONTO stocks climbed in light trading. The composite index gained 23.81
points, or 0.68 per cent, to 3,517.47, as winning issues topped losers 348
to 204. The index was up 75.56 points or 2.2 per cent on the week. Volume
grew to 18.664m shares from 11.595m, and trading value was CDollars 222.7m
against CDollars 124.4m.
International Petroleum Corp. reported 'encouraging' oil shows from a well
in Libya in which it has an interest. The stock gained  3/4 to 6 3/4 .

FT  04 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium stocks top 1m tonnes
 -Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM HAS begun the new year by earning the dubious honour of being the
first metal to build up a stockpile of more than 1m tonnes in London Metal
Exchange registered warehouses. The exchange yesterday announced a
21,800-tonne rise that took the total to 1,008,950 tonnes, nearly 700,000
tonnes up from the start of 1991, when stocks were already at a record
level.
The reaching of this unwelcome milestone came as no surprise, however, and,
although the rise was at the upper end of traders' expectations, LME
aluminium prices remained above the life-of-contract lows reached last
month. Dealers explained that the continuing rise in stocks had been largely
discounted in the market.
The cash price closed Dollars 12 down yesterday at Dollars 1,107.50 a tonne,
but that was seen chiefly as a reflection of the firmness of the US dollar,
which reduced the likelihood of consumers coming into the market ahead of
the weekend.
The weaker tone towards the end of the week was in part a reflection of
disappointment at the three months delivery position's earlier failure
decisively to break through resistance at Dollars 1,150 a tonne, although it
did exceed that level briefly on Thursday. The three months price closed
yesterday at Dollars 1,130.50 a tonne, down Dollars 6.75 since Christmas
eve, and dealers said a renewed test of support at Dollars 1,120 a tonne was
likely soon.
In comparison with aluminium's record-breaking level the LME stocks total
for copper - up 4,900 tones yesterday to 332,325 tonnes - looked relatively
modest. But it was the highest since March 1984 and helped to send LME
prices to 7-month lows.
Copper prices had begun the week on the up-beat as the LME caught up with a
rally on the New York market the previous Friday, when the London exchange
was closed, and was further encouraged by interest rate reductions in the US
and Japan. But the more buoyant mood was short-lived and despite a small
rally yesterday the cash position ended at Pounds 1,150.50 a tonne, down
Pounds 4.25 from the Christmas eve level. Dealers said the fall was
influenced by renewed weakness in the New York market, plus options-related
and stop-loss selling.
A recent downtrend in LME zinc stocks was halted yesterday by a 1,850-tonne
rise to 154,050 tonnes. That sparked a sharp price setback and narrowing of
the cash premium over three months metal. The cash price closed at Dollars
1,145 a tonne, down Dollars 26 on the day and Dollars 21.25 on the week,
while the three months price was down Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 5.75
on the week at Dollars 1,105.50 a tonne.
The upturn in stocks, after a fall of about 13,000 tonnes during December,
tended to support traders' suggestions after the announcement on Tuesday of
a 4,600-tonne rise that represented the tail end of a large merchant
shipment of Peruvian metal to the US.
Tin is the only LME metal whose stocks are not at a historically high level,
but that seems to be doing little for sentiment. Dealers ignored a 25-tonne
stocks fall yesterday and after another failure to hold above the Dollars
5,650-a-tonne level the three months position fell Dollars 80 to close at
Dollars 5,567.50 a tonne, Dollars 60 below the pre-Christmas quotation.
At the London bullion market silver prices staged quite a strong technical
rally but stopped just short of the psychologically-important 400 US
cents-a-troy ounce level. The cash price ended the week 11.50 cents up at
399.50 cents an ounce.
The platinum price began the week with a sharp fall in thin trading to reach
the lowest level for six years at Monday's morning fixing. But by yesterday
afternoon's fixing it had recovered to Dollars 337 a troy ounce, up Dollars
2.35 on balance.
The gold price moved in a narrow range meanwhile, ending Dollars 1.20 down
on the week at Dollars 352.15 an ounce.
Investment fund selling put cocoa and robusta coffee prices under pressure
at the London Futures and Options Exchange, although there were no
fundamental developments to explain the falls.
The May delivery cocoa price steadied somewhat yesterday, ending down Pounds
1 on the day and Pounds 32 on the week at Pounds 758 a tonne, and March
robusta rallied to close at Pounds 526 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on the day but
still Pounds 26 down on the week.
In New York demand was stronger for the milder arabica coffee variety and in
late trading yesterday the May futures position was quoted at 81.70 cents a
lb, up 1.8 cents from the earlier in the week.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Appointments: ECGD to maintain service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's exporters can relax. The government has decided to appoint a
department of trade and industry veteran - 51-year-old Brian Willott -
rather than a hachetman from Her Majesty's Treasury as the next chief
executive of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
Willott, currently head of financial services division at the DTI, takes
over on January 13, replacing Malcolm Stephens who resigned in December 1991
to become chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce.
Willott joined the Board of Trade in 1967, after doing research at Cambridge
and the University of Maryland on low temperature physics. After a number of
posts, he joined the Treasury for a brief spell before returning to the DTI.
From 1981 to 1984 he was chief executive of the British Technology Group,
and from 1984 to 1987 head of the DTI's information technology division.
Most recently Willott has been involved in advising the government on EC
investment services and the introduction of Taurus, which is designed to
remove the paper from securities trading. In recent months the short-term
insurance arm of ECGD - accounting for roughly 40 per cent of ECGD's
workforce - has been sold to the Dutch, and Willott is conscious that he is
joining an organisation where morale is low.
'In today's uncertain world, I know that project exporters will continue to
look to us to provide the vital support they need to achieve export
success,' says Willott. 'I shall do my very best to ensure that ECGD
continues to provide an effective service to industry.' He says that
previous posts, such as at BTG, have given him plenty of experience of
high-risk jobs.
Another Rutlish grammar schoolboy makes good. Michael Doerr is to take over
as group managing director of Friends Provident, one of Britain's top three
mutual life insurers.
The 56-year-old Doerr, who went to the same school as prime minister John
Major and qualified as a fellow of the institute of actuaries in 1954, will
succeed the 60-year-old Fred Cotton, in charge for the past 11 years.
Cotton, who will step down as an executive after the annual meeting on May
27, will remain on the board and will play a representative role in
developing Friends Provident's Eureko partnership.
Doerr takes the helm at a particularly difficult time in the history of the
159-year-old company. In terms of the introduction of new computer
technology and investment performance, Friends Provident compares well with
its peers. With over Pounds 8bn of funds under management and close to
Pounds 1bn a year of premium income it is one of the fastest growing and
most successful life insurers. However, it is having to sever its ties with
Abbey National following the latter's takeover of Scottish Mutual, a smaller
and less successful insurer.
Doerr says that the loss of the Abbey business is 'not a catastrophe' and he
believes that the the combination of new distribution channels plus his
firm's European partnership will make good any business shortfall.

FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution on Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAUTIOUS line adopted by the company's own broker, Hoare Govett, together
with some sizeable and determined selling by a number of the big US
investment houses, left British Gas the worst performer in the Footsie. Gas
shares dropped almost 5 per cent, closing 13 lower at 252p with turnover
approaching the 10m-mark.
Dealers said Hoare Govett had triggered the slide by telling its clients it
expected British Gas to face an investigation by the UK Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (MMC). Also upsetting the shares were suggestions -
denied by Hoare Govett - that the broker had been selling stock on behalf of
British Gas employees. The continuing mild weather in the UK, which has
brought worries of impending profits downgrades for 1992, was another factor
depressing the shares.
Hoare Govett said it had been expressing caution after the recent strong
rise in Gas shares, 'given the distinct possibility of an MMC reference in
the light of the stance adopted by Ofgas, the industry regulator.' British
Gas and Ofgas have been at loggerheads since the regulator insisted on a
series of measures to encourage competition in UK gas markets.
Wellcome setback
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome lost some of its recent hefty gains after
doubts surfaced over the success of a new anti-AIDS drug cocktail. The
shares rose to a new high in early trading but fell back after a newspaper
report suggested tests on the new mixture were halted because they had
failed. The shares slipped 34 to 1091p on turnover of 2.6m.
Wellcome sought to minimise the damage caused by the report, stating:
'Failed is the wrong word ..We were looking for one thing and we found
another.'
The mixture combines Wellcome's herpes treatment acyclovir and anti-AIDS
drug Retrovir. Wellcome was testing acyclovir on the CMV (herpes) virus in
AIDS patients but found that a mixture of acyclovir and Retrovir together
had an effect on AIDS itself.
Wertheim Schroder, the US house, said that Retrovir's use in Aids was a
small part of Wellcome and becoming smaller. By 1993 the broker forecasts a
Wellcome share price in excess of Pounds 15 a share.
Sainsbury shock
The food retailing sector saw early gains replaced by hefty losses after J
Sainsbury, the UK's leading supermarket and superstores chain, outlined
details of another bout of price-cutting.
Dealers said the big institutions had recoiled from the prospect of yet more
reductions in profit margins for the supermarket groups.
A wave of selling pressure left Sainsbury shares a net 14 lower at 359p;
earlier in the session the stock touched 375p. Turnover for the day totalled
3.5m shares. Of Sainsbury's main rivals, Tesco, driven up to 236p at the
outset, turned off to close a net 7 down at 225p, after 224p on turnover of
7.4m shares. Argyll, which controls the Safeway chain of supermarkets, fell
away to close 8 lower at 274p, having been as high as 282p. Asda, which many
retailing specialists view as the most vulnerable of the big food stores to
another price-cutting war, settled a penny lower at 32p.
Analysts said the latest outbreak of price-cutting came as no real surprise;
'January usually sees a series of price promotions and until the details of
Sainsbury's move are revealed, such as what lines are being targeted and how
big the price cuts, it's difficult to quantify how damaging this move could
be,' said one. He added that if the marketing promotions involved a large
number of key, staple foods, such as bread and baked beans, 'then it will
obviously have a major impact on profits'.
Last year saw a series of 'mini' price wars, principally triggered by Tesco
and Asda. The supermarkets also have to contend with increased costs caused
by Sunday opening and an attack on UK food retailing by overseas groups such
as Germany's Aldi.
Chemicals group Laporte dipped sharply in a rising market in reaction to
trimmed profit forecasts from broker James Capel, which had previously been
at the high end of analysts' forecasts. Mr David Ingles of Capels said he
had reduced earnings per share estimates for 1991 by 2.5p to 41.4. and for
1992 by 5p to 50p.
The move, made before Christmas but re-iterated by Capel's sales team
yesterday, reflected dull trading towards the end of the year and the
expectation that early 1992 would continue to be difficult. Mr Ingles added
that the stock had become over-valued. The shares fell 17 to 608p with just
under 1m traded.
Kleinwort Benson was said to have been the main force in the retailing
sector after issuing a series of forecast changes. These were said to have
included downgrades for Kingfisher and and WH Smith. The latter, due to
announce interims later this month, dropped 7 to 447p, while Kingfisher
slipped 9 to 464p on heavy turnover of 2.6m.
Dixons, scheduled to report interims on Wednesday, gave back some of their
recent gains, closing 5 off at 204p. Ratners, the troubled jewellery
retailer, dipped 2 more to 22p with a hefty 5.3m shares moving through the
Seaq system. On the plus side Sears rose a further 5 to 97p, reportedly
boosted by a Hoare Govett recommendation while Storehouse added 6 at 97p.
The attack by the Labour Party on the profitability of the regional
electricity companies failed to cause as big damage to the individual
stocks, but damaged the water stocks. There were suggestions, however, that
one of the big integrated securities house was preparing a note suggesting a
switch out of the regional electricity stocks and into the power generators,
National Power, PowerGen, Scottish Hydro and Scottish Power, all of which
showed rises of around 2 during the session.
Water stocks, on the other hand, attracted persistent selling with fund
managers said to be increasingly worried by the prospect of a Labour victory
which could lead to the water companies being renationalised, as Labour has
consistently said it will do if it is elected. South West fell 7 to 307p.
Grand Metropolitan picked up sharply after the wines and spirits group said
it had agreed to purchase the 75 per cent of shares in the Cinzano company
it does not already own. The stock closed 20 higher at 898p.
Other brewers outperformed the market as investors considered that recovery
prospects for the sector look more cheery than in many other areas. Some
traders pointed to a buy note from Daiwa, the Japanese house. Although
Japanese investors were celebrating their new year holiday, the note, which
focused on Grand Met, Guinness, Allied-Lyons and Whitbread, added pressure
to a sector with very few sellers. Guinness rose 23 to 542p on turnover of
3.5m.
ICI was boosted in early trading by a positive report in the British medical
press on one of its drugs used to treat breast cancer patients. However, the
impact of the report, which is said to be the world's largest collaborative
cancer study, faded later as ICI slipped in New York. The shares in London
closed 5 better with 1.8m traded after being up 16 at one stage.
British Aerospace was one of the weakest stocks in the FT-SE 100. The shares
fell 15 to 291p, almost 5 per cent, amid continuing concern about the long
term trend of the dollar and the company's cash position.

FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi hints at interest in
La Cinq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO BERLUSCONI, the controversial Italian media mogul, has indicated
an interest in taking charge of La Cinq, the collapsed French television
station in which he is a major shareholder.
La Cinq, which has for some time been struggling to resolve its financial
problems, on New Year's Eve announced its intention to file for bankruptcy.
Mr Berlusconi, who owns 25 per cent of La Cinq through Fininvest, one of his
holding companies, has been a sizeable shareholder ever since the station's
launch in 1986 as part of the French government's television deregulation
drive.
Initially Mr Berlusconi ran La Cinq together with Mr Jerome Seydoux, the
textile magnate who is a close associate of President Francois Mitterand. Mr
Seydoux was ousted in 1987, after Mr Jacques Chirac's right wing government
came to power, in favour of Mr Robert Hersant, the conservative press baron.
Mr Berlusconi has since taken a back seat. For the past 18 months La Cinq
has been run by Hachette, the media group which also owns 25 per cent of the
station.
Mr Berlusconi is now interested in running La Cinq 'providing conditions are
right', according to Mr Angelo Codignoni, Fininvest's representative in
France. One obstacle would be that Mr Berlusconi holds the maximum stake -
25 per cent - in La Cinq permitted under French law.
Moreover, the French government also imposes strict controls over the
sourcing and content of television programmes. Given that French television
has been structured specifically to prevent a repetition of the Italian
system - where Mr Berlusconi's channels are notorious for showing soft
pornography and pulp programmes - it seems unlikely that the government
would amend its legislation specifically to allow him to play a more active
role in La Cinq.
Mr Jack Lang, French culture minister, has said that 'laws and other
constraints will not be changed to suit the circumstances'.
The Paris commercial court appointed a legal administrator for ailing
private television channel La Cinq, La Cinq's evening news bulletin reported
on Friday, Reuter reports from Paris.
The court gave lawyer Hubert Lafont an initial deadline of three months to
save the channel from going off the air.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robson Rhodes voted out as auditors of J
Foster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBSON RHODES was ousted as auditors to John Foster, the wool and textile
group, at an extraordinary general meeting.
Shareholders voted overwhelmingly to remove the firm in a highly unusual
meeting forced by Robson Rhodes' refusal to resign at the request of the
directors and without the approval of shareholders.
In a circular distributed last month, Mr Victor Watson, chairman, said that
while the last audit had been concluded satisfactorily, the board, which was
revamped about a year ago, wanted a change of accountants.
He recommended that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte be appointed, primarily
because of the depth of resources the firm offered. It also tendered a lower
fee. Coopers is believed to have quoted at about 65 per cent of the Pounds
42,000 charged for the last financial year.
Nineteen of the company's 850 shareholders attended the 20-minute meeting in
Foster's mill at Queensbury, near Bradford. Robson Rhodes was represented by
Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing partner, and Mr Chris Connor, head of the
Leeds office.
Mr Connor said the firm had not been given any substantiated reason why it
should quit. 'We are here on a matter of great principle,' he said.
'Auditors owe their duties to shareholders as a body and are not the casual
appointees of the directors.'
But Mr Graham Creswick, finance director, said: 'We were badly let down by
the 1991 audit. It was very straightforward and perfectly competent, but it
was very quiet. We did not get the benefit we are entitled to expect.'

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet acquires balance of Cinzano for
Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has agreed to
acquire Cinzano, the Italian vermouth and wines company, in which it already
holds a 25 per cent stake.
The outstanding shares will be bought from the Cinzano Merano family, which
has owned the company since 1757, and Ifint, the investment company of the
Agnelli group, in a deal estimated at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m.
Mr George Bull, chairman and chief executive of IDV, GrandMet's drinks
division, said yesterday that the acquisition would greatly strengthen IDV's
distribution network in Europe and South America, as well as adding one of
the world's best-known brands to its portfolio.
Cinzano's relationship with GrandMet companies, such as Gilbey's, dates back
more than 50 years. Closer ties were established in 1985 when GrandMet
bought a 25 per cent shareholding.
Count Francesco Marone Cinzano, who has agreed to retain the post of
non-executive president of the company, said yesterday: 'This latest step in
the integration of the Cinzano network within the IDV structure is aimed at
ensuring the growth and development of the trademark.'
Cinzano has an annual turnover of Dollars 500m (Pounds 274.7m) and trading
profits of Dollars 30m. In addition to worldwide sales of 3.5m cases of
vermouth - wine blended with herbs and spices - it sells about 7m cases of
sparkling wine and other drinks.
Though the gradually declining international vermouth market is dominated by
Martini &amp; Rossi, Cinzano has a 20-25 per cent share of the UK's Pounds 270m
business and is brand leader in Germany, Canada, Japan and Argentina. Its
Bianco brand ranks 8th in the UK's best-selling wines and spirits, and last
year it launched higher-strength premium rosso and dry brands.
In recent years, sales of Cinzano's sparkling wines, notably Asti Spumante
which leads the sector in the German market, have overtaken those of its
vermouth.
Mr Bull said yesterday that the Cinzano brands - which have inspired a novel
and a Hollywood film entitled The Secret of San Vittoria, as well as a
memorable UK advertising campaign featuring Leonard Rossiter and Joan
Collins in the early 1980s - still offered considerable potential for
development.
But from GrandMet's viewpoint, the more important aspect of the deal is the
reinforcement it provides for the international marketing and distribution
of IDV's entire drinks portfolio.
IDV's products - which include such brands as J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff
vodka - have been distributed by Cinzano in Italy, Spain and the
Netherlands; and the two companies, with Remy-Cointreau, have joint ventures
in Germany and Belgium.
Mr Bull said: 'We shall now have more direct control over the marketing and
distribution of our brands in these important markets, especially in Germany
and Italy.'
IDV, which recently acquired Metaxa in Greece and AED in Spain, will now
market and distribute 95 per cent of its brands in Europe through its own
companies.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: US court agrees plans for MCC proceedings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US bankruptcy court last night gave its backing to an agreement which
will harmonise the conflicting laws of the US and the UK in the insolvency
proceedings against Maxwell Communication Corporation.
The agreement was hammered out earlier this week between Price Waterhouse,
the UK administrators of MCC, and Mr Richard Gitlin, the attorney appointed
by the US bankruptcy court as examiner in the MCC case.
Mr Peter Laister, MCC's chairman, surprised the company's bank creditors
last month when he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US,
where most of MCC's assets are located.
Under US bankruptcy law, a company's board usually plays a major role in
attempting to reorganise the business. However, yesterday's move means that
both the US and UK proceedings now recognise that the executive powers of
the MCC directors have been suspended.
The UK High Court approved the agreement on Tuesday and Judge Tima Brozman,
of the US bankruptcy court in New York, added the necessary American
approval last night.
Price Waterhouse said that Mr Laister would remain as chairman of MCC but in
a non-executive capacity. Two directors, Mr Ron Woods and Lord Rippon of
Hexham, had resigned. Mr Basil Brookes, the group's finance director, would
continue to assist the administrators.
Mr Laister said yesterday he wanted to stay at MCC to defend the interests
of the group's pensioners. About Pounds 50m of funds were transferred out of
the MCC pension scheme by Mr Robert Maxwell.
Mr David Shaffer, chairman of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides, MCC's
principle US subsidiaries, would remain in those positions.
The administrators plan to discuss strategy with creditor committees in both
Britain and America. Price Waterhouse said one approach to be explored was
the disposal of peripheral activities coupled with a financial
reconstruction of the remaining core business, which is likely to be centred
on Macmillan and OAG.
The US ruling is provisional and lasts until January 15, a period designed
to give creditors the opportunity to comment on it.
The US order recognises Price Waterhouse as the 'corporate governance' of
MCC, with the US examiner helping in the harmonisation process and
monitoring certain of the administrators' actions which are subject to
approval by US authorities.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ICI expected to benefit from breast cancer
study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries is expected to benefit from the results of a
cancer study to be published today, details of which were revealed
yesterday.
The study carried out by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, concludes that
women with early breast cancer have a better chance of survival if they take
hormonal therapy. One of the main forms of hormonal therapy is an oestrogen
blocking drug called tamoxifen, which is sold by ICI under the brand name
Nolvadex.
Nolvadex, launched in 1973, is the largest selling cancer drug in the world
with a turnover of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. ICI was not prepared
to comment on the study's potential impact on profits. The research involved
750,000 women throughout the world and lasted for five years.
Most UK analysts believed the study would be positive for ICI. Dr Jonathan
Gelles of US securities house Wertheim Schroder said: 'It will clearly
support further growth of this product. I would have thought that they
should be able to increase unit use by between 20 and 25 per cent.'

FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: Shareholders need more information to assess the
value of listed companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BS MCBETH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Deborah Hargreaves ('Evaluating the worth of oil', January 2), shows
the difficulty that investors face in assessing the true value of an oil
company, and prompts the question whether it is time for shareholders to be
given more information in order to make a fair and just assessment of the
value of the companies listed on the stock market.
In assessing the value of an oil company, a discounted cash flow model can
be applied if it has producing crude oil and gas assets.
The problem then becomes the reference price for crude oil and the
escalation factor employed. For example, the projected crude oil price used
by certain models in industry and financial circles in the early 1980s has
factored in a crude oil price for 1992 approaching Dollars 100 per barrel.
Clearly a high crude oil price helps establish a higher present value for an
asset.
The real tricky question comes in assessing those intangible items that are
not in the public or private domain, such as discoveries and the potential
impact such an exploration success will have on the share price. It takes a
considerable amount of time and effort to be certain of the reserves in a
field which, even after it is producing, can be revised upwards or
downwards.
The health warnings that habitually accompany the drilling results of a
successful exploration well should be taken seriously.
There is one area where the Stock Exchange, however, could add to the dearth
of impartial information on oil companies' assets by insisting that they
publish a table on the present value of their worldwide producing assets. A
standard formula and the same discount factor would be used by each company
so that shareholders would have at least one solid fact on which to build a
general assessment of a company's net worth. The impact of discoveries and
other such matters on a company's net worth would then be left to the
imagination or acumen of the individual.
In the US the Securities and Exchange Commission insists that oil companies
publish a discounted cash flow statement on their producing assets. It is
time the London Stock Exchange introduced such a practice. Dr BS McBeth

FT  04 JAN 92 / A date with the voters: David Butler puts his money on May 7
and a hung parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polling day will provide the only cure for election fever. But when will it
be?
An election can in law take place on any weekday. But since 1935, general
elections have always been on a Thursday. The dissolution of parliament has
to be proclaimed 23 days in advance but, except in February 1974, a week or
two more of notice has been given.
Since parliament has to be dissolved within five years of its first meeting,
the last legal Thursday for the 1992 election falls on July 9. Of the 29
Thursdays between now and then, many are highly inconvenient.
An election before February 15 would be on the old register and would
disfranchise many people. But because of local delays in making the computer
tapes of the new register available to the parties for canvass lists and for
addressing envelopes, an election before early March might be chaotic.
The government probably wants to get a Budget through parliament in early
March, as well as completing the council tax legislation; that would leave
April 2 or, more likely, April 9 as the earliest convenient date.
The Conservatives might be deterred by the fact that there has not been an
April election since 1880 (when Disraeli, deceived by two good by-elections,
dissolved early - and lost). But precedent is no bar.
After April 9 there is Easter (April 19), which blanks out two weeks, and
then the local elections (May 7) cast their shadow. Since in 1992 the
Conservatives are bound to lose many council seats won in the bumper year of
1988, May 7 becomes the only likely date between April 9 and early June: the
general election would mask any local adversities. In 1979 local and general
elections coincided without administrative or political disaster.
If the May 7 date is missed, June 4 and June 11 are left as the only likely
Thursdays before the holiday season and the final buffer of July 9. Since
more Conservatives than Labour supporters go away on holiday it is hard to
imagine Central Office letting Mr Major continue to the bitter end, quite
apart from the mockery such procrastination would provoke.
Ladbrokes, the leading bookies, currently offers 6 to 4 against a May
election and 7 to 4 against April. The IG Futures Index, financial
bookmakers, suggests the City finds the probabilities equal that the
election will occur before the end of April or after.
Both sets of odds seem to underestimate the likelihood of the prime minister
taking the May 7 option.
What will happen? Over the past four months the opinion polls have been
recording Conservative and Labour as neck and neck, at about 40 per cent,
with the Liberal Democrats at about 15 per cent (see table right: 'FT poll
of polls').
The latest Mori poll suggests a move - or a blip - in Labour's favour. But
what is certain is that the ratings will wobble again and again until the
end of the campaign. The volatile electorate may quite well end by giving
either Conservative or Labour the magic 4 per cent lead needed for a clear
majority - 326 seats.
Ladbrokes is offering even odds on a hung parliament; it is also quoting
virtually even odds on the Conservatives or Labour emerging as the larger
party. The more sophisticated IG Futures Index gives these break-even points
 -Conservative 307, Labour 298 and Liberal Democrats 28. (Over the past
three years the IG Index has shown Conservative expectations moving between
295 and 342, Labour between 265 and 307, and Liberal Democrates between 15
and 28.)
The election is plainly wide open. Labour optimists point to the banana
skins ahead for the government - health service misfortunes, poll tax
demands and, above all, the elusive economic recovery. Conservative
optimists point to low inflation, to the Maastricht settlement, to the
doubts over Labour's competence, and (whistling in the dark) to the escape
from recession.
The Liberal Democrats can only trust to revulsion at the yah-boo politics
between the basically consensual big parties and to the ever-greater skills
of the electorate in tactical voting (in 1987, 228 out of the 376 Tory
victors had a Liberal Democrat runner-up).
No one knows how the voters will turn, especially during the hectic days of
the campaign. Party strategists and pundits inevitably look to the past.
Conservatives are prone to rely on Anthony King's evidence that, before
every one of Britain's five post-war changes of government, the party in
power has been consistently behind in the polls.
In the past few months that has not been true for the Conservatives. Labour
points to Peter Kellner's evidence that in every election since 1959 the
governing party has lost ground in the course of the campaign: therefore, if
Labour goes in on level terms next April or May that would offer good hope
of it ending up 4 per cent ahead and in full power.
The evidence of recent elections can be seen in the table bottom left
('Governing party's lead'). Except in 1979 the party that was ahead six
months earlier won. Except in February 1974 the party that was ahead one
month before the election won. The only contest was in 1970 when there was a
really big shift between the main parties in the final month (but in
February 1974 and again in June 1983 the Liberal Alliance vote jumped by 10
per cent during the campaign).
One should always be sceptical of such statistical arguments. Bear in mind
the sophisticated version of Murphy's Law devised by Charles Goodhart, of
the London School of Economics: any government (or opposition) trying to
exploit even the best-established of statistical relationships to control an
economic (or political) variable will come unstuck.
Yet the future can be predicted only if we assume that it will in some
measure resemble the past. Logically any percentage division of the vote
could produce almost any outcome in terms of seats. But, as casino-owners
know, there are regularities about the behaviour of large numbers.
Variations in swing are likely to cancel out, affecting all parties almost
equally. Therefore, the last election may still be a good guide to what will
happen this time.
The Liberal Democrats seem likely, for local reasons, to hold on to almost
all their current 22 seats. It is highly probable that, whether they secure
15 per cent or 25 per cent of the nationwide vote they will not fall below
15 MPs or exceed 30. Working from the 1987 results, it is easy to set out
the likely outcome for any given division of the vote between Conservative
and Labour (see table bottom right: 'Division of vote').
On these figures Labour only secures a clear majority if it is 4 per cent
ahead of the Conservatives. That would require an 8 per cent swing from
1987, which (except for 1945) would be the largest swing in British history.
Of course, such figures can never be an exact guide. The 'Other' total may
be changed by Scottish National party gains. The Liberal Democrats may fare
better or worse for local or national reasons. Any tactical voting may
change the Conservative-Labour relationship. (In the 1970s the rule that had
held good from 1931 to 1970 - a 1 per cent swing means a loss of 18 seats -
went sour. As the table shows, in the 1980s a 1 per cent swing only means
the loss of 10 or so seats).
Labour needs an 8 per cent swing to win - and except in 1945 there has never
been such a swing (the 5.2 per cent swing in 1979 was the largest since the
war). But the Conservatives must keep the swing below 4 per cent to stay in
power. Ladbrokes' even odds on a hung parliament cannot be too bad a bet.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From KEITH BRADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wholeheartedly endorse Samuel Brittan's lament about the poor quality
of service in high street stores. Requirements for competitive success in
the retail sector are changing, with important consequences for corporate
decision-makers. Recent discussions with leading managers in both food and
non-food companies suggest that their strategic thinking is currently a
mixture of old and new. Sites, technology and merchandising are still
considered important. For the future, however, these executives suspect that
the recruitment, training and motivation of people will be increasingly
critical to success. Advantage will lie in human resources, but there is not
a great deal of evidence to suggest that retail managers have the tools
fully to exploit this in a climate of major demographic change, skill
shortages and increased competition.

<TEXT>
Sir, Thank God someone finally put into print what many many others have
felt about the retail standards.
I literally had to hold back from laughing aloud while reading Samuel
Brittan's article. Unfortunately this was a laugh of desperation - agreeing
on the frustrations, but knowing that this will probably never change while
I'm alive (presumably I'll have died while waiting in one queue or
another]).
There are two separate causes of this particularly British problem that I
find hard to fathom:
The complete lack of realisation by the retail sector that a happy and
satisfied customer tends to buy more products and services; and
Members of the British public continue to complain about poor service, not
to the management of the retail business, but to themselves. Then, in an
almost masochistic manner, continue to shop at those same stores where they
are treated so poorly]
The message is 'Don't complain to yourself, but to management and then vote
with your feet]'. If one store treats you poorly, tell the management and
don't shop there again. Find another that does treat customers as they
should - the most important ingredient to any business - and reward that
business with your custom. I realise that this is can be very difficult to
do but it should be attempted at all times, otherwise things will never
change.
As business is really only a reflection of the public's wants and needs, you
will then find that the level of service will increase as retailers realise
that they cannot continue to attract custom with the present state of
appalling service to the British public.

Sir, Not for the first time Samuel Brittan's lack of contact with the real
economy has led him to miss something ('Nightmare on Oxford Street',
December 30). London's Tottenham Court Road is quite different from Oxford
Street, although superficially similar. In all the shops (particularly the
scruffy ones) in the former he will find product expertise and an anxiety to
do business of a kind which is really quite remarkable, served up by people
of a cheerful ethnic mix who would not recognise supply side economics if
they tripped over it.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Old guard moves over: Managers' changing age profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were Mrs Margaret Thatcher's industrial disciples, carrying her message
into the boardrooms and on to the shop floor. They were unforgiving, dynamic
and enterprising, shameless about making money and fiercely proud of
Britain.
They were privateers like Lord King at British Airways who helped to
transfer assets from public to private ownership; predators such as Lord
Hanson and Sir Owen Greene, the chairman of BTR, who built conglomerates by
acquiring and sorting out poorly performing companies; hard men such as Sir
Robert Scholey who turned British Steel's overmanned and bloated plants into
models of efficiency.
With Mrs Thatcher's departure the time is drawing nigh when her industrial
crusaders will follow her from the field of battle. The climate is changing,
as Lord King puts it: 'Business will not be able to let rip in the 1990s as
it did in the 1980s.'
What was once the Thatcherite new guard in British management is turning
into the old guard: Lord King is 74; Sir Robert 70; Lord Hanson and his
partner Lord White were born in 1922 and 1923 and Sir Owen is 66.
Has Thatcherism bequeathed a group of ageing entrepreneurs who will be swept
away by a breed of spritely managers enthused by a very different business
spirit for the 1990s? Mrs Thatcher's own qualities as a leader encouraged a
cult of personality in business. Senior executives were lionised. It is
unsurprising that men such as King and Hanson who have wielded such power
over their baronies should be unwilling to retire.
But these industrial crusaders are a high-profile minority. Apart from the
Thatcherite old guard and a few other notable cases, such as the 73-year-old
Mr Roland 'Tiny' Rowland's long tenure at Lonrho, and Lord Weinstock's
service at the helm of the General Electric Company, there is little
evidence that the British business leadership got significantly older in the
1980s.
In 1989 the average age of the chairmen of the 50 largest British companies
was between 59 and 60, the same as a decade before, according to a survey by
Professor Leslie Hannah, of the London School of Economics' business history
unit.
While the 1980s encouraged a cult of personality at some companies, at
others more formal procedures were introduced for the recruitment and
replacement of chairmen and chief executives.
Perhaps the best example was the smooth succession organised at Courtaulds
by a 55-year-old Sir Christopher Hogg who appointed 39-year-old Mr Martin
Taylor as chief executive of the textiles company and 52-year-old Mr Sipko
Huismanns as chief executive of Courtaulds chemicals interests.
Multinational companies such as Ford, IBM, ICI, Unilever and Shell have long
had promotion policies which have produced chairmen of a similar age - in
their early 50s at IBM and their late 50s at ICI.
The 1980s were also a decade in which some young managers rose to
prominence, such as Mr Peter Bonfield, the chairman and chief executive of
ICL, the computer manufacturer, who at only 47 has spent a decade on the
company's main board. The two most powerful men at BT, the
telecommunications group, Mr Iain Vallance, the chairman, and Mr Barry
Romeril, the finance director, are both 48.
Indeed, a generation gap may be opening at the top of British business. The
chairmen and non-executive directors, who safeguard the shareholders'
interests and are responsible for the strategic direction of companies are
usually in the late 50s or early 60s. Yet operating executives, who run
companies day-to-day, are often in their 40s. At British Steel, for
instance, Sir Robert will be replaced this summer as chairman by the
62-year-old Sir Alistair Frame. But the businesses are run by a group of
40-year-old young turks promoted in the past few years.
This gap may grow. In the face of recession companies have become
increasingly cautious about the selection of chairmen, favouring older, more
experienced people, according to Mr David Kimbell, a headhunter with
recruitment specialists Spencer Stuart. 'It is getting more difficult to
persuade them to look at younger candidates,' he says.
Yet bright young graduates will be attracted into industry only if they are
offered executive responsibility early.
In Mr John Major's cautious, low-growth Britain this new guard of younger
operating executives may develop a quite different outlook from the
Thatcherite old guard. Professional competence and financial prudence may be
more fashionable than deal-making. In the 1980s consumption and debt was all
the rage. In the 1990s investment and innovation may come back into fashion.
An acceptance of Britain's place alongside the social market economies of
Europe may become more common than fierce national pride and a fascination
with the free-market US.
A decade ago it may have been fashionable to be dismissively critical of the
failings of the public sector and favour privatisation as a cure-all. In
this decade governments will want businessmen to bridge the gap between the
public and the private. A role model of Majorite businessmen could be Sir
James Blyth, the 53-year-old chairman of Boots, who used to be in charge of
export sales at the Ministry of Defence and who is helping Mr Major to
implement his Citizen's Charter.
The new generation of managers will need more than just professional skills.
They may also need a different approach to politics.
The Thatcherite old guard was politically devout. The new guard will have to
be pragmatic, able to deal with socialist commissioners in Brussels and
perhaps even a Labour government at home.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Revels for a state without a creed: As Spain gears up for
its 1992 festivities, Peter Bruce examines a country which is having trouble
paying for modernity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is party time in Spain and everyone is invited, which is only fair as
almost everyone is paying for it. Nineteen ninety-two promises to be a
monumental celebration, bringing to a climax the country's first
uninterrupted decade of democratic rule. But it also marks the end of
Spain's most glittering economic successes since the Conquistadores took
South America more than 400 years ago and draws a curtain on its reign as
the Wunderkind of Europe.
Few countries as poor as Spain would consider trying to host the summer
Olympics and a World's Fair in the same year and probably even Spain would
have baulked had it realised the extent of the economic strain involved,
even though EC structural funds have played a key role in the effort.
Somehow, more than Pta1,500bn (Pounds 8.2bn) - a combination of state
spending and European Community financing - has found its way into Spanish
roads, bridges, railways and airports to prepare for the festivities.
But back in the years after the death of the dictator General Franco in
1975, as the world rushed to congratulate Spaniards on their remarkable
transition to democracy, no ambition seemed too grand. The country, once
bitterly divided, had awakened to a promise of something completely new.
Calm. This was briefly interrupted by a coup attempt in 1981, but Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the country's longest-serving elected leader,
still tells visitors what he felt on the night he was first elected in 1982:
'People have not voted for change. They have voted for a rest.'
Spain needed that rest to be able to focus its efforts on becoming an
integrated part of a democratic, open Europe. A country ruled imperiously
from the centre for nearly 40 years by Gen Franco had developed potentially
poisonous regional conflicts, particularly in the Basque country and
Catalonia. Holding Spain together had always been Madrid's big challenge,
leading one of its leading early 20th-century philosophers, Jose Ortega y
Gasset, to proclaim: 'If Spain is the problem, Europe is the solution.'
That lesson has finally been taken aboard - being part of Europe is what
unifies Spain. The sense of being a player on a wider stage has enabled the
country's disparate communities to unite around a common objective rather
than, as in the past, sniping at the government in Madrid. Spain realises
its aspirations can no longer be met in a narrow domestic context, but only
by opening itself to broader influences.
This perception has not stopped Spaniards using democracy as a breathing
space. The government's transformation of a once-closed economy into one of
the world's most open, and the subsequent spurt of foreign investment, has
disguised the extent to which Spaniards have remained themselves.
The good life is being lived to the full: heart disease is growing faster in
Spain than anywhere else in the industrialised west. Recent polls have shown
that despite the growth of Aids and drug abuse in the country, parents still
worry most about their children abandoning Catholicism or having abortions.
Only 5 per cent of Spaniards have bought a book in the past year and more
than 10 per cent of them remain functionally illiterate. They still take
three-hour lunches and smoke in department stores. Yet criticism from abroad
still rankles. This helps explain why 1992 has become, in Spanish eyes, such
a critical year.
For the doubters beyond Spain's borders and those few inside them, it is the
ultimate showcase. Barcelona is a transformed city. Some Pta760bn have been
spent on Olympic facilities and on easily the most ambitious urban renewal
programme in Europe since the reconstruction of Germany after the second
world war. Seville, a lethargic, sun-drenched tourist venue, looks like the
kind of capital that might be built in the jungle by a mad dictator, as
fantastic buildings take shape on the island of Cartuja where the
Guadalquivir river skirts the city. Here the grandly named Universal
Exposition 1992 (Expo) will welcome nearly 20m visitors between April and
October.
They will get there by car on a shiny new network of highways that now
criss-cross the region of Andalucia. Or by air into a Pta9bn airport
terminal that even the government admits will not be used to full capacity
for at least 20 years. Or by rail on a new Pta400bn high-speed train link
with Madrid. So much money has been spent on the rail project that there
will be none left for connecting the country to Europe's high-speed network
until the next century.
New managers at the state railway company, Renfe, admit that, given the
choice now, the line between Seville and Madrid would not have been built
first. It will turn out to be more decorative than practical, an extravagant
gesture to the poverty-stricken south. Jealous of the money being spent on
Seville, and on Barcelona to the north, Madrid was determined not to be left
out of the jollity and has become the Cultural Capital of Europe this year.
Perhaps fortunately for Madrilenos, almost nothing has been done; the city
has not been torn apart by construction works and potholes. Madrid came late
to the trough though, so there is little money for anything except
renovations to the old opera house and some museums, a few big concerts and
exhibitions.
Spanish leaders defend the spending spree in Barcelona and Seville. They
argue that 1992 has been an investment trigger for pouring cash into
regional development that would otherwise never have been undertaken. In the
view of independent critics in Madrid, that makes sense in Barcelona, which
is, anyway, the country's leading industrial centre and desperately needed
an overhaul of its transport infrastructure. But the Pta800bn spent on
Andalucia and Seville is greeted less enthusiastically. The mere existence
of enhanced communications in Andalucia, the critics argue, does not imply
automatic economic transformation after the Expo festivities are over. There
is a serious risk, they say, that the facilities left behind will be
underused because the region has little industrial culture or skills.
A nagging sense persists of, perhaps, having overdone it, which is leading
some Spaniards to caution against expecting too much of 1992. One of the
wisest is Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the country's foreign minister.
'Nineteen ninety-two,' he says with a flick of the wrist, 'it doesn't mean a
thing'.
Nearly three centuries of trying to get Gibraltar back from the British has
made Spanish foreign ministers masters of lowering expectations but even
wily Mr Ordonez is probably too late to save the authorities from the
effects of overselling 1992 as a watershed for the country's development.
'Five years ago,' says Mr Jesus Martinez Vazquez, editor of the leading
national business newspaper, Expansion, '1992 was a sort of horizon we were
all moving towards. Now we are there and we have still not solved our
fundamental problems'.
These remain inflation and unemployment. Four years of a virulent mixture of
high interest rates and tight credit have failed to bring underlying
inflation below 6 per cent. Unemployment still languishes at above 15 per
cent and is likely to get worse as thousands of jobs in the steel and coal
industries of the north are threatened by Community subsidy limits. If the
government is lucky, the economy will grow only 2 per cent this year, less
than half the rate of two years ago.
Time is now very tight. Spaniards will be left to get on with the party  -
the Expo site and its 250 bars and eateries will be closed only from 4am
until 9am for cleaning - while the government struggles to shore up the
economy for a much more sombre 1993 in the hope that nobody notices the
join.
The challenge facing the government is all the more pressing as its
political dominance is under threat at the next general election, which has
to be held by October 1993. The ruling Socialists now have just half the
seats in the Cortes (parliament) and must fight at the polls while at the
same time trying to impose on Spain the harsh array of commitments made to
their European partners at the Maastricht summit.
They are broadly committed to taking the peseta into the narrow band of the
ERM in the next two years. This would entail restricting exchange rate
fluctuations from 6 per cent to 2.25 per cent and would thus severely limit
the extent to which Spanish interest rates can be used as a tool of economic
management. Interest rates would have to fall with narrow band entry, and
the only way to do this without recharging inflation is to cut public
spending.
Until now, the Socialists have tried to resolve the conflict between
budgetary discipline and spending by curbing consumer appetites. This,
however, has only served to underline the fact that the state, as the
biggest spender and employer, is itself the root cause of the inflationary
malaise. If economic convergence with the rest of the Community is to be
achieved and high public spending is to continue, someone else will have to
pay for the roads. Hence Spain's insistence at Maastricht that the method of
financing infrastructure projects with EC funds be changed. At present it is
done on a 50-50 basis, with Spain matching EC funding. But it wants to pay
less and the EC to pay more.
Wrangling with the Community over money is a far cry from the expansive and
exciting concerns of a decade ago and this year thus also probably marks
Spain's coming of age, when the choices it has to make become more mundane
and, perhaps, more mature. It is no longer a matter of how rich the country
wants to be, but how poor it can bear to be.
The absence of political mechanisms to make such choices less chaotic is not
all the government's fault. But when Spaniards finally realise that the
party is over, that they have not yet built a truly competitive
industrialised country, selling the message will be tough. Spain's system of
proportional representation is one of the most rigid in Europe. As a result
parliamentary debate is practically non-existent, attendance is low and
voters pay little attention to the deliberations of the Cortes.
They do, however, pay attention to the government and feel free to criticise
it in a way that would have been unthinkable 16 years ago. It is this
liberal rule - Mr Gonzalez calls it catharsis - that may prove just as
dangerous as an economic crunch. One of its side-effects has been to do
allow widespread corruption in public life to come to the surface.
The prime minister never tires of saying that he will leave office a
relatively poor man, and most people believe him. But he misses the point.
Corruption and influence trafficking around the government seem endless. The
deputy prime minister was forced to resign last year after it became clear
he had lent a government office in Seville to a businessman brother who then
used his connection to win himself several business deals. A few months
later, it emerged that two bogus consulting firms run by senior Socialist
party officials had been taking million-dollar 'fees' from big industry for
their services. The money appeared to have been going into party coffers.
Corruption has induced a weariness in many Spaniards, especially those who
failed to become rich in the boom years between 1986 and 1989. Even in Spain
it is hard to get very rich very quickly and legally.
Spain enters 1992 still a country without a creed. It is richer and
outwardly more contented than it has been for much of this century, and the
onset of harder economic times has taken the edge off the selfish, uncaring
side of the country that briefly emerged after 1986. But it leaves Spaniards
wondering what happens now, with nobody prepared to tell them how bad it
could get.

FT  04 JAN 92 / When an ice-green Rolls is just a memory: One man's
recession - Ted Bryant's business boomed in the 1980s but collapsed in 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TED BRYANT is not alone in hoping the economy will be better this year. Like
thousands of other financial services salesmen in the south-east of England,
he lived a high life in the 1980s and then lost it all.
He went from a Pounds 285,000 house in Camberley, an ice-green Rolls-Royce
Silver Spirit and holidays in Mauritius to a bungalow in Halberton, Devon.
Now he drives a second-hand Bedford Rascal van. 'I had 17 suits, 100 shirts,
all bought in the West End, and lunch at Langan's in Piccadilly. I saw Joan
Collins there once,' he says.
Today the Bryants watch television, eat Chinese takeaways and sing Neil
Sedaka hits on the karaoke to keep their spirits up. Their children zoom
around on mountain bikes and swap shell-suits.
Ted, 47, spends his days ferrying his three stepchildren - Stephanie, 16,
Melanie, 14 and Kristopher, 12 - along muddy lanes to school, club and the
nearest McDonald's. They are rosy-cheeked testimony to the benefits of
fishing, country air and bops at the local youth centre.
His third wife, Laura, 10 years younger than him, goes daily to a factory in
Tiverton to stick labels on bottles of Liberty and Floris scents and creams.
'The Pethers', a tiny three-bedroomed structure set in the rolling green
hills of the Devon countryside, is a cosy nest with the central heating on
full. The stone-cladded kitchen has a Raeburn stove and television blazing
continuously in opposite corners.
Ted's experience is both a parable of the recession and the tale of an
imprudent businessman who over-extended himself, got caught out and crashed.
There are thousands of Teds in the south of England. They enjoyed easy money
during the 1980s when their financial service companies expanded recklessly.
But competition eroded profits and then the markets they served contracted.
Having lost their jobs, the Teds' chances of re-employment in comparable
positions are slim. They are the steelworkers of this recession.
Everything in Ted's life has changed since his business went under at the
end of 1990. His circumstances will strike a chord with other recession
victims, even those for whom the details are different.
A bulky man in his blouson jacket, with the restless hands of an ex-smoker,
Ted may seem an unlikely symbol of the recession. But this new year, Ted has
been unemployed for exactly 12 months.
'It's been a horrendous year,' he says. Laura lights up a cigarette and
smiles reassuringly as Ted relates how the family has had to live on her
wages for the year he has been out of work.
A neighbouring sister has lent them some money, but Ted is already two
months behind with the rent. He has worked for five weeks since he went
bankrupt - at Blundell's School, as an electrician - but only claimed
unemployment benefit during the summer. 'People get too complacent if they
go on too long,' he says.
Slow to point the finger of blame at himself, he singles out two culprits
for his business nemesis:
'First and foremost, it was recession, the lack of business, that presented
the main problem. Then it was the bank. They pulled the rug from underneath
us,' he says.
Ted, who has sold mortgages, insurance and pensions since 1979, admits to
overborrowing in the late 1980s, just before the rise in interest rates to
15 per cent put the lid on the housing market.
His next mistake was shared by the government, the Treasury, and almost all
professional economists. He failed to foresee that this recession, unlike
the one in the mid-1970s, was going to be so deep and last so long.
He opened a new Camberley branch of his company, Surrey and Hants Financial
Services, at just the wrong time. He had an overdraft limit of Pounds
100,000, but ran it up to Pounds 220,000. Then the bank got 'cold feet'
about financing him further.
'Recessions have never gone on like this. Let's face it, this is absolutely
diabolical,' he says.
May 25 1990 was the beginning of the end. That day Ted threw a party,
attended by Jim Bowen, host of TV's Bullseye darts quiz show, to celebrate
the opening of the new branch of the company he started in 1988 and spent
Pounds 45,000 advertising in 1989.
The branch was tied to Colonial Mutual, a life assurance company, which had
agreed to clear S&amp;H's overdraft with the National Westminster Bank.
The bank manager had been enthusiastic. He agreed that the overdraft should
be cleared, and also agreed to give Ted a working overdraft of Pounds 50,000
to trade with and start afresh.
S&amp;H was, Ted says, 'sizeable in Surrey,' and the new branch was a part of
his ambition to 'to become a household name in the Camberley-Woking area'.
The idea was that as soon as the mortgage market, increasingly pinched since
1988, turned round 'there we would be, waiting in the wings.'
But they were not. First the office was three months late in opening, and
then there was no turnround. 'When interest rates go sky-high the first
thing that gets hit in the following recession is the property market and
the mortgage market gets hit the same day.'
But that was not all. The week he paid in the last cheque to clear the
Pounds 220,000 overdraft, he was splitting up with his wife Sharna, a
director of Surrey and Hants.
'I had booked into the Grand Hotel, Jersey, for the weekend. I went with
Laura. Came back on the Tuesday. From the airport I telephoned the office to
find we had all sorts of problems and the bank had returned four cheques.'
The bank had happened to cut off his credit on the same day he left his
wife. 'It was incredible - as if they had timed it,' he recalls.
Ted called the bank manager from his carphone. He knew the mortgage business
had been very slow, but he thought the pensions and insurance side had been
trading nicely over the summer.
The manager informed him that since the overdraft had been cleared, the
regional office had decided to withdraw the Pounds 50,000 trading facility
the company had already partly spent.
'You can imagine what that did to us. You can't have cheques bouncing in the
financial services industry,' he said.
The sales force of 25 left within a week, his wife resigned at Christmas,
and the company went into liquidation at the beginning of last year.
NatWest, which would not breach banking confidentiality without
authorisation from all individuals concerned, merely said it could 'confirm
that Mr Bryant was declared a bankrupt on April 2, 1991.'
Ted had secured his borrowings against their house where he and his wife had
lived what he describes as 'the high life'. With no money coming in it was
impossible to keep up the mortgage payments of Pounds 2,000 a month.
In July last year the house was repossessed by the building society. Ted,
now divorced from Sharna, moved down to Devon with Laura and her three
children to start a new life.
Sitting in the lounge, he hands over a snap of the Rolls. His initials are
on the number plate. The car also went to pay his creditors. He opens
another album full of shots of a bronzed and jovial Ted at office parties,
laughing with his bank manager and secretaries.
Although the new Devon nest is crammed with the wife, children and pets he
loves, he reels off the material details of the life he has lost.
'I had a very high social life. I went on a cruise in 1990 to Tenerife, and
in '89 I went to Mauritius, Singapore and Thailand in one holiday,' he says.
Their sudden hard times have shaped their views. Laura enjoys her job. Kris
wants to be a policeman because they don't get made redundant. And Ted is
starting a job in January selling record collections round the south-west.
'This'll blow your mind,' he says. He slides open a garage door to reveal an
office, arranged with all the furniture - swivel chair and double-desk -
from the fateful Camberley branch of Surrey and Hants.
'Put it this way, at least I've done it and been there. Don't turn me off
yet because I'll be coming bouncing back, I can assure you.'
The next chapter of Ted's rags-to-riches-to-rags story will not, hopefully,
end in The Pethers. Ted insists the Bryants will have their day again.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Building sector warned of setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSTRUCTION industry faces little prospect of recovery before the
mid-1990s because of oversupply and depressed rental demand, the Building
Employers Confederation warned yesterday.
In a gloomy new year message Mr John Smith, the confederation's chairman,
said there was also no real prospect of the construction industry emerging
this year from recession, whatever the prospects in the wider UK economy.
Mr Smith said the confederation's last state-of-trade inquiry pointed to a
fall of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent in construction output in 1991. A
fall of at least half that amount is likely this year, even with the limited
growth expected in some sectors of the industry in the second half of the
year.
This forecast matches closely the official assessment last month from the
National Economic Development Council. Its construction industry sector
group said output was likely to have fallen 9.5 per cent in 1991, with a
further decline of about half that in 1992.
The confederation says the most recent output figures from the Environment
Department, for the third quarter of 1991, confirmed its own inquiry. The 10
per cent decline in output, compared with the third quarter of 1990, was 'an
important statistic that cannot be ignored,' Mr Smith said.
The evidence for Mr Smith's warning about the commercial sector comes from
the sharp third-quarter fall in output - private commercial orders were down
25 per cent from a year earlier. This particularly affects big national
contractors.
Almost two-thirds of people think the economy will not recover until next
year or later, according to a Gallup survey. It found that 40 per cent
believe the recession will last for at least the whole of this year and a
further 22 per cent do not expect an upturn until the end of the year.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Taking a leaf out of Dame Marie's book: The adoption of New
Zealand methods for the teaching of reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST batch of reading tests administered to seven-year-olds in England
and Wales last summer produced dismal results. They showed that 28 per cent
of those tested could not read without help and had difficulty spelling
three-letter words such as car or sun.
Until quite recently such difficulties were not regarded as disastrous. The
received wisdom was that children needed time to develop. In some cases it
was only on arrival at secondary school at age 11 that remedial teaching
would be provided. Valuable years in school were wasted and children
confirmed in a pattern of educational failure.
In New Zealand, by contrast, six-year-olds with below-average reading skills
get intensive help to catch up. The worst readers are withdrawn from class
and coached for half an hour a day for between 12 and 20 weeks by a
specially-trained teacher. Almost all are then returned to normal teaching.
The results have been impressive, with less than 1 per cent of pupils
needing help after 20 weeks. Research shows that the improvement is retained
after three years.
The pioneer in this reading recovery programme is Dame Marie Clay, emeritus
professor of education at Auckland University and former world president of
the International Reading Association. She believes the programme can
eliminate any form of reading difficulty not caused by a physical problem,
and rejects the common assumption that up to 15 per cent of people are
'reading-disabled'.
Her approach has spread to Australia and the US, and has now reached the UK.
The first local education authority to adopt her approach was Surrey County
Council, which sent a teacher to New Zealand for a year's intensive training
in 1989. She trained 19 other teachers and the first children began the
programme last year. There will be 33 trained teachers by the end of this
summer, each working on four children at a time.
Mrs Maria Evans, the school inspector running the Surrey programme, said:
'There is a big spin-off for the schools. Improving children's reading
skills also improves their writing ability, their attentiveness and
comprehension.'
The approach is not cheap. A specialist teacher is attached to a single
school so the children become familiar with him or her. It would cost Surrey
more than Pounds 400,000 a year to introduce the programme in every primary
school in the county.
Seven London boroughs have shown an interest in adopting similar programmes
and Dame Marie is to spend two years training teachers at the University of
London Institute of Education. The funding announced yesterday for further
pilot projects should ensure that she has plenty of recruits for her
courses.

THE PORT of London Police Federation is seeking a judicial review into the

FT  04 JAN 92 / Gold and currency reserves up Dollars 382m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE underlying level of Britain's gold and foreign currency reserves rose by
Dollars 382m (Pounds 212.2m) last month, boosting the government's resources
to defend the pound.
The rise, which was larger than expected, takes into account proceeds of
Dollars 335m from sales to the public of BT shares, and Dollars 100m from
other countries in payments towards the costs of the Gulf war.
It is thought the Bank of England intervened modestly on currency markets in
December to support sterling, spending Dollars 50m from the reserves. More
intervention might become necessary should the pound continue its weak
showing of recent weeks.
The overall level of the reserves, which takes into account areas such as
Treasury bill transactions, rose by Dollars 211m in December, bringing the
total at the end of 1991 to Dollars 44.13bn.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Main oil companies cut price of petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE main oil companies are hitting back at the super-market chains by
slashing petrol prices in a potential price war, Deborah Hargreaves writes.
Shell, Texaco and Mobil followed rival oil companies Esso and BP in cutting
up to 6p from the price of a gallon yesterday.
The cuts follow a sharp decline in the price of oil on world markets - North
Sea crude has slipped by Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 18.50 a barrel in the
past month. But the companies are also trying to win back market share lost
to the aggressive pricing policies of the supermarkets.
Supermarket chains Safeway and J. Sainsbury yesterday matched Tesco's cut of
8p a gallon. Tesco has been the leader in the petrol-price battle and is
offering all fuel at less than Pounds 2 a gallon.
Supermarkets are now offering fuel at 16p less than the main petrol-station
chains. The stores are charging 183.2p a gallon for unleaded fuel and 199.6p
for four-star against oil company prices of 199.6p for unleaded and 216p for
four-star.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Union claims Sunday work pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKET chains and other stores which opened on Sundays before Christmas
are trying to force staff into signing new contracts of employment in order
to avoid paying premium wage rates as Sunday opening becomes permanent,
Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, claimed yesterday.
Usdaw said several large retail employers were trying to follow the example
of Woolworth, where all employees taken on since last April had been put on
contracts which defined Sunday as a normal working day, attracting no
overtime payments.
These workers can get time-and-a-half pay for Sunday if they work 39 hours
during the rest of the week, but Mr Pat Jones, for Usdaw, said that most
workers were women part-timers who would rarely be called on to work a full
week.
Woolworth employees who were with the company before April get double-time
pay for Sundays, irrespective of which other days they work or whether they
work Sundays within a 39-hour week. Mr Jones said this can mean workers
receiving different pay for the same work in the same store.
He added: 'We have evidence that supermarket chains which opened illegally
before Christmas enticed sufficient staff to volunteer by paying double-time
 -over Pounds 30 for five or six hours' work. Now they plan to make Sunday
work compulsory for single-time, or at best time-and-a-half. We fear that
some employers will simply give three months' notice to staff who won't
comply.'
Usdaw is particularly angry because retailers who have given evidence to
past parliamentary committees on Sunday opening claimed then that premium
payments would make Sunday trading very attractive to staff. Premium
payments are also part of a 'Shopworkers Charter' drawn up by the Shopping
Hours Reform Council, a pro-Sunday trading pressure group in which
Kingfisher, Woolworth's owner, is prominent.
Mr Jones said the union would name the retailers concerned on Wednesday,
when store employees would give accounts of what their employers had
proposed to them.
'The extra trade which even the more successful Sunday openers did over
Christmas and the new year has not been sufficiently profitable to cover
seven-day working with double-time, so now they want to cut Sunday rates.
Without paying double-time, they won't get enough volunteers, apart from
casual staff,' he added.
Usdaw admits some difficulty in organising retail employees, partly because
of the increasing number of part-time women joining the workforce.
Recession and joblessness are also on the employer's side, since many
employees reason that any job is better than none. Even a place with a
strong trade union tradition such as Merseyside may put jobs before
industrial action.
The busy Crosby branch of J. Sainsbury, for example, has advertised no local
vacancies on its in-store noticeboard for months, with only the company's
graduate training scheme seeking recruits.

FT  04 JAN 92 / J. Sainsbury to discount foods by up to a third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED price skirmishing is set to break out in the food retailing sector
as J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery chain, revealed yesterday it would
be launching an aggressive price promotion campaign on Monday.
Although it will not release details of the price-cuts until tomorrow, the
company said it would be discounting some items by up to one-third.
The offer will run throughout this month in J. Sainsbury's 310 supermarkets
and its nine Savacentre hypermarkets. The offer will be in addition to the
normal price promotions the company has on 1,000 of its 17,000 lines every
week.
The move raises the spectre of a full-scale price war in the grocery trade,
although some analysts dismissed that possibility.
'It's media-manipulation time again,' said Mr Philip Dorgan, food retailing
analyst at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. 'It is not in Sainsbury's
interests to start a price war, but it is in its interests to be seen to be
price-competitive.'
Mr Dorgan added that J. Sainsbury might be trying to capitalise on the
favourable publicity it received in a recent survey by Which? magazine,
which named it Britain's 'favourite supermarket'.
Other grocery chains have adopted a more aggressive approach to pricing in
recent months. In August, Tesco ran a much-publicised 'Why Pay More?'
campaign. At the end of last year, Gateway set up 15 discount superstores
under the Food Giant banner.
Although J. Sainsbury traditionally runs a price campaign at this time of
year, the cuts are expected to be deeper than usual.
The move seems to be a change of tactic by J. Sainsbury. It has long argued
that it does not need specific price campaigns because it is engaged in a
permanent state of price promotion.
At the time of the group's annual results presentation in November, Lord
Sainsbury, chairman, said: 'I believe we are in a highly competitive trade
and in that sense we are in one long price war.'
The move unsettled the City, which marked J. Sainsbury shares down 14p to
359p, while shares of the other leading food retailers were also hit. Tesco
fell 7p to 225p, and Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain, dropped 8p
to 274p.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Call to speed up planning decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities were urged to speed up their handling of planning
applications yesterday following evidence that their record continues to
fall well short of the government's target.
The proportion of decisions taken within eight weeks in the April to June
period last year was, at 60 per cent, a significant improvement on the 52
per cent a year earlier, and 48 per cent in the corresponding period of
1989.
However, it remained far below the target set by the government that
authorities should make a decision on 80 per cent of applications within
eight weeks.
The number of planning applications received by authorities between April
and June last year fell by 6 per cent compared with the same period in 1990,
but the number of decisions taken also fell by 11 per cent.
Commenting on the statistics published yesterday, Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, said that he was encouraged by the latest performance figures,
which showed that the trend towards quicker planning decisions was
contin-uing.
'But there remains much room for improvement,' he said.
'There has been a steady and significant fall in the number of planning
applications in recent quarters - the April-June 1991 figure of 137,000
compares with a peak of 178,000 in the January-March quarter of 1989 - but
performance has not improved as much as I would have expected in these
circumstances.
'Moreover, the average of 60 per cent of decisions within eight weeks
conceals a very wide range of performance between the consistently best- and
worst-performing authorities.
'This degree of variation is a cause for concern, especially where local
planning pressures appear similar.'
Mr Yeo urged local authorities to take advantage of the fall in the number
of new applications to speed up their handling of cases, and to ensure that
their management of the development control process was as efficient as
possible.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Art of staying afloat in a cold climate: Assessing the mood
of British boatbuilders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE buy pleasure boats when they are feeling wealthy, says Mr Edwin Paul,
and the British are not feeling particularly wealthy at the moment. 'I
reckon people have got the cash but not the confidence,' he says.
All the same Mr Paul sold five sailing boats on New Year's Day, the first
day of the 1992 London International Boat Show at Earl's Court.
Last September Mr Paul led a management team to buy Westerly Yachts for
Pounds 2.2m after it went into administrative receivership in May last year.
Renamed Westerly Yacht Construction, it will sell 80 boats this year,
compared with its previous annual average of 250.
Doctors are still buying boats, but the owners of cash-strapped small and
medium-size companies are not. Mr Peter Thomas, Westerly's sales director,
says the decline of the building industry probably means the two bricklayers
who bought a yacht two years ago will not be after a bigger boat.
Mr Paul Wagstaff, chief executive of the British Marine Industries
Federation, insists that Westerly going into receivership was not typical.
No more than a handful of the federation's 1,400 member businesses failed
last year, he says.
Mr Wagstaff says a dearth of British buyers resulted in the turnover of the
UK pleasure boat industry falling by up to 20 per cent last year from Pounds
1.36bn in 1990. However, the success of exports, which account for 50 per
cent of revenues, has saved it from the shake-out experienced in other
sectors.
In spite of the UK's decline as a shipbuilding nation, Britain remains
surprisingly successful in the manufacture of pleasure boats and related
equipment. The 650 exhibitors at Earl's Court, many of them UK-based, will
spend the next week showing off everything from navigational aids to
streamlined power boats that look as if they would be more at home in space
than in the water.
Mr Wagstaff says that although the sector employs only 20,000 people, the UK
pleasure boat industry vies with that of France for the title of the biggest
in Europe.
Mr Robert Braithwaite, managing director of Sunseeker International, one of
Europe's biggest manufacturers of power boats, says: 'Well, you've got to
put the hype out, but everyone's suffering. People who are not exporting are
suffering very badly.' Sunseeker has responded to the UK recession by
increasing exports from 95 per cent of production to 99 per cent.
Continental Europe accounts for 60 per cent of Sunseeker's sales, with the
rest divided between North America, the Far East and Japan. 'There's no
market that's booming, but we've been working on Japan for four years.
There's luck in business and the Japanese market suddenly took off for us,'
Mr Braithwaite says.
The company has eight months of orders, compared with the 12 months it
usually achieved before the recession. 'I'm very pleased to have eight
months, I can tell you,' he says.
Some smaller, more specialised UK manufacturers have suffered less in the
recession. Mr Sean McMillan, managing director of Suffolk-based McMillan
Yachts, which makes custom-built wooden boats, expects 1992 to be the first
profitable year since he founded the company five years ago.
Mr McMillan, a fine-arts graduate from Newcastle University, eschews the
industry's move towards computer-aided design, preferring to draw yachts by
hand to meet each customer's individual requirements. The average price of
his yachts is Pounds 100,000, but they can sell for much more than that. At
his Earl's Court stand is a drawing of a 78ft schooner designed for a group
of Swiss businessmen. If the deal comes off, Mr McMillan will sell the boat
for Pounds 1.5m.
He says: 'The recession has affected us only inasmuch as we haven't seen as
many UK purchasers as we would have liked. But we've had a comparatively
easy time because of the overseas market. In our business you're looking for
only half-a-dozen buyers worldwide and they're not difficult to find.'
In spite of the lifeline provided by exports, Mr Wagstaff says the industry
has worked hard over the past decade to market pleasure boating as an
activity which is not confined to the very rich. The cheapest boat on offer
at Earl's Court is a 6ft glass-fibre dinghy which sells for Pounds 169
excluding VAT. There are many other boats on display with price tags in the
hundreds rather than thousands of pounds.
Mr Wagstaff's federation sponsored 16 events in the UK last year at which
beginners were encouraged to try their hands at boating. It has also
launched a subsidiary called Schools Afloat to tell local education
authorities about boating facilities in their area.
The federation has targeted other markets. It makes presentations to
seminars for the newly-retired. It has also advised its members to be on the
look-out for potential customers who have recently inherited money.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Relaxation of employee share option rules urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is coming under growing pressure to relax the conditions on
statutory employee share option schemes (Esops) following the poor take-up
since they were introduced in 1989.
Fewer than a dozen companies have set up the trusts, which buy shares on
behalf of employees, in spite of the tax advantages that have been
introduced to make them more attractive.
Organisations such as the Esops Centre, the information and lobbying group
set up to promote employee share ownership plans, argue that the conditions
associated with the schemes are too onerous.
The centre says that the government should, as a first step, ease the
regulation which requires the schemes to have three employee trustees, and
should also lift the restriction which prevents foreign-owned companies from
setting up schemes. The government, with the strong personal backing of the
prime minister, is keen to promote the financial participation of employees
in companies through share schemes or profit-sharing. It is expected to take
some action on this front in the Budget, as it has done in 11 of the last 12
Budgets.
The government has also welcomed the intervention of the European Commission
which has issued a non-binding recommendation aimed at promoting employee
participation in profits and equity.
The recommendation, part of the social action programme, seeks to promote
best practice in the field. It also proposes setting up a working party to
examine the possibility of an EC-wide scheme.
The Department of Employment, which is inviting responses from business on
the recommendation, would not welcome statutory measures, but says it
'welcomes the European Commission's recognition of the importance of
financial participation'.
The department adds: 'The government considers that the Commission can make
a constructive contribution in this area by disseminating information and
promoting good practice.'

FT  04 JAN 92 / Rise in joblessness for former trainees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of adults out of work three months after taking part in the
government's main training programme continued to increase in 1990-91,
according to internal government figures published by the Unemployment Unit,
an independent research group.
The figure of 58 per cent for those leaving Employment Training was 5
percentage points worse than for the year to July 1990.
ET has been a controversial scheme. The Treasury last year unsuccessfully
sought to cut its budget, justifying the move with its forecast that fewer
than three people out of 10 would find a job after completing the scheme in
1992-93.
Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which now administer the scheme,
are seeking to reform it. Many are trying to relate ET more closely to real
job opportunities. At present the long-term unemployed may achieve training
in skills for which there is no local demand.
According to the ET leavers survey for 1990-91, the proportion out of work
after completing the scheme in the west Midlands and the north of England
rose to more than 60 per cent, and in London unemployment grew from 53 per
cent in June 1990 to 63 per cent in January last year.
According to the figures, the situation was worse in some Tec areas,
including South Thames Tec, which includes Lambeth and Southwark.
The survey also showed marked regional variations in participants working
towards qualifications. In London only 37 per cent of trainees worked
towards a qualification, compared with 47 per cent in the north.
The Department of Employment said rates of employment after ET were affected
by unemployment generally.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Kenneth Grob, man at centre of scandal: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH GROB, one of the main figures in the scandals that hit Lloyd's of
London, the insurance market, in the 1980s has died, aged 70.
Mr Grob was chairman of the Alexander Howden insurance broking group when
millions of pounds of funds were found to be missing after the group was
taken over in 1982 by Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US insurance broker.
The affair was one of the main cases that prompted a reform of the
regulatory environment at Lloyd's.
Mr Grob and his co-defendant Mr Ian Posgate, a Lloyd's underwriter, were
brought to trial in 1989 accused of siphoning off funds to private accounts
through a network of offshore companies. Mr Grob, who faced 16 charges of
theft, and Mr Posgate, were acquitted on all counts at the end of a 15-week
trial. The trial stemmed from the Pounds 150m takeover of Alexander Howden.
A post-acquisition audit revealed the shortfall in assets.
However, a report into the affair by the Department of Trade and Industry
heavily censured Mr Grob for misuse of reinsurance schemes to transfer
money.
Mr Grob was flamboyant as chairman of Alexander Howden, when he would
dispense champagne in silver goblets to visitors, in offices in Leadenhall
Street known as the 'Hanging Gardens of Howden' because of their
extravagance.
He started work in Lloyd's at the age of 16 and spent all his working life
there, except for wartime service in the RAF.

TOTAL NET investments by insurance and pension funds during the third
quarter of 1991 fell by 2 per cent to nearly Pounds 9.4bn compared with the
same period last year, according to Central Statistical Office research
released yesterday.
There was a substantial shift away from short-term investments, and
particularly UK ordinary shares.
The CSO's analysis of a sample of pension funds and companies showed
investments by public and private pension funds were Pounds 3.9bn, while
holdings in long and short-term funds by insurance companies were Pounds
5.4bn. There were substantial declines in holdings of short-term assets,
with a net fall of Pounds 185m in short-term investments by insurance
companies in the three-month period.
Net investment in UK shares by pensions funds fell 53 per cent to Pounds
1.8bn and that by insurance companies fell 57 per cent to Pounds 1bn.
Investment in overseas ordinary shares increased correspondingly during the
period to Pounds 5.2bn for insurance and pension funds.

FT  04 JAN 92 / US to lift Cambodia trade ban: Bush announcement will be
further step to end Vietnam war legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, US Editor and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is expected today to lift the 16-year-old US trade
embargo on Cambodia in recognition of the progress toward peace and free
elections in the country once ravaged by the Khmer Rouge.
The announcement would mark a further step toward laying the legacy of the
Vietnam war to rest, and Mr Bush is expected to unveil it in a speech in
Singapore, the second stop on the president's four-nation Pacific tour.
Mr Bush has made expanded trade with the region his top priority during his
12-day trip, but he arrived in Singapore yesterday prepared to deal mainly
with security issues stemming from the forced US withdrawal from Subic Naval
Base in the Philippines.
Mr Bush is looking to Singapore to help fill the gap, allowing the US to
show its Asian allies that it intends to retain a major military presence in
the region despite the end of the Cold War.
One specific US proposal is to move its Naval Task Force Command
headquarters from Subic Bay in the Philippines, including the relocation of
up to 200 personnel which form the Seventh Fleet's logistical unit.
Mr Bush will raise the issue in talks today with Singaporean President Wee
Kim Wee and Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister. Initial signs are
encouraging that an agreement can be reached, according to a senior US
official.
The official said: 'We're coming here to an end of one age and the beginning
of another in terms of the Cold War. It's important to see Singapore as part
of a network of basing facilities around the Pacific.'
If the two sides reach agreement it would expand their 14-month-old
bilateral pact allowing the US expanded rights to use Singaporean bases. The
US is also expected to approach Malaysia and Thailand to open their ports,
boosting a security network that already includes Japan, South Korea, Guam
and Hawaii.
During his visit, Mr Bush will also meet Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who ruled
Singapore for more than 31 years. Mr Lee, who stepped down in November 1990,
remains the dominant political presence behind the scenes.
On his first stop in Australia this week, Mr Bush was roasted by farmers
complaining about US export subsidies for wheat. But the president, often
sounding like a candidate for re-election rather than a head of state, sided
vigorously with American farmers and lashed out at Japan and the European
Community for protectionism.
Mr Bush is being accompanied on his trip by 21 senior US corporate
executives, including the top three Detroit car manufacturers. He has warned
several times that he expects trade concessions from Japan, raising alarm in
Tokyo where he arrives next week.
The US trade embargo against Cambodia has been in effect since April 1975.
After the UN-sponsored peace accords were signed in Paris in November
between Vietnam and members of rival Cambodian factions, including the Khmer
Rouge, the US sent a special envoy to Phnom Penh to work out peace
arrangements and free elections.
Mr Bush's speech will be watched closely for signs that he may be willing
this year to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. The two former
adversaries have been edging toward normalisation of relations over the past
18 months, a process slowed by US concern over missing servicemen from the
Vietnam war.
Cambodia said yesterday it would free 400 more political prisoners, but the
International Red Cross said Phnom Penh was violating the peace accord by
not freeing all such prisoners, AP adds from Phnom Penh.
Mr Jean-Jacques Fresard, chief Red Cross delegate, said the prisoners were
only a small part of the roughly 2,000 political prisoners and POWs still
being held.

FT  04 JAN 92 / West shelves threat of sanctions against Libya
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON

<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France have shelved plans to seek immediate United
Nations sanctions against Libya for its alleged role in the Lockerbie
bombing, western diplomats said yesterday.
The tactical retreat, led by the US, follows soundings within the 15-member
UN Security Council which revealed that several countries had reservations
about supporting sanctions.
A diplomat involved in the discussions said that no final decisions on
future action had been made, but it was clear that 'sanctions are not going
to move very quickly' within the Security Council.
The US, Britain and France are instead preparing to draw up a resolution
demanding that Libya hand over agents accused of planting bombs on both the
Pan Am flight which exploded over Lockerbie in 1988 and a French UTA
airliner which blew up over Niger the following year.
Drafts circulating at the UN headquarters in New York yesterday reiterated
previous demands for Libya to hand over the suspects, while condemning the
mid-air bombings.
Libya denies any part in the bombings, but has detained the two agents
accused of masterminding the Lockerbie bombing and says it is holding its
own inquiry into the case. It has also invited western judges to Libya for
any trial of the two men.
However, Britain and the US insist that the men be handed over to a
'competent court', either in Scotland or the US.
If Libya fails to comply, the three allies are likely to seek further steps
through the UN, including possible sanctions such as a halt to all
international flights to and from Libya and banning the sale of commercial
aircraft, spare parts and airline-related equipment. Tougher measures such
as a boycott of Libyan oil are possibilities.
Although Britain and the US have refused to rule out possible military
action against Libya over the bombings, a British official yesterday
conceded that the Security Council was unlikely to pass any resolution
advocating force.
British officials were yesterday at pains to play down the thrust of reports
in the Washington Post and reported comments from diplomats in Cairo
suggesting that sanctions against Libya had been ruled out absolutely.
'There is no weakening of resolve on this issue whatsoever,' said one.
'Britain, France and the USA are determined to bring this affair to a
satisfactory conclusion.'

<TEXT>
ITALY ended 1991 with an annualised inflation rate of 6.4 per cent, against
original government projections of 6.2 per cent, according to figures
published yesterday by the national statistics institute, Istat.
This was nearly double the European Community average and compares with the
1990 rate of 6.1 per cent. However, the monthly increase in December of 0.3
per cent was the lowest for the whole year. The government hopes to bring
the level below 5 per cent for the current year.
Last year the biggest increases were in housing, leisure and food items.
Housing recorded the steepest rise, of 7.3 per cent; the smallest increases
were in energy prices (5 per cent) and transport and communications (5.6 per
cent). Energy prices reflected cheaper heating oil, while foodstuffs
increases were in part accounted for by higher cigarette prices.

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, yesterday rallied Serbs from
neighbouring republics in a drive to form a smaller, rump Yugoslavia
dominated by Serbia.
The meeting of Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, which took place
in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, coincided with the
implementation of another ceasefire.
Forged earlier this week by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, the latest
ceasefire is the 15th. Its success is a precondition for the dispatch of UN
peace-keeping troops to Croatia.
Croatia wants the troops in place as soon as possible, preferably before
January 15, when the European Community recognises the independence of those
republics which want it.
With the exception of Serbia and Montenegro, all the republics - Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia - have applied for EC recognition.
Yesterday Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
said the chances for a lasting ceasefire were greater now because of a
'shift in policy from the US following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The
US now recognises that Yugoslavia cannot be held together.'
But he expressed concern that if UN peace-keeping forces were not sent soon
fighting would spread to other parts of the country.
These fears were confirmed during the conference of pro-Yugoslav political
parties in Belgrade, an attempt by Serbia to unite under one roof the
country's Serb communities.
'Let us as soon as possible reconstitute the Yugoslav state community and
form a stable state with organs and institutions which are efficiently going
to protect the interests of all citizens,' Mr Brank Kostic, the vice
president of the Serb-dominated collective presidency, said. The congress,
not attended by Serbia's main opposition parties, is expected to agree on a
draft resolution on establishing a new parliament for a rump Yugoslavia, and
create a framework for establishing its borders.
The EC peace conference on Yugoslavia is to resume on January 9 in Brussels,
the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon.

Moscow and St Petersburg will go to poor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community plans to sell Ecu200m (Pounds 142m) in food aid
directly to Russian shop managers to help Moscow and St Petersburg cope with
a the tough winter and harsh price reforms.
Mr Michael Emerson, the EC ambassador in Moscow, said yesterday that
aircraft, ships and trucks were arriving daily in the two largest Russian
cities with deliveries of meat, milk powder, butter, vegetable oil and baby
food.
But with theft and poor distribution at the Soviet end plaguing previous
deliveries of aid, the EC is deploying a novel system of distribution it
hopes will assist the bold Russian economic reforms.
Coming days after President Boris Yeltsin freed most prices in Russia, the
aid will be sold at special sales to state shop managers, at a price to be
determined by EC experts. The aim of the sales will be to help prevent
speculative excesses in pricing by increasing supply in the face of huge
demand.
The shop managers will in turn be committed to selling the produce at their
shops within a certain period at a price also agreed with the EC.
Proceeds from the sales will go into special bank accounts held by city
authorities to be spent on social welfare for those Russians most in need.
Spot checks would be conducted at the stores, although Mr Emerson admitted
this was no guarantee that food would not be siphoned off into the black
market.
Mr Emerson said the EC was determined to help Russia carry out its economic
reform plan and to ease the hardships of the population in the transition to
a market economy.
The latest batch of aid, which includes 81,000 tonnes of meat and 28,000
tonnes of milk powder, was in response to a plea from Mr Anatoly Sobchak,
mayor of St Petersburg, who said the situation in his city was particularly
acute. But Mr Emerson suggested the aid could be diverted to other cities,
say in the Urals, where shortages are also acute, if needs proved greater
there.
Another Ecu250m of aid is already being distributed directly to families and
pensioners in need by western charities such as the German Red Cross and
Medecins sans Frontieres.
The present aid comes from EC food mountains, but Mr Emerson said east
European countries were welcome to provide up to half the food which Russia
and other republics would buy with EC credits and credit guarantees
totalling Ecu1.75bn. The latter have not been used, and he expects them to
last until the summer.
Tass news agency, meanwhile, reported yesterday that 2.5 tonnes of baby food
gathered by an American peace organisation arrived in Moscow on Thursday and
was delivered to orphanages.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Washington budget battle begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle over the future of the budget agreement that has curbed US
government spending since 1990 opened yesterday as the US Congress returned
to Washington for its first session of 1992.
President George Bush said he saw 'room for some manoeuvring' within the
limits imposed by the budget pact, but wanted to preserve the ceiling on
overall spending.
In Congress, meanwhile, leading Democrats called for an end to the budget
agreement's spending curbs to allow radical measures to stimulate economic
growth.
These opening shots foreshadow a battle in earnest when Mr Bush announces
his plans for an economic growth package on January 28 and in the 1993
budget he is due to propose in February.
In a television interview which was due to be broadcast last night, he said
cuts in defence spending could be used to increase domestic spending or to
reduce the federal budget deficit.
The 1990 budget places separate caps on domestic, defence and foreign
discretionary spending, and forbids any transfer of funds from one category
to another. However, these separate caps are due to expire in the 1994
budget, allowing money to be shifted from defence to domestic spending.
Mr Bush, who is visiting Singapore as part of a 12-day Far East trip, said
he wanted to live within the caps, but there were ways to juggle spending
among the different categories, although this would require new legislation.
While the budget agreement already programmes a 6 per cent reduction in
defence spending to Dollars 295bn (Pounds 162bn) in the 1993 budget, the
administration is now considering cutting Dollars 50bn more from defence
spending in the next five years.
In Congress, meanwhile, Senator Paul Sarbanes, chairman of the joint
economic committee, and Senator Jim Sasser, chairman of the Senate budget
committee, called for a package including federal grants to local government
in order to pull the economy out of recession.
Mr Sasser said that unlike previous recessions, where the government had
provided a fiscal stimulus, this recession was being prolonged by fiscal
contraction at all levels of government which he described as 'de facto
Hooverism'.

FT  04 JAN 92 / US economy faltering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy has entered the new year with most indicators pointing to
continued weakness.
Despite the resurgent stock market, a series of economic statistics this
week has pointed to faltering activity in November and December, and to a
scarcity of confidence that coming months will show any swift upturn.
The Commerce Department yesterday announced a 0.6 per cent increase in US
manufacturers' orders in November, but the rise was slower than in October
and left new orders lower than the level they reached this summer.
The outlook for manufacturing remains clouded with doubt. The National
Association of Purchasing Management, whose monthly survey provides a
measure of prospects for the sector, said on Thursday that its index had
fallen in December to its lowest level since May.
Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM business survey committee and director
of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes, said manufacturers seemed to be
waiting for new orders before expanding production, which would suggest a
continuation of the economic malaise into the first quarter of 1992.
Earlier, the Conference Board, the New York-based business analysis group,
said its index of consumer confidence showed a further drop in December to
remain at the lowest level for a decade, while the Commerce Department said
its index of leading indicators, which combines a number of economic
statistics to provide a composite gauge of the health of the economy, fell
0.3 per cent in November.
The December leading indicators are likely to show an increase because of
the recent sharp rise in share prices, which form part of the index.
Economists cautioned, moreover, that these signals did not show any further
deterioration in the economy beyond the weakness that prompted the Federal
Reserve Board to cut its discount rate by a full percentage point last month
to 3.5 per cent, the lowest since 1964.
'I don't have the sense from recent data that things are getting
dramatically worse. We're in a long, slow, convalescing period unlike any
business cycle of the past,' said Mr Richard Berner, director and economist
at investment bank Salomon Brothers.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Boost for London shares as sterling worries recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices in London last night closed at their highest level since
mid-November, as worries about sterling receded and large investors took an
optimistic view of economic prospects.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 3,200 level
for the first time to close at 3,201.48, a gain of 29.07. It was the sixth
consecutive day the Dow had closed at a record high.
The surge in London shares will have cheered ministers, who in the run-up to
the election will be looking for bullish sentiments from financial markets
to help convince voters that the economy is on the mend.
Helped by the firm opening on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 index of leading
London shares closed up 11.3 at 2,504.1.
The continuation of the rally in London stocks over the past two weeks,
during which the FT-SE index has put on nearly 150 points, was aided by
strong buying pressure from pension funds and other big institutions.
Heartened by forecasts of a large increase in corporate profits this year as
the economy gradually recovers, many large investors bought heavily in
stocks such as brewing, publishing and chemicals.
On currency markets, the pound suffered little selling pressure.
In thin foreign exchange trading, the pound closed last night in London
unchanged against a weak D-Mark at DM2.855, increasing expectations that the
Treasury might be able to ride out the next few weeks without a politically
damaging rise in interest rates. In New York, the pound closed at DM2.8532.
There had been speculation that the government might have to follow the lead
of other members of the European exchange rate mechanism and tighten
borrowing rates to stop the pound falling to its effective ERM floor at
about DM2.84.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Political battle over education intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government and the Labour frontbench rushed out rival plans to improve
reading standards in schools yesterday as the political battle over
education intensified.
Details of Pounds 3m in funding for pilot projects to help poor readers were
released by the government just hours before Labour was due to announce
plans for a Pounds 42m national reading recovery programme.
The renewed interest in education follows the publication last month of the
results of the first nationwide tests of seven-year-olds in England and
Wales, which showed that more than a quarter had difficulty reading.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's education spokesman, blamed 12 years of Conservative
government, while Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, declared war
on 'progressive' teaching methods.
Both parties are endorsing an approach developed in New Zealand by Dame
Marie Clay of Auckland University. Her reading recovery programme gives
intensive one-to-one tuition to six-year-olds who fall behind in reading.
Despite agreement between Mr Clarke and Mr Straw on how to help children
with reading difficulties, any prospect of political accord was lost in
claims from each party that it had adopted the idea first, and that the
other was trying to spoil the initiative.
Mr Straw had planned to set out Labour's proposals for a similar programme
in the UK yesterday, at a fringe meeting at the North of England Conference.
His speech included details of a programme to ensure that every child could
read by the time he or she left primary school.
Mr Straw pledged to spend Pounds 42m on providing teachers and training so
that 10 per cent of six-year-olds could benefit. He contrasted the cost with
the similar amounts spent on the assisted places scheme to send children
from low-income families to independent schools, which Labour says it will
end.
The government, however, acted first, releasing details of Pounds 3m of
grants for reading improvement projects which Mr Tim Eggar, the education
minister, had been due to announce next Wednesday. Rumours that Dame Marie
would be recruited to run the scheme were denied, but she is expected to act
as an adviser during a two-year teaching contract at London University.
Mr Straw accused ministers of a 'panic reaction' in bringing forward the
announcement to coincide with his speech. He added that the Pounds 3m for
the programme - less than the government was spending on the parents'
charter - showed that this was no more than a 'token commitment'.
The growing importance of education in the general election battle will be
highlighted later today, when Mr Clarke announces plans for a radical
shake-up of teacher training.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Maxwell directors told of cash transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-EXECUTIVE directors of Maxwell Communication Corporation were told three
months before his death that Mr Robert Maxwell had transferred Pounds 275m
in cash from the public company to his private interests.
The bulk of transfers took place between March 31 - the end of MCC's
financial year - and July, according to an investigation by Price
Waterhouse, the accountants acting as administrators to MCC under UK
insolvency law.
Mr Peter Laister, chairman of MCC and one of the non-executive directors,
confirmed to the Financial Times yesterday that MCC's finance director, Mr
Basil Brookes, had informed the non-executives of the transfers in August.
Mr Brookes had become alarmed at the size of the debt owed by Mr Maxwell's
private companies and had been monitoring it 'for a few weeks', Mr Laister
said.
A government official with a close knowledge of the inquiry said the Serious
Fraud Office (SFO) would be looking into why the non-executive directors did
not tell MCC's shareholders in the summer about the transfer of funds.
The SFO said yesterday it would be investigating all aspects of the removal
of cash and investments from MCC, as part of its probe into the collapse of
the Maxwell empire.
Mr Laister said he was convinced that none of the non-executives was 'party
to anything associated with wrongdoing'. He believed the same was true of
those executives who were not members of the Maxwell family.
Though much of the loan by MCC was repaid by Mr Maxwell, the transfers have
contributed to a reduction in MCC's net worth of at least Pounds 1bn and
represent a substantial factor in the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Under company law and stock exchange rules, shareholders normally need to be
informed if a public company enters into a financial transaction with one of
its own directors. In some cases, shareholder approval is required.
Mr Laister said he took legal advice from an independent firm of solicitors,
Macfarlanes, when told about the inter-company loan.
'If we had been advised that we needed to make an immediate shareholders'
declaration, we would have done so. We were never advised that,' he said.
The non-executives then obtained letters from Mr Maxwell and his son, Kevin,
saying that the funds were not being used to purchase MCC shares.
It is illegal for a company to facilitate the purchase of its own shares
without obtaining shareholder approval.
Mr Laister said the non-executives had been advised that the priority was to
secure repayment of the funds. They received a commitment from Mr Robert
Maxwell that funds would be repaid.
Mr Laister said they were told in the autumn by Mr Kevin Maxwell that the
amount owed by the private companies had fallen to nothing. In the event,
there was still Pounds 73m outstanding. Including other inter-company debts,
the private companies owed MCC more than Pounds 350m in July.
Price Waterhouse has told banks, owed Pounds 1.3bn, that the pressure put on
Mr Robert Maxwell by the non-executives to repay the loans to MCC may have
led him to extract funds from his public companies' pension funds, and also
secretly to raise money by transferring a 56 per cent shareholding in
Berlitz, the language instruction company, out of MCC's control.
'We may take legal action against the directors,' a banker said. Banks are
also examining whether they have a case against MCC's auditor, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte.
Mr Laister said the question of whether loans from MCC to the private
companies should be disclosed were discussed 'in general terms' with Coopers
before August. However, Coopers said it only became aware of the big loans
in October.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Gunmen open fire on Tbilisi demonstrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TBILISI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MASKED gunmen from a Georgian opposition group opened fire with automatic
rifles on an unarmed crowd demonstrating in support of President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia in Tbilisi yesterday, killing at least two people and wounding
27. Two of the gunmen were captured by demonstrators and one was beaten to
death.
The armed attack triggered fierce fighting in the centre of the capital
after nightfall, and there were fears that Georgia might be edging towards
civil war. At least 73 people have been killed, and about 400 injured, since
the latest round of fighting broke out on December 22.
Earlier, Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has been besieged in a bunker beneath the
Georgian parliament for 13 days by opposition forces denouncing him as a
dictator and demanding his resignation, made repeated broadcasts to the
nation by short-wave radio.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, a nationalist and former anti-Soviet dissident who was
elected as Georgia's leader by a landslide in January last year, called for
a general strike and campaign of civil disobedience against the opposition,
which declared on Thursday that it was seizing power.
Some reports said the president, who has been widely condemned for arrogant
and divisive policies, also appealed to Georgian men aged between 20 and 45
to come to the capital and defend his government.
Mr Gamsakhurdia was yesterday given until midnight last night by opposition
leaders to resign or risk an all-out assault on the government building. But
the president showed no sign of complying with the demand.
Rumours and panic spread through Tbilisi after the shooting outside the
Didube railway station in the city's eastern suburbs.
More than 2,000 demonstrators had been listening to speeches and lighting
candles in tribute to Mr Gamsakhurdia, in defiance of an opposition ban on
public meetings. About 13 men, wearing black masks and armed with
Kalashnikov rifles, arrived in three unmarked vehicles.
The gunmen are believed to have been members of the Mkhedrioni, or Knights
of Georgia, which describes itself as a patriotic group devoted to the
defence of human rights and ethnic minorities, and is one of the largest
groups in the loose opposition alliance.
They first fired a volley of shots into the air, apparently Continued on
Page 22
intending to frighten and disperse the demonstrators. However, when one
section of the crowd started to move towards them, pelting them with rocks,
the gunmen panicked.
One group left by car as another fired a smoke bomb and, when the
demonstrators continued to advance, opened fire into the crowd with their
automatic weapons.
One of the captured gunmen was thrust into the back of a nearby minibus.
However, the crowd continued to hurl stones at him inside the van and
eventually he was dragged out through the broken windows. The incensed mob
then beat him with their bare hands and trampled him underfoot until he was
dead.
A second gunman was severely beaten and carried away by a near-hysterical
crowd chanting the name of the president.
Yesterday's clash demonstrated both the strength of support that still
exists for Mr Gamsakhurdia, and the potential for an escalation of the
fighting that has raged in the city since December 22, when Mr
Gamsakhurdia's forces opened fire on a group of opposition demonstrators.
It was also a severe blow to the credibility of an opposition which claims
to be fighting in the name of democracy.
An opposition military council, headed by Mr Tengiz Kitovani, the commander
of the rebel national guards and a former member of Mr Gamsakhurdia's
government, and Mr Dzhava Iosseliani, leader of the Knights of Georgia,
claims to be in control of the republic.
It has appointed Mr Tengiz Sigua, the former prime minister who resigned
from his post in August to become an opposition leader, as caretaker prime
minister.

FT  04 JAN 92 / With friends like Germans . . .: John Willman finds himself
more and more in tune with Nicholas Ridley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM very fond of Germany, I like a lot of German culture and some of my
best friends are German. But I am beginning to think that Nicholas Ridley
was on to something in his infamous July 1990 interview with The Spectator.
You will recall that he described the European Community as 'a German racket
designed to take over the whole of Europe'.
He rather spoilt his case with some unguarded language, not to mention
strange references to German 'habits'. His blimpish attempt to link modern
German politicians with Hitler's Third Reich was unforgiveable. But Ridley's
description of Germany as the dominant power in the EC is hardly anything
new in the economic sphere.
What has happened since the Bundesbank raised interest rates just before
Christmas is only the latest example of this. Almost every country in the
exchange rate mechanism has followed suit and put up rates - irrespective of
national economic needs.
Most of Europe has accepted an unnecessary deflationary blow because Germany
needed to rein in the spending party after unification.
Even in the UK, the only ERM country to buck the trend, the jury is still
out on whether a rise in interest rates will be necessary.
If British interest rates do rise in the next few weeks, who can doubt that
the decision was taken in Frankfurt rather than Great George Street?
What is new is that this economic dominance is flowing into other fields -
most obviously into foreign policy. A sobering example was provided by
Germany's bulldozer tactics in pressing the EC for early recognition of
Croatia and Slovenia, against the better judgment of most other member
states.
Just days after signing up at Maastricht for European political unity,
Chancellor Kohl described the decision as 'a great victory for German
foreign policy'.
From here, it looks a good deal more like what Ridley described as a 'rushed
take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French
behaving like poodles'.
Then there is the EC's Social Charter, which threatens to impose German
employment costs on other member states.
The argument is that this will level the playing field of the internal
market. But the better the pitch, the more likely it is that the stronger
team will win. The price of joining the German club is agreeing to the
German rules.
Of course, it is hardly surprising that Europe's most populous nation should
seek a political role commensurate with her economic strength.
Two disastrous attempts to establish German hegemony over Europe earlier in
the century by military means failed to win friends and influence people.
This time, power and influence has been won without a single shot being
fired, through the unbeatable combination of a stable currency and a strong
manufacturing base.
The resulting pax germanica is far more attractive than any tinpot empire.
Newly-freed countries from the east queue to join, and the mark is already
the hard currency from the Oder to the Urals.
I suspect that many people in Britain would happily contract out the UK's
economic management to the Bundesbank, especially if they could exchange
their pounds for marks.
Indeed, that is precisely what monetary union is about for most EC countries
 -trading recognition of the predominance of the D-mark for a seat at the
Bundesbank table.
The price of that seat is agreement to German demands for a more unified
political structure which Germany will dominate as the largest and strongest
economy. That is where the furore over the decision to recognise Croatia
begins to ring alarm bells.
A European Union dominated by Germany may be a good place to spend the third
millenium. But old enmities could re-emerge with the 'uppity' Germans
challenged by equally uppity French or Italians. How can such conflicts be
resolved if sovereignty has been ceded to an institution dominated by one
power?
Ridley attracted ridicule for his view that a more unified Europe would make
it harder to preserve a balance between the main continental powers - the
traditional aim of UK foreign policy.
For his pains, he was accused of being a little Englander, dwelling in an
imperial past and unable to come to terms with the new Europe. Yet I find
myself increasingly in tune with his argument, in spite of a fondness for
things German.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I ENJOYED myself on New Year's eve. I took my assistant, Miss Lee, to dinner
at the Moody Mango in Mayfair. Ordinarily, the prices are so steep at the
Moody Mango that I have to wait until I am invited, but the last time I was
there I won a door prize, dinner for two on New Year's eve. So off we went
in the trusty Rover, dressed to kill.
I had toyed with inviting Norman Lamont to join our table. I have been
ruder, for longer, about Norman than almost anyone. Right from the word go]
I thought: something's not right here, it will all end in tears. Which is
why it occured to me, on New Year's eve, that magnanimity would be in order,
especially as Norman and I will be Notting Hill neighbours in 1992, as soon
as he leaves Downing Street.
But then another thought struck me. Would it be fair to invite Norman to the
Moody Mango and ignore the other doomed ministerial souls who appeared in
this column in 1991? John Major? Kenneth Baker? Malcolm Rifkind?
Answer: it would not have been fair, so I did not invite him. But Miss Lee
and I were not short of company at the Moody Mango, for those in attendance
included many of my closest friends, all of whom surfaced in this column
last year.
Miss Lee was at her loveliest. She is a fortysomething Yorkshirewoman, well
to the right of centre, who spends absurd sums on clothes at the dreadful
Harvey Nicks. But that is her only fault. She has poise. She is fragrant.
And she counterbalances my own glum moods and (very minor) pretentiousness.
'Have you made a New Year's resolution?' asked Miss Lee, candlelight dancing
in her blue-green eyes.
'No,' I said, through mouthfuls of pesce ai ferri alla moda dell'Adriatico.
'Too banal by half. I read last weekend that Will Carling's resolution for
1992 was to drink less coffee. What a potato] Who is Will Carling?'
'You know perfectly well, Michael. We're not at home, tonight, to Mr
Silly-Talk.'
Just then, Jack Hillbrooke, Britain's richest bookmaker, crossed the room to
greet us, accompanied by two other dear friends, Sheikh Walli Al-kaljabi and
Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray. All three were sombre.
'Hi there, Jack,' I said. 'And what is your resolution for 1992? To bleed
the last drop of blood from the hapless punters? Or you, Sheikh Walli? To
buy another 1,500 racehorses? Catherine? To change your Korean chauffeurs
even more frequently?'
None of this went down well.
'I am battening the hatches,' said Jack. 'Everywhere I look I see grave
uncertainty. Never before have I stood at the edge of a volcano like 1992.
Survival is the only game in town.' Sheikh Walli said that he was
downscaling his racing empire fast because of less-than-Dollars 18 oil,
while Lady Catherine announced that she was firing staff. 'Cook's gone, and
the assistant gardener. What a dire, dire mess. Is civilisation ending? If
it were not for my chauffeurs I would be utterly bereft.'
The next friend to greet us was Rory d'Avigold-Teaze, the theatrical
impresario, accompanied by Penelope Powdermaker, the hot-shot media
interviewer. Both of those were downcast, as was the trio of image-builders
who came to our table next: Ron Manworthy, sports psychologist, Juliet
Fetherbrayne, London's highest-paid PR, and Micky Muff, founder of the
post-punk school of English cooking.
Micky's restaurant has closed. Juliet's PR consultancy is up to its spangled
neck in debt. Ron's business has evaporated. Rory reckons that only 17 new
Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals can save London's theatreland from doom. And
Penelope Powdermaker said there was no one left to interview. 'No one, that
is, who hasn't been interviewed to death or isn't hideously compromised and
tainted by the foul-ups of the 1980s.'
Just before midnight, Wayne Talent, gaunt, groomed, 28-ish, slipped into the
spare seat at our table. 'Thought I'd never make it. London's jammed, innit?
So what about '92, Mike? You with all your cred. Must have heard sumthin'.'
Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent, the darts-playing west London
racketeer of Martin Amis's novel, London Fields.
'No, Wayne, I haven't. How about yourself?'
'The word on the street,' said Wayne, 'is that everything's breaking up,
it's all crashing down. The universe is dying. So I'm doing a bunk. In five
hours' time I'll be aloft in first-class, winging me way to Sarawak. I'm
going to ground, Mike, as far away from bother as money can get.' And then
he was gone.
It was midnight. I said to Miss Lee: 'Now I know we're in deadly trouble.
Happy New Year, Miss Lee. I think we should ring the airline.'

FT  04 JAN 92 / Dr Criminale, I presume?: The final instalment of Malcolm
Bradbury's new novel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Journalist Francis Jay, who is researching a film with the working title
'Great Thinkers of the Age of Glasnost,' is now posing as a Russian.
Accompanied by the mysterious Hungarian woman Ildiko Hazy, he is still on
the trail of the enigmatic philosopher Dr Bazlo Criminale as he treks from
conference to conference. Their paths finally cross on a Swiss lake steamer,
which is playing host to the exotic delegates of an international congress
on eroticism in photography. Dr Criminale, who is in the company of the
beautiful Miss Belli, is one of the speakers. In this second extract from
Malcolm Bradbury's new novel, Jay enjoys his first real meeting with the
Gatsby-esque Criminale . . .
I WAS beginning to learn quite a good deal about congresses and conferences,
as anyone would whose task was to follow in the footsteps of Doctor Bazlo
Criminale. I had certain half-formed thoughts on the subject which might in
fact have made quite a good paper, if they ever decided to hold a conference
on the topic of conferences (and I have no doubt that sooner or later they
will).
In one sense all congresses are like each other: they all have lapel badges
and briefcases, banquets, trips, announcements, lectures in the congress
hall, intimate liaisons in the bar. In another sense every congress, like
every love affair (and the two are often closely connected), is different.
There is a new mix of people, a new surge of emotion, a new state of the
state of the art, a new set of ideas and chic philosophies, a changed order
of things. There are congresses of pleasure, congresses of reason and
congresses of emotion.
In this simple scale of things, the Lausanne International Congress on
Erotics in Postmodern Photography - which, standing in the entrance of the
ship's saloon, I began, Ildiko beside me, to inspect - was pretty clearly a
congress of art, pleasure, and emotion. The photographers of Lausanne, who
numbered about eighty strong and had come from everywhere, were clearly a
group of ego-fondling extroverts. Writers are sometimes inclined to let
their work do the talking; photographers have to let their talking do the
work.
Yes, they were a flamboyant crowd. One woman was barebreasted. One man wore
a Napoleonic uniform. Many had cross-dressed: several of the men had on what
looked like chiffon bedroom wear, and several of the women were clad in
ties, tweeds or dress shirts and dinner jackets. They had a band on board,
so they began to dance. There was a bar on board, so they began to drink.
There was finer food on board, so they began to snack. There were
celebrities on board, so they started celebrating. There were evidently
illegal substances on board, so they began to dream. There were lips and
breasts and buttocks on board, so they began to neck and fondle and nuzzle
and suck. They were beautiful people, and they knew they were, so they
started to do beautiful and outrageous and infinitely photographable things.
They also photographed themselves doing them, making their circle of
unreality complete.
But amid all this glitzy excitement there was one small pool of calm, sanity
and metaphysical reason. It surrounded, of course, Bazlo Criminale.
We wandered round the ship and at first we could not find him. Then there he
was, sitting at a table in a corner of the rear saloon. He wore a Ralph
Lauren sport shirt under his fine suit, and his hairstyle had been slicked
down in the style of a Thirties seducer. Belli, beside him in her bright
orange dress, chattered, flirted, and constantly touched him on the arm. And
in a crowd of flamboyant celebrities, he seemed somehow to be the true
celebrity, as perhaps the constant flash of cameras insisted. I saw now how
Criminale and People magazine could somehow go together.
But he was still the hardy philosopher. A crowd had gathered round,
listening to what he was saying. I stood on the fringes and caught some of
it. 'I read in the newspaper today a very interesting thing,' he was
remarking. 'Always first in the morning when he wakes he reads the
newspapers,' explained Miss Belli. 'I see the Japanese have now invented a
special new toilet, the Happy Stool,' said Criminale. 'It takes what you
drop in the bowl each morning and at once makes a medical diagnosis of it.'
'Bazlo, caro, you are disgusting,' said Belli. 'In goes your effluent, out
from a slot in the wall comes your health report,' said Criminale ignoring
this. 'Too much vodka last night, sonny, now look what you have done with
your cholesterol. Maybe even a needle comes into your rump and puts the
matter right.'
'Bazlo caro, eat something,' said Miss Belli, pushing forward a tray of
canapes. 'All this blasted lovely food and you don't take any]' 'After I
read this, how can I eat something?' asked Criminale, 'You see what it
means, there is no secret anywhere any more.'
I was still out there on the cold deck, watching the Swiss lights flicker on
the shore, when someone came and leaned on the rail beside me. I turned, and
there was a neat young man with a small beard, with a congress briefcase
tucked under his arm. There then followed a familiar conference ritual,
which resembles that of dogs sniffing each other; I checked his lapel badge,
he checked mine. I saw that he was Hans de Graef, from Ghent, somewhere in
Belgium.
He began addressing me in Russian; I had to explain that since my departure
from wherever I lived I had perfected my English so effectively that I had
now lost touch with my Russian. He seemed, I thought, a little suspicious,
but began talking to me about the day's congress proceedings, especially the
intense discussion of the Feminist Non-Erotic Nude in Scandinavia, which had
provoked such fury right after lunch. I must have acquitted myself quite
well on this, though, because he switched to more general conference gossip,
which provided me with a good deal of useful information.
I shifted the talk, or maybe he did, to Bazlo Criminale. Had he, I enquired,
been a sudden new addition to the congress programme? No, he said, glancing
at me in obvious surprise; he had been in the congress information from the
very beginning. In fact that was why he, de Graef, had chosen himself to
come. He was, after all, the leading thinker in the field. I nodded,
explaining that I myself had been a very late enroller. But his news came as
a considerable surprise. Criminale had not, as I had been supposing,
suddenly descended at whim on the conference, like some god from heaven
deciding to lower his golden car.
It now began to occur to me that, having totally failed to understand
Ildiko, I had also totally failed to understand Bazlo Criminale as well. In
fact from that moment onward, the things I thought I had understood began to
grow ever more obscure.
Just behind the two of us, in the saloon, the band was going through its
eclectic repertoire, which seemed to range from 'Mirabelle, Ma Belle' to the
latest Madonna hits. The decks of the vessel bounced; the erotic
photographers were clearly in the best of spirits. Then, glancing through
the port, I suddenly caught another, momentary glimpse of Bazlo Criminale.
He was twirling and turning in a stiff and stately waltz: rather
surprisingly, since the band was playing something entirely different. I
couldn't from this angle, see his dancing companion, though the dress in his
arms was clearly not the bright orange garb of Miss Belli. And there was a
moment, though it made no sense to me at all, when I actually thought the
partner in his arms was him.
But just then we were both interrupted by a very physical-looking young
Frenchwoman - she was strapping, entirely bald, and wearing what seemed to
be a bathing dress; in fact in every detail except the grease she appeared
indistinguishable from an Olympic swimmer - who came over to us, seized
young de Graef and demanded he come to the dance floor.
He smiled at me apologetically - I rather gathered that this was exactly
what he had come out on to the deck to get away from - and then I was left
alone again, leaning over the rail, seeing the lighted streets and towers of
a reasonably-sized lakeside town come out of the darkness ahead. Then a
moment later, someone else joined me by the rail, puffing somewhat, wiping
his brow with a handkerchief. I turned, and saw, to my complete surprise,
that it was Bazlo Criminale . . .
To this day, I have no idea whether - as we stood there on the cold deck of
the steamer on Lake Geneva, leaning over the side like two passengers on a
transatlantic liner, very probably doomed - Bazlo Criminale recognised me,
or whether I was some obscure grey figure in the darkness to whom he by
chance began to talk. If he had some idea who I was, he certainly showed no
surprise at seeing me there.
Perhaps, given that he lived in the higher realm of thought, to him one
congress was so like another, one congress face so like another, maybe even
one congress lover just like another, and every situation merged into one.
Maybe his reaction was somewhere between the two; he knew me, and he didn't
know me; I was both satisfyingly familiar and totally obscure. He was the
elephant, I was the flea - that very convenient thing, the quiet young man
who was interested in him but in no way represented a rival or a threat. At
any rate, there I was, and he began to talk.
'You don't dance, I see,' he said, wiping his sweating brow. 'Perhaps I
should admit myself I am too old for this kind of thing.' 'Oh, surely,' I
said. 'You know, when I was young, sex was such a wonderful discovery,' he
said. 'My young friend, I will tell you something important, but it will
take you a long time to believe it. When you reach a certain age these
things cease to be a great discovery and turn into a bad habit.'
'Is that possible?' I asked. 'These people there talk all day about the
erotic,' said Criminale, waving his hand back toward the dancing
photographers. 'They are like chefs who spend all their time thinking about
food but have forgotten what it is like to eat it. But believe me, when you
are over fifty, and I am quite a long way past it, sex is like meat, only
worth taking if there is a certain sauce with it.' 'What kind of sauce?' I
asked. 'In my case it is power,' said Criminale. 'The erotic for me has
always something to do with power. A woman to please me must always have a
certain grip on power.'
I found this bewildering. Did the bewitching Miss Belli have a certain grip
on power? She didn't seem the Jackie Kennedy or Joan Collins type to me.
'No, sex is not so amazing,' Criminale went on. 'It is what we confuse
ourselves with on the way to something better. It misdirects us and empties
us. It is our unfortunate necessity, our incontinence, our error, our folly.
Now the women don't want it anyway.' 'That's very depressing,' I said,
thinking that if this was his current state of mind it must be still more
depressing for Miss Belli.
I suppose fame is erotic,' I said. 'But let me warn you, the love life of
celebrities, which fills up all the newspapers, is never quite what it
seems,' said Criminale. 'The image is a deception. The description is
nothing like the reality. Celebrity is a public delusion for which the world
will make you pay. And now where in the world have we got to?'
'Where in the world?' I asked. I thought at first he was posing me some
philosophical question, but he waved his hand grandly at the lake in front
of us. 'Oh, on the lake,' I said, 'I think those lights must be Vevey.' 'Ah,
yes, Vevey,' said Criminale, 'Once the exile home of a very great man.' 'Oh
yes?' I asked. 'Charlie Chaplin,' he said, 'Do you know Adolf Hitler's men
had strict orders that the Fuhrer must never watch his movies, for the fear
that he might think the fool he was watching up there on the screen was
himself?' 'No, I didn't,' I said. 'Those two were born in the same year,
1889, by the way,' he said. 'Think of it, Hitler and Chaplin, the Fascist
and the clown . . . '
And so we stood there, two friendly passenger, our cigar ends glowing,
staring out over the rail as the lights of Vevey and then Montreux slipped
brightly by. 'You know, I like this lake,' he said after a moment. 'Yes it
is very pleasant,' I said. 'The lake of exiles,' said Criminale. 'The people
who loved it most were mostly exiles, like myself. All came looking for what
you can never find. Rousseau came, looking for human innocence. It was not
here. Byron came seeking political liberty. Not here. Eliot came wanting a
relief from the madness of the modern. No good. Nabokov came and thought he
would find Russia again. He found Swiss hotels.' He wasn't the only one, I
thought.
I looked at him sideways. One thing, I realised, was certain: whatever
erotic delights this famous and fortunate man was enjoying - or perhaps not
enjoying - in the warm arms of Miss Belli, they had not diminished by one
jot his teacher's unquenchable desire to instruct and explain. I was full of
questions; I wanted to ask him things, to ask him everything - about his
childhood, his politics, his philosophy, his experience under Karl Marx, his
life, his loves.
But I settled for listening, and why not? That was what you did with Bazlo
Criminale. After all, in the middle of an egotistical world, very short on
dignity (the photographers behind us were now turning the party raucous), he
had the gift for deepening and dignifying any occasion, for adding presence
and value to any thought. I found that I liked the sound of his talking
voice, the slow ironic tone of his ideas. I liked his seriousness, his human
flavour, his sense of history. He came out of confusion, but he brought a
sort of order. At moments like this I knew there was nothing wrong with
Bazlo Criminale . . .
Malcolm Bradbury's new novel, Dr Criminale, will be published by Secker and

FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: Victoriana in the harem - A look at an unfamiliar
period of Iranian art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEHRAN version of high Victoriana is not guaranteed to appeal to purists
who associate Persian art with exquisite good taste. Iran in the 19th
Century, at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (until 26 January but closed on
Mondays; 0865-278000), may well be the first exhibition ever mounted on this
subject in Britain. It is a modest show, with no catalogue and not much in
the way of text, but it is interesting because Qajar period art is so
unfamiliar.
The focus is on secular and not religious objects, and the exhibits are the
kind of decorative pieces that well-to-do merchants of the Qajar period
would have had in their homes; mirror-cases, books, a perfectly splendid cat
made from steel, daggers and enamelled tableware. Qajar connoisseurs (a rare
breed) will find pieces never before loaned out of private collections, and
others which are usually buried in museums' lumber-rooms.
A small group of 19th-century photographs sketches in some sort of
background. The Qajars were the dynasty which ruled Iran from the 1790s and
through the last century. We see pictures of two great Qajar rulers, Fath
Ali Shah and Nasr al-Din Shah, and pictures of eunuchs and the women of the
anderun, which was the Iranian equivalent of the harem. Fath Ali Shah, you
may recall, was the sexually hyperactive monarch notorious for having left
some 5,000 legitimate heirs.
His successor but one, Nasr al-Din Shah, was more moderate, with a mere 60
or so concubines in his anderun. An album of portrait-photographs of these
ladies implies they were dreadfully plain, perhaps because eyebrows that met
above the nose were considered beautiful; if nature did not oblige, the gap
was briged with a tattoo.
Photographs of drawingrooms of the period give a strangely 'Victorian'
impression, with a mass of bric-a-brac, standard lamps and upholstered
furniture with long fringes. A tidal wave of European influence was flooding
through the Middle East in the 19th century, and fashionable society in Iran
was thirsty for images of the Western way of life. Traditional miniature
painters responded by lifting images from Western prints and photographs.
They borrowed landscapes, they borrowed Holy Families. Most of all, however,
they imported images of European women.
Lacquer pencases and bookcovers feature prominently in the exhibition
because they were favourite places for paintings of this sort. Persian
lacquerware was unusual in being made out of papier-mache, and I do not much
care for its toffee colour. Even so, there is so much charm to the way
Persian artists represented European society. The traditional Iranian heroes
and heroines were not entirely abandoned, nor bird-and-flower designs. But
the fashionable subjects were taken, very selectively, from western sources.
Ingres-type women with fans lean against mantlepieces and Gainsborough-type
ladies wear wigs like piles of sausage rolls. Vaguely Elizabethan banqueting
scenes allowed artists to show ladies in daring necklines committing the
enormity of sitting down to eat with their menfolk. Men and women take the
air in open carriages wedged tightly together. To the merchants of Tehran
and Isfahan, images like these must have hinted at the charms of a Europe
which was scandalously, yet deliciously, decadent.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: Nostalgic about Communism - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEMPTATION to mark New Year's Eve by recalling all that happened in the
year was resisted by all the BBC networks except Radio 1, who gave us a Top
40 of the Year. To mark New Year's Day with forecasts for the coming year
was a privilege given only to the Prime Minister, interviewed by James
Naughtie, though the previous day BBC correspondents, chaired by Gordon
Clough, gave their own conceptions.
Surely one of the more important events of 1991 was the demise of the
Communist Party. I belonged as a boy to the British bit until I made a
change into the Junior Imperial League; and I could not like anyone who,
when young, did not find something generous about the idea of communism.
Many good names were remembered in Radio 4's Damn, Damn, Damn, the Communist
Party Man on Sunday.
Intellectuals were recalled rather than such folk as 'Red Ken' at Morris
Motors; and many changed their minds. C. Day Lewis felt 'kind of romantic'
and (less attractively) thought that 'officer-class minds' could direct the
workers. No one minded his becoming Poet Laureate in due course. Stephen
Spender 'wasn't really at heart a communist', and he was later knighted. The
Spanish civil war was a focus for sentiment as well as politics; from it
grew, tortuously, Penguin New Writing. The Unity Theatre was an influential
fringe house, and many good people worked there, including Roger Woddis, my
personal Poet Laureate. Graham Greene had communist friends, but was not
himself a party member. The programme was sympathetic rather than seductive,
and did not keep Sir Michael Checkland's name out of the Prime Minister's
list on Tuesday.
My favourite programmes over the year's end were From Guitry to Godard,
concerts of French popular songs that Richard Mayne presented from Saturday
to Friday (not Sunday). Each covered a decade, and the songs were taken only
from films - the sole possible excuse for not including Jean Sablon. On
Saturday we had the 1920s; there was no sound on the movies then, but apt
songs could always be found - Edith Piaf grinding out 'Ca ira', for
instance, or Yvonne Printemps fully operatic in an aria.
In the 1920s we had Chevalier in 'Valentine' and Danielle Darrieux, very
sad, in 'Deja'. But the 1930s had songs still often enough heard to keep
them vaguely familiar. Here were Patachou in the programme's theme-song,
'Sous le Ciel de Paris'; Josephine Baker singing 'C'est lui'; Darrieux
again, as a Russian princess challenging the weather, 'Il peut neiger';
Fernandel longing to be tutoye; Yvonne Printemps, not a day older, singing
'Je ne sais pas ce que l'on pense'; and the discovery of the season, Charles
Trenet, in 'Je chante' and 'il pleut dans ma chambre'. There were also such
treasures as Yves Montand, Zizi Jeanmaire, Brigitte Bardot, Charles
Aznavour, Jane Birkin (once banned by the BBC]). Never mind about
understanding French; the songs and the singers were, and are, enchanting.
Radios 3 and 4 both had continuing 'Consequences' games over the holiday.
They were joined by Radio 5 in Chain Reaction from Tuesday onward. The idea
was that on Day 1, A interviews B; on Day 2, B interviews C; on Day 3 - get
it? But they picked the wrong names. On Tuesday, Ralph Steadman interviews
John Cleese. Steadman once drew a great dust-cover for a book of mine; but
he is no interviewer, and Cleese kept interrupting him. Cleese interviewed
American novelist William Goldman, who wrote the scripts of such films as
Marathon Man and Butch Cassidy; but he was seldom made to sound interesting.
Then Goldman interviewed Sir Ian McKellen, and he in his turn Glenys
Kinnock; but I wasn't listening by then.
Two errors in my summary last week. One, the genes programme didn't go out
on Christmas Day; two, Mind the Gap was not transferred from Radio 1 to
Radio 4 but the other way round.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: Stop mugging the paying public - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM in an office at 20th Century Fox in Los Angeles and Mel Brooks is
screaming at me across his desk. 'Hollywood - this is the lead of your
article] - Hollywood doesn't care about art. It just wants to make hits]
People think Home Alone is a good movie because it made Dollars 550m
worldwide. But people think it's a good film because they like things that
are easy, they like bland crap] I made a film called Life Stinks. . . .'
And he is off, talking my ears raw about Life Stinks and how good it is and
how it salutes the human condition and how 'the marvellous spirit of comedy
surfaces even in the depths of degradation.' What has happened to the man?
Five minutes ago he had a sense of humour.
The video age has happened. Mr Brooks knows that Life Stinks is coming out
on video in Britain, a country I represent via a pink newspaper, and this
presentation of his is 'Publicity Push 2: the Cassette Phase.' It is his
last chance to ensure that a film that made no money at the box-office
(except, he points out insistently, in Italy) makes some from the video
market.
Life Stinks is not a good film, but it is decent-hearted and it, yes,
salutes the human condition. Month by month the video lists fill up with
items that have no interest in any condition other than that of their
distributors' wallets. January is a worse month than most, because the
quality product came out before Christmas and we are now deluged with things
like The Brain Eaters, Earth Vs The Spider and Psycho IV, interspersed with
last year's spendthrift also-rans like The Godfather Part III (CIC).
A video shop is a wondrous place: all that blood and violence splashing
about on cassette jackets. But although the most lurid jackets are usually
those advertising made-for-video cheapies, identifiable by key words in the
titles like 'murder', 'scream' or 'blood,' mainstream commercial films now
have to compete with these eye-catchers. So they re-surface on video, after
a possibly shaky theatrical run, wearing a bold, bright jacket with splashy
graphics and a scroll of critical encomia. Never mind that few critics can
remember saying anything good about the film concerned.
At the same time men like Mr Brooks must indulge in their lunatic hype to
coin a little more money from a failed film in order to keep their places a
little longer on the Hollywood payroll.
It is a demented cultural-economic climate. Critics are sometimes asked why
they express negative or carping opinions about a work of cinema. The answer
is: because they are the only people allowed to do so. No one else connected
with the industry, when assessing a film, is permitted to point out that the
Emperor is naked; or even to offer hints that the weather is a little
chilly, your majesty, and you might want to throw on a scarf.
The reason that advertising overkill exists in the video arena even more
than the theatrical one is that few critics are any longer on guard duty.
Most of them have done their job, or think they have, the first time around
in the BC or 'Before Cassette' era. Hence the anomaly that when a film is
video-released and most viewers actually come around to seeing it, no
professional guidance is on offer: except from video magazines which largely
exist to sell, not to assess, the software.
Two ringing exhortations, therefore. Critics, you should be more aware of
how and when film viewers actually view films. Men and woman of the
industry, you should stop trying to mug the paying public whenever it comes
around the corner into Video Alley without a policeman in sight.
Enough, or I shall risk shouting across the furniture like Mr Brooks. Let us
now graciously salute that film-maker's talent, forgive him for Life Stinks,
and remember that nearly all his good films are on video. They include The
Producers, Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie and (my favourite) The History Of
The World Part 1. Meanwhile the best non-Brooks January release is Listening
To Britain: A Jennings Trilogy (Imperial War Museum, COI). This comprises
three of Humphrey Jennings's masterly war documentaries combining
patriotism, humour and a tender, caustic visual poetry.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Arts: A little light music - Ronald Crichton visits Paris
and Nantes in search of comic opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE days after Christmas Paris looks surprisingly empty, except for
queues - queues for theatres, big stores and above all for major art
exhibitions. On New Year's Eve the queues spread to food shops and not, you
may be sure, because of shortages. At one famous traiteur, not a mile from
the Madeleine, staff were offering champagne to queuers. Inside, the
assistants were disobliging enough to qualify for automatic British
citizenship. There was however a difference. Their impatience is not caused
by ignorance or lack of interest but by unconcealed feelings of superiority.
In and around the Champs-Elysees, the trees glisten after dark with ropes of
tiny white lights - simple but magically effective. The Southern end of the
Madeleine is shrouded in mysterious, pearly blue, but I was disappointed to
find no special illuminations this year for the old Opera, the Palais
Garnier. Indoors, the house was full and well sprinkled with children for a
Saturday matinee of the ballet Romeo and Juliet in Nureyev's 1984 version,
resplendent with Patrick Dupond, Monique Loudieres, Eric Vu An and Yann
Bridart. A centenary offering to Prokofiev, no doubt, but I must confess
that, coming back to it after some time, the score as a whole does not wear
terribly well.
Lovers of that splendid building will be delighted to hear that culture
minister Jack Lang has announced the completion of the redecoration and
considerable enlargement of the West wing, where the Opera's mouth-watering
museum collections have long been housed in cramped conditions. They will
now be displayed in showcases specially designed by Richard Peduzzi. The
space, with larger reading rooms and better facilities for temporary
exhibitions, will presumably embrace Garnier's gaunt Egyptian staircase at
the foot of which one half-expects to discover the crouching form of Aida.
At the Opera-Comique down the boulevard, where formerly a fine line of
distinction existed between comic opera and operetta, the barriers are down
with a vengeance. The Christmas show was not even an operetta but a
twenties-style revue by Patrice Thomere and Alain Lagarde, punningly called
L'as-tu revue? Not, as you might think, a pure nostalgia trip but a fantasy
on 1920's entertainment themes with a few old songs. The new ones in the old
style and the linking passages are by Jean-Michel Dalmase.
Little evocation of stars of the past - not a sight of Maurice Chevalier's
straw hat. The only Josephine Baker number I identified was sung by a
Nordic-type blonde, Arielle Dombasle. Built around the personality and
versatile talents of the indomitable, inextinguishable, veteran baritone
Gabriel Bacquier, smoothly directed by Olivier Benezech in decors by Lagarde
and brilliant costumes by Christian Lacroix, eye and ear were agreeably
entertained. It was nice to hear the music-hall song about a wooden leg
which Stravinsky used in the fairground music in Petrushka.
Otherwise big musicals loom large, with West Side Story at the Chatelet, Les
Miserables at the Mogador and Peter Pan at the Casino de Paris. To find a
real French comic opera I went to Nantes, where at the handsome
theatre-promoted-to-opera-house queening it over the Place Graslin, a stone
and stucco circus with streets radiating star-wise (imagine a theatre in
such a commanding position in a British city]) there is a new production of
Messager's La Basoche.
Messager was a conductor of great distinction, responsible among other good
deeds for the first performance of Debussy's Pelleas. He was also a composer
of light music of the finest quality. La Basoche appeared at the
Opera-Comique in 1890 and remained in the repertory for years. D'Oyly Carte
staged it in London as The King of the Students at the short-lived English
Opera House,where it succeeded Sullivan's Ivanhoe.
The Basoches were student associations traditionally granted some licence:
they elected their own 'king' and gave performances of satirical and no
doubt scurrilous plays. One of their 'kings' was the poet Clement Marot, who
in the opera (Albert Carre's libretto is ingenious but complicated) catches
the eye of the young English Princes Mary, sister of Henry VIII, coming to
Paris as the second wife of Louis XII. Being a lively young woman she
arrives a day early, incognita, to see Paris for herself. One result of
their meeting is that Marot's wife Colette has to be passed off as the
Princess. When the truth comes out Mary is dismayed, Marot being a more
attractive proposition than the ageing genuine King (in real life, Louis
died soon after the marriage, leaving Mary free to return home as Duchess of
Suffolk).
The music is light as air, with the subtle harmonic touches Messager managed
so well, equally happy in pastiche 16th century songs and in ensembles with
an unexpected whiff here and there of Die Meistersinger - Messager, a fine
Wagner conductor, had recently enjoyed that work at Bayreuth. One is
grateful to Nantes for rescuing La Basoche, now surely due to join the
rediscovered Fortunio in the repertory, even though the production by
Philippe Arlaud is not very distinguished.
Two performers stood out - the stylish, experienced Jean-Louis Soumagnas as
Matre Roland, Marot's rival for the student kingship, and Sophie Fournier as
Marot's wife Colette. Her singing was sometimes insecure but she perfectly
caught the note of warm-hearted rural innocence with a touch of slyness. As
the Duc de Longueville, sent to accompany Mary to France, Vincent Le Texier
showed why 'Elle m'aime]' became the opera's best-known number, but
elsewhere forced the comic note relentlessly. Conductor Jean-Louis
Forestier's feeling for tempi was sure. Perhaps the grandly-named Orchestre
Philharmonique des Pays de la Loire slightly underrated the difficulty of
accompanying comic opera at this level.

Secret Museums: Gauguin and M. Vaquez Montalban; Goya and Paul Nizon; James
Ensor and Paul West; Alberto Giacometti and Tahar Ben Jelloun; El Greco and
Fernando Arrabal; Georges de La Tour and Pascal Quignard. 80pp, Pounds
13.99. Flohic editions. Distributed by Serpent's Tail.
THE AIM of this on-going series of books (at present they are being
published in batches of three) is to bring together writers and artists  -
living masters of the pen (novelists, playwrights, journalists) and past
masters of the brush and the chisel. The writers have been invited to sit
back and savour works of art; to reflect upon them; and to give us the
fruits of their meditations.
Self evidently, the result promises to be unusual, even a little
unpredictable, because the task itself is an unusual one. It will be part
reverie, part biography, and part formal art criticism; a mixture, perhaps,
of poeme en prose and hard scholarship. This cocktail could prove very
stimulating, of course; and the publishers have been quick to make a virtue
of the method itself in the handsome publicity material that accompanies the
first batches of books in the series. They use such words as 'magical',
'other worldly' and even 'emotion of knowledge' as they endeavour to
anticipate the likely impact of the texts upon their readers.
The matter of design is given a special emphasis by the publishers, too.
Each spread, for example, consists of text on the left-hand page
(beautifully printed against a background tint of beige as if it were a page
from a novel) and a colour plate on the right. This fosters the illusion
that the text - a 'book-within-a-book' is how the publishers describe it -
has the coherence, the importance and the well-crafted unity of a good
novel, and that it will indeed 'permit the reader to advance . . . in these
two worlds of the fictional and the artistic'.
The titles are also very good value for money: Pounds 13.99 for a book that
contains more than 30 large colour plates (made possible, one imagines, by
the massive co-edition print run in five languages); they are handsomely
produced; the quality of the colour reproductions themselves is above
average.
So far so good. Everything seems handsome, admirable and courageous - until
we come to read the actual translations of the texts written by this roll
call of international literary celebrities. And then the niggling doubts
begin to creep in. Was the idea of reverie, with all that that word has come
to connote of the quasi-mystical wedding of intellect, subjectivity and the
unconscious mind, quite enough? Was the publisher's original brief no more
than that? Were the authors even given a brief? Or was the fact that they
were who they were a sufficient qualification for such a task as this one?
For the fact is that the texts are often a disgrace. At worst, they are
slipshod and almost incoherent - what Dylan Thomas once described as 'the
higher Woollage'. Let me quote one example, from Vasquez Montalban's essay
on the painter Gauguin. Opposite the plate of Nature Morte a la Mandoline,
we read as follows:
'My attempt to recapture Gauguin (in poems written during the 1960s) was
neither onerous nor particularly far-sighted. The aim in the 60s was to
achieve a democratic cultural and political order that was universal,
decentralising and anti-authoritarian, the left challenged the dialectic
fatalism (or contradiction) which forces mankind to pass by way of slavery
feudalism and capitalism to reach socialism and repeated mention was made of
the Asiatic mode of production giving rise to another potential emancipation
process peculiar to a third world which has not undergone the industrial and
liberal revolutions . . .'
Did anyone read this statement before or after it had been translated into
some sort of pidgin English? Did anyone find it interesting, stimulating,
intellectually provocative - or relevant in any way whatsoever to an
understanding of Gauguin and his work? Did anyone enquire after the meaning
of that enigmatic phrase 'Asiatic mode of production?' Did anyone care? Or
did the printer perhaps lose the text of the original and substitute for it
a fragment from some unpublishable Marxist sociology manual of c1972?
There are many examples of untreated verbiage of this kind throughout the
series, but let that one suffice. Who is to blame for such bad writing? So
much slipshod editing? So many verbal infelicities? So many awkward turns of
phrase? The authors themselves? The translators? Were these translations
checked and approved by the English distributors of these books before the
co-edition presses rolled?
And how can books which purport to take art seriously allow Tintoretto to be
described as Tintorello] Did the great Venetian belong to the opera buffa
after all? Was it the higher harlequinade that he was striving to represent
on the great, coffered ceiling of the Scuola San Rocco? Molesworth needs to
No.

'I AM a thorough softy when it comes to animals. I love them. Dogs and cats
are my passion. Their love is unchanging, unconditional and unbounding in
warm kisses and wiggling bodies.'
What ever happens to screen goddesses when they retire? Like pet-lovers
Doris Day and Brigitte Bardot, whom no journalist today can approach without
a written affidavit that he is dotty about moggies or doggies, Palm
Springs-based Ginger Rogers has given up humanity for a larger love. Make
that two larger loves; for she also has religion. 'I owe my health and
happiness to it,' she confides. And she says farewell to the reader with the
single word 'Blessings.'
Thinly disguised as an autobiography, Ginger My Story is a guide to the
dottinesses, woolly thinking and PR postures a screen diva is encouraged to
subscribe to during a long, long career. They give her by retirement age an
understandable readiness to retreat from humanity. Between 1930 and 1965, in
which time she made 70 films, Rogers lived in a world where the adulation of
others was her daily bread and where make-believe kept edging off the screen
into her life.
Her book alternates well-polished mythopoeic anecdotes, like the one about
the blue ostrich-feather dress that got up Fred Astaire's nose in Top Hat's
'Cheek by cheek' number, with a screen diva's usual have-I-missed-anyone-out
roll call of males in her life. These seem to have included absolutely
everyone: from silent star Lew Ayres (first husband) to Cary Grant
(unrequited love) to the indefatigable Howard Hughes (late of Katharine
Hepburn's autobiography).
I wish I liked Miss Rogers in print as much as on screen. Her early film
career, before a Best Actress Oscar for Kitty Foyle gave her delusions of
grandeur, was a delight. She was a fresh, mickey-taking presence. But this
book is ponderous when it is not fluffy. Much goody-two-shoes complimenting
of her peers goes together with bits of unattractive bitchery. (Do we need
two stories of Fred Astaire's toupee falling off?) The final pages savour of
valedictory smugness as our heroine passes from one award ceremony to the
next, thanking her fans, waving at her autograph-hunters and moving at last
towards the uncritical love-glow of her cats and dogs.
Edith de Rham's Joseph Losey shows how one distinguished American film-maker
dealt with all that Hollywood flummery. He walked out on it. Losey left
America in the 1950s, banishing himself to England with a little
encouragement from the House Un - American Activities Committee. HUAC had
been showing an unhealthy interest in Losey's supposed Communist sympathies.
If he had such sympathies, the Wisconsin-born director soon transmuted them
into something rich and strange. He found the perfect screenwriting partner
in Harold Pinter and produced a series of baroque, sardonic visions of the
British class system in films like The Servant, Accident and The Go-Between.
Miss de Rham does not exactly warm to Mr Losey, but then who did? He
presented a morose and misanthropic exterior that brightened up only on the
film set. But he was a movie artist of beguiling mystery. The obliquity of
his work was its richest feature - making one regret that he never realised
his cherished project of filming Proust - and Losey's move to Britain and
later Europe added subtle layers of old-world enigma to the new-world
idealism with which he was born.
Miss de Rham is scanty with source notes and relies on clippings more than
confidants. But she provides at least one revealing witness. Losey's
favourite actor Dirk Bogarde testifies to the human Losey by recalling
everything from crying fits to an illness bout that made the film-maker hand
over directing reins for ten days on The Servant to Bogarde himself. What
are the auteur theorists going to say about that?
Some auteurs have cast-iron claims to the title. If a man writes his films
as well as directing them, like the 1940s screwball comedy specialist
Preston Sturges (The Palm Beach Story, The Lady Eve), no one can deny him
authorship. But what about Preston Sturges On Preston Sturges? Did Preston
Sturges write that?
Not quite. Edited and arranged into autobiographical shape from Sturges's
diaries and letters, the book is a pretend-memoir devised by his widow
Sandy. It is still a pacy, delightful read, full of detail and persuasively
modelled on the whipcrack-witty style of PS's own movie dialogue.

VAMPYRES: LORD BYRON TO COUNT DRACULA by Christopher Frayling Faber &amp; Faber
Pounds 17.50, 429 pages
'PRIVATE PERSONS may be Vampyres, or Blood-Suckers, ie Sharpers, Usurers and
Stockjobbers . . . but nothing less than the Power of a Treasury can raise
up a compleat Vampyre.' (Gentleman's Magazine, 1732).
Bram Stoker began Dracula one hundred years ago. It was already an enduring
and replicable myth, resistant
to changing fashion and scornful of parody. Where did Stoker get his ideas?
Or,
more interesting, why is vampire literature alive and biting?
Christopher Frayling has gathered a wide collection of Vampire literature in
his Vampyres, a capacious book dripping with suspense and replete with
horror. His excellent introduction tracks the history of vampire treatises
from 18th-century Serbia to Stoker's 1897 classic, showing how Stoker
synthesised elements of the folkloric vampire, the Byronic Lord, and the
femme fatale in the same book.
The first of these, vampire folklore from Silesia and Bohemia, had surfaced
in English periodicals in the
1730s and 1740s, and was available to Stoker. The second, the Byronic
figure, dates from 1816, when modern vampire literature began with John
Polidori, Byron's physician. His The Vampyre was written in three mornings
after spending the summer of 1816 with Byron, Shelley and Mary Godwin (the
same party produced Frankenstein). Polidori's hero is an English aristocrat
preying on impressionable women and society girls in Athens and London. It
was the first Byronic vampire.
Goethe had made vampires respectable in 1797 with The Bride of Corinth, but
it took Polidori's book to make the vampire upwardly mobile, and Byron's
reputation in the 1820s to add a social tang to the taste of blood - thus an
1820 Parisian account of 'ce Don Juan vampirique'.
Stoker's third ingredient, the femme fatale Vampire arrived in 1820 with
Hoffman's 'Aurelia' (from The Serapion Brethren), the tale of a dark-eyed
and deathly-pale baroness who prefers warm blood to cool Chablis. Throughout
the 19th century, Poe, Gogol, Dumas, Lynn Linton and de Maupassant produced
vampire stories; but none was as chilling as Gautier's erotic La Morte
Amoureuse of 'sea-green eyes and teeth of the purest Orient pearl' from
1836.
Stoker himself was a compulsive note-writer and list-maker, as the holdings
at the Rosenbach Foundation in Philadelphia and the Shakespeare Centre,
Stratford-upon-Avon,
clearly show. Stoker's environment comes over plainly: a wonderful list of
Dracula's characteristics scrawled on Lyceum Theatre notepaper reminds one
of his life in the theatre (he was Henry Irving's secretary and manager for
27 years); the 80 pages of notes for Dracula bear the imprint of Stoker's
precise mind, right down to railway timetables and weather manuals.
Frayling confirms the origins of Dracula ('Count Wampyr') in one of Stoker's
dreams, scrawled on a scrap of paper in March 1890: 'young man goes out -
sees girls - one tries - to kiss him not on the lips but throat. Old Count
interferes - rage and fury diabolical. This man belongs to me, I want him.'
(Sic.)
As a postscript to the extracts in this crowded book, Frayling includes some
revealing excerpts from Krafft-Ebing's 1886 Psychopathia Sexualis on
decadence, and Ernest Jones's excellent Freudian account of vampires, On The
Nightmare (1920). Frayling can be witty too, describing AN Wilson's
introduction to the OUP edition of Dracula as 'anaemic.' One can be
much more sanguine about Frayling's book, sharply-written and incisively
edited.
Psychologically, Vampirism seems to be nothing less than an incestuous,
necrophilic, sado-masochistic free-for-all; anything goes, as long as it is
taboo. Practically, Vampirism is best expressed by the perplexed lawyer in
Dracula who pronounces with professional exactness on the Count: 'he left me
under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor.'

KGB by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky Sceptre Pounds 10.99, 847
pages
INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CENTRE by Christopher Andrew and Oleg Gordievsky
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 238 pages
CHRISTOPHER Andrew is a Cambridge historian who has made a reputation
writing about intelligence operations: Oleg Gordievsky is a former KGB
officer who, it would appear, was turned by SIS in 1974, defected to Britain
in 1985, and has since furnished material both to the Office and Andrew on
his former masters' whys and wherefores.
One result of collaboration between Andrew and Gordievsky is KGB, a history
of the Soviet Union rather than clandestine operations, which is a solid,
reliable piece of work. Instructions From The Centre is a slighter thing
altogether, heavily dependent on what Gordievsky chooses to reveal or can
recall (the sparse source notes are an indication of this factor), diverting
in its details but not particularly valuable as a contribution to knowledge
of our times. We are, as it were, offered roast beef followed by fruit
salad. The former is a bit tough, but provides substantial nourishment; the
latter can be consumed in a few mouthfuls, leaving a vague sense of
dissatisfaction.
In setting out to describe and analyse the 74 years between the 1917
revolutions and the attempted coup against Gorbachev of last August the
authors have clearly in mind the undoubted fact that huge, repressively
cruel and all-embracing armies of state security have been a central feature
of Russian history since at least the 16th century. Until the 1917
revolutions such armies operated mainly within Russia. Since 1917 they have
also attempted to operate on an international scale, reflecting not only the
Leninist belief in 'world revolution' but the endemic and well-founded
conviction that Russia's European neighbours have threatened Soviet
communism, not merely opposed it. The authors describe this specifically
Russian fear of encirclement in these words: 'Lenin's Manichean vision of a
world divided between bourgeois darkness and Bolshevik light.'
KGB is, therefore, enlightening in revealing in great and well-documented
detail how the combination of repression at home and espionage abroad
fostered and bred a peculiarly vicious brand of suspicion about individual
and national motives and actions. This psychotic condition, in Stalin's day,
matched his own neurotic obsession about real or supposed enemies within and
without. KGB is important, if not wholly original, in showing how this
wicked dictator was so dominated by his neurosis that when, in early 1941,
it became clear from 'sure sources' that Hitler was about to turn east, he
could not bring himself to believe intelligence from Churchill, Stafford
Cripps, Richard Sorge - and his own espionage and security subordinates in
Moscow.
Admittedly, the NKVD and GRU were not particularly effective at acquiring
intelligence overseas, because the requirement to do so on a professional
basis jarred with subversive activities, in particular the attempt to
penetrate western governing establishments. Andrew and Gordievsky have
little specifically new to say about 'the Cambridge Light Blue Five' but do
remind us, in discussing this NKVD attempt to get inside the British 'upper
ten thousand' in the 1930s, how absurd it was for Moscow to suppose that a
clutch of disaffected young men represented the sources of power. Comparison
with Ribbentrop's and Hitler's delusions about 'the Cliveden set' comes
irresistibly to mind.
When we come to the post-Stalinist era - and so, it might be remembered, to
the worst decade of the Cold War, which only ended when Khruschev was
defeated during the Cuba missile crisis in October 1962 - the narrative
tempo slackens somewhat. The Soviet empire, by the early 1960s, was running
out of steam: the onset and course of the Cuba missile crisis are described
clearly. Narration of Oleg Penkowsky's role, although arguably marred by
revealing more detail than a stringent sense of security might warrant, is
put in the right historical perspective. The Soviet Union was such a
ramshackle affair technologically that its capacity either to wage modern
war or run an industrial society should, by the west in general, have
seriously been doubted. Unfortunately, it has taken nearly 30 years for
these realities to become apparent to us all.
Oleg Gordievsky commenced his service in the KGB during immediate aftermath
of Khruschev's defeat. Although apparently possessing a clear grasp of
'historical forces', the papers comprising Instructions From The Centre are
so much concerned with minutae that one is forced into the impression that
Gordievsky quickly lost interest in intelligence operations as an element of
State policy, defecting to Britain, all other reasons apart, to escape from
the deadening burden of a system which, whilst remaining brutal, had become
amazingly inefficient. Certainly the most revealing example of a system out
of touch with reality is a report, presumably filched from the KGB Registry,
purporting to establish the case for using one corner of the Brompton
Oratory as a dead letter box. The report makes curious reading to anyone
familiar either with the Oratory - as the compiler of the report clearly was
not - or the function of dead letter boxes. One can only hope that they
order these things better in Moscow today.

THE NEW OXFORD BOOK OF SEVENTEENTH CENTURY VERSE edited by Alastair Fowler
Oxford Pounds 25, 831 pages
SPARE A thought in your New Year meditations for an old friend who has just
been retired after 56 years' service - The Oxford Book of Seventeenth
Century Verse. Of all the Oxford Books it was the most influential,
promoting the 20th century revival of Donne, Herbert and Marvell. It was not
quite first in the field: the appearance of an earlier anthology, edited by
Herbert JC Grierson in 1921, prompted TS Eliot to write his famous essay,
The Metaphysical Poets. This was superseded in 1934 by the Oxford Book
Grierson edited with Geoffrey Bullough.
'Donne's 'Songs and Sonets', not alone in virtue of their content and 'wit',
but in their rhythms, their suggestion of speech rather than song . . . mark
a new fashion in poetry, a shifting of the centre of gravity . . .' wrote
the editors in their preface, claiming that this new fashion dominated the
period. That claim has, over the past 50 years, been the subject of
continual debate in departments of English.
The question was, for instance, widely discussed in the Cambridge journal
Scrutiny. In 1936 there appeared, from one of its editors, FR Leavis, the
book Revaluation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry, advocating a
new critical rating for several of the poets in the Oxford book and taking a
swipe or two at its editors in the process. Nor was the discussion confined
to academics in universities. It provided inspiration for poets. Eliot,
Auden, MacNeice, Empson found fruitful models in the Oxford book. For a
while it seemed as if the terms 'metaphysical' and 'modern' were synonyms
where poetry was concerned.
It was, surely, reasonable after more than half a century to appoint an
editor of a later generation to make a fresh Oxonian selection of poetry to
represent this wonderfully rich period. Professor Alastair Fowler was the
man chosen for the job; he is, as was Grierson, a Scottish academic, and his
approach to literature is historical.
Fowler is a foremost authority on the development of literary genres, an
interest which gives him a rather different perspective from his
predecessors. He points out that the underlying poetic genre for the whole
period was epigram in the Greek sense. Typified by brevity and a closing
'point', epigram is the standard brick with which many a 17th-century poetic
structure, great and small, is built. Epigram is to be discerned as much in
a passionate love-poem by Donne as in those more leisurely, ceremonial
country house poems in which the period delighted - Jonson on Penshurst,
Marvell on Appleton House, Cotton on Chatsworth, and their offshoot, the
garden poem. Fowler describes these Estate poems as examples of English
Georgic - a much more fruitful concept when thinking about the poetry of the
period than 'metaphysical'.
The main difference between the old and the new anthologies is that whereas
Grierson and Bullough were metaphysical fundamentalists, Fowler is an
ecumenical liberal and he has opened the door to an even wider variety of
poets in kind and gender than the previous editors. The question arises: has
this breadth involved a sacrifice of depth, of excellence?
Well, all the familiar names are here including Shakespeare, Ben Jonson,
Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Milton, Dryden, Cowley, Herrick. But mingling with
these truly great is the Leveller poet and pamphleteer, Gerrard Winstanley
with 'The Diggers' Song' and so are even more obscure figures, the waterman
Edward Taylor, the alcoholic Richard Brathwait and the lunatic James
Carkesse.
Other newcomers include women poets ignored by the editors of the original
Oxford book - that fine American poet Anne Bradstreet, and Lady Mary Wroth,
who wrote despairing love-sonnets; also, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Finch,
Mary Astell, Elizabeth Tipper, and the mysterious Emilia Lanier. The latter
was AL Rowse's candidate for Shakespeare's dark lady. She had not been
discovered in time for the Grierson anthology, and even if she had, would
not have got into it. Another recent poetic find is Cowley's epic The Civil
War, parts of which Fowler has included.
But in spite of these crucial differences, frequently there is a duplication
between the two anthologies, and it is revealing to compare their
presentation of the same poem. Fowler has modernised all spellings and use
of capitals whereas the earlier editors tried to preserve the appearance of
the original texts. Thus in Bishop Henry King's 'Exequy' to his wife who
died in her twenties, Fowler has 'But hark] My pulse, like a soft drum,/
Beats my approach, tells thee I come . . .'; whereas Grierson and Bullough
have, 'But heark] My Pulse like a soft Drum/ Beats my approach, tells Thee I
come . . .' The latter seems much stronger - not least because of the pun on
'Thee'. Here the grieving bishop equates his beloved with God, a resonance
lost if you down-grade the 'T' to lower case.
But Fowler has done a difficult job well. Younger readers will receive a
comprehensive introduction to the period; older readers will surely want to
have both.

Elaeagnus Gilt Edge This fine variety of Elaeagnus ebbingii makes a large
evergreen bush with glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green, broadly
edged with yellow. They have small, silvery, fragrant flowers in autumn, but
it is as a hardy ornamental shrub that it is chiefly valued. It is easy to
grow in all fertile soils and is stocked by most garden centres in
containers so that it can be planted at any time of the year. It will thrive
in sun or light shade, but the best leaf colour is produced when the light
is good. If it grows too large, stems can be shortened or removed,
preferably in May but certainly by August. It can also be used as a hedge or
screen, clipped during the same period. AH

ADRIAN COOK first, the rest nowhere. That was the outcome of the Racing
Post's 1991 national tipsters' competition in which Cook, who tips for the
Post under the nom de course Diomed, won a Pounds 2,100 prize by giving
2,015 winners from 6,390 tips (strike rate: 31 per cent).
All tipsters had a bank of Pounds 1,200 to play with. When Cook was profiled
in the Weekend FT five weeks ago, he was Pounds 178 clear of his nearest
rival. By year's end, Cook had stretched that lead to Pounds 200, finishing
with Pounds 900 in the bank. The 25 per cent reduction in Cook's original
bank (from Pounds 1,200 to Pounds 900) is a perfect measure of how difficult
it is to make betting pay when confronted by high commercial rake-offs.
The competition's runner-up was Robin Goodfellow of the Daily Mail (Pounds
700). The worst performers were Templegate of the Sun (Pounds 382) and Man
on the Spot of the Sporting Life (Pounds 281).
Cook, 38, said this week that his favourite races for tipping purposes were
eight to ten-runner middle-distance handicaps, both on the Flat and over
jumps. His worst: sprint handicaps. Essential information: Cook himself bets
only once a year or so. He thinks it is a mug's game.

but there will often be a management service to help with lettings.
However, buying a cottage in the middle of nowhere is a different matter.
There are agencies that handle such places - but it will be up to you to
find them.
A comparative newcomer to this field is French Country Lettings. Covering
all of France would be a mammoth job so the agency draws a line from Dieppe
down to the Languedoc and will take on rural properties anywhere west of
that if they are up to standard.
Nicky Cambrook, who learnt about property with a London estate agency,
started FCL in August 1990. 'Our first season was fraught with war, high
interest rates and recession,' she says. 'But now we are extremely busy.'
She finds there is a demand for this type of agency and is building up a
portfolio, from her present base in Somerset (0963-34066).
Ideally FCL likes to hear about properties for letting by September, which
leaves time for inspection before inclusion in the following year's
brochure, which comes out in November, although there is a spring supplement
for later entrants.
The agency's first brochure has a variety of properties. There is a
farmhouse with a 40 ft sitting room, in four acres, an hour from the coast
in Brittany, a converted windmill with circular rooms. In the south, a
village house in a hamlet in the Cevennes national park, north of
Montpellier, is a conversion from a silkworm loft. It is on three floors and
sleeps seven. This lets at Pounds 840 a week in high season, Pounds 500 in
low season. At the other end of the scale a studio apartment in a modern
block next to a marina on the Vendee coast, sleeping two, lets for Pounds
210 a week in high season, Pounds 115 low season.
FCL will only recommend, not stipulate, a letting figure. It requires owners
to contract a property to it for at least the season (April 1 to October
31). During this period an owner may reserve six weeks, of which two can be
high season, for his own use.
In addition a property can be offered, if an owner wishes, for out of season
holidays. FCL finds there is also a small market for longer term letting
(six months or more) while people house hunt or decide if they would like
living in France.
The agency charges a one-off registration fee of Pounds 50 plus VAT, to
cover start-up expenses of featuring a property, such as photography and
office administrative costs. Its commission rate is 20 per cent of the gross
rental. This includes advising on rent and presentation, producing and
distributing a lettings brochure, advertising, dealing with enquiries and
bookings, collecting rent and sorting out any complaints.
In a Weekend FT article on Malta on December 7/8 last year, the amount of
stamp duty payable by foreigners purchasing property in that country was
incorrect. This was due to a computer error. The correct amount of stamp
duty payable is 13.55 per cent.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Property: Mixed fortunes in the housing horoscope - What
does 1992 hold for the property market? John Brennan takes an astrologer's
view . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRENNAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERSTANDABLE caution pervades most previews of the 1992 property market.
Yet, there is no shortage of data from which to form a picture. The trick is
to blend the industry's more cautious, subtle and private views into the
random time segments thrown up by astrological dates. So, let us see-in the
year's housing prospects with the stars.
CAPRICORN CHILL
(December 22-January 21)
After the holidays, it is too chilly and icy for much viewing. Fear of the
heavily-publicised world-wide 'flu epidemic keeps more people at home. This
is, however, a good time for hardy hunters of the limited number of good
country houses on the market in the lower to middle price range (Pounds
200-400,000).
Try to see the house at work (ideally, by arriving unannounced one morning)
) and take the opportunity to talk with the owner; perhaps, even, to work
out a deal. If he is afraid of values leaping just as he sells, you might -
lawyer close at hand - work out a simple agreement where, a year later, you
pay the difference (if any) in value of the house, less inflation and any
improvements you may have made.
AQUARIUS ARISING
(January 21-February 19).
With pre-election political analysis proliferating, most people will have
been educated to appreciate that the embarrassing little increase in
interest rates (to preserve an over-valued pound's status on the ERM) is
more of a technicality than a higher cost of money.
So, this is a good time for couples and families to get out into the high
streets to look at all the great-value properties on offer. There are bound
to be a couple of 'just in' properties on offer in every sales agent's
office. The blunt fact is that the rest are still listed because they have
yet to sell at the asking price.
For a property window-shopper in February, when the nights still close in
early, there will be little patience for anything but the neatest sales
story. As for there being a wider choice of homes to sell, we hit the
political wall. Few homes are expected to be prepared for the new sales
season. Unless there appears to be some exceptional end-of-year performance,
that new sales season will not be until after the election. Everything
hinges on the man in the grey suit.
PISCES SURPRISES
(February 19-March 20.
News of impressive central London house and flat sales encourage
popular-newspaper headlines to hint at a house price revival. This has been
a regular feature of housing market coverage for years. The reality is that
in this most specialised of the many layers of the market a number of the
best connected and most energetic agents have used their skills to keep
selling a few high-value homes since 1988.
In fact, in this period the supply of super-prime property is thin. This
real-life supply/demand imbalance at the top of the town market stands at
odds to the number of dramatically advertised, super-luxury properties
available in London today. The difference between the real and the public
list involves extrapolating those schemes that are on the market at prices
aimed at bankers' and shareholders' eyes only.
Why should tales of big-number purchases in Belgravia have any impact on
Barnsley? Because this is the 'cheer-up' time of the election year. In any
event, Conservative party-supporting newspapers will be snapping around the
heels of housing industry chiefs to get a nice selection of 'light at the
end of a tunnel' comments.
ARIES ASTOUNDS
(March 20-April 21)
Against every rational argument, the housing 'revival' ('boom' is banned) is
here again. The popular newspapers trawl the country for tales of cheer and
resale profits as building society researchers find that, allowing for
reasonable mathematical error on a sample base that they would not like to
elaborate upon, it does seem that property values do tend to go up, all
things being equal.
Finding evidence of rising prices is no problem for a news reporting team
aimed in that direction. This is also the time of year at which builders
paste on their broadest smiles and trail exceptional items to end the
financial year on a happy note. There is also the CBI, which may be sure, if
asked, to have spotted that the recession is at an end and that all is well
again in the economy.
TAURUS TORTURES (April 21-May 22), GEMINI JEWELS (May 22-June 22), CANCER
CONFUSION (June 22-July 23)
Into the astrological void of a possible general election. An election would
dash any artificial flurry of activity on the residential market, although
housebuilders should be able to keep some of the extra viewers drawn out by
the weather and the positive press comments. Talk of a revival may have to
be artificial, but anything that draws a crowd helps the salesmen.
Once there is an election date, one can track the fortunes of the competing
parties through opinion polls, and we are unlikely to be in much doubt of
the outcome by the time it comes to a vote. Unless, that is, we have the
worst outcome: an indecisive result and a hung parliament, where the balance
of power is held by such conviction politicians as the Ulster Unionists. It
is not the housing policies of the Ulstermen that would upset the
residential property market, but rather the high probability of another
election inside a few months.
A returned Conservative government would be a comfortable outcome for most
of those operating in the private housing sector. It might have been the
signal for an exodus of good people from the threadbare social housing
system but for the evidence in December 1991 that John Major is a social
housing man at heart.
A Labour victory would open the door for 'innovative' housing policies.
Having had most of the traditional housing controls cut away over the last
decade, the process of redrawing a policy on the void would be fascinating.
The main factor for most people, however, is that since we are tied to the
ERM no domestic political party can woo us with 'that old Black Magic of
inflation'. A Labour government used to mean a surge in inflation and a run
on the pound; not any more. Those who create charts showing the impact of
domestic politics on property values have had to stop and accept that the EC
is indifferent.
LEO ROARS
(July 23-August 24)
Potentially one of the strongest home sales periods of the year - no matter
who wins the election - as prospective buyers finally start to make offers.
However, a greatly increased number of people will be checking whether a
rental does not suit them just as well.
Most of the town and country properties that have been hovering in the wings
for months before finding the right time to be 'marketed' should come into
view at this time. Launched to benefit from the shortage-induced price
fillip earlier in the year, this avalanche of good houses acts as a bar on
any increases in value for the rest of the year, and well into the spring of
1993.
This is good for vendors, good for buyers, good, in that it regenerates
turnover, for sales agencies. The only confused sounds are in the background
as headline writers try to say that the housing market is well again, but
that prices are static or weak: 'Housing Boom as Prices Slide' may hit the
mark.
VIRGO ON HOLIDAY
(August 24th-September 23)
This is reaction time: reaction to the election, to the subsequent serious
economic news (all heavyweight eco-news becomes increasingly hard to extract
once the election campaign starts); reaction to the idea that something
different might be happening. Unemployment and job security are unlikely to
be much affected, but mortgage money may not be as cheap and easy to get.
There is no way of telling how the mortgage lenders will react to the
pressure they have been put under to bail out bad payers. Whether that will
make the lenders amenable to a lively home buyers' money sale at the same
time is a moot point.
LIBRA LAUGHING
(September 23-October 23)
New statistics show that house prices nationally are 2 to 3 per cent lower
than in 1991. On the other hand, the volume of sales is picking up by 50,000
transactions a month.
This is the real - but unremarked - turning point to the housing market, the
low point of the slump in price and volume terms. However, from this time
forth there can be none of the usual price surges or slumps. Thanks to our
membership of the ERM, the bottom of the slump no longer presages a ride up
the other side.
SCORPIO SALES
(October 23-November 23)
Now is the calm after madness, the period when an overdose of facts and
counter-facts, offers and counter-offers, bargains and super-bargains wears
off and reality becomes clear again. There are a great many new houses left
unsold from last year and completed this year; there are plenty of
repossessions and near forced-sale houses and flats. In the general housing
market there will be ample stock for a more active set of buyers.
No one ever will have seen such a selection of quality country houses as the
post-election surge leads to the release of every middle class homeowner's
dream property. 'Where do they all come from?' is the usual question when
faced with a sheaf of sales details of manor houses and rectories. The
answer is that they are many idyllic country homes in the UK, but this time
around asking prices will be closely in line with what the vendors and
agents think to be fair value. Long-distance bargain hunters would not be
welcome.
SAGITTARIUS SMILES
(November 23-December 22)
The last few days outside the EC 'single market' provides an opportunity for
every TV channel, newspaper and radio station to 'go continental.' Having
been only vaguely aware of how the other 11 countries live, our stalwart
British homeowner now learns a great truism and loses a faith.
Our continental partners might have overtaken us in many things but, as
every true-born Brit knows in their bones, Britain's housing system is the
envy of the world. Seen through other's eyes, such as those who point out
that half the UK's housing stock is past its fall-down date, it can be a
shock to appreciate that what we see as a strength in the commitment to
owner-occupation may be viewed by our neighbours as an eccentric expense.
Growing knowledge about the different ways of treating housing in Europe
will have an irreversible effect on the UK market as old truths are
challenged.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Travel: Heavenly skiing in the very jaws of Hell - Skiing in
the shadow of the Eiger, one of Europe's most lethal mountains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a magnificent off-piste run, the White Hare, which starts at the
very base of one of the most terrible mountain faces in Europe - the
fearsome North face of the Eiger. When I first skied it, I discovered to my
horror that while I was cavorting in the powder, two Korean climbers were
freezing to death somewhere on that awful slab of granite. They were the
latest of many to perish on this monstrous wall.
The Eiger and the quintessential Swiss alpine village of Grindelwald have
always seemed bizarre neighbours. Separated only by the kind of meadows
through which Shirley Temple once gambolled as Heidi, the mountain has
always represented terror while the village oozed cuckoo-clock contentment.
In a sense, to gaze at the Eiger from Grindelwald is to look at Hell from
the portals of Heaven. In 1935 two German climbers, Max Sedlmayer and Karl
Mehringer, studied the mountain with a mixture of fear and elation. They
were the first men to try to scale its dreaded North face. On a quiet Sunday
morning in August they froze to death on the upper rim of the third
ice-field at 10,800 ft, a spot which came to be known as Death Bivouac. Less
than a year later, Edi Rainer, Willy Angerer, Andreas Hinterstoisser and
Toni Kurz were all killed retreating down the face.
Kurz's death was particularly distressing. His would-be rescuers, arriving
too late in the day on the ice-glazed face, had to leave him, with one arm
already rigid with frostbite, another night hanging from a rope after
getting near enough to hear him shout: 'I'm the only one alive.
Hinterstoisser came off and fell the whole way down. The rope pulled Rainer
up against a snap-link. He froze to death there. And Angerer's dead too,
hanging below me, strangled by the rope when he fell.'
The following day, a Herculean attempt by Kurz to climb down to Angerer's
corpse and cut him free failed tragically at the last moment when he
couldn't squeeze a knot through a snap-link. Kurz, all his energy drained,
died there and then. Since the first successful conquest of the Eiger's
ruthless North face in July 1938, dozens more climbers have died there.
The Eiger has no mercy.
If you make a mistake on this sheer and gigantic slab of rock that rises to
13,041 ft and dominates the Grindelwald skyline, you will be lucky to escape
with your life. Whether you die or survive could depend on people like Ueli
Frei, a 45-year-old mountain guide.
Like so many real-life heroes, Ueli Frei comes across like an avuncular,
unassuming sort of fellow. In the book The White Spider, which chronicles
both the terrible and the triumphant attempts on the North face, Heinrich
Harrer, an Austrian climber who was a member of the first successful assault
on the North face, describes this rare breed thus:
'They were wiry, well-trained types, men with frank, wholesome faces. Not
theirs the steely iron-hard features of legendary heroes, or of film-stars
of a certain stamp. One would hardly have noticed them in the ordinary way.'
Although Harrer was describing Sedlmayer and Mehringer, the first climbers
to perish on the fearsome wall, his description fits many of these quiet
mountain men, including Ueli Frei. Since joining the Swiss mountain rescue
team in 1974, Frei has achieved several climbing firsts in the Jungfrau
region - including the North face of the Gutzpfeiler, which is even steeper
than the Eiger's North face - and played a key role in dozens of rescues,
including no fewer than 12 on the Eiger wall. In many of them he has had to
be winched on to the face by helicopter.
In November 1977, after a Spanish climber had broken both his legs in an
accident, severe storms delayed rescue by five days. By the time Frei and
his fellow guide Edi Bohren were lowered on to the face, the injured climber
had been on the mountain for 11 days.
In 1984, Frei became head mountain guide for Powder Byrne, the British tour
operator, and has run their powder courses ever since. Last year I joined
one of his groups. Now the helicopter had become an instrument of skiing
pleasure instead of a vehicle to deliver stricken climbers from pain.
Our small group of five, a former army officer, Robert Williamson, and his
wife Iona, and two jewellers, Nick Silver and Pippa Galpin, plus Ueli and
myself, had a spectacular canvas of untracked, virginal snow on which to
fashion our tracks: the beautiful mountains on the other side of the Eiger
in the Bernese Oberland. Two of the classic descents - from Rosenegg, 11,972
ft, and the Sustenhorn, 11,490 ft, are reached by helicopter.
Another - an exhilarating descent through the chillingly beautiful Fiescher
glacier - can be reached via the Jungfraujoch, a shoulder of the Jungfrau at
11,329 ft from which Europe's longest glacier, the Aletschgletscher,
meanders grandly into the distance.
To reach the Jungfraujoch you take a truly remarkable journey on the
Jungfraubahn, Europe's highest rack railway. On its way to the Jungfrau, the
track curls its way into the Eiger, through the very North face on which so
many climbers' nightmares and triumphs have materialised.
The train stops at two halts hewn into the rock, and from these you can gaze
out through gallery windows at the extraordinary climbers' eye-view of the
lower half of the sheer face. It is an un-nerving feeling. From the higher
station, the Eigerwand, rescuers can climb out through a door on to the
mountain face.
From the Jungfraujoch, there is some gentle skiing for half-an-hour down the
Aletschgletscher before you reach the first major cross-roads of the
glacier, the Konkordiaplatz. Here you fix nylon skins to your skis to enable
you to climb without slipping backwards, and begin the 2 1/2 -hour slog up
to the Grunhorlucke.
From the summit, after an exhilarating descent through a massive snowfield,
the Fieschergletscher, one of the most beautiful glaciers it is possible to
ski through, beckons you into its maze of icy ridges, slabs, snow-bridges
and crevasses. Without Ueli, you simply would not make it.
Like a wily fox, he sniffs out a route. Sometimes the path he chooses looks
like a dead end, or veers off in the opposite direction from the one you
would expect. On one occasion we inched our way along a ridge with crevasses
on both sides.
It was difficult not to feel scared. Ueli grinned. He had seen it all
before. Few skiers are privileged to visit this glacier. It could be on
another planet. Yet the resorts of Grindelwald and Wengen, teeming with
recreational skiers, are only a few miles away. As we glided this way and
that, we finally exited from the icy maze and headed on across the snow
scrublands of the Fieschertal valley.
Finally the snow ran out, and we faced a gruelling but invigorating walk
down to the pretty village of Fiesch, where there was just time for a cold
beer at the railway station. Although we had skied in pretty much a straight
line, the journey back took two train and two car rides to reach
Grindelwald.
The next day we did it the easy way, by helicopter. The gleaming machine
clattered us deafeningly from Mannlichen up into the giddy and jagged world
of mountain peaks interspersed with cliffs, columns, cols, cornices and
crevasses, before setting us down at Rosenegg.
The descent took us through steep, deep and virginal snowfields first. Even
Ueli was grinning. 'Ski to my right,' he instructed us, 'and watch out for
the wulperdings]' The wulperding is the local variety of the mythical 'snow
snake' which lurks just below the surface, intent on tripping up
powder-skiers who get too cocky.
Later, as we reached the ice-fields, we had to be a lot more cautious. At
one particularly awkward stage, where a fall would have sent us cascading
down the ice across the glacier floor, Ueli roped us up and lowered us one
by one to safety. We had skied for hours from one solitary helicopter lift.
Every time we paused and looked back we were greeted by a stirring sight:
five pairs of tracks meandering down a beautiful snowscape of craggy cliffs,
slabs of ice the size of buildings and vast glacial valley floors. Perfect
powder was giving way, now, to perfect spring snow, which is much
sought-after and is rather like skiing on tiny glazed ball-bearings.
We wanted to do the whole thing again, and with a helicopter it was a luxury
we could indulge. The machine gave us a ringside seat as we re-traced our
tracks in the powder, turn after turn, marvelling not so much at the
satisfactory contours but at the complete isolation. Apart from our traces,
signs of any other people were as rare as Yeti tracks.
At the end of the day the smile on Ueli's weatherbeaten face was as broad as
ours. A remarkable climber and skier, there is only one challenge that
eludes him - the North face of the Eiger.
'The best time to climb the wall is during August, September and October,'
he said. 'This is also the busiest time for the mountain rescue service. But
I am still keen to do it one day.'
Powder Byrne is at 50 Lombard Road, London SW11 3SU, tel: 071-223-0601. It
offers four different off-piste courses, including an introductory course,
depending on skier ability. Each is led by a Swiss mountain guide.

FT  04 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Backhanded compliments
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME there may be whose New Year resolutions revolve round weighty matters -
mastering the finer points of the Maastricht summit, resolving the paradox
of Schrodinger's cat or climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. Then there are those who
plan to lose a stone or two, give up smoking, be a nicer person - you know
the kind of thing.
Me, I have just one simple resolution: I would like once, just once, to beat
my husband at tennis. It is not that I do not get near to it. I do, very
near. There I am almost home and dry, leading five games to one, with my
serve to come, when from the other side of the net I am aware of something
stirring.
The unconsidered forehands, the casual cricket drives from inside the back
line, the double-faults, the inadequately lifted lobs dry up - in their
place comes a maddening array of what I call dirty tricks but could perhaps
more sportingly be described as clever shots.
There are balls hit deep to the backhand corner where they winkle out the
inconsistencies in my new double-handed backhand, wicked little cuts to the
front of the court that spin off side-ways and, most maddening of all, balls
that stop dead in their tracks. In no time at all it is seven games to five
 -to HIM. Again. With the second set he takes no chances and closes it out
6-1 or 6-2.
As you can see, I need help. Two summers ago, HTSI readers may remember, I
took myself off to the Pierre Barthes tennis school at Cap d'Agde where nice
Alain took my game apart, pieced it together again and sent me back home. It
was worth it - He with the beastly repertoire gets the odd fright or two and
has to bestir himself to beat me, whereas it used to be a piece of cake.
Who better to take my problem to than Roger Taylor, once the golden hope of
British tennis, now sage and guru to tennis hopefuls of all levels?
Chewton Glen, on the fringes of the New Forest in southern England, is the
plushest of plush country house hotels. Having installed two splendid indoor
courts to supplement its outdoor one it has started a programme of
occasional tennis week-ends where Roger Taylor himself runs the clinics.
You arrive as early as you can manage on a Friday afternoon but whatever you
do try not to miss (as I did) the Friday practice session, which runs from 4
pm to 6 pm. I arrived just in time for a tip-top dinner and found some
fellow pupils already discussing the finer points of each other's shots.
On Saturday morning the real business begins. Four to a court, two courts in
all, with Roger and Matthew Salisbury (the hotel's resident tennis supremo)
in charge, the programme begins. In two groups of eight, we play for two
hours in the morning, two in the afternoon. Forehand, backhand, cross-court,
down-the-line, forehand, backhand, cross-court, down-the-line. Little games
are played. Some points won, some lost.
No white hopes of British tennis here but nor is anybody a real duffer. We
all seem much of a muchness, tolerable club players all, and though I am not
the best my mortal fear of being the one nobody wants to play with is not
realised. Everybody is very, very keen. Nobody is there to fool about.
Roger Taylor manages to seem interested in each and every one of us. Our
little triumphs are greeted with delight, our difficulties taken seriously.
As the weekend progresses every aspect of the game is tackled - from the
proper grip for the serve (hold the racquet as if you were going to chop
wood), how to add a bit of kick, where to stand in doubles. In between we
head for the swimming-pool, dining-room, jacuzzi, gym, or we lie in the
treatment rooms having our stiffness soothed away.
The course is not cheap but then you are getting the expertise of a great
player as well as the real luxury of Chewton Glen. There are, I suppose,
cheaper ways of trying to improve your tennis but I cannot think of any that
are more fun. And no, I haven't beaten him yet but I will, I will . . .
The next two tennis week-ends at Chewton Glen with Roger Taylor will take
place on February 14 and 15 and March 13 and 14. Write to Chewton Glen, New
Milton, Hampshire, England BH 25 6QS. (Tel: 0425-275341.) Prices are Pounds
140 (exclusive of VAT) per person per day which includes rooms, breakfast,
lunch, dinner and tuition.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Cookery: Carrots to cleanse one's conscience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY of reckoning is nigh, I mean the 12th day of Christmas when most of
us feel a little fat and queasy. This is the season when health farms and
spas rake in the bookings. Half the population of France will be murmuring
'mon pauvre petit foie' while on the British side of the channel the sales
of Alka Seltzer and Rennies must reach a peak.
I love the architecture of Bath, I enjoyed L'Annee Derniere a Marienbad, and
I once had a a strange encounter with a News of the World type of vicar in a
little known Scottish spa, but the idea of actually taking the waters, like
visiting a health farm, jogging and pumping iron, is alien to me. I prefer
the notion of a brief cleansing spell of meals majoring on carrots, lettuce
and spring water taken in the privacy of my own home.
Carrots and spring water sound horribly abstemious, and I am sure they could
prove a penance, but there is no reason why their consumption should not be
pleasurable. Health considerations and pretty designer labels apart, bottled
water usually tastes better than tap, which, in my area, seems to be dosed
with Olympic swimming pool-quantities of chlorine.
As for the carrot, it may be one of our commonest and cheapest vegetables
but it is also one of the best gastronomically at this time of year -
colourful, richly flavoured and sweet - and of course full of healthy
virtues (bursting with fibre and vitamins A C and E).
The carrot dish that sounds ideally suited for serving now in this low-key
New Year resolutions week is Carottes a la Vichy. The spa kitchen title
suggests an austere little recipe designed to cleanse, purify and tone the
body, mind and spirit, and the method does indeed call for cooking the
carrots in spring water. But there is more to it than that. A king size
nugget of butter and a spoonful of sugar also go into the pot, and it is
their presence, reduced to a syrupy glaze at the end, that give the dish its
delectable character.
If you are serious about making up a little for extravagant eating over
Christmas you would do better to tuck into the no-fat crunch of a grated
carrot salad simply dressed with the juice of an orange and a pinch of zest.
As it happens I relish a plain salad like this but if it strikes you as too
rabbit food for words, try adding a grating of ginger and a scattering of
seedless white grapes, or a bulb of Florentine fennel cut into slivers, or a
handful of fresh chopped herbs.
A mixture of mint, lemon thyme and parsley is good. Add wild rice, burgul or
couscous for a more substantial bite, or offer something bready on the side.
Good choices for non weight watchers might be hoummus with strips of hot
pitta bread, rounds of tapenade-topped ciabatta, and wholemeal toast spread
with crushed sardines.
Also to be recommended is a hot carrot puree soup, particularly if it is
spiked with orange and bay or elusively-scented cardamom. But my favourite
carrot dish of the moment, one that exudes a hint of opulence rather than
budget-beating penance, is a Turkish-inspired pilav. Do not expect to lose
weight by eating it.
CARROT AND CARDAMOM PILAV (serves 5-6)
This is one of those relatively rare dishes made without meat that makes me
think, briefly at any rate, that I would be happy to stop being a carnivore.
Having said that, I must admit that it is not only worth eating as a dish in
its own right, but it also makes an unusually good accompaniment to roast
pheasant, guinea fowl and quail, in which case the quantities given here
will serve many more people, of course.
1 lb carrots, scraped and coarsely grated;  3/4 lb rice, thoroughly rinsed
under a cold running tap to wash away some of the starch; the seeds from 15
cardamom pods, crushed with pestle and mortar; 3 tablespoons extra virgin
olive oil; 4 shallots, chopped; the finely grated zest of 2 oranges; 2
rounded teaspoons honey; 1 1/4 pt good stock; 3-4 oz split and well toasted
almonds.
Warm the oil in a large flameproof casserole and soften the shallots for 2-3
minutes. Stir in the crushed cardamom and the well drained rice and cook
gently for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the carrots, orange zest and a good grinding of black pepper and stir
continuously over medium-low heat for two minutes to warm the carrots and
anoint them with fat.
Add the honey, hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Stir to mix and bring
quickly to the boil. Cover tightly and simmer over the lowest possible flame
for 12 minutes or until the rice is cooked to your liking.
Drive off surplus liquid at the end if the pilav is sloppy, or moisten with
a splash of hot stock enriched with an extra spoonful of oil if the mixture
is too dry.
Check seasoning, stir in the well-toasted nuts and serve with a salad on the
side. Chicory and orange go particularly well - and tidily use up the flesh
of the fruit whose zest has gone into the pilav.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Wine: A world of bargains for every palate - A wine buying
strategy for 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATURE seems to be helping Brussels break down Europe's trade barriers. Last
year's frost-shrunken harvest in western France, especially of white wines,
has had all sorts of interesting side-effects on a hard-pressed industry.
Smallholders in the Loire who depend on the disposal of their white grapes
or wine for their annual income are probably suffering most. Some of
France's larger co-operatives and commercial merchants have been looking,
with varying degrees of enthusiasm, over the Pyrenees for white wine to
flush through their idle bottling lines.
This has led to a change of emphasis for the Midi's militant vine-growing
tendency - from anti-Italian to anti-Spanish - and the odd spot of bother in
Carcassonne for northbound wine tankers.
Safeway has been saving money by using bottling facilities of the Plaimont
co-ops in Gascony on its own-label white Spanish Penedes (Pounds 2.69). Some
of the larger Loire companies are offering white La Mancha - through gritted
teeth - on the principle that at least there is no shortage of this dry
Spanish white, unlike the local Vouvray or Muscadet.
CHEAPER WHITES
Most of the dry Spanish white available in the UK, especially that labelled
La Mancha, is very good value, the produce of the handful of large companies
which have invested sufficiently in modern winemaking technology. There may
be little real character in the wine but for Pounds 2.49 from Sainsbury's,
for example, it delivers an extraordinary degree of vibrant fresh fruitiness
 -just the thing for those who used to buy Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne
which is in short supply.
A little further up the price scale, forget the elastic-edged Muscadet
region but seek out finds from the highways and byways of what is loosely
termed 'regional France.'
Just as we had all finally been convinced that white bordeaux was a jolly
good thing - sulphur, under-ripe Sauvignon and dirty wood all things of the
past - the frosts decimated the 1991 crop. If you are a fan, it is worth
snapping up the best 1988s that remain and the fine 1990s. Oddbins and
Thresher/Wine Rack have a better selection than most.
EVERYDAY RED
The shortfall (and less-than-thrilling quality) of 1991 red bordeaux matters
less at the bottom end of the market which is still awash with jolly good
wine made in 1990 and 1989. Even at the lowly level of AC Bordeaux, on sale
here for around Pounds 3 a bottle, there is much pleasure to be had - indeed
there is a great deal of sense in buying these, generic commune wines and
petits chateaux clarets from the super-ripe 1989 and 1990 vintages to drink
now, although traditional merchants would rather sell their stocks of tough
1988s first. The high street chains and supermarkets offer best range and
value at this modest level.
Also good value, at under Pounds 4 a bottle, are many of the southern Vins
de Pays from unfamiliar and parochial Pays. Quality of these was excellent
in 1989, 1990 and even 1991. For full-bodied reds under Pounds 5 look to the
Cotes-du-Rhone 1989 and 1990. Oddbins has a clutch.
NEW WORLD
Those looking for a wine to mark 1991 will either have to wait until the
port vintage is declared (as it undoubtedly will be) in 1993 or look to
California where the signs are that quality was exceptional for reds - at
least as good as 1987 and possibly as good as 1974. The California wine
industry is shaky and competition from Chile has pushed down the price of
Cabernet grapes, so in the medium-term California wine should seem less
outrageously priced - surely?
Australia continues to offer keen prices and is tackling the need to offer
an array of styles. Some of my favourites are the subtlest Chardonnays which
meet Old World classics head on but at about half the price, such as
Bannockburn (Oddbins), Dromana Estate and Mountadam (Haughton Fine Wines of
Nantwich), Leeuwin Estate (Domaine Direct, London WC1) and Seville Estate
(Raeburn of Edinburgh).
GRAND WINE
Last year's vintage yielded precious little to offer futures in this spring.
Will the wine trade survive a year without an en primeur campaign to keep
the cash flowing? Expect to see extensive discounting of fine wine (Laytons
of London NW1 cut its prices on selected 1989 red and white bordeaux as long
ago as November) and sales of larger-than-usual bin ends. This is a good
time to stock up on the exceptional claret decade just past: 1987, 1985 and
1983 for current drinking; 1989, 1988, 1986 and 1982 for future pleasure.
It will probably be many years before we see another run of great sweet wine
vintages half as good as 1988, 1989 and 1990. Buy Sauternes and mid-Loire
wines for the long term; Alsace, Jurancon and Monbazillac for the medium
term and fine German wines at all ripeness levels for current and future
thrills.
Rhone 1989s and 1990s from the best estates are far more likely to disappear
from the market than to disappoint, and Chateauneuf-du-Pape has to be the
world's most user-friendly full red. Prices of most burgundies still look
like obscene relics of the inflated 1980s but serious collectors will want
to buy 1990 reds and 1989 whites from the top domaines. The Beaune
merchants' cellars are reputedly piled high with unsold stock; can no one
negotiate a deal? For now, Mercurey, Givry and Rully offer best value by
far.
AUCTIONS
Falling prices in the saleroom are all very well, except that they keep
potential stock out of it. There are bargains to be had at Christie's and
Sotheby's in 1985 and 1986 clarets, vintage port and such fine German wine
as come under the hammer - at prices that we will never see again - but be

FT  04 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: A new look for the piste de resistance -
Snow is falling, the skiing season is upon us. Picking the best gear for the
slopes
</HEADLINE>

FOR THE dedicated ski fan this winter has brought the best news for years.
In New Zealand they have just had more snow than many skiers ever remember,
while from Aspen to Alpbach and Avoriaz the snow is falling, falling,
falling. By now you are unlikely to need any prompting - you are probably
one of the thousands who have rushed to give the ski-tour companies THEIR
best season for years.
You may, however, be a mite concerned about what you should wear. Has a new
fad or fashion sprung up that you have yet to discover? Never fear. Fads and
fashions come and go and most of us can take them or leave them without any
disastrous consequences. What really makes the difference, particularly when
it comes to skiwear, is technology - it has this habit of marching on and
leaving some of us marooned in what was once the dernier cri and now turns
out to be very vieux chapeau.
The real problem with skiwear is that it has to cope with a vast range of
weather conditions. Nevica, a highly-regarded skiwear manufacturer, sums it
up perfectly in its latest brochure: 'It could be -20`, a whiteout and
snowing hard. It could be still as night and shrouded in mist. It could be
baking hot and thawing all around. Or it could just be that perfect day with
untracked, fresh powder and glorious sunshine.' It could . . . it could. It
could also be all four in the course of 24 hours.
So what do you wear? The real answer is the best that you can afford.
The experts seem to agree that there is nothing to beat Goretex for keeping
the wet out and the warmth in. The problem is that it is expensive, so
several companies have produced less expensive fabrics which have some of
the same qualities - Tenson, for example, uses a textile called Airpush
which has microscopic hairs on the surface of the fabric to trap air and
keep water droplets out. The Japanese company Descente uses Entrant, and so
on.
For wearing under shellsuits or waterproofs Fleece has to be the textile of
the cold climate set - made from 100 per cent polyester, it is used by many
manufacturers, including the ultra eco-chic Patagonia, and combines great
lightness with softness and warmth. If you do not need a whole garment try a
fleecy neckwarmer for Pounds 10.99 - it keeps the draughts out, adds warmth
and on cold lifts you pull it up around your ears.
You may or may not be relieved to know that the fashionable florescent look
of a couple of years back has died a terrible death. Colours are more muted,
much more chic.
In Euro ski circles skiwear has come full-circle - the sleek ski-pants or
leggings topped by an anorak or parka which have been seen on the smartest
urban streets are now to be seen again on skiers' backs, where they came
from in the first place. In the US the skisuit still reigns supreme.
If, back home, you wear Doctor Martens, black Levis and leather jackets then
the right-on piste-cred name to look out for is Mambo - needless to say it
is heavily into black. Bad Boys and Oxbow are two other names to look out
for - both go in for clothes that could transfer happily from piste to
street.
There are some fun new gadgets to look out for, all stocked by Snow + Rock
and other good ski shops. If you have always wondered if you were going as
fast as you thought you were the ski-pole watch (Pounds 9.99) will tell you.
Cat tracks prevent you slipping on ice - you put them on over the sole of
your ski-boots. Pounds 10.95.
For the cold-feet sufferer there is the Hotronic (Pounds 79.95) boot-heater.
insole is slipped into the boot and is connected to a battery-pack clipped
on to the back of the boot. It can be taken in and out easily and put into,
say, climbing or walking boots. Salomon has ski boots with a polar fleece
lining - Force 7 costs Pounds 199.50 and Force 9, Pounds 234.50.
Finally, in skiing circles it is never long before talk comes round to Knees
and their problems. Help is at hand. Snow + Rock has joined forces with a
team of sports physiotherapists who will fit customers with a rigid frame
brace called an MVP.
Dion Taylor, a ski buff who works with Snow + Rock, has a torn cruciate
ligament, one of the most common skiing injuries, and he tells me that ever
since he took to wearing an MVP brace he skis with scarcely any problems at
all. The Pounds 299 fee includes the consultation and the brace. For Pounds
520 there is what could be called a Rolls-Royce service which offers a
similar but slimmer and stronger brace.
Those who keep office hours might appreciate that Snow + Rock at 188
Kensington High Street, London W8, is open on Sundays (until Easter) from 11
am to 5 pm. The branch at 150 Holborn, London EC1 is open until 6 pm six
days a week and the Birmingham branch (14 Priory Queensway) opens until 5.30
five days a week, except Thursdays, when closes at 6.30 pm. It also has an
excellent mail order service - ring 0753-830868 for a free full-colour
catalogue.
From Luhta, a Finnish company which specialises in fashionable, extremely
reasonably priced skiwear made from a combination of cotton and polyamid
(you should take great care over how you clean it - ideally wash it by
hand), come the two current looks - the tapered ski pants (Pounds 61.50) and
large jacket (Pounds 173.95) and the one-piece suit (Pounds 246.95).
There are lots of colours - black, red, pink, turquoise and lilac.
Available from all branches of Olympus Sports, Blacks, Ellis Brigham, Snow +
Rock and Harrods' skiwear department.
One of this year's major skiwear themes from Chervo - a blouson jacket with
a white body and 'silky' inserts. It has lots of pockets and a detachable
imitation fur hood. In 54 per cent polyamide and 46 per cent polyester,
Pounds 379 from Snow + Rock branches.
When it comes to that essential accessory - sunglasses - the wrap is the
shape to go for: they are fashionable this year and give much better
protection from dangerous rays than ordinary sunglasses. This pair by Block
sports Gamma reflective lenses which may look a bit sinister but give good
visibility and high protection. Pounds 27.99. from good ski shops including
Snow + Rock.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Perspectives: The hostage saga that still goes on - The
Britons who remain trapped in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JADRANKA PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE return of Terry Waite the British hostage saga was thought to be
over, but the last of British hostages in the Middle East have yet to be
released.
A number of Britons who were last year held hostage by the Iraqis were
trapped again when they resumed work in Kuwait earlier this year. The irony
of it is that their captors are Kuwaitis, for whose freedom British soldiers
died.
Driven by what is perceived as greed, insecurity and congenital suspicion
the Kuwaitis, who last year saw their power and some wealth vanish
overnight, are trying to claw back what they think they are owed. As if the
persecution of Palestinians and the stateless Arabs for alleged
collaboration was not enough, they are now meting out some rough justice to
the allies as well.
In a form of bonded labour several Britons have been forced to work out
their 'debt' before they are set free. Their punishing experience, first at
the hands of the Iraqis and now the Kuwaitis, has finally moved the Foreign
Office to intervene on their behalf.
At the centre of this saga is the state-owned Kuwait Oil Company, before the
invasion one of the best employers in the country, whose staff enjoyed rare
privileges.
KOC, the production arm of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, formed the backbone
of its oil industry and with its control of the wells became the main target
of Saddam Hussain's plan to destroy Kuwait. During the Iraqi occupation the
KOC lived up to its pre-invasion image. It said it had a moral obligation to
help the families of its men held in Iraq as human shields or hiding in
Kuwait.
'We were the only Kuwaiti company looking after the families during the
crisis,' says the manager of the KOC's London office Abdulla Al Abdulrazzak.
The company offered a living allowance to hostages' families and paid
mortgages and rents as well as school fees. Since the then Finance Minister,
Sheikh Ali Al Khalifa Al Sabah, gave assurances that Kuwait would honour its
contracts. This was understood to be a payment in lieu of salaries. The
families were heartened when ROC offered flowers and reassurance in their
moments of hopelessness.
The change came with the liberation. The payments stopped in April but the
Britons were told to be ready to report to work. Those who were recalled
were in for a shock when in a sudden change of rules they found that their
contracts were no longer valid. Large deductions from their salaries were
made, and explained as repayment of the cost of supporting the families
during the crisis. The company claims that the payments were advanced
against benefits settlement.
Disgusted and angry, several decided to leave Kuwait only to discover that
they could not get release letters or exit visas.
It took David Hudson, KOC's superintendent of maintenance planning, five
months to get his. Hudson, who has landed another job overseas, left behind
at least three colleagues who have been prevented from leaving.
Other Britons who have not settled their pre-liberation bills and loans face
captivity for the second time in less than two years. All the debts have
been punched into the airport computer to make sure nobody escapes the law.
In the months after the liberation the British government seemed impervious
to the hostages' pleas for help. Jimmy Smith, who refused to risk a return
to his work at KOC's Ahmadi hospital, was told by the Foreign Office: 'We
don't deal with individual cases. If you don't feel well go to your GP, and
if you have no job ask for unemployment benefit.'
The British government dismissed the hostages as simply unemployed and,
according to support groups, wanted to sweep the issue under the carpet. Not
until October, 10 months after their release, and only after a special study
showing that one in four hostages still suffer psychological problems and
need professional help did the government take their plight seriously. It
allocated funds for special trauma units, agreed to meet hostages for
consultations and to deal decisively with the Kuwaiti employers.
The Foreign Office summoned the Kuwaiti ambassador and according to a source
close to the FO 'gave him a dressing down' about the KOC's treatment of
Britons. The Foreign Office also went directly to the company according to
Abdulrazzak.
Since then the KOC has decided to suspend the deductions from the salaries
of Britons 'with a view to writing them off.' But Abdulrazzak denies that
any Britons are held in Kuwait against their will.
'We are not a terrorist organisation, we are not holding anyone against
their will,' he says. He admits though that after the liberation the company
was slow to respond to people's complaints and operated in an 'organised
chaos'.
'We are solving the problems as we go along,' he says. But there is still
confusion about new contracts and redundancies. Abdulrazzak says the new
contracts are for one year only and offer bachelor instead of married status
and frequent holidays.
He announced there would be redundancies among about 50 Britons who are
still waiting to be re-employed. This is part of an overall plan to out
staff by two thirds because the company's production facilities including
its 700 oil wells, were destroyed in the Gulf war. Three thousand workers
have already been laid off or left of their own free will. A group of 15
Britons has engaged a solicitor to sue the company for breach of contract.
The solicitor, Paul Bacon, from Nottinghamshire, says he will try to settle
out of court. Failing that he could resort to litigation in British courts.
Jadranka Porter was a journalist in Kuwait who stayed throughout the Gulf
War. She is the author of a book Under Siege in Kuwait - a Survivor's Story,
published by Victor Gollancz, in June last year.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Perspectives: A head above the parapet - The gospel
according to William McCrea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'In country, town or city, wherever man is found
folk spend their time a grumbling at everything around,'
 - from 'The Grumblers' recorded by the Rev William McCrea in Nashville,
Tennessee, 1986.
WHEN the Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, started
to cry during our interview, the troubles, tragedy, hopelessness, despair -
call it what you will - of Northern Ireland, stood as drearily as the
province's weeping mountain scenery on a winter morning.
Here was a true fanatic - the most popular gospel singer in the province, a
simple-minded father of five from a tucked-away Ulster farming town, a
Presbyterian fundamentalist, a deeply-emotional politician - who was
prepared to carry the heavy burden of a community's collective grief.
If you want a view on the IRA, the locals say, speak to McCrea. He will put
his head above the parapet. His small family house is surrounded by security
technology. He has police protection. Three cousins have been murdered by
terrorists. When we spoke he had just returned from the funeral of a
policeman, murdered by the IRA, who had once been his bodyguard.
You may mock his timbre, his irritating protestations, or ridicule the
lyrics on his albums - but you cannot laugh at McCrea. There are not many
jokes in Northern Ireland politics.
'I'm a very resolute person,' he says, restraining the tears. 'I'm
determined that the enemy will not deter me from doing that which is right.'
I was shown around his Calvary Free Presbyterian Church, on the outskirts of
Magherafelt, by the labourer working for free to help build a Sunday school
extension. Clambering from the scaffolding, he brushed some of the mud from
his black shoes and took me through the church's side door.
The foundation stone of the brick and pebble-dash building was laid in 1975
by the Rev Ian Paisley, the voluble, larger-than-life leader of the Free
Presbyterian Church who has dominated Northern Ireland's Unionist politics
for two decades. Gaunt on its hillside perch, overlooking patchwork fields,
the building is surprisingly comfortable, a welcoming church rather than of
strict Presbyterian austerity.
Free Presbyterianism dates from 1951, when Northern Ireland's most
conservative evangelistics concluded that the Rome-ward drift and apostasy
of Irish Presbyterianism was beyond redemption. From its earliest years, the
church has been almost a museum example of traditionalist religious fervour
in an increasingly secular Europe.
In grey bricks above the altar, were set the words: 'Woe is unto me if I
preach not the gospel.' The labourer, a devotee of McCrea, caught the line
of my sight. He was a thick-necked man wearing a ripped vest and trousers
that struggled to cling to his belly. 'That is the God's wrath, up there,'
he warns.
McCrea, now 43, came here first in 1968, running a three week gospel
campaign. He was a young man, fresh from the college Paisley had set up in
Belfast to train ministers for his growing church. A year later he returned,
preaching in a windowless wooden building that quickly became too small. The
Calvary church, advertising McCrea's 'Old Tyme Gospel Evening Services' has
been built for expansion.
McCrea was born into an strict Irish Presbyterian family, not far from
Magherafelt, and dutifully attended church each Sunday. 'You went and you
knew nothing else,' he says. But on June 4 1957 (he has no difficulty
recalling the date), the nine-year-old William McCrea was 'saved' - the
experience of conversion that characterises full members of the Free
Presbyterian church.
'I realised that before God that I was a sinner,' he says. Reconciliation
could only come through Jesus Christ upon the Cross. 'That night I simply
asked the Lord Jesus to come into my heart. I asked the Lord Jesus to
cleanse me from my sin.'
He entered the ministry of the Free Presbyterian Church, inspired by
Paisley's imprisonment in 1966 following disturbances at an anti-ecumenical
march against the Irish Presbyterian leadership. 'I realised that here was
someone who was suffering because he believed the Bible, because he preached
the gospel,' says McCrea.
Life for him, in many ways, is as simple as that: defending the beliefs that
he is, literally, prepared to risk his life to maintain. The Bible is the
divinely inspired word of God; Jesus Christ died to atone our sins. He
adheres to the seventeenth-century Westminster Confession of Faith in which
the Catholic Pope is the Anti-Christ. He believes in sex only in marriage
and respect for the Sabbath.
It is a prickly defensiveness. He is no ecumenicalist; McCrea is the
antithesis of a consensus politician. He can see no other way. Little wonder
Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, finds it so difficult to find a
political accommodation in the province.
I asked if he saw himself as an emotional person?
'Yes, I do,' he say quietly.
'What would you have been like, if you hadn't been saved?'
'I don't know. I couldn't answer that question. I'd just say, 'thank God the
Lord did take control of my life'.'
Religion brings him an inner peace and joy, he argues, that gives him the
strength to withstand the threats and intimidation; to stand up to terrorism
where others might crouch.
'I have been the target of attacks. I opened my front door one night and a
man was standing there with a revolver pointed straight at my brow. I have
been left to tell the story but you are always conscious that death is never
far away. I suppose nothing I ever do now will spare me as far as the
terrorists are concerned.'
McCrea, the politician, is as fierce in his defence of the Union with the UK
mainland as he is of the gospel. Free Presbyterianism and the Democratic
Unionist Party, established by Paisley in 1971, do not have to overlap but
frequently do. They are similarly conservative and equally convinced that
their's is the true way.
The DUP is the brasher, less stiff-collared cousin of the larger Ulster
Unionist Party, drawing its support largely from working class, urban and
rural, voters.
McCrea's style is shrill; his soft singer's voice does not stretch easily
when trying to cower the House of Commons or journalists with words of
fire-and-brimstone. 'The honourable gentleman is working himself up,'
Margaret Thatcher retorted in her best school ma'am manner after a
particularly hysterical intervention.
He has been an MP since 1983 - from when, he says, unionists have been
systematically betrayed by the government. Once he sent Thatcher his album,
'How Great Thou Art', only to find that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
signed by the former prime minister, was to give the Irish government a say
in the affairs of the province. He, like all his unionist colleagues, was
horrified at the prospect of foreign intervention in a part of the UK.
Constitutional uncertainty has to be ended, he insists, with the government
making clear, 'that no bombing, no shooting, no campaigning - political or
otherwise - will destroy the union.' Then the IRA will have no purpose and
could be eradicated by a determined counter-offensive from the British
security forces, unfettered by politicians.
'It is so easy for other members of parliament to carry on with the little
niceties of parliamentary privilege and parliamentary duties. They haven't a
clue what it is to spend the last eight years as an MP, going from home to
home, family to family, seeking to give them succour, help, comfort.'
That leaves little scope for embracing the agenda of nationalist politicians
or the Catholic church, although he says he has nothing against individuals
or their right to a particular viewpoint. 'It seems to be all right for a
Roman Catholic to aspire to be part of an all-Ireland but it seems to be a
sin for us to aspire not to be. I can't have a dual passport.'
Does he shed a tear when he hears of a IRA terrorist who has been killed by
the security forces? 'I grieve genuinely that a person has been cut off and
taken out into eternity but I realise that a person who espouses violence
and murder as a means of achieving a political end can expect to die by the
sword.'
He is not a good European but turns to Biblical prophecy for comfort. 'The
fall of the system, yes, the European Community and the fall of Romanism.
Read the 17th chapter of the Book of Revelations. You get a wonderful view
of the fall of Babylon.'
Within the DUP he is taken most seriously. During the summer 'round-table'
talks engineered by Brooke he is widely regarded as having urged Paisley to
stand resolute behind the DUP's demands - to the despair of more moderate
colleagues. Some believe he might eventually succeed Paisley, now a close
friend.
Compared with his politics, the best-selling, 'singing Billy' is a far
softer character. Positively soapy, in fact. But he taps a rich vein of
fans, stronger still than his popularity as a politician. In spite of having
no formal training, there are silver, gold and platinum discs framed on his
sitting room wall.
'The best key to be in is B natural', he says. The style is 'country 'n'
gospel' which means hymn tunes or Biblical themes set to a twangy country
'n' western backing, 'in the way that I feel the Lord wants me to present
it'. He has recorded more-or-less an album a year for two decades, usually
in Nashville, Tennessee.
He has no reservation in expressing his love for Jesus Christ. It is pure,
unadulterated and unsophisticated. His first producer tried to mould him.
'They were trying to change my ministry and put in it something which wasn't
me and I said, 'Lord, give me the grace to stand up against this, give me
the strength to say no.' And I did. That was the best decision I made in all
of my singing.'
What you get is almost the pure, heart-opening McCrea: 'Majesty, worship his
Majesty. Unto Jesus be glory, honour and praise,' run the lyrics of one.
It is almost, but not quite, McCrea. As we neared the end of our
conversation, I asked if he were not, in fact, a grumbler at heart? Whenever
he speaks - in Parliament, on television, even here in the comfort of his
sitting room, he is on the defensive, full of demands.
He looked shocked at first but, to my surprise, did not deny the charge. He
believed in self-improvement: 'Maybe someday I'll be able to come on and
tell you all the good things that are happening.'
One day, perhaps.

<TEXT>
AFTER Christmas there were suddenly these bunches of letters. CEI, CSI, GUS
 -they all meant CIS or Commonwealth of Independent States. On the continent
the acronyms were accepted at once - perhaps because the word 'commonwealth'
exists only in English and Russian and must be rendered as 'community' in
other languages.
In Russia it is clear that the new organisation is not seen as one that
matters. In Moscow, Kuranty, the liberal daily, summed up the changes: 'The
world saw Gorbachev off in a respectfully reserved manner but without
sentimentality, not only because everyone was reconciled to the change of
scene in the Kremlin, but also because our foreign partners will not have
permanent allies but rather permanent interests in Russia. Their interests
coincide with our state interests in many aspects. Russia alone can exercise
to the full the role of a Eurasian bridge as an alternative, rather than an
antagonistic, centre of world influence.'
Kuranty concluded that the West would do all it could to shore up Russia's
great power status: 'It appears ready to cover our backsides here too. From
a high moral viewpoint it is inadmissible that Russia should be admitted
anew to the United Nations, kept in the Security Council, or invited to join
in talks that have been underway for some time. The West is awaiting
Russia's assurances about paying off debts since the bankruptcy of a great
power can bring about considerable changes on the international scene.'
This mixture of studied incoherence, demotic vulgarisms and a Chekhovian
insouciance in the face of disaster is a feature of the Russian press today.
It is not enough to sustain all those experts who used to make a living
trawling the barren oceans of Pravda and Izvestia editorials but it is a
sight more interesting.
If the Russian press is refreshingly new, the German has gone back to
another era. There is nothing like the advent of a new year to depress the
Germans. The turn of this year is associated with the legislation allowing
people to look up their old Stasi files. That is really going to set the cat
among the pigeons. The East German secret police kept many miles of
documents on 4m of its own citizens and 2m westerners. People can now look
up their own files on demand. There has already been a notable case of an
outspoken woman who found the Stasi was kept informed on her activities by
her husband.
So we have seen the re-emergence of that archetypal German word -
Vergangenheitsbewaltigung. It means overcoming the past and was used
formerly to describe the responsibility of the first post-war generation of
non-Nazis.
In Der Spiegel, historian Eberhard Jackel wrote a piece entitled 'The double
past' about the relationship of the Germans with their history. He feared
that the revelations of the horrors of the GDR could vitiate the memory of
the horrors of the Nazis. He concluded, 'We can only become one people when
we come clean about our double past, and that can be done decently only when
we differentiate our history in sober comparison. In this context
unification has thrown us back into the 1950s. There is yet again much to
do.'
A British businessman and private detective were found in Geneva to be
investigating illegal sales of arms to Iraq. Both have been arrested. (Neue
Zurcher Zeitung).

FT  04 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: 'Hellish' year leaves many losers
and a few winners - Nick Garnett revisits small companies he has written
about over the last 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE PAST year has been pretty hellish,' says Jenine Moody. 'Our turnover
will be down about 40 per cent in line with the corporate hospitality
market. In October and November the company's phone hardly rang.'
With its six double decker buses, support vans and large marquees catering
for the Bollinger boys during the Lawson boom years, Moodies found itself in
the eye of the past year's recessionary storm. But anyone seeking examples
of the damage which a recession has inflicted on Britain's tiny businesses
need look no further than the scores of companies featured in this column
over the past 15 months or so.
Some of the weaker ones with precarious financing have thrown in the towel.
Others proved remarkably resilient, pumping up turnover but watching
helplessly as profit margins shredded. Those engaged in a bit of property
speculation on the side were caught cold. Some infant companies saw growth
forecasts turn into fiction. In only a few cases did last year prove to be
fun and fruitful.
Bootz Spatz and Shooz gave up the ghost. It manufactured all-weather
footwear in Harrogate; its founder Michael Cooney had hoped to raise
production from 25,000 to 40,000 pairs and break even for the first time in
the company's short history. In 1990 the company had lost Pounds 58,000 but
Cooney hoped to swing the company into the black by nearly doubling turnover
to some Pounds 600,000.
'We just couldn't run it as a single production company,' Cooney says. 'It
wasn't working what with the way the economy has gone and Americans
undercutting in Europe. We were finding it more and more difficult.'
For 'a few tens of thousands of pounds', the company's assets and trade name
were sold to an Essex clothing company which now makes the same label
footwear in its own factory.
Garden Tours, specialising in horticultural holidays from Pounds 400 to
Pounds 1,500, is at least in serious difficulty or worse. The company
vacated its Milton Keynes premises without leaving a forwarding address.
'We would like to know where they've gone,' says a manager of the business
premises it used. 'People have been ringing in and we haven't been able to
tell them anything.'
The company's owner, John Weltz, admitted in a radio interview a few months
ago that the company was in trouble. He was using money deposited by new
customers to pay off customers who had had their holidays cancelled.
A former sales manager with Ladbroke Hotels, Weltz had been confident that
the type of customer Garden Tours serves possessed pockets immune to
recession. It has not worked out quite as he expected. Garden Tours was set
up in 1986. In 1989 it had a claimed turnover of Pounds 600,000 and a net
return of 18 per cent.
It has been a difficult time in other ways for companies in the
entertainment and leisure game. Laurence and Sue Cowley successfully raised
turnover at their country hotel, Glazebrook House in Devon but the property
market's steep slide is putting them under strain.
They signed a contract two years ago to buy a disused abbey with planning
permission for a leisure complex. That contract is costing them money but
they have been unable to sell Glazebrook, a necessary move to finance the
deal.
'We haven't even had one looker since we put it up for sale a year ago,'
says Laurence Cowley. The 13-bedroom house in four acres is on the market at
Pounds 700,000. 'We are committed to buying the other property. It's a very
sticky position. We are treading on ice.'
In spite of a virtually complete drop-off in business entertainment, the
company has picked up other trade - more social functions, seminars and
conferences, increasing turnover from the previous year's Pounds 160,000.
The Cowleys have also pared costs. 'We have changed our wine supplier,
dropped back on staff, renegotiated the laundry contract, changed the
grocery wholesaler and we are using two or three butchers instead of buying
from the same one.'
The Alternative Shooting Company set up in August 1990 offered a different
type of clay pigeon shoot. Banks of clay birds are hidden away on country
estates providing a greater illusion of live bird shooting. The company
turned out to be hopelessly optimistic about its first year's trading.
Instead of doing 125 days shooting it did 20 and managed only a tenth of its
target turnover of Pounds 500,000.
'We have been concentrating on keeping our head above water,' says Wendy
Plummer, the marketing and reservations manager for the company based in
Burford, Oxfordshire. Corporate hospitality has again proved a disaster
zone.
'The difficulty has been not only getting a company to take a day's shooting
but for those companies to get people to come on them because so many are
worried about their jobs and don't want to take time off work.'
Open days, cheaper at Pounds 150 than the 16-gun corporate day at Pounds
190, have become much more important than Alternative Shooting expected.
Plummer says, however, that the general concept has been accepted by the
shoot fraternity, the company now has a substantial client data base and a
target next year of 70 shooting days.
Some companies really drove up turnover last year. Watts &amp; Wright, a
hand-crafted fitted kitchen and bedroom maker in Walsall, raised sales to
Pounds 250,000, double that of the previous year. Profit was also up at
about Pounds 30,000. The company's two owners, Tony Watts and Adrian Wright
increased staff by two to eight and have started to land larger jobs in the
Pounds 20,000 range. The market for Watts &amp; Wright's relatively high quality
bespoke furniture is very tough as the rest of the kitchen and bedroom
market.
'The market is very, very competitive. Its like a dog fight now,' says
Wright. 'We are often selling domestic appliances at cost to get the job.'
The company is being drawn further from its Walsall base. 'There is not much
life in the West Midlands.' The two men have decided to keep their salaries
unchanged at Pounds 18,000.
Bob Dowdell, director of New Era Cosmetics, sums up the past 12 months. 'We
thought it was going to be tough but we didn't think it would be this
tough.'
The company started in March 1990. Its principle product is up-market pot
pourri and it turned over Pounds 105,000 against its target of Pounds
120,000. Like so many production businesses, New Era is expanding sales
quickly and expects to have done Pounds 200,000 for the whole of 1991. But
it is the same story of shrunken margins.
'Rather naively we thought we might break even in the first year. We
actually made a loss of a few thousand pounds. We will make a loss this year
as well of about the same amount.'
Retailers and brand name suppliers of pot pourri for whom New Era produces,
demanded price drops from the West Sussex business of about 5 per cent over
the year.
'People are also delaying payments. We did not envisage that it would be as
much a down turn as this, but our blends are different and we have not
sacrificed quality.'
The company, which also makes aftershaves, fragrance sprays and eau de
toilette has started exporting to Sweden, Holland, Greece and Italy. 'We
have been getting a name for ourselves in the market. and we are also
developing our liquid filling facilities.' Dowdell and his partner Brian
Charman together with another shareholder raised a further Pounds 20,000 to
add to the businesses capital. 'We are not over-pessimistic but I don't want
to borrow heaps of money.'
Pam Jose is completing her second year at North-East Recycling, a
Newcastle-based company handling paper, polythene and other recyclable
waste. 'It has been very tough,' she says. 'Paper prices have kept on
spiralling downwards by about 10 per cent last year and I'm expecting
another drop this year.'
Nevertheless, the company's puny turnover of Pounds 20,000 in its first nine
months has become Pounds 77,000 in its second full year. Instead of making a
loss of Pounds 15,000 it is breaking even and Jose is taking a salary from
the business, allbeit just Pounds 5,000 a year.
The company improved the layout of its warehouse and baling operation, is
buying a portable baling press so it can carry out compacting at the site
where it collects polythene and wants to purchase a baling machine for cans.
The company will drop cardboard recycling because of low prices and is
increasing its interest in polythene and polythene film which form half of
its business.
Among its network of suppliers and customers, North-East Recycling takes
material from local shops, breweries and industrial companies and sells
recycled material to polythene reprocessors for bin bags and all weather
sheeting, paper mainly to paper mills and cans to Alcan.
'We are creeping forward inch by inch,' Jose says.
J Chapman has been manufacturing sporting bags, hand and travelling bags in
Carlisle, Cumbria since 1984. Two years ago it had a brilliant 12 months. It
has also been busy during 1991 selling to its main customers, stores and own
brand label bag suppliers. But its owner, John Chapman and wife Jo have been
made all too aware of the general recession.
'Altogether it has been more difficult than we expected,' says John Chapman.
'Most customers are now wanting very quick deliveries of smaller quantities
and that makes it very awkward. In the past three weeks I think there has
been a sudden deterioration. Some customers cannot take the goods we are
making even to their own design because they have no cash. We have had three
or four letters in the past few weeks from liquidators of companies we have
dealt with.'
The company expected to turn over more than Pounds 500,000 last year but did
not achieve that. Margins are also down from 30 to about 18 per cent.
Chapman is disturbed by what he perceives as a continuous slide in the
quality of material he buys, including cloth, brass fittings and leather.
'The quality is deteriorating substantially. Perhaps these companies are
passing material which they would have rejected before. Perhaps they are
cutting down on staff and therefore quality control.'
If such deterioration in quality is now becoming endemic in other
industries, that is a depressing feature the recession has bequeathed
Britain.
