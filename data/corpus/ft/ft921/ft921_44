FT  04 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The sweet taste of success

NO MATTER how bad a recession, everyone has to eat. And two little
businesses serving the human palate show that you can start out on your own
at any age.
Pensioners and retired school teachers, Arthur Davy and Kathleen
Suchland-Smith started making chocolates for fun back in 1986 and gradually
moved into commercial production. 'The past year has been fantastic, so busy
it's absolute chaos,' says Davy.
Producing chocolates using only natural ingredients, Clarke's of Loch Ewe is
now selling 50 per cent more than it was doing at the beginning of last
year. In December it had orders for up to 280 boxes a week, 12 large
hand-wrapped chunks of confectionery per box. The enterprise will become a
limited company this month and two younger people, with capital, are coming
in to help run the operation. 'It's going to be a serious venture from now
on,' Davy says.
In the past six months, Clarke's outlets have grown to include two shops on
London's Fulham Road and its mail order business has taken off. Working with
just a few staff at its minuscule 'factory' in Coldstream on the
England-Scotland border, the two founders continue to buy their dried
apricots and raisins in Edinburgh and, from Glasgow, the ground almonds
which they use to make their own marzipan.
Prices of raw ingredients have changed little over the past 12 months and
Clarke's has held the price of its broad range of sticky edibles. Its
whisky-flavoured Glenlivet sells mail-order for Pounds 8.80.
Clarke's is no threat to Cadbury, but it is giving the two pensioners a lot
of fun. 'It's something to get out of bed for,' Suchland-Smith says.
Fasta Pasta was started in 1990 by 27-year old Ben Fox. Last year, Fox was
able to add a second home delivery outlet in London's Clapham to his
existing one in Fulham, after an the injection of capital from two private
investors. All deliveries of rigatoni, linguine and spaghetti are done by
bicycle ('we want to make it the Body Shop of fast food') and turnover in
the first full year was Pounds 127,000.
The company's Fulham premises now act as a kind of centralised kitchen and
Fasta Pasta has begun selling cold pasta and sauces to restaurants and pubs
for reheating. With four full-time and 21 part-time staff, controlling
labour costs is now one of Fox's headaches.
People still eat in the recession, but they do not always want to fork out
what they once did for a lunch time snack at the office or an easy meal at
home in the evening.
'People are not spending quite as much now,' says Fox. 'They still want a
nice pasta dish with a nice sauce but are not wanting to spend Pounds 4.50
on it.'
As a result Fox has introduced a delivery pasta salad for Pounds 1.80 in
competition with the ubiquitous sandwich.

DIXONS, headed by Stanley Kalms, has long been regarded as one of the stock
market's favourite 'recovery plays'. However, the company is likely to
disappoint some followers by emitting cautious noises about the state of the
electrical goods retailing market when it reports interim results on
Wednesday.
Pre-tax profits may have fallen to Pounds 20m from Pounds 27m. Christmas,
which falls after the end of the interim period, is also not expected to
have been as buoyant as previously hoped.
The UK retailing division should have continued its profits improvement, but
any advances will have been dragged down by losses at Silo, in the US, and
reduced contributions from property and interest.
Securicor, the security and parcels delivery company, and its 51 per cent
controlled sister Security Services, report full-year earnings on Thursday.
They are likely to reflect an improvement from their 40 per cent stake in
Cellnet, the mobile telephone network, which disappointed at the half-year.
The companies are still dominated by Cellnet earnings. While Cellnet has
suffered from a higher rate of disconnection than Vodafone, its main
competitor, profits are likely to have benefited from a recession-induced
cut in capital spending.
Securicor is estimated to have made pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m (Pounds
51.9m). The pre-tax figure for Security Services, which is consolidated, is
expected to be Pounds 21m (Pounds 36.1m).

On October 26, under the heading 'Inheritance tax and Pets', we said the
donor's estate would be liable for payment of inheritance tax if the
seven-year period was not achieved. We omitted to say that the primary
liability falls on the donee, and that the liability of the donor's estate
is confined to where the tax remains unpaid for more than 12 months after
the end of the month in which the death occurred. The Capital Taxes Office
will not necessarily pursue the personal representatives for the donor in
such circumstances.

No. the use would not amount to adverse possession, and in fact would not

<TEXT>
I HAVE been resident abroad (in Zambia) for the past 36 years during which
time I have classed as non-resident and not ordinarily resident for UK tax
purposes. I have no connection with the UK apart from immediate family
(mother and brother) a bank balance and some investment trust shares. I do
not intend to return to the UK as a permanent resident. I expect to retire
in Zambia where I have resident status. I am concerned about my position
with regard to domicile, particularly with regard to inheritance tax. Would
I be correct in assuming non-domicile status after all this time or will I
have to obtain a ruling from the UK tax authorities? If so how do I go about
this? Also, under the terms of my mother's will I am due to inherit her
house on her death. If I kept this house for holiday purposes would it
effect my non-domicile status?
It would appear that you have acquired a domicile of choice in Zambia. If
you do not change your present intention that domicile will remain. The
Inland Revenue will not be prepared to rule on this at a stage when there is
no claim which raises the question of your domicile as an issue. Your use of
a house in England for holiday purposes should not affect the position, so
long as your use of it does not reflect a more permanent approach to your
visits to the UK.

MY brother-in-law died in November 1984 and I was named an executor in his
will. My co-executor died in June 1990. I have the complete record regarding
the liquidation of assets and the final distributions which were made
according to his will.
The benefactors have gained their inheritances and no query is expected. How
necessary/desirable it is for me to continue to hold any records of the
transactions? They are somewhat bulky and I would prefer to dispose of them.
We think that you should retain all documentation until at least six years
after completion of the administration of the estate. If the final
distribution was made in 1985 you could consider disposing of the documents,
otherwise you should wait before doing so.

Pounds 56,000. What would our position would be on the event of the building

Each depositor is entitled to the protection afforded by section 27 of the
Building Societies Act 1986 (90 per cent of up to Pounds 20,000) regardless
of the number of accounts he or she holds. Where there are joint accounts
the amount of the investment is divided by the number of people who are
beneficially entitled. Thus, each of you and your husband would be deemed to
have half the investment and so you would each have Pounds 28,000, Pounds
20,000 of which is protected, so Pounds 40,000 of the joint fund is
protected. If the account were held on trust for one of you only, only
Pounds 20,000 would be protected.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A costly bonus share dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE has recently submitted a claim for repayment of tax paid in the year
to April 5 1991. Her income is derived from dividends and interest; the
largest item is dividends on BP ordinary shares which she takes as shares
rather than cash.
The tax inspector has ruled that dividends taken in this form do not qualify
for tax repayment, although the gross amount of the dividend has been used
in computing my wife's income, consequently taking her above the allowance
limit. Can you advise me if the inspector is correct?
Yes, by virtue of Section 249(4)(b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988.
It is a pity that your wife did not ask about the tax consequences before
she decided to elect to take her BP dividends in the form of bonus shares.
The law on this point has remained unchanged since 1975 (the 1988 Act was a
consolidation of the existing legislation).

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Vogel struggles to revive Prolific
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROLIFIC has turned the corner after a difficult run. In January 1988, its
parent, the privately-owned Provincial Insurance Group, decided to demerge
its unit trusts and life and pensions products, leaving Prolific partly
owned by its management and partly by Provincial's shareholders.
After a year, Prolific felt that it needed additional capital and underwent
a time-consuming and distracting public auction to find a new parent. In
November 1989 it was bought by Hafnia, the second largest Danish insurance
company. During this time, one of the key fund managers left for personal
reasons. Although performance was good in 1988, and reasonable in 1989, 1990
was a bad year.
Michael Vogel, who was promoted to managing director of Prolific Asset
management in 1990, had the task of restoring Prolific's image and
performance. One of his first steps was to stop running both the sizeable
funds on his own and to concentrate on High Income, Prolific's bell-wether
fund. Prolific's entire asset management division, including the unit trust
group, was reorganised along geographical rather than product lines.
There was also some discussion among managers over whether the group should
stick to its traditional investment approach. Typically, Prolific invests in
small to medium sized companies with market capitalisations from Pounds 100m
to Pounds 800m. Vogel sees a number of advantages: 'They have got over the
first hurdles which small companies usually face, the management is usually
stronger and broader, they have generally got good bank financing if they
have needed it, but they are not into problems of scale.'
After the 1987 stock market crash, these types of companies went out of
favour as investors flocked to the safety of blue chips. Performance
suffered, all the more so because Prolific likes to take bold positions and
hold them across a number of funds.
Vogel says: 'We like to concentrate portfolios - even the biggest funds may
have the top 20 stocks making up some 60 per cent of the fund. We like to
get very close to the management of those businesses, and if necessary we
will sit with substantial holdings, even if they are likely to go through
relative periods of underperformance.'
Prolific's managers felt they had the right approach, and stuck with it.
Eventually the tide began to turn and a number of funds have improved over
the last year.
The upturn is steady rather than spectacular: of the 11 funds launched
before 1991, five are above average for their sectors over the three years
to December 1, and six below. Over one year, seven are above average and
four below.
The strongest performers in 1991 were High Income, North America and
Technology and Europe. The weakest were Special Situations and Convertible &amp;
Gilts.
Vogel admits to being pleasantly surprised by the revival in High Income's
performance over the last year. Its income record - and that of the extra
income fund, too - is good, with an 18 per cent annual net return for the
last five years. This year, says Vogel, it will be a struggle, but the
dividend payment will increase again.
The main difference between the High and Extra Income funds is that Extra
Income makes four payments of dividends to unitholders a year and holds more
convertibles to support a higher yield. Extra's performance has also
improved, although it has not done as well as High Income.
In North America, the fund tends to invest in smaller companies than in the
UK. Performance follows the US major-minor company cycle, which turned with
a vengeance in smaller companies' favour at the end of 1990.
American Income's record is less impressive, although it improved in 1991.
There is a problem finding enough high yielding equities to keep up a good
yield (4 per cent, double the US market), so nearly 25 per cent of the fund
has been invested in convertibles, which have underperformed.
Technology is Prolific's riskiest fund, as about 80 per cent is invested in
US high-tech stocks. Performance jumps around quite dramatically, but this
year, the fund is Prolific's strongest performer, in the top five of
International funds.
In November, the European trust was split into two: a new European Income
trust (Pounds 21m) and European Growth (Pounds 16.5m). Providing income and
growth in Europe is even harder than it is in the US, and it was felt it was
counter-productive to try to do both. Nevertheless, the former European
Growth and Income trust has had an excellent 1991, which manager Caroline
Morrison attributes to taking the view in March that Germany was going to
slow down, and France looked better, as well as getting the stock selection
right.
Unfortunately, it is not so good elsewhere. Special Situations is in the
bottom 25 per cent of its sector over one and three years. Although it rode
out the early part of the recession, it was over-invested in US dollar
earners such as Hanson, Siebe and BTR during 1990.
Because it is one of the most concentrated portfolios, the underperformance
of big holdings has a considerable effect on the rest of the fund. It is
also quite heavily invested (50 per cent) in smaller companies, capitalised
below Pounds 700m, which have been out of favour until recently. Manager
John Thornton is convinced that some of the larger holdings like Hanson will
come right again and that the cycle has turned in favour of smaller stocks.
Prolific's convertible and gilt fund, the biggest in the market, performed
well enough until a couple of years ago when it suffered from its
comparatively high exposure to convertibles - only 5 per cent of the fund is
in gilts. It then sunk under the weight of poor quality paper coming on to
the market in rights issues. Vogel does not intend to alter the mix, and
says 'we are sweating it out'.
Prolific also launched two trusts in 1991 - Blue Chip and Recovery. The
latter is run by Thornton and Vogel, who spent a couple of years working for
David Tucker, M&amp;G's recovery fund manager.
The message which often emerges from an unit trust group is that steps have
been taken to improve performance, but that it is too early to say whether
they have worked. At Prolific, the message is that steps have been taken,
and they seem to be working.
This article resumes our series on fund managers.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: How to profit from charity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHARITABLE land trust has substantial tax advantages and can enable the
owner to control the destiny of the land forever.
If the preservation of your land is more important to you than leaving it to
your heirs, or if an Inheritance Tax bill might force your heirs to sell the
land, you might like the idea of setting up a charitable land trust.
The Charity Commissioners cannot grant charitable status to every private
land trust. The land must be of benefit to the public in some way.
Typical examples of what the Charity Commissioners will accept as
'charitable' are the protection of the countryside, conservation of gardens
of scientific interest or outstanding beauty, the preservation of the
environment, the provision of agriculture or woodlands or the preservation
of rare breeds of animals useful to humans.
Of course the public must be able to enjoy the land. This is usually
satisfied, where a building is concerned, by a commitment by the trustees to
allow the public access for at least 90 days a year. Most landowners do not
find this too onerous.
What about people who have land or buildings which would benefit from being
owned by a charitable land trust but is also their home or means of
livelihood? Transferring the land into a charitable land trust does not
necessarily mean they will have to vacate or find another job.
If the land to be transferred is a house of national interest, the normal
practice is for your charity to grant you a lease for exclusive occupation
of a relatively unimportant part such as the servants' quarters or stable
block. Of course, when the public do not have access you can then occupy the
whole house. If the land is agricultural or a woodland, your charity can
grant you a tenancy to farm or manage it for commercial rent.
The fiscal advantages of setting up a charitable land trust are also
substantial. This should not only enable you to transfer the land to the
trust without selling it but also allows the land to be maintained in a cost
effective way.
The transfer to the charity, for example, during your lifetime is free from
Capital Gains Tax and on your death is free from Inheritance Tax with no
limit. This means that if you are a landowner (or you have inherited land
within two years) and are concerned about the Inheritance Tax, a charitable
land trust could be the answer.
Furthermore, once the land is in the charity little or no further tax need
be paid. Gains made in a charity are tax free: for example, if the trustees
sell a farm cottage, the gain is free of CGT - provided it is applied for
charitable purposes such as the further maintenance of the estate.
A charity is also exempt from tax on income such as the rent paid by a
tenant farmer and on all annuities and interest paid to it, provided in
every case the money is used by the charity for charitable purposes.
Also, other charities can make gifts to the trust without jeopardising their
charitable status.
One area of taxation which is not covered by exemption is trading. The most
obvious example is running a shop or restaurant on the land. However this
can easily be overcome if the charity sets up a company to run the shop. The
company can then covenant its profits to the charitable land trust.
The profits will be held according to the constitution of that trust, which
you cannot change and by professional trustees over whom you have little
control. However, if you set up your own private charitable land trust you
can specify the constitution (subject to the Charity Commission's
constraints) and you can appoint the trustees - one of whom could be you.
You may be particularly concerned about an ancient woodland which you think
should be preserved. This can be specified in the constitution and you can
appoint trustees whom you believe will ensure this is done.
A charity also goes on forever. This is unlike a private trust which can tie
up your land for only two generations or so. The idea of keeping your land
in trust forever may not particularly appeal to you. If not, you could grant
your charity a lease, but the lease will have to be for a substantial period
of time - the minimum acceptable is usually 99 years. The freehold can then
be retained by the family.

EVEREST Foods had poor results in 1990, at which point three directors
bought shares at prices of between 72.5p and 80p. Following the company's
recent offer, two directors have each sold 300,000 shares at 168p, although
two other directors have increased their holdings.
Substantial buying has been seen in Tarmac, with Sir Anthony Bamford buying
a further 200,000 shares at 99p. The price has fallen by almost two-thirds
this year with this recent purchase following one in October at 160p. Sir
Anthony was joined by a fellow non-executive director who purchased 100,000
shares.
Richard Peskin, of Great Portland, the property company, has continued to
increase his holding, purchasing shares at 152p. This purchase follows the
acquisition of 500,000 shares earlier this month at about the same price.
Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, has taken the opportunity to top
up his holding following the failed offer for Racal Electronics.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: World seeks to break a spell of
recession - Leading economist Giles Keating forsees a difficult 1992 for
financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR was a tough one for the world economy and 1992 looks to be little
better. Mainstream forecasters such as those at the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development envisage little pick-up until the
second half, and the reality is that the recovery may have to wait almost
until 1993.
The problem is one that always bedevils macro-economic policy making:
politicians and central bankers are so concerned with looking in the
rear-view mirror that they fail to see the dangers ahead.
As 1992 begins, the bias of policy-makers around the world appears too
concerned with containing inflation. Promoting growth is still a very
secondary consideration.
A short tour around the world's major economies illustrates the point. In
the US, gruesome pre-Christmas data finally turned the Fed decisive, the
discount rate being cut by a full 1 per cent. But all the rest of the year
had seen only a slow and cautious easing. Result: output and employment have
been flat or falling, and the near future looks no better, given collapsing
consumer confidence, auto layoff plans, and weak money supply.
Plans for fiscal stimulus have become so embroiled in the battle between
Administration and Congress that their only contribution has been to depress
growth by making the bond market nervous.
In Japan, the reduction in interest rates has been miserly, reflecting the
determination of the Bank of Japan's governor Mieno to avoid a return to the
'bubble economy', which in 1989 saw a land price boom and the Nikkei Dow at
almost twice today's level; and taxes are actually being raised to offset
weak revenues.
The result is that growth is likely to fall below 3 per cent in 1992, which
Japan counts as a recession. One bright spot is that massive funds from the
Postal Savings Bank could be mobilised for emergency investment spending, if
the recession gets out of hand.
Closer to home, the Bundesbank is imposing high interest rates on every
European country. This policy is right for Germany, where it is needed to
curtail inflationary pressure left over from the post-unification boom. It
means a continued period of stagnation in the German economy, but that is
acceptable because unemployment is reasonably low.
However, harsh monetary policy is not right elsewhere in Europe, where
unemployment is high and rising, and inflationary pressures are subdued.
Unless there is a realignment of currencies within the ERM, lower interest
rates will have to wait until German rates start to fall - in late spring or
beyond. The result will be a miserable first half year in the European
economies, and then not much improvement until lower rates finally have an
impact well into the second half.
The impact of this international gloom on the UK is compounded by domestic
factors: the weak state of the banks, with at least one clearer paying
liquidating dividends; a moribund housing market which will be no more
resuscitated by Norman Lamont's offer to pay stamp duty than it was by more
generous deals from the housebuilders last year; and political uncertainty,
which damages consumer confidence and increases the interest rate-premium
over Germany demanded by the foreign exchange market.
Dealing with this outlook requires some unusual thinking by private
investors.
Policy-makers' excessive concern with reducing inflation is good news for
fixed-interest government bonds worldwide, so a global bond fund should form
a significant part of any private investor's portfolio. If they are
well-managed they should be able to take advantage of the rise in the dollar
that is likely now German interest rates have peaked and US rates are near
the trough.
In the UK, gilts have benefited from the worldwide trend to lower inflation
and should do so again in 1992, because yields - still around 10 per cent -
are attractive to institutional investors, many of whom expect inflation to
stay close to 4 per cent. But as the election approaches, political
uncertainty will at times push gilt prices down temporarily.
The equity market outlook is more equivocal. Provided that long-term
interest rates really do come down further, valuations in the UK, the US,
Japan and France would be slightly conservative. So if there are no
unpleasant shocks, there will be significant support for prices at current
levels, especially for companies with dollar earnings, once investors sense
that recovery is finally coming. Be warned: it may be necessary to wait to
mid-year or beyond for that to occur and the risk of unpleasant shocks is
substantial.
Worldwide, the rumblings in Russia are compounded by the much closer threat
of banking difficulties. In the UK, the market has the election
roller-coaster to cope with. It is a situation in which the upside potential
is not large, while there is a small but clear risk of a substantial
downside move. So buy one of the special funds that go up in line with any
rise in the equity market, but offer your money back if the market falls.
These option-based funds have very high hidden charges but right now may be
worth the money.
What better way to finance them than by selling any bank shares you may
still hold? You could also check the banks and building societies where you
hold cash deposits. If you have more than Pounds 20,000, it could be wise to
spread it round to take advantage of deposit insurance schemes.
Some canny people will have unusually large amounts of cash on deposit this
year, since they will have sold their house and be living in rented
accommodation. Rental yields, at least in London and parts of the south, are
currently so low that you can sell (if you can find a buyer), move into
better accommodation, and finance the rent out of money from those deposits,
or from saved mortgage interest. When you come to buy back in a year or two,
prices will not be any higher and could well be down further.
Giles Keating is chief economist for Credit Suisse First Boston.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Rothschild life launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW life assurance company opened for business this week.
It may be starting off in a recession but it has the benefit of a famous
name - J Rothschild Assurance - and Sir Mark Weinberg, the man behind the
success of Abbey Life and Hambro Life, as its chairman.
The target market for the new company - and its 180-strong salesforce - is
the better-off investor.
About two-thirds of its salesmen come from Allied Dunbar and are subject to
a one-year moratorium on doing business with their old clients. However,
they are relying on such clients to refer friends and acquaintances to the
new company for business.
JRA is offering a wide range of products, from critical illness through
personal pensions and endowment policies to unit trusts. The one area which
the company admits it lacks a policy at present is permanent health
insurance.
Nevertheless, it is quite a broad list for a start-up company. It has been
able to achieve this, partly because it has subcontracted the administration
of its policies to Scottish Amicable.
Fund management is divided between three companies - J Rothschild Investment
Management (whose chairman is Nils Taube), Scottish Amicable and M&amp;G.
With products such as the personal retirement plan, investors will have the
choice of these three management groups, running a total of nine funds.
The unit trusts, which mainly come from the old Bishopsgate stable, include
growth, international, greater European progressive, North American &amp;
international and PEP progressive; two further trusts, UK High Income and
Far East, are managed by M&amp;G.
JRA will be a niche player. It is only aiming for a market share of 0.5 per
cent this year and 2 per cent in five years' time, when the company hopes to
float on the London stock market.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Now is the time to top up your TESSA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to TESSA. Anyone who opened a Tax Exempt Special Savings
Account in January last year can this month pay in their second year's
instalment, up to a maximum of Pounds 1,800.
Given the high rates on offer in 1991 - the average rate was around 12.9 per
cent - TESSA holders should be able to have more than Pounds 5,000 in their
accounts earning tax-free interest in 1992.
If one assumes an average interest rate of 9 per cent for the next four
years, and that an investor puts in the maximums in each year (Pounds 1,800
in both 1993 and 1994, and then Pounds 600 in 1995), the total value of a
TESSA on maturity should be about Pounds 12,500.
Since many people have yet to open TESSAs, it is worth repeating the
advantages of the account. Interest is paid tax-free, provided the capital
is left in the account for five years. An investor can withdraw net interest
during that period, but not the tax-free element.
The five year time scale has probably deterred most people from opening a
TESSA. But this is not a good reason for them to hold back. Most people will
simply be putting money in a TESSA which previously was held in a building
society account. If they withdraw their capital before the five years are
up, all that happens is that they will not get the benefit of tax-free
interest - in other words, they will be in the same position as if they had
left the money in the normal building society account.
The only real disadvantage of TESSAs is that many institutions impose
transfer penalties. But these tend to be fairly small and their effect will
be outweighed by the fact that the interest rates on many TESSAs are more
attractive than those offered on normal accounts.
So, if you have not opened a TESSA to date, open one now. And if you already
have one, pay your second instalment.
The table (a shortened version of the one we published on December 14) shows
the ten best and worst performing Tessas of 1991. It is based on a lump sum
of Pounds 3,000 invested on launch date, and assumes that rates prevailing
in mid-December continue until the anniversary. Those looking for the most
attractive rates of the moment should consult the Best Rates for Your Money
table on Page IV.
One building society complained that, in our December 14 table, we did not
include bonuses which would be credited at the end of year five (although we
did include bonuses credited at the end of year one). We did this for the
simple reason that we wanted to show the actual value of a TESSA at the end
of year one - only that value will accrue compound interest.
A bonus paid at the end of year five is obviously not worth as much as a
bonus paid now. A fair comparison would have involved discounting that bonus
back to a present value - a calculation which would have required us to
establish a subjective discount rate.
One further point. In year one of TESSAs, some institutions offered high
interest rates and no bonuses; others offered high bonuses and low rates. It
may be that those institutions which offer high bonuses at the end of year
five will pay lower interest rates towards the end of the TESSA.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: More companies to sponsor PEPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE COMPANIES are stepping forward to sponsor their own single company
Personal Equity Plans, which became available to investors on January 1,
writes Philip Coggan.
Investors can put up to Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP in any one tax
year, on top of the Pounds 6,000 they can place in a general PEP. Income and
capital gains are tax-free.
As a rule, sponsored single company PEPs will offer lower charges than plans
from independent managers. The Weekend FT contacted the stocks in the FT-SE
100 index to find out whether they were offering sponsored PEPs.
The following FT-SE 100 companies are sponsoring their own single company
plans (managers in brackets):
Argyll (CC&amp;P), Bank of Scotland (itself), BAT (Bradford &amp; Bingley BS), Blue
Circle (CC&amp;P), British Airways (BA itself), British Gas (CC&amp;P), BP (B&amp;B),
Forte (CC&amp;P), Glaxo (B&amp;B), Grand Met (B&amp;B), Guardian Royal Exchange (CC&amp;P),
Hanson (CC&amp;P), ICI (B&amp;B), Land Securities (B&amp;B), Legal &amp; General (itself),
Lloyds Bank (itself), Marks &amp; Spencer (CC&amp;P), National Westminster Bank
(itself), NFC (itself), Pilkington (CC&amp;P), Prudential (itself), Sainsbury
(B&amp;B), Scottish &amp; Newcastle (Bank of Scotland), Severn Trent (B&amp;B), WH Smith
(James Finlay Assoc), Smith &amp; Nephew (CC&amp;P), Smithkline Beecham (B&amp;B), Tate
&amp; Lyle (B&amp;B), Thorn EMI (CC&amp;P), TSB (CC&amp;P), United Biscuits (B&amp;B), Wellcome
(B&amp;B), and Whitbread (B&amp;B).
Companies in the Footsie which say they 'intend to' sponsor a PEP include:
Barclays Bank (Barclays Stockbrokers), Boots (CC&amp;P), Inchcape (B&amp;B), Lonrho
(Godwins), Midland Bank, Northern Foods (B&amp;B), Powergen, Reed International,
RTZ (B&amp;B), Shell, Tarmac, Tomkins and Trafalgar House (Barclays
Stockbrokers).
The following Footsie companies say a sponsored plan is under consideration:
Abbey National, Allied Lyons, Anglian Water, Bass, BET, BOC, British
Aerospace, BTR, Commercial Union, GEC, Guinness, Ladbroke, MEPC, MB Caradon,
P&amp;O, Reuters Holdings, RMC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Insurance, Sears,
Vodafone and Willis Corroon.
Footsie companies with no plans to launch a PEP are:
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, Associated British Foods, BAA, British Steel, BT,
Cable &amp; Wireless, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Eurotunnel, General
Accident, Great Universal Stores, Hillsdown Holdings, Kingfisher, Laporte,
National Power, North West Water, Pearson, Rank Organisation, Reckitt &amp;

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Co-op strikes gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CO-OP BANK's promise of a free gold card for life to those who applied for
it before January 1 1992 seems to have paid off. This week the bank said
that it had issued about 70,000 cards to 55,000 customers. Some applications
are still in the pipeline but the bank says it expects to have over 67,000
accounts eventually. 'We are overwhelmed by the response we have had,' a
Co-op bank spokesman said.
The Co-op card is now one of the most popular British gold cards. American
Express, the leading player in the UK gold card business, is believed in the
industry to have around 140,000 gold card customers. Barclays, the second
largest gold card issuer, has 134,000.
The Co-op card is aimed at the 'high rollers' - people who use their cards
much more than the average. 'We believed that if we got the high rollers in,
we could make money on the card by offering it free for life when everyone
else was introducing a charge,' says a spokesman.
Despite adverse publicity about the numbers of credit-worthy people who were
turned away, the bank says it refused far fewer people than it expected.
There were 90,000 applications and it looks as if 23,000 will be
unsuccessful.
Co-op was looking for gold card customers aged over 25, who owned their own
homes and earned more than Pounds 25,000 a year. 'We got a much higher
standard of applicant than expected,' the bank says.
One reason for its popularity was good luck: the Co-op launched its card in
the week after National Westminster and Royal Bank of Scotland announced
annual charges on their cards.
Now that the January 1 deadline has gone, the chance of getting a
free-for-life gold card from the Co-op has passed. The next best deal
available is probably a free Visa card from one of the dwindling band of
issuers who do not make a charge: these include TSB Bank, Giro, and National
&amp; Provincial Building Society, although these do not offer the additional
benefits of a gold card.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Thoughts of a fund manager - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE last chimes of midnight died away on Tuesday night, professional fund
managers must have breathed a sigh of relief. The FT-SE index had risen 6
per cent over the Christmas period, chalking up half that gain on New Year's
Eve. Those fund managers who had stayed in equities in the autumn, shrugging
off the market's wave of pessimism, were relieved of nearly half the penalty
of loyalty: FT-SE ended 1991 only 7 per cent below its September peak.
However, the London market's surge - from 2345.4 on the FT-SE on December 23
to 2504.1 yesterday - took place on very low volume. Market-makers set their
price quotations in the light of New York's strong performance during the
period, rather than on the basis of any real supply and demand pressures in
London. As the chart shows, movements in New York were faithfully echoed in
London a day later: when New York soared ahead, London followed at a
slightly more modest pace; when New York eased, as in the closing days of
this week, London backed off too.
The question that awaits Monday's trading, therefore, is simple: will fund
managers buy at these prices? If institutional investors decide that the
end-year run-up was simply an unexpected bonus, but not a true guide to the
London market's value, then prices will drop back down again. If they decide
today's prices are more realistic than those of only two weeks ago, then
they will be willing to continue buying, in self-fulfilling anticipation of
the traditional January surge.
Fund mangers' bath-time thoughts are always relevant to the private
investor, because institutions are the dominant influence on UK share
prices. But they are particularly relevant now, after a rally as
precariously based as the one we have seen over Christmas.
Here's a summary of the views of one successful fund manager, pondering some
of these issues yesterday:
Is the market overvalued? No: shares are now close to fair value, having
looked very cheap a couple of weaks ago. By international standards, London
still looks cheap, especially by comparison with New York. The uncertainties
of the year ahead - an election, the uncertain start to economic recovery
and so on - are fully reflected in share prices.
Is the latest rally over? Probably not. London usually tracks New York
closely, and earlier this week there was quite a gap between the two as US
share prices accelerated ahead. The gap is now partly closed, but there is
some way to go before it is eliminated.
Is the election a worry? Yes, but not because Labour may win. In fact, a
Labour victory might not be a bad thing (though it would probably lead to
the market trading at a slightly lower multiple of earnings). The market
would be much more concerned, however, by a hung parliament: that would
really be a worry.
What other factors are at work? German interest rates: but they may be a
positive, rather than a negative influence in the months ahead. The moment
will soon come when the market starts looking for German interest rates to
come down. Once the market gets a whiff that that might happen soon, it will
go higher.
Will there be another surge of rights issues? Yes, probably starting towards
the end of January. Badly handled issues, as in the autumn, will stop the
market dead for a while. But perhaps companies and their advisers will have
learnt a lesson from last year. There will also be a steady flow of other
calls on cash, such as payments for previous privatisation issues, but
institutional inflows of funds remain healthy. At some point there will be a
surge of cash from abroad as international investors start to take advantage
of the UK market's relative cheapness.
Which sectors will do best? Sometime this year, the recovery stocks,
especially capital goods, will at last start to outperform the defensive
stocks, such as the drug companies and other members of the Health and
Household sector of the FT-Actuaries index. However, it may be anything up
to six months before the shift happens, because there is still more bad news
to come from the capital goods companies in the early part of the year.
Will equities continue to outperform gilts? Yes, though the gap has
narrowed. UK quoted companies have provided real dividend growth of 2 per
cent a year for the past 20 years, and that is likely to continue.
Those views, drawn from one fund manager, are probably representative of the
mainstream view in the professional investing community. What could upset
this generally favourable set of prospects? The biggest likely spanner in
the works would be a long delay before German interest rates come down - or,
worse still, a further rise.
Much therefore hangs on the outcome of the German pay round, now getting
under way. Claims already made are for wage rises of around 10 per cent,
compared with last year's 7 per cent. The chances are that the final outcome
will be increases of around 5 per cent, but getting there will be hard.
There is unlikely to be any good news on German interest rates until the
Bundesbank is convinced that settlements will be sensible. So UK investors
will spend the next few months hoping for moderation on the part of German
trade-union officials. Welcome to the new Europe]

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Bulls cheer the 'January effect' -
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WALL STREET ended 1991 as it began it
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with a sudden and remarkable upward surge in US stock markets. The rally
which started just before the Christmas holiday was sustained right the way
through to 1992, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising by nearly 9
per cent between December 19 and New Year's Eve, from 2914.36 to a new
record of 3168.83. While the momentum of the advance has slowed this week,
the Dow still managed small advances on Thursday and Friday morning.
The remarkable about-turn in market sentiment from pre-Christmas gloom was
reminiscent of the Dow's sudden upward charge last January on the outbreak
of the Gulf War, when it became clear that Western technological superiority
would make that conflict brief.
But the reason for the year-end rally was utterly different. The Federal
Reserve's one percentage point cut in the discount rate on December 20
transformed investor sentiment for the better - and fund managers did not
want to be left behind in the rush into equities. The result was a 1991 gain
in the Dow of 535.17 points, or 20.3 per cent, while the broader Standard &amp;
Poors 500 index was up 86.87 points, or 26 per cent.
Smaller stocks,which often perform better than large capitalisation
companies when coming out of recession, did even better, with the Nasdaq
Composite Index ending the year with a gain of 212.5 points, or 56.8 per
cent.
The question now is whether the upward momentum can continue, or whether
December's rally has simply anticipated the 'January effect' - the historic
propensity for stock markets to post strong advances in the early months of
the year.
The bull case is that the Fed's aggressive easing demonstrates that the
central bank is prepared to do whatever it takes to get the flagging economy
moving. The Wall Street consensus is that by the middle of the year the
economy will be expanding, albeit at a more modest pace than after most
post-war recessions.
Throw in a mildly stimulative economic package at the end of this month from
the White House, plus the probability that George Bush will be re-elected in
November's presidential election, and the stage could be set - say the bulls
 -for a prolonged period of rising equity prices, interspersed with modest
corrections.
The most optimistic analysts believe 1992 could see stock market gains
rivalling those of the past year - up to 15 or 20 per cent on the Dow,
carrying it towards 4,000.
A dwindling band of Cassandras, many of them technical analysts, believe
this is a fool's rally and the stage is merely being set for a plunge in the
Dow towards 2,600 as the US enters a severe 'double dip' recession.
A majority of Wall Street's pundits is probably cautiously optimistic, fully
expecting an economic recovery but concerned that, as in the early months of
1991, the market is in danger of getting ahead of itself, anticipating too
much good news.
Certainly, the news of the past week has been mixed and shows little
economic or corporate evidence of an early recovery.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers Index fell below 50 per cent
in December for the first time in six months - indicating a contracting
manufacturing base.
True, figures for sales of existing houses showed a 5.7 per cent
year-on-year gain in November, showing that low interest rates are starting
to get that market moving. Yet any strong recovery in housing and other key
sectors, such as automobiles, will be dependent on an improvement in
consumer sentiment, and the much-followed confidence index produced by the
Conference Board was virtually unchanged in December from November's insipid
reading. Yet that in itself may be mildly encouraging, since it suggests
that confidence may at least have touched bottom.
Sluggish Christmas sales claimed a large corporate victim this week when
Zales, the largest jewellery retail chain in the US, announced that it was
closing 400 of its 2,000 outlets and stopping payments to its creditors as
part of a financial restructuring which, many analysts believe, will involve
a passage through the bankruptcy courts.
Zales, which was acquired in 1986 by a Canadian company, Peoples Jewellers,
and Swarovski International of Switzerland, had been ailing financially for
months and sent early warning signals of its problems in early December when
it missed an interest payment. The company forecast that good Christmas
sales would enable it to meet the payment before a grace period ended last
Thursday.
In the event, Christmas sales were awful - down more than 10 per cent on
1990 - prompting this week's drastic action. But Zales may be just the first
in a string of retailers - some large, but many small - finally driven to
the brink of bankruptcy by this singularly unfestive, festive season.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Market remains addicted to Wellcome
magic - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE SEEMS to be something magical about the Wellcome share price. It was
the best Footsie performer in 1991, has had four record highs since
Christmas and is the highest rated stock among the big pharmaceutical
companies. If you had invested Pounds 1,000 at the company's flotation in
1986, your holding would now be worth more than Pounds 9,000, even after the
share price weakness yesterday.
The sharpest gain has come since Christmas. It was triggered by evidence
from research scientists that the company's Aids drug Retrovir was even more
effective when used in combination with other drugs. To put icing on the
cake, one of those other drugs, Zovirax, is made by Wellcome.
Wellcome has been keen to play down the significance of the research
findings. While the shares leapt in recent days, Wellcome described the
results of the research simply as 'interesting'. Yesterday's fall in the
shares was partly the result of the company's own cautious comments.
Such conservatism only reinforces the City's admiration for the company.
'Wellcome does everything by the rulebook', says Jonathan de Pass of broker
BZW. 'The standard of disclosure has been tremendously high. You just smell
quality.'
Wellcome's reputation has also been built upon bold but measured management
and two strong products. The latest generation of top management is still
new to the job. John Robb, the chief executive who joined in 1990 from
SmithKline Beecham, is 'a strong marketing man', according to Martin Hall of
securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
John Precious, the finance director, joined at the same time from Tioxide,
the chemicals company owned by ICI. His presence has seen tighter money
management: 'Disposals of non-core business have freed working capital and
management time,' says de Pass.
The two star drugs are AZT and acyclovir, better known by their trade names
of Retrovir and Zovirax. One advantage they have is that they are effective
against viruses.
This is significant because antiviral drugs are rare. Since the discovery of
penicillin, the pharmacologists have seen their greatest successes in
defeating bacteria, rather than viruses. Even in 1992, dealing with everyday
viral infections such as influenza is a hit and miss affair.
Of the two drugs, Retrovir is the more famous. Until a few months ago, it
was the only approved treatment for Aids in US. Even now that US doctors can
consider another drug, DDI from US company Bristol Myers Squibb, Retrovir
remains the first line of defence against the disease. Since the launch of
Retrovir in 1987, share buyers have been inspired by the prospect of
millions of chronic users of an expensive drug. This is what has moved the
shares since Christmas.
By the same token, fears that rival treatments would take Retrovir's market
away have occasionally caused sharp falls in the share price.
Out of the limelight Zovirax has been a much bigger contributor to
Wellcome's success. While political lobbying over Aids in the US cut the
price of a year's supply of Retrovir from Dollars 8,234 at launch to Dollars
2,200 (Pounds 1,208.70) now, Zovirax has faced no such pressures.
The bottom line shows what this means. In the year to August 1991, Zovirax
sales rose 26 per cent to Pounds 471m while Retrovir's improved only 4 per
cent to Pounds 177m. Zovirax has no serious rivals and Wellcome estimates
that it has more than 80 per cent of the herpes treatment market.
So the rising share price trick is no sleight of hand. And it needed no
flamboyant chief executive with a penchant for adventurous accounting.
That said, the statistics for 1991 are slightly flattering. The shares fell
in 1990 as profits failed to come up to expectations. 'So the 1991 share
price performance was a recovery from a low base,' says Hall.
There are also doubts over the importance of the research data released this
week. 'These results are pretty inconclusive and the trials need to be
followed a lot longer,' says Hall. The news received wide publicity at a
quiet time of year, exaggerating the effect on the shares. 'The market has
always tended to over-react to news on Wellcome,' says de Pass.
The domination of the herpes and Aids niches have nevertheless taken
Wellcome shares to extraordinary levels. The price/earnings ratio is 38,
compared with a market average of around 14.
At these dizzy heights, analysts are considering taking profits. Robin
Gilbert of James Capel has been a buyer of the stock since October 1990 and
is now 'inclined simply to recommend a hold'. Hall says 'it will be very
difficult for Wellcome to outperform the market over the next 12 months.'
The City has not lost confidence in Wellcome, but it might take some real
magic to keep the share price growing quickly for another year.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The end is not yet nigh for investors
 -Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM, GLOOM, all around is gloom. It was hard to enjoy Christmas while one
economic pundit after another popped up in the media to pronounce, like
Private Fraser in 'Dad's Army', 'We're all doomed]'
Sages have predicted a worldwide slump to rival the 1930s, with financial
crises bringing down many a famous corporate name. The pound will be under
pressure, interest rates could go up, and the price of houses will continue
to fall. No one has yet forecast a plague of boils but it cannot be long
before they do.
Savers naturally are worried. Some have even suggested that the traditional
'safe havens' in troubled times - banks and building societies - are not as
secure as they used to be.
But how much notice should savers take of all this pessimism? As a rule,
journalists love bad news, and financial journalists are no exception. The
collapse of a corporate empire such as Robert Maxwell's is always likely to
generate more column inches than the success of, say, Glaxo. A 100 point
fall in the FT-SE 100 makes better copy than a 100 point rise.
Readers can therefore dismiss some of the catastrophe stories being printed
as the natural journalistic relish for crisis. There may also be a
psychological reason or two behind the gloom spread by economists and stock
market analysts.
Normally, it pays a forecaster to be reasonably optimistic. Economies grow,
more years than not, and stock markets rise, more years than they fall. In
the 1980s, analysts got used to seeing companies produce 20 per cent per
year earnings per share growth. The tendency to extrapolate from past
trends, plus the natural enthusiasm for the companies they follow, meant
that sector analysts were slow to see the effect of higher interest rates
and the recession on corporate profits.
Over the last couple of years, therefore, the trend has been for analysts to
be initially over-optimistic in their forecasts for profits growth - and
then be forced to indulge in a round of downgradings. That process has just
occurred in respect of 1992 profits expectations.
Economists were never quite as bullish as the sector analysts, but even
they, given the natural bias of the City, had a tendency to take the
Panglossian view that free markets would ensure that all would be for the
best. They, too, have been cutting their forecasts for economic growth in
1992.
In short, the recent bout of pessimism is in part a reaction to the
over-optimism that went before it. This is not to say that the world economy
does not face enormous problems; just that the average saver needs to keep a
sense of proportion.
Take the stock market. Those who bought shares or unit trusts back in 1986
or 1987 learnt to their cost the penalties of buying at the top of the
market. Now they must learn the benefits of buying near the bottom.
One need not get too carried away by the 73 point one-day rise in the FT-SE
100 index. It was achieved on thin volume and could easily be reversed (and
more) by a run on the pound. Nevertheless, statistics show that when the
stock market yields more than 5 per cent it is a good time to buy shares.
The profits will not come instantly; the wisdom of the purchase will only be
proved over three or five years. But such a strategy has been successful
even during crises such as the 1930s depression and the 1974 oil shock.
It is, admittedly, tempting to fight shy of shares at the moment. With
interest rates on some accounts at 11 per cent or more, and inflation at 4
per cent, the real returns to savers of 7 per cent are very high by
historical standards.
Those worried about the stability of individual financial institutions
should not invest more than the deposit protection scheme limit of Pounds
20,000 with any one group. It may mean giving up the 0.5 of a percentage
point or so offered on higher sums, but it will be worth it for peace of
mind.
In the long run, savers will not prosper by investing solely in deposits.
Real rates of 7 per cent cannot be sustained for ever without driving the
economy into penury. For what might happen, one need only look at the US
where savers are being offered rates of a measly 4-5 per cent - their search
for better returns elsewhere is part of the reason for the recent strength
of Wall Street.
Prudent investors should therefore be shifting part of their funds out of
deposits before interest rates fall. Given the risk of further individual
corporate calamities, any purchase of equities should be done though the
vehicle of a unit or investment trust.
But for those who, whatever the rationale, simply cannot face the risks of
equity investment, there are alternatives. If interest rates are set to
fall, the 8.5 per cent tax-free on offer from National Savings (the
equivalent of 14.17 per cent for higher rate taxpayers) looks highly
attractive. And gilts, which currently yield around 10 per cent, should show
capital gains if interest rates fall - although the rise may be limited by
the widening government deficit.
In other words, savers should not despair. Universal gloom does not
eliminate investment opportunities; indeed, to some extent, it creates them.
As Corporal Jones would say in response to Private Fraser, 'Don't panic'.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family (At A Glance): Gilts prove their worth
in the long term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Index-linked gilts have proved reliable friends for investors over the last
couple of turbulent years for stock markets. As the left hand graph shows,
the normal pattern for index-linked gilts is steady growth over the long
term. Occasionally, this means that the index-linked tortoise can beat the
equity hare, as shown by the right hand graph. Private investors should also
remember that a large part of the return on index-linked is tax-free, and
that it is easier to construct a representative portfolio of index-linked
than it is to put together an equity portfolio that matches the All-Share
Index.

FT  04 JAN 92 / The Long View: Voting against inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL index-linked gilts prove to be the surprise winners among investments
in 1992? To judge by the wave of devaluation talk over Christmas and the New
Year you could be forgiven for thinking so.
There is an inclination to blame the Germans, and more specifically the
Bundesbank, for behaving irresponsibly in the middle of a global recession.
But the Bundesbank is just about the last defender in the world of honest
money, and at times like this the cost of preserving the value of a currency
can become painfully obvious. In any case, Britain's inflation is a British
problem. Underlying inflation is still between 5 1/2 and 6 per cent, and pay
inflation continues to run at some 7 1/2 per cent. Since the UK became a
full participant in the European Monetary System 15 months ago British pay
rates have risen by some 10 per cent in spite of the recession and the rapid
growth of unemployment. The UK is plainly drifting towards a currency crisis
created by itself, not the Germans.
Another manifestation has been in the continued excess of demand relative to
the British economy's ability to supply. Forget the misleading squeals of
the retailers, the fact is that at the national level imports still exceed
exports, even in the depths of a serious recession. Any period of sustained
economic growth at the current exchange rate will inevitably lead straight
to an unmanageably large trade deficit.
Devaluation is a means of restoring a balance, at least temporarily.
Externally it can be seen as a cut in real wages, so that exporters become
competitive again, and demand for imports is reduced. Internally, however,
the mechanism is more complicated. Inflation has the effect of pricing
overpaid workers back into their jobs, so that they are not required to
accept humiliating cuts in nominal pay; but inflation also tends to damage
investors, most obviously by reducing the purchasing power of bank deposits,
but also in other ways, such as by making it difficult for companies to earn
profits large enough to replace their stocks and physical capital at updated
prices, a problem which hits share prices. At the same time, inflation helps
borrowers to evade their full commitments.
When the vulnerable groups in society, such as investors and pensioners, are
unprotected against inflation a comparatively small change in prices may be
enough to achieve the required shift in wealth. But when they are
well-prepared, through ownership of inflation-proof assets or the benefit of
index-linked pensions, the inflation may need to be much more rapid.
Ultimately you arrive at Latin American-style hyperinflation, although in
the UK bursts of inflation of around 20-25 per cent, in the early 1920s and
the 1970s, and again at the beginning of the 1980s, have been enough to
solve the worst problems.
As I have said before in this column, the UK approached the challenge of the
European Community's exchange rate mechanism the wrong way round. We should
have aligned the economy first, reducing monetary growth and inflation over
a period, and then joined at a stable long-term exchange rate. However, I am
conscious of being vulnerable to charges of political naivete, because
without a tough external constraint the necessary measures could never in
practice be imposed. So John Major as Chancellor in 1990 did it in reverse.
The once-famous 'Madrid conditions' were ignored. As a pragmatic politician
he entered the ERM with UK inflation over 10 per cent precisely as a means
of bringing prices under control. But the contradiction remains. If the
country did not have the political gumption to solve its own inflation
problem will it have the determination to remain within the ERM when the
going gets really tough?
In their New Year messages we have been able to observe John Major and
Norman Lamont still wriggling with embarrassment over the economic
'recovery', which Lamont continues to claim will be gathering momentum over
the coming months. It would have been much better to say there can, and
should, be no recovery until pay inflation has collapsed: no more than 4 to
5 per cent is tolerable even in normal conditions, and in the present
recession 2 to 3 per cent must be the target.
Unfortunately, this kind of battle can be faced only by an administration
that has just won an election, not by one that must face the country within
the next six months. Low inflation is one of the government's chief policy
objectives, and quite rightly so; but there seems to be great nervousness
over whether it will win many votes. Norman Lamont's remark some months ago
that high unemployment is a price well worth paying in order to achieve low
inflation is still being used against him; it appears to have been too
brutally honest for widespread public consumption, which is not a good sign.
But it is no use just relying on the Bundesbank to beat British inflation.
The government will come to regret its failure to encourage a quicker
adjustment in the labour market. As for the asset markets, the crisis in
property was inevitable, but surely should have been presented as a
necessary step towards affordability in housing, not as some sort of
emergency to be solved in 48 hours just before Christmas.
It will take a brilliant exercise in political leadership if the transition
to low inflation now being attempted is to be accomplished successfully; the
mumbled apologies, deceptions and excuses now being put about by leading
ministers do not inspire much confidence. I am not a devaluationist, but the
pound sterling cannot be saved on the basis of minority support.
At any rate, during the past week or two the London stock market has been
influenced more by New York's cheap money and devaluation boom than by the
expectation of a harsh domestic struggle. In the event gilt-edged securities
did not manage to achieve a higher annual rate of return than UK equities,
which gained 5 1/2 per cent in the final four trading days of the year.
Index-linked gilts were the dullards of 1991, as inflation came tumbling
down and real interest rates stayed high. But they could still be a valuable
part of a portfolio for 1992.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Why Natasha and Irina are up for sale: Nicholas Woodsworth
finds pathos in communism's collapse as he travels with a modern-day white
slaver on the Tbilisi-Yerevan express to a brothel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS mid-day, and in the dismal suburbs of Yerevan, Rosa sits at her
kitchen table in a red dressing gown, smoking cigarettes and slowly waking
up. By the window, her face plump in the grey autumn light, Natasha begins
to work on the pullover she is knitting. She is hungover, keeps missing
stitches, and occasionally breaks the silence with muttered Russian curses.
At the end of the tiny kitchen, Anna stands over a mirror placed on the top
of the refrigerator. Carefully she applies lipstick, eye-liner, and rouge.
Anna is 17 and loves colour, music and anything else that brightens life in
this benighted city of the former Soviet Union.
Don't I think, she asks me in broken English as she gazes intently in the
mirror, that most Armenian women are dull and dowdy?
I find myself unable to reply. I murmur non-commitally, and continue to sip
tea. Somewhere along the way in the last few days I have lost any feeling
for the criteria normally used to judge people. These are, after all,
peculiar times.
Not long ago the Soviet Union was known as one of the most controlled,
monitored, and regulated societies in the world. Now, even here in
traditional, conservative Armenia, isolated by the Caucasus and far from the
main theatres of change, revolution has stood everything on its head.
Political and economic structures have collapsed. Ideological guidelines
have disappeared. Communism has failed. Capitalism has yet to get off the
ground. In this limbo none of the old rules, or any rules at all, seem to
pertain, except one: if the system does not work, work the system. Like the
streets of Moscow, Odessa or Tashkent, the streets of Yerevan have become
schools of hustle, scam and the wilder extremes of free market philosophy.
Are most Armenian women dull and dowdy? I cannot say, any more than I can
say if these three women lounging away the morning in deshabille are, in
their practise of prostitution, vulgar or immoral. For them morality or
immorality is beside the point; what counts is simply getting by.
My intrusion into the lives of Rosa, Natasha and Anna was not a calculated
one. It began, as many irregular things begin, with a train journey. The
night train to Armenia from neighbouring Georgia is not well organised.
There is not a single light on the main platform of Navtluqi Station in
Tbilisi. Trains leave at irregular hours from platforms announced at the
last second. Conductors remain indifferent to the fate of their charges.
The Tbilisi-Yerevan express seems symbolic of the whole juddering ride of
eastern Europe into the western world. Half an hour after we pulled out of
Tbilisi, I was still wandering dim, crowded corridors, looking for a
carriage and compartment that turned out not to exist.
What I did find, however, was a squat, ugly, powerfully-built Armenian named
Aram. Aram had a large white smile and a lot of gold rings on his fingers.
He was proud of his second-hand knowledge of England. He stopped me in the
corridor, and we chatted about Big Ben for a while. Then, after a short
silence, he told me he was not travelling alone.
'Two girls I have with me', he said with an air of self-congratulation.
'That's nice. Are they little girls?', I responded, thinking him merely one
more proud father. 'No', he replied with his widest smile and appropriate
wide-palmed gestures over his chest. 'They are big girls.'
In Aram's tiny, overheated train compartment I met Gala and Irina. Gala, a
tall redhead in her late teens, was decked out in skimpy cotton pyjamas.
Irina, heavier-set and a little older, was dressed in a good deal less, and
struggled into a track suit as introductions were made. Neither women were
great beauties, but both had a youthful freshness. As the train rattled
through the night we brewed thick black Turkish coffee, drank Georgian
brandy, chain-smoked an endless supply of Aram's American cigarettes, and
made small talk.
'I am not interest money, I am not interest politics,' Aram explained
through a heavy tobacco fug. 'I am interest only love.' He smiled at Gala
and gave her a quick tweak on the bottom. She smiled back. But Aram's
interest in love, it turned out, was not on the lines of simple
boy-meets-girl romance. Aram, in fact, was a modern-day white slaver, and
was running Irina and Gala down to Armenia from their home in the Ural
mountains.
These were not hardened pros. Like a large and growing number of young women
in the former Communist states, they were pushed into prostitution by a lack
of any other livelihood. In the Urals, they had been just two more mouths to
feed; in Yerevan, they would be exotic, light-complexioned objects of
attraction, and make themselves and their procurer a livelihood. When they
had had enough and made sufficient money, they said, they would head back to
their homes and a more normal life.
In the meantime, Aram was finding them a distraction from a long and boring
trip. Perhaps I, too, he inquired hospitably, would enjoy a little
distraction? It would cost only 30 roubles an hour, about 95 US cents at
today's exchange rate, surely an honest price for a friend. He indicated the
compartment's narrow upper bunk.
What does this signify, a country which was part of a global superpower,
that put men into space and proclaimed 70 years of struggle for human
dignity, offering up its youth for the price of a bag of crisps? I looked
around the tiny room, not more than four by six feet square, and at the
faces of Gala and Irina, lively with talk and brandy. Before I had time to
reflect on the meaning of it all, there was a timely knock at the door.
Irritably assigning me a new compartment, a ticket collector brought the
evening to a rapid halt.
But Aram had offered me more than just an hour with Gala and Irina; before I
left he also offered me a place to stay in Yerevan. For a small introductory
fee, he said, he would take me to a friend of his, someone who would welcome
extra dollars in exchange for a few night's stay. What he did not tell me
was that his friend was a madam running a call-girl business.
Rosa, when I meet her, is a middle-aged woman with a tired face and kind
eyes. Once she was pretty, but has let herself go. She smokes incessantly,
drinks too much, and has put on too much weight. There are times when she is
bright and animated, others when she sits despondently in the kitchen, her
face drained and vacant.
It does not take long to get to know her; she is friendly, intelligent, and
warm-hearted. She is also frank about her business; it is, she says, the
only way she and her daughter Anna have been able to survive.
Rosa is well educated. Divorced, she has a degree in Slavonic studies from
the University of Yerevan, and worked for 15 years as an office manager in a
state-owned electronics firm. Her salary was 450 roubles, a sum that each
month allowed her to make less than two week's worth of essential household
purchases.
Arranging sexual contacts is not making Rosa rich, but it gets her through
the month. Many of her clients, functionaries in state factories and
marketing networks, pay her in commodities much more appreciated than
roubles - sugar, coffee, eggs, meat, soap and other items unavailable in the
shops can be found in Rosa's kitchen.
But without leaving her cramped studio flat, where day couches and
collapsible cots make up accommodation for us all, I can see that life on
the whole remains what it has long been - a dull exercise in cynicism,
futility and resignation. Things, in fact, are even worse now than they were
before.
The room in which we live remains dark for most of the day; after Armenia's
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, oil imports for power
generation were cut. Gas for cooking and heating in these suburbs is fast
running out, too, and will be gone before mid-winter. If it were not for
Rosa's business, we would be living, as most people are, simply on fruits
and vegetables harvested this autumn - soon these will run out. There is
nothing to buy in the shops and housing is appalling. From the window I can
see endless rows of apartment blocks stretching away to the horizon - they
are so uniformly dingy, dilapidated and overcrowded that the suburb is known
locally as Bangladesh.
'In Armenia,' Rosa tells me one afternoon between telephone calls and the
comings and goings of grotesquely made-up women, 'everything is a problem.
Food. Clothing. Transport. Heating. Electricity. All are problems. But sex,
sex is no problem.'
Indeed, the one import that still seems to be in steady supply from Russia
is young women. Thus the presence of Gala and Irina on the train, and of
plump, fair-haired lodger Natasha in Rosa's flat. Armenian men, it seems,
prefer blondes. And Russian prostitutes, according to Rosa, offer the
additional advantage of being less fussy. 'Armenian girls want presents,
expensive dinners, and American dollars,' she says. 'Russian girls are happy
with vodka and roubles.'
For her daughter Anna, Rosa wants much more than presents or dinners - she
wants to get Anna out of Armenia and living with distant relatives in Paris.
For this she is saving every rouble she can to exchange for black market
dollars. 'Isn't immigration to the west very difficult?', I ask. 'Not as
difficult as staying here and living as I do,' Rosa replies grimly.
For the moment Anna is nothing like her mother - she is friendly with the
girls who work for Rosa, but does not share or want their life. She believes
in another future. She wants to study computer programming, have money to
buy fashionable clothes, and live somewhere where the halls do not stink of
boiled cabbage.
A couple of days after I arrive Anna and I escape the telephone calls and
Natasha's fish-net stockings hanging over the broken bathroom radiator, and
indulge in one of her favourite pastimes - going to church.
It is not that Anna is overly religious, but in this Soviet-designed city of
vast stone ministries and oppressive monumental statuary, there are few
other places quite as appealing. Off Mashtots Avenue, we enter a dark and
ancient orthodox church smelling of incense and candles. Anna crosses
herself and we each light half a dozen thin wax tapers. We place them,
besides scores of others, in front of a brass-bound triptych and
richly-coloured oil paintings of the Virgin Mary. Suffused in the rich
golden glow of candlelight, Anna's face, for just a moment, mirrors the
contented faces in the images before her.
One afternoon Rosa and Natasha, dressed and made up, told me to get my
jacket on; they had a surprise, they said. Outside in the street a driver
and battered black car were waiting, and in we piled. We cruised through the
city, picking up women at shabby tenements here and there until the car was
jammed and reeking of perfume.
We entered an industrial zone, a wasteland of crumbling breeze block hangars
and rusted-out trucks, and stopped outside an office. Three evil-looking
men, all whiskers, cheap baggy suits and gold teeth, climbed into another
beat-up black car and followed us. We repeated the process a number of
times, until four black cars were on our tail. The cortege rolled out into
the arid and rocky Armenian countryside, the girls chatting, Rosa enjoying
my mystification.
After an hour's drive through desolate, denuded hills, we arrived at Lake
Sevan. In official tourist guidebooks the lake is known as the Jewel of
Armenia, in the annals of Soviet hydro-electric power generation as an
ecological disaster - constant drainage over the decades has almost
destroyed it. Nonetheless, it is still a place to which Armenians repair for
recreation.
Recreation is what we came for, too. The evil men with gold teeth turned out
to be managersof a state food co-operative, friends of Rosa. They had
arranged a banquet at one of the lakeside hotels, but this was not really
the main programme of the day. Within no time, polite toasts over pickled
peppers, kebabs and Lake Sevan trout had turned
into a lusty, uninhibited drinking binge. We toasted the past, the present,
the future. We toasted our parents, our children, our friends, each other.
We toasted Great Britain, we toasted Russia, we toasted any country we could
think of. And with each toast we tossed down small tumblers of ice-cold
vodka.
Through the afternoon, in ragged succession, the men in baggy suits
disappeared upstairs, girls in their arms and room keys in their hands. But
finally, another kind of sensuality, some sort of deeper racial
communication, surfaced through the laughter and alcoholic fog. By the time
the soft light of evening crept over Lake Sevan, we were deep in remembrance
of the fate of Armenia.
We drank in memory of countless invasions of Armenia, of Turkish butchery,
of Soviet oppression, of diaspora, droughts, earthquakes, and endless
suffering. We were drinking for the relief of Armenia's pain. We danced,
hands outspread above our heads. We sang, tears rolling down our faces. The
ultimate end of the evening was not titillation, but commiseration.
The next day, we are all dreadfully hung-over and Rosa's kitchen, not so
mysteriously, is full of good things to eat. Once again Rosa is smoking at
the table, Natasha is knitting and swearing, and Anna is putting on make-up.
I sit there watching and thinking sadly of Anna's question to me.
The truth is that, despite the make-up, the wild evenings, the drink and the
men, life for these women is dull and dowdy. It is as cramped, cold, and
unlovely as the flat that we are sitting in or the city that surrounds us.
From an armchair in a more comfortable flat, in a more prosperous city
somewhere in the West, the collapse of the communist system may appear
highly desirable. It may even look glamorous. But closer up, there is no
glamour, there is only pathos. For with it has come a collapse of moral
authority, social concern and, ultimately, human values. Rosa, Natasha and
Anna did not deserve communism. But neither do they deserve the new order
which, for a long time to come, may prove to be no order at all.

Yesterday's attack by the Labour party on the regional electricity
companies' interim profit increases was crudely political. It was also
ineffective in the narrow sense that the market ignored it. If the RECs'
profits are rising sharply now, it is partly because the companies are
making good a previous under-estimation of inflation which meant customers
were charged less than they might have been in 1990. Equally, mild weather a
year ago means the comparison is misleading.
All the same, the RECs will not escape the underlying issue of the
appropriate rate of return for regulated utilities, and Labour's
intervention was a reminder that a change of government could transform the
industry's operating environment. At some stage before the scheduled 1995
review of the RECs' price formula, the regulator will have to take a view on
returns. Unlike his counterpart in the water industry,there is nothing in
his licence to require him to initiate wider discussions now, even though
the National Grid is under review this year.

FT  04 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London equity market's recent slavishness in following Wall Street has
at least one curious gap. The Nasdaq composite index of US small companies
rose by 57 per cent last year, more than twice the gain among leading
stocks. By contrast, Hoare Govett's index of UK small companies recorded a
total return of 18.5 per cent, slightly underperforming both the FT-SE and
All-Share indices. The index, which measures the bottom 10 per cent of the
market by capitalisation, has now underperformed for three successive years,
a unique sequence in its 35-year history.
Granted, the record books are unlikely to note that only the FT-SE's late
upward dash kept the trend intact. It is perhaps also significant that a
healthy chunk of the Nasdaq index's outperformance took place in the few
December days after US authorities cut the discount rate to 3.5 per cent.
But the question remains why UK small companies should have been relatively
lacklustre.
The delay in UK economic recovery was mainly to blame, not least because for
some constituents of the index it spelt doom. By the end of the third
quarter 35 companies had gone bust out of the 1227 in the index; the
full-year figure will probably be nearer 50. If the recessionary cycle of
the early 1980s is repeated, that figure will be worse again this year. All
the same, the economy in the US proved equally sluggish. Investors there, it
seems, had sufficient confidence to start discounting recovery rather
earlier and to stick with small companies for longer.
Given the widespread acceptance that recovery in the UK will appear at some
point this year and accelerate in 1993, it is logical to suggest that small
companies will quickly restore their reputation for outperformance. They
have higher financial gearing than in 1982, so those which survive and
prosper might hit the rights issue trail. But if profits in the sector are
forging ahead, that should present only a minor inconvenience.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of the reason for yesterday's 23 per cent recovery in First National
Finance Corporation's shares was that its Pounds 34m pre-tax loss was not
even worse. The worries, which prompted FNFC's share price to collapse by
some 85 per cent between its peak last April and the end of the year, have
proved unfounded. The company, whose name still brings back unhappy memories
of the secondary banking crisis of the 1970s, does not look as though it is
about to fall victim a second time. It has sufficient undrawn credit to meet
debt repayments of Pounds 230m this year, and the rate of default by its
borrowers has slowed.
That said, new provisions last year were over 7 per cent of the loan book,
more than three times greater than those of the clearing banks. With the
housing market still depressed, they are likely to come down only slowly, so
that a further loss can be expected this year. Though the company is making
play on the scope for home improvement lending, there is limited room for
organic growth until demand for consumer credit recovers.
At some stage after the recession, earnings should snap sharply back into
the black. The conservative valuation of FNFC's loan book may then allow
some provisions to be clawed back. On that basis, the shares appear cheap at
37p; even more so against a net asset value - admittedly still falling - of
113p. The trouble is the turnaround will be a long time coming. Meanwhile
there is no yield and there are plenty of recovery stocks offering a faster
potential return.

FT-SE Index: 2,504.1 (+11.3)
The equity market will be barely recognisable to fund managers returning to
their desks on Monday after a prolonged Christmas holiday. Since they left,
the market's gloom has evaporated and the Footsie has risen by some 150
points. The natural inclination, especially since the New Year seems to
demand a rally, may be to indulge in a spot of panic buying. All the more
so, since the year-end rise in equities has prevented the establishment of a
precedent for gilts offering a higher overall annual return. Even at current
levels, equities still look under-valued compared with gilts.
Yet prices have been supported over the past couple of days of thin trading
by short-covering in the futures market, which had largely abated by
yesterday afternoon, and by the strength of Wall Street, which could still
prove to be short-lived. Closer to home the risk remains that a sterling
crisis could force the authorities to raise interest rates. Only slightly
further down the road lie election jitters and the probability that some
large industrial companies will cut their dividends when announcing results
for 1991.
The dilemma for the professional investor is whether to plunge in and ride
out these storms in the anticipation of economic recovery during the second
half of the year. The dangers of missing out on a New Year rally could be
considerable, but so are the risks of buying in too early. Much depends on
whether the market manages to sustain its present level as trading volume
revives over the next few days. It will be a while yet before its direction
becomes clear.

FT  04 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Continental top ten invaded by
pharmaceuticals - How equity investment fashions changed as last year split
into two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS took over the running among European blue chips in the
second half of 1991 while cyclicals and banks, which featured earlier in the
year, dropped out of the reckoning.
Dreams of economic recovery, inspired by a quick end to the Gulf war, were
replaced by renewed worries about recession, and a move to defensive stocks.
Volvo and Philips in consumer durables still made the top 10, but this
partly reflected the severity of their share price losses in 1990.
Drug companies have visible earnings, a quality lacking in former luminaries
such as real estate developers which, along with worries about Soviet debt,
have troubled the banking sector. In addition, continental European drug
companies are benefiting from US investment interest, in anticipation of
harmonisation in corporate accounting procedures.
Mr Mark Tracey, European pharmaceuticals analyst at Paribas Capital Markets,
says that US investors have raised their stake in the UK's Glaxo, part of
the sector's quality triumvirate along with Astra and Roche, from 9 per cent
to around 26 per cent.
Information suggests that US investors hold 7 to 8 per cent in Astra and
Roche, the former with 60 per cent of its equity restricted to Swedish
investors but prospectively wide open to foreigners as Sweden enters the
European Community.
Other companies, particularly Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, probably
generated around 60 per cent of their profits last year from pharmaceuticals
as industrial chemicals dropped their contributions; these two are seen as
beneficiaries from the growth in drugs, and the more cyclical recovery
prospects in bulk chemicals.
But why should the continentals be doing so well? Prospects for UK
pharmaceutical companies are under threat from inflation, and world-wide
pressure on drug pricing. That, says Mr Tracey, is because UK companies get
between 35 and 65 per cent of their profits from the US market while the
continentals ascribe between zero and 25 per cent to that source.
France, depressed for most of November and December by interest rate
uncertainty, the Bundesbank's rate rise on December 19 and its own four days
later, still managed to produce three of the Eurotrack top 10, and five of
the top 15 while Germany was noticeable for its absence.
France performed better over the year, as Germany's expansion to the east
came to be perceived as an economic liability, rather than an opportunity.
But it also had more big companies in defensive and consumer-oriented areas.
Mr John Fordyce of Ferri International in Paris sees technical features, and
timing, in Euro Disney's gallop up the charts lately. The technicality, he
says, is a Dollars 3.3bn Walt Disney issue, convertible into the cash value
of Euro Disney shares, which should provide support for the share price of
the French offshoot.
The other, he says, is that Euro Disney's leisure park is due to open on
schedule on April 4, well located and served by transport facilities, amid a
rising tide of highly professional publicity.
Of France's other two top performers, L'Oreal is a world-wide leader in
cosmetics and, once again, it is also liked for its pharmaceuticals
subsidiary, Synthelabo. Total, the oil company, has seen a lot of US buying
 -as has Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications network operator and
another recent climber in the charts.
France had its losers. Paribas, the diversified banking group, ran into more
problems in the corporate finance market, high provisions against
conventional banking risks and the unexpected deterioration in specific
situations such as companies owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, and the
Soviet Union.
Meanwhile Axa, the insurer, saw general pressure on the industry: from
non-life losses, a consequence of recession; pressure on net assets, from
the softening of the bond and real estate markets; and from the French
government's decision to make insurers pay compensation to Aids sufferers as
a result of the maladministration of the national blood transfusion service.
Mr Jonathan Walker, European insurance analyst at Baring Securities, adds
that Axa was weighed down by a misunderstanding of its Dollars 1bn-plus
investment in Equitable Life of the US which, he says, has significant
upside potential; a rise in the shares from FFr645 to FFr758 in two weeks
indicates that the market is beginning to see the light.
Insurers also provided a top 10 entrant in Skandia, depressed at the end of
1990 by sky-high interest rates in Sweden, a very weak stock market and a
fast weakening one in real estate. It had fire losses in Sweden, an Italian
acquisition doing extremely badly and UK motor business which, for
competitive reasons, was seriously unprofitable.
However, Skandia was also the focal point of plans for a strong Scandinavian
insurance industry which eventually brought its Norwegian counterpart, Uni
Storebrand, into the market. That was in December, and this particular pot
is only a little off the boil.
Being involved in merger situations was no guarantee of stock market
success. In a bottom 10 riddled with depressed Italian blue chips, Pirelli
SpA had to pull out of negotiations with the German tyremaker, Continental,
as Pirelli forecast worse-than-expected losses and its share price
collapsed. Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Montedison, members of one family group,
reflected industry problems; as did the car manufacturer Fiat (11th from
bottom) and the Agnelli family holding company Gemina. Olivetti suffered
from the recession in the computer industry.
Among former darlings of the Scandinanvian markets, Ericsson ran into third
quarter losses; in November, management was cautious and sombre about
prospects for 1992. From October, Norsk Hydro dropped on a Norwegian market
already demoralised by the collapse of its banking industry, uncertain
short-term earnings prospects and the fact that it ran ahead of itself in
1990.
Finally, Asea and Brown Boveri, the Swedish- and Swiss-quoted companies
which merged their operations several years earlier, also hit trouble in the
third quarter of 1991. Asea nearly slid into the bottom 10 (coming 12th) and
Brown Boveri got there, on third-quarter figures which were worse than
reduced expectations; as with Ericsson and Norsk Hydro, premium ratings for
both stocks have had to be reconsidered.

FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer in two-way trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market began to return to more normal trading levels yesterday
as tensions over sterling and domestic interest rates relaxed a little and
the institutions took a fresh look at their equity portfolios. Share prices
moved erratically before closing firmly behind early gains in the new
trading session on Wall Street.
Traders reported substantial activity in London, with many large deals not
reported until the very end of the session. The institutions were present,
both as buyers and sellers, apparently re-positioning portfolios rather than
buying across the range of equities. International blue chips were firm,
encouraged by sterling's steady performance and by the continued improvement
on Wall Street. Strong gains were recorded among brewery and publishing
stocks, both sectors influenced by hopes for early economic recovery.
But there were also some notable weak spots. Electricity stocks recovered
from the initial effects of a political attack on the industry's profits
record. Food retailers turned down sharply on news that Sainsbury plans
substantial price cuts this month, a move seen as threating further
pressures in a tightly competitive industry.
Equities opened strongly, quickly rising by 22.9 on the FT-SE Index as the
March Footsie contract established one of the largest premiums against the
cash market ever recorded. However, the Footsie topped out at 2,515.7 as the
futures premium faded and by mid-session, the equity market was barely ahead
of its overnight level, reflecting some nervousness ahead of Wall Street's
opening.
In the event, the Dow Average, after a slow start, showed a gain of 15
points in UK hours, and the London market was quick to respond. The final
reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,504.1, its highest level since
mid-November, with a gain on the day of 11.3.
Seaq volume totalled 452m shares, below the 457.1m of the previous session.
'But, on Thursday, it was all basket trades with the futures market.
Yesterday, the institutions were very busy, although very stock selective,'
said the head trader at a large integrated securities house.
Cadbury-Schweppes stood out strongly among the food manufacturers, helped by
Wall Street's influence. But there were heavy falls in such institutional
core stocks as British Gas and Wellcome.
The government bond market, in contrast, had a quiet trading session and
although there was a favourable reception for the December Official Reserves
statistics, bond prices ended the day a shade easier.
Retail or customer volume in equities has remained below last year's average
daily levels as the market returns from the Christmas holiday.

FT  04 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets were quieter yesterday but the Footsie future contract
continued to exercise a strong influence over the underlying cash market. In
early deals, the March Footsei contract rocketed by a premium of around 70
points, one of the largest premiums ever recorded; fair value now stands at
about 29 points.
Traders stressed that the early advance reflected heavy short covering by
London traders who had convinced themselves that Wall Street would fall
overnight. With the Dow in fact up by 3.58 overnight, there was a scramble
to unravel positions in futures.
The futures sector soon settled down to more modest trading, and the
underlying equity market followed suit. By the close, the March contract was
trading at a 50 point premium against cash, making an acceptable 20 points
ahead of fair value.
Business in traded options fell away to 21,048 contracts from Thursday's
26,261, with the FT-SE contract recording only 6,118. The Euro-FTSE contract
returned to the top of the actives list but, with only 998 trades, made
little stir. Individual share contracts were less busy yesterday. Amstrad
recorded 943 contracts, and Allied-Lyons restraded 700.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark declines in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark weakened against most European currencies yesterday amid fears
over the consequences of potential unrest in the former Soviet Union and a
general correction of the optimistic buying in recent weeks.
Economists suggested that traders who had expected some sort of ERM action -
such as realignment - over the holidays were unwinding long positions on the
D-Mark.
The German currency's weakness was most notable against those countries
which have raised rates in line with the Bundesbank's move on December 19,
said one senior dealer.
The peseta had a particularly strong run, and tested its ceiling against
sterling, the weakest ERM currency. Traders speculated that the Bank of
Spain had intervened to pull the peseta back.
The Spanish currency closed higher at Pta 63.43 per D-Mark, compared with
Pta 63.61.
The French Franc reached its strongest level since October at one stage,
quoting FFr3.4135 against the D-Mark. The French currency closed in London
at FFr3.4132 per D-Mark, up from FFr3.4149.
Sterling still languished at the bottom of the ERM grid, although the
D-Mark's weakness has taken some of the pressure off British authorities to
raise interest rates for the moment.
'Sterling has finished the week on a stronger note  .. than most people
would have imagined on the Monday before new year's,' said Mr David Dean,
assistant chief dealer at Barclays.
The UK currency was buoyed both by the D-Mark's weakness and the comments
made on Thursday by Bank of England governor, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton
reiterating government statements that there was no immediate need to raise
rates. Sterling closed in the mid-range in London yesterday at DM2.8575.
Dealers were cautious over the prospects for sterling, as most of the big
market players were still on holiday. Some dealers suggested that sterling
had taken some of its shine from the dollar's steady recovery against the
D-Mark.
The US currency has gained two pfennigs in two days and last night closed at
the day's high of DM1.5465. The dollar also gained early ground at the
expense of the yen, climbing to Y125 by midday and finishing at Y124.85,
compared with Y124.55 on Thursday.
The dollar is expected to make further gains next week.
Both Mr Bush's visit to Tokyo and the absence of further depressing economic
figures - at least until the US employment report on Friday - are expected
to boost the dollar.
The Argentine austral has been redenominated as the peso. One peso -
equivalent to 10,000 australs - is now equal to one US dollar.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Money Markets: London rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates eased during the day as sterling held its own in the
foreign exchanges. However, some nervousness at the close in London appeared
to be due to uncertainty over the pound's long-term stability.
The key three-month interbank rate reflected the general relief in the
markets, edging lower to 10 3/4 - 5/8 - only marginally above the current
10.5 per cent base rate.
The March short sterling contract also indicated a belief that rates will be
held,
standing at 89.35 in late trade. At this level, the market feels rates will
remain the same for the immediate future.
The Bank of England also pushed down lending rates in the money markets by
offering to take a large chunk of the forecast Pounds 1.25bn shortage out
before noon.
In early operations, the bank bought Pounds 544m of Band 1 bills at 10 3/8
per cent, Band 3 bills at 10 7/32 per cent, and Band 4 treasury and bank
bills at 10 1/8 per cent. It also offered a Pounds 730m 10-day repurchase
agreement.
Lending costs fell as low as 7 per cent after the bank's actions. However,
when the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.45bn, lending rates shot up to 11
per cent. The bank stepped in with late assistance of Pounds 40m and
overnight rates settled at 10 1/2 - 1/4 .
The official reserve figures published yesterday indicated that the bank had
been fairly subdued as far as intervention was concerned.
After accounting for British Telecom receipts, interest payments, and Gulf
receipts, the reserves suggested that the bank had intervened to the tune of
about Dollars 180m in December.
However, dealers were quick to point out that some of the intervention may
come from deals done in previous months.
In the US, Federal funds were trading at 4 3/8 per cent, above the Federal
Reserves presumed target of 4 per cent. Dealers said year-end pressures and
high treasury balances were behind the upward movement.
In Germany, the Bundesbank offered a tighter than expected repurchase
agreement - indicating that there would be no easing of monetary policy for
some time.
Liquidity did not appear to be a problem, however, and call rates held at
9.5 per cent.
Dealers said the Bundesbank's minimum liquidity requirement for January was
likely to be well below December's DM75bn.

for the year to September, from MDollars 84.8m a year earlier, writes Lim

The improved results were attributed to higher palm oil prices, which helped
lift turnover by 7.2 per cent to MDollars 381m from MDollars 356m.
The group net operating margin declined, however, from 17.7 per cent to 17
per cent of turnover while the net return on equity capital stood at 5.9 per
cent, compared with 5.8 per cent previously.

<TEXT>
TURNOVER on the Frankfurt securities market reached a record DM2,430bn
(Dollars 1,500bn) last year, a rise of 2 per cent. Trading in bonds was up
sharply, while share dealings fell, although the DAX share index rose by
15.5 per cent on the year.
Figures for German securities markets as a whole - there are eight bourses -
showed that Frankfurt increased its share of business to 70 per cent from 66
per cent. The German securities market federation said total German turnover
in bonds and stocks was DM3,450bn, a drop of 5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, turnover in bonds was 21 per cent higher at DM1,520bn, while
business in shares fell by 20 per cent to DM904bn. The city's traditional
predominance of bond trading over stocks was thus restored, the Frankfurt
Securities Exchange said.
Average daily turnover in Frankfurt rose from DM9.6bn to DM9.7bn. The
exchange said both total turnover and turnover in shares alone was higher in
the first than in the second half.

RASHID HUSSAIN and TA Enterprise, Malaysia's two largest stockbrokers, have
posted higher turnovers, but their operating profit margins narrowed,
reflecting substantial increases in interest payments.
The higher turnovers partly reflected acquisitions - in banking and property
by Rashid Hussain and in insurance by TA Enterprise - following a
government-imposed capital restructuring of brokerages in the past two
years.
TA Enterprise reported a 28 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars 96m for
the year to October, from MDollars 75m a year earlier. Pre-tax operating
profits rose 6 per cent to MDollars 42.5m (USDollars 15.6m), after interest
payments soared 221 per cent to MDollars 13.3m. Net profits slipped
marginally to MDollars 25.6m or 21.3 cents a share compared with 21.5 cents.
Rashid Hussain recorded a 33 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars 56m for
the six months to November, from MDollars 42m a year earlier. Operating
profits rose 5 per cent to MDollars 22.1m. Net profits rose 40 per cent to
MDollars 17.5m, or 10.4 cents a share, from MDollars 12.5m or 7.4 cents.

FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Leaner, fitter Greyhound finds
its running form - A look at what months of protection from creditors has
helped the US bus company achieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Doyle, finance director of Greyhound Lines, has just zoomed into
work on a new motorcycle. Intrigued, staff at the US bus company spill out
of their corporate headquarters to admire.
Two things are worth noting. First, there aren't very many of them.
Secondly, the building from which they appear - one of the soulless edifices
flanking a freeway north of Dallas - seems to belong to a bank. In fact,
Greyhound's spartan offices, only occupied in November, are subleased at the
back.
But this leaner look is all part of a new image. After a violent drivers'
strike tipped Greyhound into bankruptcy 18 months ago, America's best-known
bus operator has been struggling to drive its outmoded operations into the
1990s. A financial reorganisation was agreed with creditors last autumn, and
bankruptcy status shed. Almost unmarked by US commentators, Greyhound shares
also started trading on the American Stock Exchange in November. Now comes
the hardest part - cranking out the profits.
Ever since the US airline industry was deregulated in 1978, competitive
pressure on bus operators has been intense. Deregulation gave birth to a
crop of new, low-cost airlines, and sent domestic fares spiralling
downwards. Since then, many of these carriers have either failed or merged,
but a lingering glut of cash-strapped airlines means that fare-discounting
is still rife.
The damage to Greyhound has been immense. Imagine, for example, that you
want to journey between Tuscon and Phoenix, Arizona's two main cities. A
one-way flight would cost you less than Dollars 60 and get you there in 45
minutes. With a little advance planning you might obtain a Greyhound fare
for Dollars 15.75, but you would spend two hours bumping down a freeway.
Small wonder that most Greyhound customers have an annual income of Dollars
25,000 or less, and the average ticket sale is Dollars 35.
Greyhound's financial position has not helped it to compete, either. The bus
operation was born over 75 years ago when an enterprising Swedish immigrant
started transporting miners in Minnesota. By the mid-1980s, however, it was
simply one part of a much larger conglomerate. In 1987, a Dollars 350m
leveraged buyout took place - led by Mr Fred Currey, former chief executive
of the rival Trailways bus line - and Greyhound became a private company.
Mr Currey took some much-needed steps. He acquired Trailways, renovated some
of Greyhound's oldest terminals, installed a computer system to improve
ticketing and internal information, and boosted advertising. 'We didn't used
to know about ticket sales for 45 days,' recalls one employee, spelling out
how backward the systems were.
But the Dollars 375m lump of LBO debt hung around Greyhound's neck. Between
1987 and 1990, the company was never more than marginally profitable,
although its 'regular route' revenues increased significantly to almost
Dollars 720m.
Meanwhile, labour tensions were rising. Mr Currey secured big wage
concessions at the time of the buyout. But in early 1990, attempts to
negotiate a new contract with the Amalgamated Transit Union - representing
about 8,500 drivers, clerks and mechanics - proved fruitless. The bloody
strike followed, and bankruptcy was only a few months behind.
So what has months of protection from creditors, and the subsequent
reorganisation plan, achieved? Even today, Greyhound does not start with a
clean financial sheet. Under the complex reorganisation scheme, many
creditors swapped their claims for equity in the ongoing company - currently
valued at Dollars 80m - plus a Dollars 165m tranche of senior notes. Coupled
with bank debt (and excluding operating leases), this means the company
still has over Dollars 300m of long-term borrowings.
But the strike did accelerate the operational streamlining. Peripheral
businesses, like the charter operations and bus manufacturing, have been
wound down or sold, while a 'package express' delivery service - which never
recouped the 'small business' element that quickly defected when services
were interrupted - is a shadow of its former self.
More significantly, core operations are also being reorganised. Although
badly hit in the early days of the strike, Greyhound quickly recruited
non-union drivers and claimed to be running almost 90 per cent of its
pre-strike service within months.
A rescheduling of operations, however, coupled with more flexible working
arrangements, means that this network is now being serviced with around
3,700 drivers, compared with 6,300 pre-strike. The number of buses and
maintenance facilities has also been sharply pruned.
This process is not at an end. Greyhound says that its aim is to instigate
something akin to an airline 'hub' structure, where buses would feed in and
out of regional centres, rather than the traditional point-to-point service.
Further improvements in its computer systems could help short-notice pricing
decisions. It is, however, a delicate process: Greyhound is acutely aware of
criticism suggesting that some small communities may be left without a
transport service.
Whether this adds to a rebirth remains debatable. In its reorganisation
plan, Greyhound projected net profits rising from Dollars 37.4m in 1992, to
Dollars 46.9m in 1998, with total revenues increasing by about 15 per cent
over the same period. But capital expenditure is still tight, running at
little more than Dollars 30m a year at present.
Almost half this figure is going on bus renovations; for Dollars 25,000 a
bus can be completely overhauled while a new vehicle costs Dollars 225,000.
But such refurbishments, repeatable twice or three times, only last three to
five years. The average age of a Greyhound bus is already nine years, and
replacements will be necessary at some stage.
The labour problem is not quite buried, either. Although the bankruptcy
court approved the reorganisation plan, a legal appeal by the ATU is still
outstanding. There is also a back-pay claim running to tens of millions of
dollars, although estimated by the bankruptcy court at a maximum Dollars
31.25m.
This is based on union claims that Greyhound bargained in bad faith. Not
surprisingly, the bus company says not - but its lawyers estimate that five
years could elapse before a final legal determination is made.
All this, moreover, is no longer in the hands of Mr Currey. He departed with
a Dollars 1m cash payoff plus Dollars 600,000 for non-competition
provisions, and has been replaced by Mr Frank Schmieder, previously chief
operating officer.
In all honesty, it would be hard to tag Greyhound as the growth stock of
1992. But its shares have bumped along at the Dollars 8 level - a
respectable edge on the Dollars 4 to Dollars 7.50 valuation suggested by
Goldman Sachs, its adviser, last summer. While the famous Greyhound may not
be sprinting home, it is at least up and running.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHUNG JU-YUNG, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, one of
South Korea's largest conglomerates, announced yesterday that he has retired
from business to start 'a new venture', believed to be a new political
party, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
'I retired from the group's management as of December 31 1991, and now I
will do a new venture,' Mr Chung said after meeting with senior company
officials.
He said Hyundai, which is the second largest chaebol, the conglomerates
which dominate the South Korean economy, would now be run and controlled by
his younger brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, who headed the successful expansion
of the Hyundai car subsidiary into the world market.
Last month Mr Chung Ju-yung had denied speculation that he was about to
retire, saying he would spend the next three years restructuring his
diversified business empire and then retire in 1994.
Yesterday, Mr Chung did not say what the 'new venture' would be, but close
associates said the 72-year-old businessman would enter politics and form a
new political party soon.
Mr Chung's move into politics would be highly unusual in a country where
business leaders usually maintain close relations with politicians,
particularly those in the government party.
Mr Chung has been at odds with the South Korean government of President Roh
Tae-woo because of his critical stand on its economic and other policies.
Last year, Mr Chung and his family were forced to pay won 136.1bn in penalty
taxes for allegedly illegal stock transactions aimed at evading inheritance
or donation taxes.
Mr Lee Myung-bak, Mr Chung's closest aide, also announced his retirement
yesterday as chairman of Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Reuter
reports from Seoul.

FT  04 JAN 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi hints at interest in
La Cinq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SILVIO BERLUSCONI, the controversial Italian media mogul, has indicated
an interest in taking charge of La Cinq, the collapsed French television
station in which he is a major shareholder.
La Cinq, which has for some time been struggling to resolve its financial
problems, on New Year's Eve announced its intention to file for bankruptcy.
Once an administrator has been appointed there will be three months to find
a new owner, or to put together a rescue package, otherwise the channel will
close.
Mr Berlusconi, who owns 25 per cent of La Cinq through Fininvest, one of his
holding companies, has been a sizeable shareholder ever since the station's
launch in 1986 as part of the French government's television deregulation
drive.
Initially Mr Berlusconi ran La Cinq together with Mr Jerome Seydoux, the
textile magnate who is a close associate of President Francois Mitterand. Mr
Seydoux was ousted in 1987, after Mr Jacques Chirac's right wing government
came to power, in favour of Mr Robert Hersant, the conservative press baron.
Mr Berlusconi has since taken a back seat. For the past 18 months La Cinq
has been run by Hachette, the media group which also owns 25 per cent of the
station.
Mr Berlusconi is now interested in running La Cinq 'providing the conditions
are right', according to Mr Angelo Codignoni, Fininvest's representative in
France. One potential obstacle would be that Mr Berlusconi already holds the
maximum stake - 25 per cent - in La Cinq permitted under French law.
Moreover, the French government also imposes strict controls over the
sourcing and content of television programmes. Given that French television
has been structured specifically to prevent a repetition of the Italian
system - where Mr Berlusconi's channels are notorious for showing soft
pornography and pulp programmes - it seems unlikely that the government
would amend its legislation specifically to allow him to play a more active
role in La Cinq.
However, the French authorities are keen to find a way of salvaging their
fifth channel.
The disappearance of La Cinq would have serious implications throughout the
French television industry. Telediffusion de France (TDF) the satellite
operator that broadcasts La Cinq, warned yesterday that the channel's
closure would have 'damaging consequences' for its finances.

BARCLAYS has sold its Danish car, farm, and business financing and leasing
operation to Alm Brand, a Danish banking and insurance group.
Barclays Danmark has a portfolio totalling DKr530m (Pounds 47.8m), but the
farm financing operation will be transferred to a separate business which
will be managed by Barclays in London. It accounts for about half the total
business of the subsidiary.
The price has not been disclosed. The Danish group plans to concentrate on
the car financing business, which makes up most of the remainder.
Barclays said that the bank had sold the business because it did not fit in
with its core activities. In some respects the sale of Barclays Danmark
resembles the disposal of parts of the Mercantile Group last year.
Barclays, the British bank which has made the deepest inroads into European
markets, has no plans to alter its overall European strategy.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet acquires balance of Cinzano for
Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, has agreed to
acquire Cinzano, the Italian vermouth and wines company, in which it already
holds a 25 per cent stake.
The outstanding shares will be bought from the Cinzano Merano family, which
has owned the company since 1757, and Ifint, the investment company of the
Agnelli group, in a deal estimated at between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m.
Mr George Bull, chairman and chief executive of IDV, GrandMet's drinks
division, said yesterday that the acquisition would greatly strengthen IDV's
distribution network in Europe and South America, as well as adding one of
the world's best-known brands to its portfolio.
Cinzano's relationship with GrandMet companies, such as Gilbey's, dates back
more than 50 years. Closer ties were established in 1985 when GrandMet
bought a 25 per cent shareholding.
Count Francesco Marone Cinzano, who has agreed to retain the post of
non-executive president of the company, said yesterday: 'This latest step in
the integration of the Cinzano network within the IDV structure is aimed at
ensuring the growth and development of the trademark.'
Cinzano has an annual turnover of Dollars 500m (Pounds 274.7m) and trading
profits of Dollars 30m. In addition to worldwide sales of 3.5m cases of
vermouth - wine blended with herbs and spices - it sells about 7m cases of
sparkling wine and other drinks.
Though the gradually declining international vermouth market is dominated by
Martini &amp; Rossi, Cinzano has a 20-25 per cent share of the UK's Pounds 270m
business and is brand leader in Germany, Canada, Japan and Argentina. Its
Bianco brand ranks 8th in the UK's best-selling wines and spirits, and last
year it launched higher-strength premium rosso and dry brands.
In recent years, sales of Cinzano's sparkling wines, notably Asti Spumante
which leads the sector in the German market, have overtaken those of its
vermouth.
Mr Bull said yesterday that the Cinzano brands - which have inspired a novel
and a Hollywood film entitled The Secret of San Vittoria, as well as a
memorable UK advertising campaign featuring Leonard Rossiter and Joan
Collins in the early 1980s - still offered considerable potential for
development.
But from GrandMet's viewpoint, the more important aspect of the deal is the
reinforcement it provides for the international marketing and distribution
of IDV's entire drinks portfolio.
IDV's products - which include such brands as J&amp;B Scotch whisky and Smirnoff
vodka - have been distributed by Cinzano in Italy, Spain and the
Netherlands; and the two companies, with Remy-Cointreau, have joint ventures
in Germany and Belgium.
Mr Bull said: 'We shall now have more direct control over the marketing and
distribution of our brands in these important markets, especially in Germany
and Italy.'
IDV, which recently acquired Metaxa in Greece and AED in Spain, will now
market and distribute 95 per cent of its brands in Europe through its own
companies.
Cinzano's distribution strength in South America - particularly Argentina,
Venezuela and Colombia - will complement IDV's own network in Brazil and
Uruguay, run by Heublein do Brasil.
Cinzano is the largest wines and spirits company in Argentina and also has a
strong sales force in Venezuela. Both countries are emerging as valuable
growth markets for the drinks industry.
Sales of Scotch in Venezuela increased by more than 80 per cent last year.
Mr Bull said: 'With the distribution spread that Cinzano now gives us, we
believe we are in a very strong position to seize the opportunities.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust, the newspaper publishing group, has sold
its freehold interest in a wharfage in Purfleet, Essex for at least Pounds
17.5m.
The proceeds will be used to reduce the group's net debt, which at the last
reporting date stood at Pounds 378m.
The wharf, previously used to store newsprint before being taken to Fleet
Street, has been rendered redundant by the opening of new print works at
Surrey Quays.
The asset was held in the DMGT's books at about Pounds 15m.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reconstruction for Govett Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Govett Atlantic Investment Trust is considering a capital reconstruction.
The move is aimed at narrowing the discount between the trust's net asset
value and its market value. It is seen as a defence against a possible bid
from Mr Andrew Shechtel, a US entrepreneur, who recently acquired a 5 per
cent stake.
Mr Kevin Pakenham, Govett's chief executive, would not give any details but
said a further announcement would be made when the trust had identified what
it considered to be the best course.
Last November, Sequoia Investment Trust, Govett's largest shareholder, sold
its 23.5 per cent stake - some 19m shares - at below the then market price.
Mr Shechtel bought a little more than 4m shares and the rest were sold to
more than 30 institutions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUMMOND GROUP, the worsted and wool textile company, is acquiring the
business and certain assets of Courtaulds Woollens from Courtaulds Textiles
for an expected Pounds 695,000 cash.
The acquisition is in line with Drummond's policy of diversification in
order to lessen its dependence on its traditional worsted business.
Courtaulds Woollens incurred an operating loss of Pounds 240,000 on turnover
of Pounds 3.1m for the 11 months to November 30. At that date the estimated
realisable value of assets being acquired amounted to Pounds 1m.
Consideration is payable as to Pounds 200,000 on completion with the balance
deferred until April 2.
In addition Drummond has an option, exercisable before the end of October,
to acquire the premises of the business at a price of Pounds 600,000 until
end-June and at market value thereafter.

via offer for subscription
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXETER PREFERRED Capital Investment Trust, which will invest in the shares
of split capital trusts, is joining the main market via an offer for
subscription.
The new trust has an unusual structure, with Pounds 28.5m of zero coupon
debenture stock already being placed with an institution.
This stock has a nominal value of Pounds 83m and will be redeemed in 2002, a
gross return of about 11.25 per cent a year.
The other class of capital in the trust is ordinary shares, of which 22.5m
are being offered for subscription at Pounds 1 each by stockbroker Greig
Middleton.
By investing in the zero coupon shares and high yielding income shares of
other investment trusts, the aim is to achieve capital growth on the shares
of around 13 per cent per annum.
In addition, the trust will pay a modest dividend, which will bring the
redemption yield up to 13.5 per cent a year.
Exeter Preferred Capital will be managed by Ian Henderson Associates, a
group which runs a series of unit and investment trusts specialising in the
split capital trust area.
The trust is capable of being held in a Personal Equity Plan (PEP), although
the low dividend yield means that this will only be suitable for those
investors who regularly pay capital gains tax.
Applications, for a minimum of 500 shares, must be made by January 23 and
dealings will start on January 29.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robson Rhodes out as J Foster auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBSON RHODES were ousted as auditors to John Foster, the Yorkshire-based
wool and textile group, at an extraordinary general meeting yesterday.
Shareholders voted overwhelmingly to remove the firm in a highly unusual
meeting forced by Robson Rhodes' refusal to resign at the request of the
directors and without the approval of shareholders.
In a circular distributed last month, Mr Victor Watson, chairman, said that
while the last audit had been concluded 'satisfactorily', the board - which
was revamped about a year ago - wanted a change of accountants.
He recommended that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte be appointed, primarily
because of the 'depth of resources' the firm offered.
It also tendered a lower fee. Coopers is believed to have quoted at about 65
per cent of the Pounds 42,000 charged for the last financial year.
Nineteen of the company's 850 shareholders attended the 20-minute meeting in
Foster's mill at Queensbury, near Bradford. Robson Rhodes was represented by
Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing partner, and Mr Chris Connor, head of the
Leeds office.
Mr Connor said the firm had not been given any substantiated reason why it
should quit. 'We are here on a matter of great principle,' he said.
'Auditors owe their duties to shareholders as a body and are not the casual
appointees of the directors.'
Several shareholders criticised the board for acting within a few weeks of
Robson Rhodes' reappointment at the last annual meeting and for not
disclosing its reasons for the change. They also questioned the quality of
an audit conducted at a significantly lower charge.
Mr David Breton, a director until last year, said: 'It was an apathy vote. I
feel this should all have been done in a more gentlemanly way. The AGM is
the proper time to appoint auditors.'
But Mr Graham Creswick, finance director, said: 'We were badly let down by
the 1991 audit. It was very straightforward and perfectly competent, but it
was very quiet. We did not get the benefit we are entitled to expect.'
While it met the legal requirements, he felt the auditors were not as
questioning as he would have hoped given the recent changes in strategy.
He also criticised the 'unnecessary' administrative and legal costs to the
company of calling an EGM.
Robson Rhodes said it had made a number of suggestions for change which had
been ignored by the management.
John Foster made pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.24m last year.

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Defence founded on sound management -
Steetley's attempts to defeat the hostile offer from Redland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HOLIDAY season has not been one of festive fun for Mr Richard Miles,
group managing director of Steetley, the building materials group facing a
Pounds 595m hostile bid from Redland, one of its competitors.
As Steetley's chief operating officer, Mr Miles has been working long hours
to meet the deadline for the first defence document, which is being sent to
shareholders today.
The offer of 85 Redland shares for 100 Steetley, with a partial cash
alternative, has not only ruined Mr Miles's Christmas, it has jeopardised a
deal with Tarmac of which he is mightily proud. Indeed, the pooling of the
Steetley-Tarmac brick interests was welcomed by the City as ushering in a
much-needed restructuring of the UK bricks industry.
But instead of cementing this deal, he now has to fight off Redland's
charges that the Steetley management has let profits slide and allowed the
balance sheet to deteriorate. The predator's view of the Tarmac joint
venture solution is that it brings few benefits and dilutes assets,
Steetley will have to convince shareholders that the Redland offer, which
would create a building materials group with a much wider geographic spread,
is not as attractive as staying with Steetley's gradually evolving
continental strategy.
The short-term picture is also clouded by gearing, which is a little high
for comfort, and by low dividend cover.
Although Steetley's chances of remaining independent have already been
pronounced 'sadly limited' by at least one City analyst, Mr Miles shows
little sign of being cowed by the task.
He believes the group has a proven track record, having produced more than
20 per cent compound annual growth over the past five years. He points to
the management's early response to problems in the industry as evidence of
tight management.
'Steetley is a company that has a focused business, that is at the bottom of
the cycle and that has assets that will outperform in the future,' he says.
'We've demonstrated that we've done a good job.'
His stress on recovery prospects follows a sharp fall in profits. The
pre-tax figure for the first half of 1991 fell by more than 70 per cent to
Pounds 13.5m, which was at the lower end of City expectations.
Earnings per share plummeted to 5p but the interim dividend was maintained
at 5p.
With the UK construction industry still deep in recession and the French
market, where it derives a substantial amount of its profits, coming under
increasing pressure, the short-term outlook is hardly promising.
Yet Mr Miles maintains that despite the recent setback, Steetley is on the
right track and that the strategy will bear fruit in the long term.
The best evidence for this lies in the group's success on the continent and
its quick response to the downturn in the UK bricks industry through the
proposed deal with Tarmac.
Steetley's mode of geographic expansion has been to marry local knowledge to
tight management control from the UK. It is already a leading producer in
France and is strengthening its position in Spain.
While its moves overseas have limited the damage of the UK recession, Mr
Miles places more stress on the soundness of the business strategy.
'The point is that the position (in France) has been built up logically and
has a value immensely greater than the actual underlying asset value,' he
says.
The strength of management, as Mr Miles sees it, is also evident in the
concentration of Steetley's businesses on quarry products for the
construction industry. 'Hanson would say everything is up for sale, that is
not true of us,' says Mr Miles.
For the purposes of a bid defence, this focus appears to leave little room
for future disposals.
However, for Mr Miles, making disposals or management changes after a bid
has been launched is only proof of previous ineffectual management. 'Hawker
Siddeley has demonstrated that that is not the way to fend off a bid.'
He says it is more important that Steetley's management has been quick to
respond to overcapacity in the industry by making cuts and by coming up with
the joint venture proposal with Tarmac.
'The Tarmac deal is on the table. That's management. It's a shrewd, live,
seasoned, competent management who know what they're at.'
He defends the deal as offering a far more effective way of dealing with the
industry's overcapacity because it gives much greater scope for
rationalisation than the Redland alternative.
Before settling on a deal with Tarmac, Steetley did look at possible links
with several other groups, including Redland, whose bid Mr Miles dismisses
as a 'knee-jerk reaction'.
He is confident that shareholders will share this view. 'We've demonstrated
that we've done a good job. I think they (the institutions) are learning
from other countries that churning is not necessarily the way to make
profits.'

FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 122m provisions force FNFC to loss
of Pounds 33.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the troubled consumer finance and
commercial banking group, plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.7m in the
year to October 31 after making provisions of Pounds 122m against bad debts
on second mortgages and other consumer and commercial lending. The loss
compared with a taxable profit of Pounds 36.4m in 1990.
There is no final dividend on the ordinary shares (8.5p). FNFC also passed
the interim dividend and any decision about restoring dividend payments is
unlikely to be taken until later this year.
Losses came to 13.4p per share (earnings 18.3p) and net assets per share
were 113p, down from 125p.
The total stock of FNFC's provisions now stands at Pounds 160m or about 10
per cent of its total loan book.
Mr Richard Langdon, chairman, said yesterday: 'The year has seen a depressed
property market, which has affected all aspects of our business as most
others have found who are engaged in lending money on property security.'
During the year, FNFC sold Pounds 206m of its loans to two continental banks
to boost its capital resources.
The sale was intended to reassure shareholders after the group's shares
tumbled from 104p in early October to 54p in three days.
Mr Langdon said that the group would have been all right even without the
sale of managed assets.
Yesterday the group's shares rose 7p in fairly active trading to close at
37p, after the market was encouraged by remarks from Mr Langdon of signs of
a fall in default levels and an expected recovery in the second half of the
year.
Total lending at the year-end was Pounds 1.65bn, of which Pounds 1.3bn was
consumer loans and Pounds 350m commercial. During 1991 FNFC did Pounds 430m
of new business of which Pounds 380m was consumer finance. There was a net
reduction of Pounds 32m in arrears during the autumn.
Group turnover, excluding banking business, totalled Pounds 58.3m (Pounds
59m).
There was a tax credit of Pounds 12.3m (charge Pounds 6.25m).
Only 250 of the group's 300,000 personal customers had their homes
repossessed by the group during the year, though this probably understates
the true extent of its clients' distress as most lending is on a second
mortgage basis.
Mr Langdon, who will be 73 in June, plans to retire after seven years as
FNFC chairman after the group's annual meeting in late February.
He will be succeeded by Mr Martin Mays-Smith, a former director of Kleinwort
Benson who is also chairman of Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: Seeking redress for unfair competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM KING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government recently announced that it has accepted recommendations
from the director-general of fair trading to amend the provision concerning
extortionate credit bargains. The amendment, we are told, will allow unjust
credit transactions to be reopened, including those which 'involved business
activity which was deceitful or oppressive or otherwise unfair and
improper'.
The government proposes that there be regulations setting out the factors to
be taken into account in determining whether the credit transaction was
unjust.
Therefore, the government accepts that a definition of unfair and improper
business activity can be achieved in the consumer credit area. The same
should be possible and is desirable in the area of unfair competition - that
is, where unfair and improper business activity of one trader damages
another. As things stand, redress is only available under specific headings
which do not provide complete coverage of all unfair trading activity and in
some cases are too complex or costly.
At a time when the consumer is increasingly well-protected and the interests
of the public and shareholders are being looked at under the corporate
governance review, it is unfortunate that similar steps are not being taken
in relation to general trading practices.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: No real purpose in continuing ban on Wagner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEAN L. DE MONTEBELLO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra announced that it would end a
53-year ban on Richard Wagner's music, I was delighted and filled with joy.
Now, however, it appears ('World News in Brief: Vote on Wagner music',
December 23) as if the ban will be in effect for a much longer period of
time, as a result of the senseless outcry from radicals of the Jewish
Community, and from the survivors of the Nazi holocaust, who wrongfully
pretend that Wagner openly espoused anti-semitism throughout his life.
True, Wagner was Hitler's favourite composer, but some obviously often
forget, or refuse to admit, that Wagner was also one of the world's finest
composers and a musical genius indeed.
So, whether or not Wagner was anti-semitic, I think it is time for the
Jewish community to realise that a continuing ban on Wagner and his work
would accomplish no real purpose.
One positive point: James Levine, main conductor of the Metropolitan Opera,
and a Jew, has been playing several of Wagner's operas for a long time now.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Dividends in recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the second half of the 1980s, Britain's corporate sector
increased dividend payments faster than profits. But not any more, it seems.
Last year dividends on the FT Actuaries All-Share Index rose by a mere 5 1/2
per cent, which is little more than a third of the rate experienced in the
late 1980s. Since that nominal increase is broadly in line with underlying
inflation, there was no increase in real terms. Is it a return to sanity or
a loss of boardroom nerve?
Making sense of British dividend policy is not as easy as it might be.
Economic theory suggests that the market should put an equal value on
retained profits and dividends, except to the extent that the tax system
favours one against the other. Since the Heath government's corporation tax
reforms of the early 1970s, the discrimination against dividends in favour
of retentions has largely been removed. Yet in practice the market is not
just neutral; it places a significantly higher value on dividend income -
witness the plunge in British Steel's share price when it warned last year
of a possible dividend cut.
The most plausible explanation is that Britain's unusually active market in
corporate control has caused dividend policy to become uniquely sensitive to
the pattern of portfolio demand. Whereas in Germany quoted companies are
able to adjust the annual payout to reflect the earnings trend without fear
of retribution, the British have to worry about hostile takeovers. It is no
coincidence that dividends started to outpace profitability in the mid-1980s
when the threat of a hostile bid became real even for ICI. In effect,
management has been paying its shareholders an advance loyalty bonus with
their own money.
Tax privileges
In Germany portfolio demand is heavily skewed towards fixed income. By
contrast, British investors' experience of inflation largely destroyed their
appetite for bonds in the 1970s and 1980s. Pension funds in particular
sought to match their liabilities with a rising dividend income from
equities, not least because of their right to reclaim tax on dividends. If
these tax-privileged institutions are viewed as the real owners of the
corporate sector and their stake in industry is consolidated, they pay an
effective 13 1/3 per cent tax rate on dividends compared to 35 per cent on
retentions.
But taxed investment institutions are equally yield conscious. And some take
the view that high yields and payout ratios are appropriate in an economy
where managerial performance has been unexciting. For if profits are
distributed in full, corporate investment and acquisition programmes would
have to be submitted to the institutions for approval. By this means fund
managers and trustees would appropriate for themselves the right to decide
whether profits were worth more in the hands of incumbent management or in
their own institutional coffers.
Feeble record
It sounds, at first blush, like enhanced accountability. Yet the
institutions' own record in holding management to account scarcely commands
respect. Their ability to identify bad investments and remedy bad management
is notoriously feeble. Nor is it clear that imposing institutional
priorities on the corporate sector makes wider economic sense.
Some smoothing of dividends may be acceptable in normal circumstances. But
the present profits squeeze is part of a wider structural adjustment to the
new disinflationary world of the ERM. In the past a recessionary fall in
real dividends has been brought about in much the same way that real house
prices have been allowed to fall without damage to nominal prices: inflation
has outstripped increases in declared dividends. Why should the
institutional rentiers be exempted from the adjustment to reality that home
owners now face?
It is tempting to explain the difference in dividend policy between
countries like Britain and Germany in terms of philosophy: liberal
capitalism versus corporatism. But that is too simplistic. The real issue is
about contrasting forms of corporatism. In the peculiarly British
corporatist model, the institutions have recently been acquiring more say
relative to management, which in turn has made gains over the past decade at
the expense of labour. The result is that dividends enjoy priority in a
recession over capital investment, pay and jobs. German corporatism. by
contrast, operates on the reverse set of priorities, with dividends coming
bottom.
Much of the recent increase in British dividends came from recession-proof
privatised monopolies and duopolies, which is probably why the market is not
expecting a sharp fall in nominal dividends this year. But last year's nil
real increase in the payout suggests that there may be a big squeeze in more
competitive sectors. Stand by for nasty surprises - and ponder those German
priorities.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Woman in the News: Bull in a Wall St bear garden - Elaine
Garzarelli
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no better embodiment of the extraordinary wave of optimism that has
been sweeping through the US stock markets than the person of Ms Elaine
Garzarelli, one of Wall Street's best-known analysts and among the most
vociferously bullish.
For Ms Garzarelli, who shot to celebrity status in 1987 when she correctly
forecast the October crash, reckons that the remarkable stock market rally
of the past 10 days is but a foretaste of a strong surge in equity prices
over the next year.
And this week Lehman Brothers' leading equity analyst was busily putting her
money where her mouth is, buying shares for her own account in General
Motors and International Business Machines - lumbering blue chip companies
which are being hurt severely by recession and suffer from very low stock
market ratings. 'When they're at these levels,' she says with a chuckle,
'you can't go wrong.'
Views like this put her at one end of a Wall Street spectrum which runs
through mild concern that the market is getting ahead of itself,
anticipating too much good news, to pessimistic warnings that the Christmas
rally could merely be the prelude to a market slide, if the US economy
remains stuck in recession or enters a prolonged depression.
Yet Ms Garzarelli's track record in recent years is impressive. Not only did
she predict the 1987 crash, but she had the prescience to do so on
television. She rightly dismissed the sudden downturn on Wall Street in
October 1989 as a blip and accurately called the bottom of the bear market
in the autumn of 1990. She urged investors to get into equities just ahead
of the Gulf war, when Wall Street was consumed with gloom, and was
vindicated by the Dow's subsequent 500-point surge.
Ever since 1984 fund managers polled by Institutional Investor magazine have
voted her the leading US quantitative analyst - that is someone who predicts
significant market turning points by feeding statistics into their own
computer models.
Nor have the 39-year-old Ms Garzarelli's powerful personality and flair for
self-publicity hurt her reputation. Her personal style is arresting  - a
combination of frizzy hair, designer clothes and stiletto heels, which has
earned her the nickname of 'Wall Street's Barbra Streisand'.
The daughter of a Philadelphia banker, she has a reputation for being a
highly strung loner, a workaholic and commanding a salary of Dollars 1m or
more. 'The market,' she says, 'is a passion. It's fun.'
She lives alone in a Greenwich Village apartment building, where she closets
herself for two weeks a month while working on her forecasts. But she
insists she has been developing a social life and was recently quoted as
saying she would like to adopt a child with a 'parental syndicate of three
men'.
Her investment advice is not without blemishes. Wall Street rivals point out
she has made some poor short-term predictions, including tipping General
Motors last summer before its share price plunged.
Nevertheless, she claims her system of 13 indicators has predicted all the
big market moves of the past 20 years. The indicators are broken down into
four groups, each of which has a roughly equal weighting - the economy,
monetary policy, share price valuation and investor sentiment.
She owes her success, she says to 'following my indicators, even when they
tell me to do things that are totally against my emotions'.
If changes in the direction of the market can be deduced in this manner, why
have others not copied her? The answer is that Ms Garzarelli's framework and
weightings, built up over 10 years, are uniquely hers. She claims, for
example, that no one else has the contacts to match her monitoring of
institutional cash holdings - an important factor in market liquidity.
So what makes her so much more optimistic now than most of her rivals? In
December, she says, 11 of her indicators were bullish and two neutral,
giving one of the strongest readings in their history.
Like most of Wall Street, she thinks the US is in the final stages of a
recession, and that the significant easing of monetary policy by the Federal
Reserve on December 20 - the prime reason for the stock market's recent
rally - shows the central bank will 'hold the economy's hand until it is up
and running'. That, she thinks, could feed through into average 22 per cent
growth in corporate earnings in 1992.
The more pessimistic analysts, however, argue that the Fed's easing move is
more a sign of desperation and of the depths of the economy's problems. They
maintain that with high unemployment, weak consumer confidence, an overhang
of corporate and personal debt from the 1980s and softening overseas
economies, the US recovery could be extremely sluggish and 1992 corporate
earnings could be disappointingly small.
Many analysts think that the ratio between the price of US shares and
corporate earnings - one of the most basic tools of stock price analysis -
shows that the US equity market is already assuming rather too much good
earnings news for comfort.
But Ms Garzarelli will have none of it. She says her rivals are making the
mistake of placing too much emphasis on earnings in the current recession
year, rather than 1992 and 1993, or are not discounting one-time write-offs
by companies which are in the process of restructuring.
She reckons that fair value for the Dow, given current interest rates, is
3,276 on the basis of prospective 1992 earnings and 3,520 for 1993 earnings.
However, Ms Garzarelli adds that the stock market usually tops out well
above fair value when economic growth is a long way from peaking and Fed
policy is easy, as is the case now. And this creates scope for the Dow to
rise by 20 per cent or more over the next 12 months, possibly to about
4,000.
The current rally, she argues, could last another two months and then be
followed by a 4 per cent to 7 per cent downward correction - not
sufficiently serious to merit selling shares.
Stocks Ms Garzarelli thinks will do particularly well include big players
with lowly market ratings in sectors which tend to mirror the ups and downs
of the economic cycle, such as General Motors, Westinghouse Electric, the
troubled conglomerate, and retailer Woolworth. 'With these you know you are
going to make gains twice as much as the market,' she declares.
And judging by the Christmas rally, an awful lot of investors would like to
believe her.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Job cuts by nappy producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWADDLERS, the Gateshead, Tyne and Wear producer of the UK's second most
popular disposable nappy brand, Togs, is shedding 75 jobs.
The company is blaming price cutting by retailers of Procter &amp; Gamble's
Pampers brand, which has about 68 per cent of the UK disposable nappy
market.
Togs has a 9 per cent market share, compared with 14 per cent early last
year, when Swaddlers employed 250 people. Mr Jim Clough, the managing
director, said yesterday the company's 1991 turnover would be about Pounds
27m, 5 per cent to 6 per cent lower than in 1990.
Mr Clough said Swaddlers had the support of its Italian parent, the Angelini
Group. He was hopeful there would be no more redundancies.
The cuts, which will reduce the Swaddlers workforce to 150, are the second
blow to hopes of making disposable nappy manufacturing a growth sector in
the north-east's economy. Last year Blue Ridge Care, of Consett, Co Durham,
went into receivership with the loss of 125 jobs.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Pension funds cut rate of investment
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL NET investments by insurance and pension funds during the third
quarter of 1991 fell by 2 per cent to nearly Pounds 9.4bn compared with the
same period last year, according to Central Statistical Office research
released yesterday.
There was a substantial shift away from short-term investments, and
particularly UK ordinary shares.
The CSO's analysis of a sample of pension funds and companies showed
investments by public and private pension funds were Pounds 3.9bn, while
holdings in long and short-term funds by insurance companies were Pounds
5.4bn.
There were substantial declines in holdings of short-term assets, with a net
fall of Pounds 185m in short-term investments by insurance companies in the
three-month period.
Net investment in UK shares by pensions funds fell 53 per cent to Pounds
1.8bn and that by insurance companies fell 57 per cent to Pounds 1bn.
Investment in overseas ordinary shares increased correspondingly during the
period to Pounds 5.2bn for insurance and pension funds.
Total long-term insurance funds were Pounds 5.6bn, Pounds 600m above the
previous quarter and Pounds 800m above the third quarter of 1990.
Net investments by pension funds in UK property rose to Pounds 300m,
however. This is the highest level since the last quarter of 1987. Net
investment in property by long-term insurance company funds was Pounds 400m,
slightly more than in the previous five quarters.

ALGERIA'S constitutional court has received at least 300 claims from

The claims affect 100 out of 430 constituencies. About half have been lodged
by candidates of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN). The FLN polled
1.5m votes, compared with more than 3m for their opponents in the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS). But the FLN won only 15 seats, against 188 for the
FIS.
Reuter adds: A Moslem fundamentalist, Abdelkader Moghni, newly elected to

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S private sector is taking advantage of a partial liberalisation of
the hitherto strict foreign exchange controls to repatriate blocked
dividends and pay for imports.
Nairobi bankers and businessmen said yesterday that the freely convertible
foreign exchange certificates of deposit, introduced by the government last
October under its structural adjustment programme, had given the private
sector a small boost of confidence in an otherwise gloomy economic
environment.
According to bankers at least Dollars 6m-Dollars 7m of the certificates have
already been issued by the Central Bank of Kenya and about half have been
redeemed. Demand for the certificates is high among foreign banks and
companies desperate to repatriate an estimated Dollars 60m (Pounds 33m) of
dividends blocked from 1989 and 1990 and importers previously denied foreign
exchange allocations.
An embryonic inter-bank market in the certificates is beginning to develop
as commercial banks catch on to the pilot scheme. The certificates are
trading at a premium of 12-15 per cent above the prevailing rate of exchange
 -about 5-10 per cent below the black market rate for the Kenya shilling.
Until the policy was introduced foreign companies had to wait up to 30
months for the Central Bank to unblock their profits which, while earning
17-18 per cent interest, were suffering from a weakening currency. The Kenya
shilling depreciated against the US dollar last year by 17 per cent.
So far the scheme has remained limited because the biggest denomination for
the certificates is Dollars 10,000 and few bankers have caught on to trading
the certificates. The government has also yet to include the export of goods
and services under the regulations.
Furthermore, foreign exchange flowing into the country has slowed to a
trickle as donors have suspended aid programmes because of corruption and
economic mismanagement, and investors, apart from a few in the tourism
sector, remain cautious about the economic prospects. Estimates suggest that
Kenya's foreign reserves could be as little as 3-5 weeks of imports.
Kenyan businessmen are hoping that, faced with a critical shortage of
foreign exchange in the next four months, the government will stand by, and
even expand, the scheme and squeeze public sector imports instead.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Serbs in push for rump Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, yesterday rallied Serbs from
neighbouring republics in a drive to form a smaller, rump Yugoslavia
dominated by Serbia.
The meeting of Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, which took place
in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, coincided with the
implementation of another ceasefire.
Forged earlier this week by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, the latest
ceasefire is the 15th. Its success is a precondition for the dispatch of UN
peace-keeping troops to Croatia.
Croatia wants the troops in place as soon as possible, preferably before
January 15, when the European Community recognises the independence of those
republics which want it.
With the exception of Serbia and Montenegro, all the republics - Slovenia,
Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia - have applied for EC recognition.
However, some Serb-inhabited enclaves in Croatia are seeking their own
status as states, as well as the Serbian-controlled ethnic Albanian province
of Kosovo.
Yesterday Mr Mario Nobilo, an adviser to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman,
said the chances for a lasting ceasefire were greater now because of a
'shift in policy from the US following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The
US now recognises that Yugoslavia cannot be held together.'
But he expressed concern that if UN peace-keeping forces were not sent soon
fighting would spread to other parts of the country.
These fears were confirmed during the conference of pro-Yugoslav political
parties in Belgrade, an attempt by Serbia to unite under one roof the
country's Serb communities.
'Let us as soon as possible reconstitute the Yugoslav state community and
form a stable state with organs and institutions which are efficiently going
to protect the interests of all citizens,' Mr Brank Kostic, the vice
president of the Serb-dominated collective presidency, said. The congress,
not attended by Serbia's main opposition parties, is expected to agree on a
draft resolution aimed at establishing a new parliament for a rump
Yugoslavia, and create a framework for establishing borders for the new
state.

FT  04 JAN 92 / German economic confidence declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S leading economic institutes have sharply reduced their 1992 growth
forecasts and industrial confidence has plummeted, according to researchers
at the Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft (IW) in Cologne. Investment budgets
have been pruned, and leading employers are preparing to reduce their
payrolls.
Four of the seven main organisations questioned by the IW now expect gross
domestic product to grow by only 1.5 per cent, with the remainder expecting
2 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent during 1991. Last autumn they were
expecting a 2.5 per cent improvement.
'The institutes have seldom been so gloomy,' the IW said. Arguing that all
the causes of weakness were 'home-made', it blamed over-generous 1991 pay
rises and a worsening of the investment climate following the recent
half-point increase in German interest rates. Increased taxes and duties
also played a part.
Progress could be even slower if the economists' optimism about the growth
in sales to reviving export markets - estimates range between 4 and 6 per
cent - proves ill-founded. Sales outside Germany account for more than 40
per cent of gross domestic product.
The forecasts also allow for pay settlements lower than the 6 to 7 per cent
rises awarded last year. Unions which have so far put in their claims are
demanding 10 per cent increases.
A separate IW poll of confidence in 39 key industrial sectors showed 30
starting the year in pessimistic mood. Only foreign trade companies said
their situation was better than a year earlier. Oil and plastics companies,
hotel owners, publishers, clothing and food makers claimed their position
was unchanged.

THE 12 member states of the European Community should agree to open joint
embassies in each of the ex-Soviet republics, and urgently develop a new
form of EC treaty to accommodate them, according to Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the German foreign min-ister.
At the same time, he called on Nato to hold an emergency meeting of its
newly formed co-operation council, at foreign minister level, to admit the
ex-Soviet republics in place of the Soviet Union. Mr Genscher also urged
their inclusion in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE) before the end of this month.
Mr Genscher spelt out his ideas for an urgent reassessment of western policy
towards eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, the newly formed
Commonwealth of Independent States, in a newspaper interview published
today.
He called on all EC member states to agree on joint embassies in the former
Soviet republics, as a way of promoting a common foreign policy in a
concrete way, and answering their immediate need for a string of new
missions.
'If all 12 (EC members) are not ready for such a step, then we are
determined to undertake such a step along with individual member states,' he
told the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, published in his home town of Halle.
'I think it is necessary for Germany to be represented in all these
republics,' he said.
Meanwhile Russia said yesterday it was prepared to represent other republics
at the former Soviet embassies it has taken over all around the world.

FT  04 JAN 92 / Washington budget battle begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle over the future of the budget agreement that has curbed US
government spending since 1990 opened yesterday as the US Congress returned
to Washington for its first session of 1992.
President George Bush said he saw 'room for some manoeuvring' within the
limits imposed by the budget pact, although he wanted to preserve the
ceiling on overall spending.
In Congress, meanwhile, leading Democrats called for an end to the budget
agreement's spending curbs to allow radical measures to stimulate economic
growth.
These opening shots foreshadow a battle in earnest when Mr Bush announces
his plans for an economic growth package on January 28 and in the 1993
budget he is due to propose in February.
In a television interview due to be broadcast last night, he said cuts in
defence spending could be used to increase domestic spending or to reduce
the federal budget deficit.
The 1990 budget places separate caps on domestic, defence and foreign
discretionary spending, and forbids any transfer of funds from one category
to another. However, these separate caps are due to expire in the 1994
budget, allowing money to be shifted from defence to domestic spending.
Mr Bush, who is visiting Singapore as part of a 12-day Far East trip, said
he wanted to live within the caps, but there were ways to juggle spending
among the different categories, although this would require new legislation.
While the budget agreement already programmes a 6 per cent reduction in
defence spending to Dollars 295bn (Pounds 162bn) in the 1993 budget, the
administration is now considering cutting Dollars 50bn more from defence
spending over the next five years.
In Congress, meanwhile, Senator Paul Sarbanes, chairman of the joint
economic committee, and Senator Jim Sasser, chairman of the Senate budget
committee, called for a package including federal grants to local government
in order to pull the economy out of recession.
Mr Sasser said that unlike previous recessions, where the government had
provided a fiscal stimulus, this recession was being prolonged by fiscal
contraction at all levels of government which he described as 'de facto
Hooverism'.
'Getting this economy back on its feet is a condition precedent to getting
the deficit under control. We have got to have a short-term recovery before
we can have long-term fiscal health,' he said.
His counterpart in the House of Representatives, Congressman Leon Panetta,
is now almost alone in attempting to preserve the discipline of the budget
agreement.
Mr Panetta warned recently that although the federal budget deficit is
likely to fall from a peak of Dollars 362bn in the current fiscal year to
Dollars 179bn in 1996, it will grow again to Dollars 335bn by 2001 under the
influence of slow long-term economic growth, rising medical costs and the
lingering debt service cost of cleaning up failed Savings and Loans and
banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN creditor nations met yesterday to finalise an accord to delay until
the end of this year repayment of principal on the former Soviet Union's
official debt.
The meeting between the Paris Club of 17 creditor nations and a delegation
from Vnesheconombank, the Soviet bank for foreign economic affairs, follows
the end of the November agreement by the Group of Seven industrialised
countries to allow deferral of about Dollars 3.6bn in repayments of
principal due by the end of 1992, and to ask other creditor nations to
follow suit.
Since then, eight of the republics have confirmed that they accept
responsibility for the foreign debts and bank creditors have agreed to delay
repayments of principal on commercial debt.
Lionel Barber adds from Washington: The US supports early consideration of
membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for Russia,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belorussia, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia, Mr Nicholas Brady,
US Treasury Secretary, said yesterday.
The US is establishing diplomatic relations with these six republics. Mr
Brady said the US was ready to support other republics' membership once
diplomatic relations were in place.
Vnesheconombank has injected Pounds 70m into Moscow Narodny Bank to allow
the UK-based institution to take additional charges against its Soviet loan
exposure, AP-DJ reports.
Moscow Narodny, which halted unsecured lending to the Soviet Union more than
a year ago, has thus raised its total capital to Pounds 190.3m, up 58 per
cent.

FT  04 JAN 92 / BCCI liquidation ordered by court in Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE winding-up of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, closed by
regulators six months ago, was finally triggered by a Luxembourg court
yesterday, although this is not expected to interfere with talks over a
compensation scheme for depositors.
The Luxembourg district court ordered the liquidation of BCCI SA, the
Luxembourg-based part of the group which controls branches in many parts of
the world, including the UK. This is the first step in what is likely to be
a chain of similar judgments around the world, bringing the entire group
into liquidation in the coming weeks.
The High Court in the UK is also due to consider a winding-up order against
BCCI SA on January 14, while the Cayman islands-based BCCI Overseas, which
controls the other main operations of the group, is expected to be placed
into liquidation at the same time.
Representatives of Abu Dhabi, the bank's controlling shareholder, had argued
before against a winding-up in the UK, and said this might jeopardise a
compensation plan being backed by the Gulf emirate. However, talks over
compensation between Abu Dhabi and Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross partner
acting as administrator of the Luxembourg parts of BCCI, were yesterday said
to be on course.
Abu Dhabi representatives said the winding-up would not stop a later deal
being agreed.
Meanwhile, PaineWebber, the US securities house, has told BCCI depositors it
believes it could obtain for them a better deal in an alternative
liquidation plan.
The PaineWebber plan estimates that it would be possible to achieve a final
return for depositors of between 52 and 85 cents in the dollar. This
compares with the existing forecast by Touche Ross, the provisional
liquidators, of 30 to 40 cents in the dollar.
The plan envisages the formation of a new investment company to transform
debt into equity and to manage out the assets of BCCI in an actively trading
company.

IN THE old days of Soviet power, Mr Anatoly Kiryushkin, a trained geologist
who earned his living as a graphic artist, channelled his talents into
stamp-collecting. But nowadays he has no time for stamps. He has joined a
pioneering class of small entrepreneurs, on whom the success of market
reforms in the former Soviet Union largely depends.
Ten years ago Mr Kiryushkin was predicting a rapid end to the dictatorial
communist system under which he and his compatriots were still living. Still
cautious, however, after five years of perestroika, he decided to set up a
small business only last spring. 'It was then I decided that the changes
were irreversible,' he says - though his wife Ira still mocks his business
activities because she fears the Communists could still 'come back and take
everything away'.
Mr Kiryushkin, 40, does not share his wife's fears of a political cataclysm.
But given the collapsing distribution system and the prospect of
hyperinflation as real market reforms begin, he is glad that his Minsk
typesetting bureau, which also produces fonts for desktop publishing, relies
on few inputs. 'All we need are our computers, electricity and our brains,'
he says.
Having increased turnover 10 times to Rbs150,000 for last month, he still
sees the greatest threat to his business as high inflation and the fact that
his fledgling business is still dependent on a few large customers. When the
cost of computers was tripled in November, he was locked into keeping his
fees at the same level, but was almost bankrupted when one customer delayed
payment for a particularly big contract by five weeks.
The company, registered as a small business under Soviet legislation which
gave him a two-year tax holiday, is housed in two rooms of a student hostel.
He pays a modest rent of Rbs177 a month per room but is looking for better
premises 'now that we have more money'.
The new office will also have a telephone, Mr Kiryushkin hopes. The local
authorities told him he could only have a telephone connected at the hostel
if he gave them a brand-new refrigerator, which, when they can be found at
all, would cost Rbs5,000, double the official price of installing a
telephone.
The authorities in newly-independent Belorussia are also proving
unpredictable. They are cancelling all tax concessions awarded by the old
Soviet authorities to new businesses, says Mr Kiryushkin, but they have not
yet published the rates for the taxes they intend to charge for 1992.
'Even the tax authorities say they do not know what they will be asking us
for,' he complains.
The company, Nestor, employs eight full-time staff and 15 freelances. Basic
salaries are relatively low for the new business sector at Rbs600 a month,
but thanks to a piece-work system - which he devised to make people work
harder than at their old state enterprises - staff take home between three
and six times as much.
Asked where he learned to run a business at a time when foreign technical
assistance is designed to help people learn how to operate a market economy,
Mr Kiryushkin says he is indebted to his stamp-collecting - the only form of
entrepreneurial activity allowed 10 years ago.
The success of his business would also have been unthinkable without the
personal contacts which have oiled the heavy machinery of Soviet life for
decades. Mr Kiryushkin was able for instance to buy his first computer
without a bank loan because a friend ran a computer import enterprise and
agreed to let him pay by instalments.
Thus, Nestor was started up with Rbs5,000 in personal savings ploughed in by
Mr Kiryushkin the chairman with a 55 per cent stake, and Mr Vladimir Kotov,
a journalist who is the managing director, with 45 per cent.
Mr Kiryushkin is determined to avoid having to borrow money from the bank,
because he does not want to be dependent on a bank manager and says he can
borrow money more cheaply from other businesses.
But despite his firm belief in the success of a market economy, Mr
Kiryushkin agrees with his wife that some aspects of the new order are still
fragile - in particular the transformation of Belorussia into an independent
state now officially called Belarus.
A Russian, Mr Kiryushkin is upset that he is now officially a foreigner
living in a foreign country, but he also believes that it will not be long
before Belarus, an artificially created independent state, rejoins Russia in
some form or another.

FT  04 JAN 92 / New Jewish settlement set up in Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jewish settlers in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday established a new
settlement outside a Palestinian refugee camp in retaliation for the
shooting dead of one of their colleagues in an ambush by unidentified
Palestinian gunmen on Wednesday.
The dead man, Mr Doron Shorshan, was the fourth Israeli shot dead in the
West Bank and Gaza since October in a wave of attacks which have alarmed and
infuriated the 100,000-strong settler communities. Their leaders say they
will respond to every such killing with a new settlement. Hamas, a
Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group, replied by urging Palestinians 'to
attack settlers everywhere'.
The latest settlement, comprised of three mobile homes, comes a few days
before Middle East peace talks are due to resume in Washington.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Ghali pledges to fight for human rights: New UN chief takes
over from Perez de Cuellar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt formally took over from Mr Javier Perez de
Cuellar yesterday as the sixth secretary-general of the United Nations and
pledged to create a new momentum for peace-making and 'above all' defend
human rights and democracy all over the world, Reuter reports from New York.
The first secretary-general from Africa, Mr Ghali said he wanted to 'create
a new momentum' that would help the UN play 'a more important role in
peace-keeping, peace-building, economic and social co-operation and above
all defending human rights and the democratic institutions all over the
world.'
Mr Ghali stayed away from the UN complex on New Year's Eve to allow his
predecessor, Mr Perez de Cuellar of Peru, to crown his diplomatic career
with a peace accord for El Salvador, which he worked on until the clock
struck 12.
While the new secretary greeted his cabinet and a host of under
secretary-generals warmly, it is not clear which of them will survive an
expected major reform of the bureaucracy.
A group of diplomats, led by Australian ambassador Mr Peter Wilenski, has
already given him a host of suggestions for trimming top posts and
appointing four deputies in an effort to streamline the organisation.
President George Bush in talks with Mr Ghali after his November election put
his weight behind the Wilenski proposals and changes are expected next
month.
Mr Ghali comes to his UN job with impressive credentials. He was Egypt's
deputy foreign minister for 14 years and recently its deputy prime minister.
He also played a pivotal role in forging the 1979 Camp David peace accords
between Egypt and Israel, although the Israelis criticised him as a
hardliner.
Mr Ghali is known as a technocrat who avoids the limelight despite
considerable foreign policy achievements. As an Egyptian he can claim to be
both Arab and African. He is also a Coptic Christian from a mainly Moslem
country and married to an Egyptian Jew, who converted to his religion.
Mr Ghali must pick up the pieces left over from the old order, as in
Cambodia and Afghanistan, and deal with a new era of ethnic warfare in
Yugoslavia and the break-up of the Soviet Union.

FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers strike at Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKETMAKERS attributed the latest sharp fall in Ladbroke to 'just another
bear raid', and said a line of 1m shares was sold into the market and the
broker involved could only manage to place the shares in much smaller lumps.
The leisure group, whose businesses encompass betting shops, hotels and
property development, has suffered from a number of similar raids during
recent months.
The shares fell to 218p before struggling off the bottom and ending a
difficult session a net 13 lower at 219p. Turnover reached 3.1m, well up on
usual levels of business in the stock. No clear reasons were put forward for
the latest slide, but there were persistent rumours of imminent property
revaluations and of a series of possible property sales.
Forte shares were also under pressure, closing 8 down at 225p, albeit on
unremarkable volume of 1.6m. The stock was recently downgraded by a number
of influential analysts.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo dropped in early trading on consideration of a
US report linking its Zantac ulcer drug with higher blood-alcohol
concentration in patients who drink socially. The stock picked up as
investors bought on weakness but fell again on US profit-taking. The shares
were also affected by an easier early showing for Wall Street and closed 15
off at 838p. The US report mentioned Zantac along with SmithKline Beecham's
Tagamet.
However, SmithKline Beecham responded to a New Year's Eve announcement by
the company that its anti-arthritis drug Relifen had received US approval.
The shares were also helped by some switching from the SmithKline units,
which slipped 10 to 4163p. The 'A' shares jumped 57p, some 6 per cent, in
early trading, although they finished the session only 4p up at 900p.
Wellcome reached a new high on appreciation of a US study showing that, when
Wellcome's Aids drug Retrovir is used together with an experimental drug
from Roche, treatment of the disease might be improved.
The shares advanced 32 before ending a net 24 ahead at 1125p. The rise
followed a jump of more than Pounds 1 earlier this week after UK tests
showed Retrovir's performance was boosted when used with Wellcome's Zovirax
anti-herpes drug to treat Aids patients.
Racal Electronics, which recently beat off a hotly contested bid from
Williams Holdings, topped the list of active stocks for the second
consecutive trading session, with turnover reaching 13m shares. The day's
activity included a single trade of 3m shares transacted at 51 1/2 p, plus a
number of deals of around 1m apiece. At the close, Racal was 1 1/2 easier at
51p.
Vodafone sped up to 385p at one point, before settling only 2 firmer at
379p.
BT 'new' were hard on the heels of Racal in terms of volume, with 13m shares
changing hands. The stock finished a half-penny firmer at 122 3/4 p.
ICI was down on the day as investors took profits after recent sharp gains.
The shares, which leapt by 76 points on Tuesday and outperformed a very
strong stock market, were not helped by cautious comment yesterday from Sir
Denys Henderson, the chairman. They retreated 22 to 1188p on a turnover of
1.1m.
Wall Street's early downturn yesterday reversed a gain in BAT Industries,
which lost a net 4 at 624p. Turnover of 6m was boosted by a line of 1m
shares traded at 630p.
Hanson, which closed marginally firmer at 200 1/2 p, saw a line of 8.5m
American Depositary Receipts - equivalent to 42.5m shares - traded at
Dollars 19.5.
British Aerospace fell 14 to 306p. Nomura Research pointed out to clients
the uncertainties over the company's cash position.
Shell Transport gave the best performance of the oil leaders, closing
another 5 ahead at 503p on good turnover of 4.8m, having responded to firmer
crude oil prices.
BP, on the other hand, slipped back 2 to 291p on 6.2m. There were stories in
the market that BP had increased its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices by
around 3 per cent and that Calor Group, a big supplier of bottled gas, may
not be able to pass on such a rise, thereby squeezing its profit margins.
Calor declined 4 to 206p on the rumours.
Lasmo staged a spirited recovery, moving up 5 to 228p on heavy turnover of
3m shares. Dealers noted a number of new year tips for the stock.

FT  03 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds from early fall
to set new record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARE PRICES on Wall Street began the new year on a weaker note yesterday,
but by the close of trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen to
yet another record level. It is the market's eighth straight advance and the
fifth consecutive record high, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Having stood over 20 points lower at mid-morning and been down by a similar
amount at mid-afternoon, the Dow advanced to 3,172.41, up a modest 3.58 on
the day.
Throughout the session, traders suggested that most of the selling pressure
came from short-term investors taking profits after the market's
post-Christmas surge.
The trend was broadly similar for other indices and markets. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a marginal 0.17 higher at 417.26,
while the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter shares was finally 0.11 up at
586.45. Volume on the Big Board by the close stood at 207.6m shares, with
declining stocks modestly outweighing rises.
Statistics released yesterday morning sounded contradictory messages about
the state of the US economy and had relatively little effect on share
prices. The latest National Association of Purchasing Management survey was
far more gloomy than economists had predicted, suggesting that the composite
index had fallen to 46.5 per cent - the first time it has dropped below 50
per cent since May. A reading below 50 per cent indicates that the
manufacturing sector is declining.
Within the NAPM index, the employment constituent showed a particularly
marked fall. However, labour department figures suggested that initial
jobless claims fell by 29,000 to 438,000 in the week ended December 21 -
significantly better than pundits had predicted.
In the retail sector, dealers continued to pay attention to news of
Christmas sales; shares in Toys 'R' Us gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 34 3/4
after the company said eight-week same-store sales, including the Christmas
period, rose by 7.9 per cent. GTE, the telecommunications group, slipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 on news that it is selling its stake in US
Sprint to United Telecom for Dollars 530m. United Telecom was Dollars  1/8
down at Dollars 23 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO experienced a very quiet trading session and only partially
recovered from an early setback.
The composite index, down 29 points at midsession, was finally 18.7 off at
3,493.7. Falls led rises by 290 to 204 after a volume of 11.6m shares.
Peoples Jewellers 'A' gained 60 cents to CDollars 2.35. Creditors of Zale
Corp, which is 47 per cent owned by Peoples, moved to force Zale into
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation in the US. Zale announced on Monday
that it will close 400 of its 2,000 stores. Mr Charles Gill, president of
Peoples, said he knew of no reason for the stock's rise.

SPAIN stood out with a 3 per cent drop in a quiet 1992 debut for European
bourses. Other late-closers came off their highs on Wall Street's easier
start, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID blamed a technical reaction for its weakness, following year-end
window dressing. The general index tumbled 7.31 to 238.93, although turnover
was thin at around Pta7bn after more than Pta20bn on Tuesday.
FRANKFURT broke through 1,600 on the DAX index, which closed 23.90 higher at
1,601.88 after a gain of 11.61 to 651.92 for the FAZ at midsession. Volume
rose from Monday's DM2.9bn to DM3.4bn.
Ms Barbara Schumacher of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said the launch of
Germany's new unity bond, with an 8 per cent coupon to yield 7.94 per cent,
was achieved on better-than-expected terms. This led to a fall of 5 basis
points, to 8.35 per cent, in the Bundesbank's average bond yield, and rises
in bank and insurance shares. Deutsche Bank put on DM12.70 to DM683.90, and
Allianz DM40 to DM2,138.
PARIS's CAC 40 index rose as high as 1,765.49 on a firm bond market but then
fell back on profit-taking and Wall Street to close at 1,749.91, down 15.75.
Turnover was estimated at a thin FFr900m.
Among blue-chips which fell after their recent gains, L'Oreal fell FFr18 to
FFr733 and L'Air Liquide lost FFr17 to FFr686.
MILAN was steady in thin trading. The Comit index eased 0.36 to 507.43 in
turnover estimated at L50bn after Tuesday's L66bn. The introduction of
new-style brokerages or Sims added to the cautious mood.
Pirelli ordinary shares fell L40 to L1,055, weakened by last month's
revelations of heavy losses linked to the failed takeover of Germany's
Continental. On the upside, the telephone company Sip rose L18 to L1,382 and
the insurer Generali added L70 to L28,290.
AMSTERDAM was weakened by Wall Street. The CBS Tendency index, re-based to
100 at end-1990 values, closed up 1.1 at 113.6, after a high of 114.8.
BRUSSELS saw the retailer Delhaize jump BFr500 or 5.9 per cent to BFr8,910
in response to the rise in shares in its US subsidiary, Food Lion. The Bel
20 index rose 15.74 to 1,108.46.
STOCKHOLM fell back after its end-1991 recovery, the Affarsvarlden General
index closing 3.90 lower at 913.70 in low volume. Astra free Bs fell SKr10
to SKr580, and Ericsson by SKr3 to SKr105.
OSLO was less pessimistic, the all-share index rising 5.38, or 1.3 per cent
to 418.93 in turnover worth NKr332m.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound climbs back into favour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING inched its way back into the bid books yesterday as the D-Mark came
under greater pressure due to price deregulation in the Soviet Union.
Many traders who arrived early yesterday - anticipating the much-hyped
'great sterling crisis' - were relieved to see more buyers than sellers for
the UK currency. However, most of the market's big players were still on
holiday and next Monday is widely regarded to be the real testing day for
the pound.
Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer and market analyst at Sumitomo Bank, said:
'People are waiting to see what will happen. If the Soviet situation gets
worse, then the D-Mark will weaken, letting sterling off the hook.'
Sterling gained almost 2 pfennigs on the previous close in London to end at
DM2.8513.
The pressure on the D-Mark took some of the heat out of sterling's position
within the European ERM. The German currency finished at 44 per cent of its
permitted divergence above the central Ecu rate, compared with 54 per cent
before the new year holiday.
However, the easing was not enough to lift sterling from the floor of the
EMS grid, where it languished for the whole day.
Sterling also closed higher against the dollar, up from Dollars 1.8678 to
Dollars 1.8740, but in New York the pound fell to Dollars 1.8665.
During the day the dollar came under pressure from a stronger yen and the
general economic malaise in the US.
The yen moved up on expectations of concessions to US President George Bush
when he visits Tokyo next week. The recent cut in Japan's discount rate has
only strengthened traders' opinions that Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa will
calm Mr Bush's fears of protectionism with a promise to keep the yen firm.
However, with the Japanese market closed, moves were slightly exaggerated in
a generally thin business, traders said.
Statistics published in the US yesterday also continued to justify bearish
sentiment on the dollar.
The purchasing managers' report, which analyses the trading expectations of
US companies, showed that economic growth had been sharply lower in December
than during the previous month. It dropped to 46.5 per cent, the first time
it has fallen to less than 50 per cent during the past six months.
By the end of trading in London, however, the dollar was beginning to claw
its way back. The US unit ended at Y124.55, compared with Y124.95 at the
previous close, and a low during the day of Y123.75.
The dollar closed virtually unchanged against the D-Mark at DM1.5218 after a
session low of DM1.5110. In New York, heavy D-Mark selling gave the dollar,
yen and pound an early boost. The more suspicious traders bounced rumours of
intervention to ease ERM pressure, while others put the movements down to
mere speculation. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.5302 and
Y124.38.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Base rate fears fade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONEY markets took a breather yesterday as fears over an interest rate
rise began to fade.
Sterling's stronger showing from the early hours gave some reassurance that
the UK government would be able to avoid a rate rise for the time being.
However, with most of the market still on new year holiday, dealers were
cautious about too much optimism.
'Everyone is waiting for something,' commented one senior trader. 'The whole
picture is one of calm before next week's storm.'
Many dealers attributed sterling's rally, not just to encouraging noises
from Downing Street, but also to a scramble to cover short positions.
The Bank of England gave an early and clear signal that it anticipated no
rise in rates when before noon it injected Pounds 265m to cover a forecast
Pounds 550m shortage. The assistance was high, given the uncommonly low
shortage.
During the day, the Bank revised its forecast to Pounds 650m, and provided a
total of Pounds 504m in bands 1,3 and 4 bank and treasury bills - all at the
lower end of market rates. The bank's actions helped to keep overnight money
soft, and it traded around the 10 per cent mark during most of the day.
The market was forecasting a shortage for tomorrow of Pounds 950m.
The Bank's actions - along with statements from its governor, Mr Robin Leigh
Pemberton, that there would be no need for an interest rate rise - appeared
to give some heart to short sterling contracts.
The March futures contract surprised the market by rising to 89.40, implying
an interest rate of 10.6 per cent.
Yet most dealers - although feeling slightly comforted by the government's
determin-ation to keep rates steady, at the very least - are still expecting
a rate rise in the medium term. The key three months inter-bank rate eased
slightly, although at 10 7/8 - 3/4 per cent it still indicated a  1/2 point
rise early this year.
In the US, traders were talking of pressure for a further rate cut as the
latest economic figures gave little indication of an upturn. Jobless claims,
although better than expected, were still too high, economists said.
Federal Funds traded at around 4 7/16 per cent, above the Federal Reserve's
presumed target of 4 per cent. Year-end pressures had forced the funds rate
upwards, dealers said.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet imports 'key to
commodity prospects'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTS BY the former Soviet Union in the coming year will be the key factor
in soft commodity prices, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Some commodities are likely to benefit from the Soviet collapse, including
wheat, maize, barley and oilseed meals. Others, such as sugar, will suffer
from depressed demand.
The EIU points out that in 1989-90 Soviet imports accounted for 25 per cent
of world trade in maize and barley, 20 per cent of the sugar trade, 16 per
cent of wheat trade and 15 per cent of soyabean meal trade. 'Its ability to
feed itself to a greater or lesser degree is a matter of concern to
exporters of those commodities, and to importers competing for the same
supplies.'
The latest figure for the 1991 Soviet grain harvest - 156.3m tonnes - is
also the most alarming, sharply down on earlier estimates of between 180m
and 190m tonnes. However, that figure could be unduly pessimistic as the
Soviet authorities have a vested interest in painting the picture as black
as possible in order to strengthen their case for requesting food aid.
In any case, predictions of famine have been exaggerated, the EIU believes.
The 1990 Soviet harvest was good, and it is likely that a fair amount of
Soviet grain, still on the farms, will find its way in to use. In addition,
the realistic pricing of bread has reduced consumption, principally because
there is less waste now the cost is not derisory.
The EIU estimates that the most the Soviet Union will be physically able to
import in 1991-92 will be about 40m tonnes, 2m tonnes more than the 1989-90
figure. 'That amount would keep the international trade nicely topped up
without blowing prices through the roof.'
The Soviet Union needs imports not to avoid famine, but to avoid paying
decent prices for home produced goods, the EIU suggests. 'The fact that
state grain procurement late in October was only a quarter of the projected
harvest and only half what was needed to feed the population through the
winter months is an indication that Soviet farmers are in revolt, and are
holding back supplies until farm-gate food prices are raised substantially
in real terms.'
The EIU believes that farmers' dissatisfaction contributed to the poor 1991
harvest, and points out that the authorities do not have long to motivate
them for the 1992 harvest. However, in the long run the Soviet Union will
again be an agricultural exporter.
Soviet sugar imports are not expected to exceed 4m tonnes in 1992, compared
with 4.6m tonnes in 1991. The EIU cites the shortage of hard currency, the
transition to a market economy and the prospects of a better domestic crop.
Of subsidiary importance is the Soviets' ability to afford luxuries such as
cocoa and coffee. However, from the coffee and cocoa producers' viewpoint,
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe are among the best potential markets.
Consumption rates for coffee in the Soviet Union are low, averaging only
0.24 kg a head in 1988, compared with saturation rates of more than 10 kg a
head in some European countries, the EIU points out.
Soviet cocoa grindings are estimated to have fallen to a 20-year low of
75,000 tonnes in 1990-91. International Cocoa Organisation figures show
Soviet consumption at 0.71 kg a head, compared with Switzerland's 4.62 kg.
However, in both commodities the EIU predicts that the shortage of hard
currency will prevent any big improvement in Soviet consumption figures for
at least another year.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine crops washed out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 24-hour downpour over the new year holiday has wreaked havoc in
Argentina's agricultural heartland. Mr Marcelo Regunaga, the agriculture
secretary, said yesterday that 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres) of farm land
in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe were affected by the
rainfall and estimated damage at about USDollars 250m.
The rain has affected winter crops in the Pampas, principally wheat and
barley, which are due to be harvested now. The new year downpour compounded
damage caused by heavy rainfall during December. If Mr Regunaga's estimates
are borne out, wheat would be the most affected crop. Analysts value this
year's crop at Dollars 800m to Dollars 900m.
Unusually, independent observers say the government is over-reacting:
usually, government officials accuse farmers of exaggerating their problems.
Yesterday, analysts warned that it was still too early to estimate the
impact of the rainfall and emphasised that the weather over the coming days
would be crucial to evaluating the situation.
Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an agricultural economist, commented: 'If we have a day
of strong sunshine followed by two or three days of dry weather, wheat could
easily recover and barley would hardly be affected. It would be risky to
hazard a figure on the damage at the moment.'
However, officials estimate damage of Dollars 100m in Buenos Aires province
from storms earlier in the month.
The bad weather caps a year in which Argentina's farmers struggled with
rising production costs and falling prices as the government implemented a
radical anti-inflation and economic liberalisation programme. However,
government officials insist that prices are improving and that production
costs will stabilise in 1992.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uncertainties cloud US farming
outlook - Election year politics could again ease growers' sufferings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN FARMERS are facing a new year as shrouded in uncertainty as any in
recent times. The collapse of the Soviet Union puts into jeopardy one of
their most lucrative markets; trade war with China is looming; and the
condition of the world economy is precarious.
Negotiators in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade are still deadlocked on farm trade reform. Even the course of the El
Nino weather phenomenon is confounding experts, who worry that it could
trigger droughts in some areas at a time when US grain stocks are
uncomfortably low.
At the annual outlook conference of the US Department of Agriculture
Department last month, Mr James Donald, head of the USDA's World Agriculture
Outlook Board, put an optimistic face on 1992 for American farmers. Global
crop production would fall but animal output would grow, creating many more
hungry mouths to feed, he said.
Higher grain prices and an increased volume of wheat, soyabean and
horticultural product exports would boost the value of farm exports to
Dollars 39bn, up 4 per cent from 1991, Mr Donald forecast. World commodity
demand would increase because of real economic growth of about 2.5 per cent,
population growth of 1.7 per cent and a 2 per cent rise in meat output.
Meanwhile a 'modest increase' could be expected in input prices. However,
the overall result would be cash returns only 'close' to 1991 levels.
Mr Robert McElroy, a USDA agricultural economist, predicted a rise in US
wheat prices next year. But he told the conference a threatened drop in
other grain prices could lead to an overall drop in incomes. That would be a
further blow to a sector where bankruptcies are continuing at a brisk pace,
although not at the rate of the early 1980s.
Mr Mitchell Morehart, another USDA agricultural economist, acknowledged that
the rapid changes in the world had made it 'pretty difficult' to forecast
net farm income. The drop in US interest rates would benefit some farmers
and a possible fall in fuel prices would also help.
Maize is the largest single component of US farmer price receipts and the
republics of the former Soviet Union are still the major wild card in the
pack. The future of this trade rests on the willingness of the west to
provide financial assistance.
If the west withheld credits mendous,' said Mr Alan Terhaar, executive
director of the US Feed Grains Council.
'The cumulative effect of lack of trade credits that would cause the Soviets
to fall from the projected level to, for example, 5m tonnes of imports would
by the end of 1995-96, could cause a build-up of 60m tonnes of US feed
grains stocks. Wheat stocks would face a similar build-up.'
If President Bush took the lead on increasing export guarantees to the
former Soviet republics then the subsequent rise in maize prices could
actually turn falling farm incomes around.
With all the uncertainties, Mr Terhaar expected a 'disappointing' outcome
for 1991-92 trade. Although exports to Mexico had been rising, they were
slightly behind expectations of 7.5m tonnes per year by 1995. Furthermore,
he was keeping a close watch on proposed changes to Mexico's ejido (communal
farm) land tenure system.
'Even two years ago it would have been inconceivable that Mexico would ever
change its ejido system, which dates back to that country's revolution,' Mr
Terhaar said. The system had been 'considered an insurmountable impediment'
to higher Mexican production, but a proposal to introduce privatisation into
the system could have 'far reaching consequences for the make-up of crop and
livestock production'.
Mr Terhaar was hopeful about increased exports to Egypt, since US debt
forgiveness and an emerging private sector had strengthened the market.
Eastern Europe offered some possibility of new markets in the short term but
it could not afford to buy much.
Australia, South Africa and Thailand appeared to be moving away from feed
grains exports, but the Asian market posed another concern for the US.
Japan's tariff quota on imports of maize for industrial processing and
layers of regulations and secondary tariffs on feed grain might indicate 'we
have simply reached a plateau in Japanese imports. . . or we are entering a
period of significant decline'.
In Korea the US was facing China as a major competitor, while China was
maintaining firm control on import volume into the south, where economic
growth rates in excess of 20 per cent were causing an explosion in demand.
Mr Terhaar was 'bullish' that China would succumb to economic and political
pressures to open its market to feed grain imports. Currently it was
importing 800,000 tonnes of barley for malt production, and demand was
growing by more than 100,000 tonnes a year.
The likeliest bet is that election year politics will prevail and US farmers
will not be allowed to suffer unduly in 1992. If history repeats itself -
and why not? - then the Republican administration and Democratic Congress
will join forces to ensure that the Midwest and the Sunbelt states, major
electoral battlegrounds, will get sticking plasters for their pain.
Already there have been calls in Congress for export subsidy re-armament.
President Bush, facing a tough re-election fight and lagging in the polls,
is unlikely to refuse this favoured constituency unless Gatt brings
discipline into the trade.

Gold closed down on the London bullion market, but off the day's low after a
late rally in silver. Early selling from Frankfurt and Middle East sources
pushed gold down but it met strong support at Dollars 350 a troy ounce and
then clawed back losses as silver hit a three-week high. Gold lacks clear
direction, but a clearer trend is likely to emerge on Monday, when many
operators return from holiday. Talk that liquidated Soviet swaps formed part
of the morning's sales could not be confirmed. Comex gold futures hit 3 1/2
 month lows in early trading, while silver futures rallied strongly on short
covering by three big US funds. The New York rally lifted London silver,
which met resistance as it approached 400 cents a troy ounce. The market was
also underpinned by the firmer tone in international equity markets and by
recent industrial demand. London robusta coffee prices were in retreat while
New York arabicas were ahead at midday. 'New York and London are going in
two different directions at the moment ..if New York manages to hold above
78.50 cents in March, then we could see some more speculator buying. In
London, if it is fund selling, that usually comes in two or three waves,
which could see the market fall further,' one dealer said.

FT  03 JAN 92 / International and Government Bonds: Long gilts make up
ground as sterling bounces back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-dated UK govern-ment securities surged ahead by nearly 1 1/2
percentage points in highly volatile trading yesterday as sterling bounced
back from its recent lows.
Having missed out on the recent rally in other European bond markets, gilts
made up much of their lost ground. The benchmark 2003/07, which finished
before the new year at 113 15/32 , moved to 114 29/32 . Traders attributed
much of the turn-round to a determined performance by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, in a radio interview. This eased concerns about a possible
interest rate rise, helping sterling climb back comfortably above 2.85
against the D-Mark.
The surge caught many traders with short positions, and the rush to reverse
them accounted for much of the volatility, observers said.
In a relatively busy day for the futures market, with nearly 32,000 long
gilts contracts traded on Liffe, the March futures contract climbed from
95.20 to 97.00, before easing to 96.27 in reaction to US weakness.
GERMAN government bonds firmed slightly despite the announcement of the
first full issue of the German unity fund since last September. The wider
spread between German interest rates and those of the US and Japan helped
fuel retail interest, and accounted for the strength of the market.
Bids for the latest unity fund bonds, which are offered at 100.40 with a
coupon of 8 per cent to yield 7.94 per cent, are due today. Traders expected
strong demand, although some said the take-up was likely to be closer to
DM8bn than the DM10bn some had expected.
While bunds rose in the cash market, the futures market fell on some profit
taking.
DESPITE some mixed economic statistics, bond prices in New York were
generally lower yesterday. The US labour department reported that initial
claims for state unemployment insurance fell 29,000 to 438,000 in the week
ended December 21 - in sharp contrast to economists' predictions of a
5,000-claim rise.
Within half-an-hour, however, this news was counteracted by publication of
the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for December. This
showed a marked slump, to 46.5 per cent, the first time it has fallen below
50 per cent - which indicates a decline in manufacturing - since May.
The net result was to leave longer-dated issues down by almost a full point
at midday, although below their lows for the morning. The benchmark long
bond showed a loss of  27/32 at 106 9/32 , yielding 7.460 per cent.
THE Ecu bond market made an encouraging start to the year, registering the
first new issue of 1992, an Ecu200m Eurobond offering for Canada's Export
Development Corporation. The two-year deal carries a coupon of 9 per cent,
and is designed to appeal to retail investors, who like short-dated paper,
particularly when there is an inverted yield curve. In addition, some
central banks and money market funds were said to be buyers of the triple-A
rated paper.
More short-dated Ecu deals could follow if arbitrage opportunities persist.
The EDC deal was swapped into floating-rate dollars. The deal was held in
syndicate overnight.
Demand in the Ecu sector is concentrated at the short end of the market,
where rates are relatively high, and at the very long end.

AXA, the large French insurance group, announced yesterday that it was
acquiring privately-owned International Technology Underwriters (Intec), a
Maryland-based company which specialises in arranging space insurance.
No financial details for the deal were announced. Intec added that it had
yet to be determined whether Axa would have 100 per cent ownership, although
it confirmed that the French insurer would take a majority stake.
Intec, which employs around 17 people and handles around 15 to 20 large
policies a year, is essentially a managing general agent for space insurance
on behalf of CIGNA, the US multi-line insurer. It said it expected this
operational arrangement to be unaffected by Axa's involvement.
News of the deal came mid-afternoon in New York, and there was no immediate
comment from Axa.
A spokesman for the French company, however, said that Mr Claude Bebear, Axa
chairman, had long been interested in certain high-technology niche sectors
of the insurance industry.
Last year, Axa made its long-sought significant investment in the US when it
injected Dollars 1bn into Equitable Life, the mutual life insurer.

FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Test-tube research that breeds blockbuster
success - Daniel Green on speculation and sensitivity surrounding drug
companies' share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S gyrations in the share prices of SmithKline Beecham, Glaxo and
Wellcome reflect the drug companies' sensitivity to both the US regulators
and the news flowing from research laboratories.
Many years of testing pass between the discovery of a chemical and its
approval by health authorities. During this time, rumours of technical
breakthroughs, trial results and regulatory decisions make the sector a
speculators' paradise.
Although the industry is fragmented - even the biggest player, Merck of the
US, has a market share of less than 5 per cent - the secret of success does
not lie in world domination.
Over the past decade, some of the most spectacular performers have conquered
niches. Glaxo and Wellcome became winners by creating one, or perhaps two,
blockbuster drugs, products which usually combine a large potential market
with a technical breakthrough.
'We define a blockbuster drug as one with sales of at least Dollars 500m a
year,' says Mr Jonathan de Pass of BZW. 'In 1990 there were 24, in such
areas as ulcers, asthma, herpes and cholesterol control.'
Blockbuster drugs dominate the huge US market. If US doctors do not
prescribe the most effective drug available, even if it is only a little
better than its rivals, they face the possibility of legal action from
patients who do not return to complete health.
Glaxo, the UK's biggest drug company, is the classic example. Its fortunes
have been built on the Zantac ulcer treatment. Zantac and its nearest rival
Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beecham, work in similar ways. 'The difference
between them is small, but enough to incline many doctors to pick Zantac,'
says Mr de Pass.
Wellcome's Zovirax is a more extreme example. It is so much better than its
rivals that it has more than 80 per cent of the herpes virus treatment
market, according to Wellcome.
Glaxo raked in Pounds 1.6bn from Zantac sales in the last financial year -
almost half its total sales. Zovirax sales climbed 26 per cent to Pounds
471m.
But companies which depend on single blockbuster drugs are more vulnerable
than their diversified rivals to new competitors. Any blockbuster can be
toppled by a newcomer. This happened with Tagamet, knocked off its
best-selling perch by Zantac.
And now Zantac is threatened. 'Glaxo shares have been occasionally unsettled
in recent months by Losec, a new ulcer drug from Swedish company Astra,'
says Mr Robin Gilbert of James Capel.
A drug can be forced off the market quickly by health regulators. The US
Food and Drug Administration banned two Fisons drugs a year ago after what
it saw as shortcomings on the manufacturing side. Their absence from the
market has cost Fisons Pounds 65m.
For many companies, such uncertainty would be unsettling. The prospect of
rapid changes in fortune might be expected to deter investors from the
shares. Yet the p/e ratio of the health and household sector is more than
24, compared with a market average of about 14.
Wellcome was the best performing Footsie stock during 1991, the shares
rising 151 per cent. Glaxo was the top Footsie stock over the last two
years, the shares more than doubling in value.
One reason for such investor demand is that drug sales hold up during
recessions.
'This security is combined with the potential for high growth and high
profit margins, which is particularly appreciated at a time of disruption
elsewhere,' says Mr Gilbert. Even the decline of an obsolescent drug can be
slowed with heavy marketing, price cuts and the launch of non-prescription
versions.
The future performance of a drug company can be gauged by an examination of
the drugs under test. Analysts and investors keep a close eye on a drug from
its invention in a test-tube, through several stages of trials with animals
and then humans, to approval by the FDA and other national health
authorities, such as the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the UK. A
drug's potential hangs in the balance for many years.
The behaviour of drug company's shares seems likely, if anything, to become
more excitable over the medium term.
Governments are keen to cut the cost of healthcare and want to reduce drug
prices. Proposed European Community price rules should do that.
They leave relatively free, however, the pricing of new treatments. This
will put an even higher value on the peerless blockbuster.
It should ensure many more years of scanning the research journals for
anyone with more than a passing interest in the pharmaceutical industry.

FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit fitter as it shrugs off report on
poor service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK-FIT Holdings, the Edinburgh-based tyre and exhaust systems replacement
group, yesterday shrugged off sharp criticism from a Consumers' Association
report on 'fast fit' servicing centres.
The share price fell 7p at the start of trading yesterday as reports of the
criticism circulated. By the close, however, the price was unchanged at
182p.
Motor industry analysts, some of whom were critical of the manner in which
the Association's research was conducted, also suggested the report was
unlikely to cause lasting damage. Kwik-Fit - slogan 'you can't get better
than a Kwik-Fit fitter' - was lambasted in Which?, the association's
magazine. It said that more than a quarter of 43 Kwik-Fit branches surveyed
had recommended unnecessary work on a car taken in to have its 'basically
sound' exhaust inspected.
One other 'fast-fit' group, the north-west of England-based Smileys, was
rated 'poor' in the survey. Among eight others surveyed, Michelin-owned ATS
was rated 'good' while Continental-owned National and Goodyear-owned
Tyreservices were rated 'average'.
Market sentiment about the group's present financial prospects was that
increased vehicle tyre sales arising from new minimum tread depth standards
(introduced on January 1) would more than compensate for any adverse effects
of the Consumers' Association report, which focused mainly on exhaust system
replacement.
Mr Tony Lancelott, Phillips and Drew motor industry analyst, said: 'One
should be cautious about drawing too many conclusions about the likely
impact of the report'.
Kwik-Fit profits increased 67 per cent to Pounds 16.8m in the first half of
1991. Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, has said that 'we had a good six months last
year and there is no reason to believe that we will not have a good six
months this year.' Debt fell from Pounds 20m at the year-end to Pounds 15m.

GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, is to sell its remaining
19.9 per cent stake in Sprint, the nation's third biggest long-distance
carrier, for Dollars 530m (Pounds 283m) to United Telecommunications, which
already owns 80.1 per cent of the company.
The deal, announced yesterday, marks the end of a five-year partnership
which began in 1986 when GTE and United Telecom, which both have substantial
local telephone interests, combined their long-distance and data
communications interests into a single organisation, with each holding a 50
per cent stake.
However, joint ownership produced considerable strains and hampered Sprint's
development.
In 1988 United Telecom took over management control of the business and
bought a further 30.1 per cent from GTE for Dollars 600m.
GTE, which has made clear over the past two years that it intended to sell
its remaining interest, had an agreement under which it could have required
United Telecom to buy the stake at book value from the start of this year.
However, yesterday's agreement was negotiated separately from that so-called
'put' option.
United is paying a discount to the book value of the stake, which stood at
around Dollars 560m at the end of September, while GTE will benefit by not
having to arrange the financing for United's purchase, as was required under
the 'put' option agreement.
GTE is believed to have held discussions last year with some European
carriers, including Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, about selling the Sprint
stake. However, any such deal would have required the approval of United
Telecom, which had always made clear it wanted 100 per cent ownership.
United now intends to change its corporate name to Sprint, which is more
widely known to the US public thanks to its national presence and strong
marketing effort.
After a rocky start, Sprint now holds some 10 per cent of the US
long-distance market and has developed a reputation for technological
innovation, although its revenues and profits are currently being hit by
recession.
United Telecom will pay Dollars 250m in cash on completion of the deal,
expected at the end of this month, and the remainder in cash on July 1.
It aims to finance the deal with a combination of short and long-term debt.

FT  03 JAN 92 / PM seeks summit to discuss Soviet break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is proposing a summit of the United
Nations Security Council's permanent members later this month to discuss the
international security implications of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Diplomatic soundings on the possibility of holding such a summit have
already been carried out by Britain, which took over the rotating presidency
of the Security Council on Wednesday.
Officials said the matter was still in a tentative stage, however, pending
reactions from the other council members - the US, China, France, and Russia
which is due to take over the former Soviet Union's permanent seat.
The idea behind Mr Major's proposal is that a meeting of all the Security
Council heads of state and government, probably to be held in New York,
could formally recognise Russia as the successor state to the Soviet Union
in the UN.
It would also give the leaders, including Russian president Boris Yeltsin,
an opportunity for an early contact with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new
UN secretary-general.
The proposal would also allow the permanent council members to have a
discussion with Mr Yeltsin about a problem which is causing great concern
worldwide: the effective control of the former Soviet Union's nuclear
weapons following the country's dissolution into independent republics.
The decision by the leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States in
Minsk last Monday that unified control over the former Soviet nuclear
arsenal should be maintained by the Russian president has only partly
reassured the rest of the world.
In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr Major said he was worried that the
smaller independent former Soviet republics might sell off some of their
nuclear weapons and technology to foreign buyers.
Mr George Robertson, Labour's shadow foreign minister, said in a radio
interview yesterday: 'It is entirely sensible that we take a look, at UN
level, at the way the world's affairs are now configuring. We cannot assume
that the old world order is going to remain in place especially when there
is a new entity controlling 35,000 nuclear warheads.'

FT  03 JAN 92 / Japan homes in on mock-Tudor houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH exports to Japan received an unusual boost yesterday with the
announcement of a pioneering deal. It brings home the attractions of English
village housing design to Japanese families - and still lets them take a
bath downstairs.
Japanese businessmen will soon be able to come home to a mock-Tudor or
Elizabethan house complete with English village-style landscaping under a
licensing deal. Beazer Homes, the UK's third largest housebuilder, is
licensing Kureha Construction, a subsidiary of Japan's Kureha Chemical.
The deal is claimed to be the first in which British housing designs have
been exported to Japan. It panders to a Japanese view of British goods that
contrasts with the UK's self-image. 'Anything that is British will be looked
at as quality,' said Mr Dennis Webb, managing director of Beazer Homes.
But the British export coup goes only skin deep. Japanese homebuyers might
want landscaping and a mock-Tudor facade, but once they are through the
front door, local preferences will prevail - Japanese layouts with large
bathrooms downstairs and family areas with tatami matting.
And, just in case the idea of traditionally solid British construction
methods causes the occupants to tremble at the thought of an earthquake,
Beazer's double-skinned timber-frame houses will be redesigned with flexible
single skins. Designers will work out how to obtain the best brick effect
without the rigidity of real bricks, Mr Webb said.
Selling English village housing in one of the world's most densely populated
countries might seem like the UK construction industry's craziest idea since
stone cladding. But Mr Webb says there is more room for such housing away
from Tokyo, and two sites about 100 miles north of the capital have been
identified.
In the first stage of the agreement, Beazer will license Kureha to use its
names and house styles, and receive a fixed percentage royalty for every
house completed.
It is expected that about 60 houses will be built over the next two years or
so, with the first going on sale early this year for about Pounds 170,000.
The second stage will involve the export of entire timber-frame house kits.
The deal gives Beazer, now part of Hanson, a foot in the door of the
Japanese housing market.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Tax burden rises, official figures show: Publication of
Treasury statistics suppressed for 18 months, says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government suppressed figures showing that the poll tax has
significantly increased the tax burden on many households, Labour said last
night.
Treasury data on the impact on typical households of the poll tax, income
tax, national insurance contributions, VAT and other indirect taxes show
that only single person households or families on above average earnings are
paying a smaller percentage of their incomes in tax than at the end of the
last Labour government in 1979.
Labour asked for the figures in July 1990 but Mr Peter Lilley, then
financial secretary to the Treasury, delayed publication until data on the
poll tax bills actually paid were published last month.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'I don't
think there is any doubt that the government wanted to suppress the fact
that the poll tax had added to an existing trend.'
The government has admitted that the total tax burden, excluding the poll
tax, has risen for many households, undermining Tory claims to be the party
of lower taxation. The latest statistics, which compare the poll tax with
the old rates system, are likely to embarrass ministers further. Officials
warned, however, that the estimates including the poll tax were only
'approximate'.
The rise in VAT in last March's budget, which has not been included in the
latest figures, almost certainly means the trend of rising taxation will
continue.
Labour used the figures to intensify its attacks on the government's
handling of the economy. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment spokesman, said
the government's credibility 'has been shot to pieces, first by the creation
of the recession, and then by its arrogant misjudgment of its depth and
extent.'
Mrs Beckett warned that the government may raise VAT again, perhaps to fund
cuts in income tax or increased public spending.
According to the figures, a married couple on average earnings with two
children paid 35.2 per cent of their gross earnings in tax in 1978-79. By
1990-91 that had risen to 37.5 per cent on average earnings of Pounds 306.20
a week. For a married couple, with two children, but earning just three
quarters of average earnings, the rise in the tax burden has been still
greater - increasing from 30.9 per cent of earnings in 1978-79 to 34.9 per
cent in 1990-91.
Of the households sampled, only those on 1 1/2 times average earnings have
seen reductions in the tax burden, Mrs Beckett said.
A family on three quarters average earnings, with two children, paid 6.2 per
cent of their earnings on the poll tax in 1990-91. A similar sized family on
1 1/2 times average earnings paid only 3.4 per cent.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Bush puts blame on Japan and EC for trade row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday rebuffed Australian farmers demanding an end
to US farm subsidies. He declared that the European Community and Japan were
mainly to blame for protectionism in world trade.
On the first leg of his four-nation Pacific tour, Mr Bush also made clear
that he wants Japan to make trade concessions during his talks in Tokyo next
week, particularly by opening its market to the hard-hit US automotive
industry.
Then, early today, while Mr Bush was on a four-hour visit to Melbourne,
Australian mounted police charged into a crowd of about 500 demonstrators
protesting against his presence. Their banners read: 'Stuff Bush's New World
Order'.
The president was then leaving Melbourne for Singapore, the next stage of
his tour.
Mr Bush had earlier faced complaints from more than 3,000 Australian
farmers, outside the federal parliament in Canberra, that US subsidies were
costing them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
He then delivered a tough trade speech to a joint session of the parliament.
The president told members that US subsidies - known as the Export
Enhancement Programme (EEP) - were needed to offset an 'avalanche' of
subsidised exports by the European Community. The US would not halt the EEP
programme of subsidies until the EC had cut its own export subsidies, he
said.
Asked at a news conference to explain the apparent double standard of
refusing to modify US protectionist policies while demanding big concessions
from Japan, he replied: 'We've never said we're totally pure.'
The EEP programme was the main source of friction in talks in Canberra
between Mr Bush and Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, who
urged the US to avoid traditional markets for non-subsidised Australian
grain.
The US programme subsidises the disposal of US grain in world markets.
Australia claims this has reduced world grain prices and forced
non-subsidised Australian exports out of traditional markets, notably in the
Middle East, where US sales have increased since the Gulf War.
Mr Bush said the best solution would be an agreement on freer agricultural
trade in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) which is expected to conclude shortly.
During his news conference with Mr Keating, Mr Bush sounded much like a
candidate running for re-election, with one eye on the Republican primaries
to come.
He attacked the EC and Japan for unfair trade practices, and singled out
Japan's trade surplus for renewed criticism. The surplus was costing
American jobs and slowing the US recovery, he said.
Mr Bush's tour also takes in South Korea.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ratners shares have fallen so far in recent months that they barely reacted
to the threatened move into Chapter 11 of Zale, the leading US jeweller.
Granted, they had already dropped by more than 10 per cent yesterday on
worries about the group's Christmas trading performance. But Zale's angry
creditors have served an unwelcome reminder to the market that Ratners is
vulnerable to more than the depressed UK high street. Its US business is an
obvious candidate for sale should the group require a refinancing of its
debts. While the issue of what that business might fetch is more germane
than ever, the likely figure is shrinking all the time. Zale's decline will
surely benefit Ratners in the long term. The question is whether Ratners has
enough time in hand.

FT  03 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: GTE/Sprint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale by GTE to United Telecom of its 20 per cent stake in Sprint looks
like a backward step for the US long distance market. The Dollars 530m deal
hands Sprint back into full ownership by United. The price looks absurdly
cheap by international standards, although an old option agreement between
the two companies dictated that.
GTE tried to sell its stake to a third party, but, since players such as
Cable and Wireless apparently baulked at the higher price asked of
outsiders, United and MCI will remain the only real competitors to AT&amp;T. The
US long distance market has been steadfastly resisting the trend towards
globalisation of the telecoms industry. Until the regulatory climate
changes, even a more powerful United offers little attraction to outsiders
wanting to enter the market.
British Aerospace
It is a measure of investor disillusion with British Aerospace that the
shares conspicuously lagged the end-year stock market rally. Since the
Footsie bottomed out on December 23, BAe has underperformed the market by
6.5 per cent; over the last six months the underperformance is 47 per cent.
Recent positive news has failed to impress, including this week's signal
from the US State Department that it no longer objects to the sale of the
146 regional jet to Iran.
The problem is that, even setting aside the Pounds 250m exceptional
restructuring charge announced in mid-1991, there is still no sign of a
profits stream sufficient to staunch BAe's outflow of cash. Negotiations on
the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence contract, once promised for the
end of 1991, are still apparently making progress, but doubts remain over
the scope of any final deal or how much cash it will generate initially. The
UK car market remains depressed, while demand is also turning down in
France, Rover's largest export destination in Europe. As for Airbus, the
weak dollar looks set to make for disappointing earnings from that quarter.
On an historic basis the shares now yield nearly 11 per cent, but this means
little when future dividends must be in doubt. Even after yesterday's 13p
fall to 306p, the paper hardly represents a bargain.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jeremiahs who had expected 1992 to start with a good old-fashioned run
on sterling were disappointed yesterday. Perhaps the reason was in part that
many dealers will not return to their desks till next week; but there are
also now some factors restraining the D-Mark. Russian price reform has
underlined the economic crisis in the former Soviet Union, while Japan looks
likely to talk the yen up in order to alleviate trade friction with the US.
The short-term pull of high German interest rates appears less attractive as
the economic prospects of that country deteriorate. That may in turn dampen
the trend towards polarisation of currencies within the European exchange
rate mechanism.
All that could produce a respite for sterling, especially if the dollar
manages a pause on its long downward decline. Yet the UK currency is not out
of the woods as long as the interest differential with Germany is only 0.75
percentage points. It may have been easy yesterday for the governor of the
Bank of England to dismiss any immediate threat of higher rates, but the
money market is still discounting an increase of nearly 0.5 percentage
points even if three-month money is a shade cheaper than it was before the
new year. That is not a situation which can last indefinitely. The
authorities could still face some awkward decisions in the weeks to come.
After their emphatic determination to defend sterling with higher rates if
necessary, it would be all the harder for them to duck a challenge from the
exchange markets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,492.8 (-0.3)
Wall Street's extraordinary year-end performance has doubtless left
investors more confused than ever. The trigger for the rally was the Federal
Reserve's decision a fortnight ago to cut the discount rate to 3.5 per cent.
It is a matter of debate whether the cut was made in belated recognition of
a US economy on its knees; or whether the Fed believed it could tip the
balance decisively in favour of recovery. But with the equity market now
around 8 per cent higher, the argument appears to have reverted to that
familiar topic of 1991, the timing of recovery.
The latest signs from the real economy show just how grim things remain  -
yesterday's manufacturing purchasing managers index and construction
spending figures both indicated renewed weakness. It was perhaps surprising
that Wall Street did not react more negatively, but the suspicion that the
rally was founded on sand nevertheless gained credence.
The retail investors who pushed the market along have been reacting more to
lower rates on their money market funds than to any well-founded perception
that shares are cheap. Indeed, this year's prospective multiple on the S&amp;P
Composite index is already steep at around 22 times earnings. Short-term
considerations such as the cost of money are not an informative guide to the
dividend streams which traditionally underpin equity values. But the dilemma
for the market is that interest rates could yet come down again, fuelling
further paper asset inflation - all the more so since there still appears to
be plenty of foot-loose money in the money markets.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Germany 1992 Forecast: A year of transition - Some optimism
may be justified in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORBERT WALTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and the world economies have had more than just a cold. Instead of
the promised recovery in 1991, we have experienced a double dip. Consumer
confidence is down and the business climate is chilly. Fiscal policy is
incapacitated by high public deficits worldwide. Re-regulation by the Bank
for International Settlements, and sound banking practices, helped restore
profit margins in banking and prevented lower refinancing costs from being
passed on to consumers and investors: monetary policy, expansionary for more
than a year, now seems to have lost its effectiveness. Thus uncertainty
increases as to whether the recession can be overcome in the foreseeable
future.
The German economy is perceived by Germans and international observers alike
to have been almost completely separated from the worldwide slowdown by its
unification process. Growth in 1989-90 and even at the start of 1991 was a
remarkably high 4 per cent.
By mid-1991 the business cycle started to tumble in western Germany,
principally for three reasons: international demand was consistently weak;
the impact of the Bundesbank's restrictive monetary policies; and the
deflationary effects of big tax increases (amounting to 1.5 per cent of GNP)
to meet the costs of unification. It took some time to realise this, because
observers tend to analyse the German economy on the basis of year-on-year
figures. On a quarter-to-quarter basis it is obvious the (west) German
economy has - at best - been stagnating since mid-year.
Now a growing number of pessimists are voicing their concerns. These
Cassandras - especially after the recent increases in discount and Lombard
rates - see Germany sliding into an outright recession.
In the year ahead various cyclical and structural factors will be at work.
The cyclical factors will produce more negative news, probably until
mid-year. Thereafter net exports and fiscal impulses should support the
recovery.
The structural factors - with the exception of the repercussions of
developments in the former Soviet Union - will foster prosperity.
While doubts are mounting whether monetary expansion is still effective, I
strongly believe that by early summer markets in north America and the UK
will begin to recover. Prospects for German exports will have improved by
then.
But two obstacles stand in the way of such a change. First, a significant
strengthening of the D-Mark against the dollar; and second, a substantial
gain of market share on the part of Japanese and other south-east Asian
companies as a result of aggressive international selling in the wake of a
domestic slump in these countries.
Another cyclical factor that will support the German recovery is the expiry
by mid-1992 of the so-called 'unification tax' - the 7.5 per cent surcharge
on income and corporate taxes designed to pay for unification.
Since many arguments, particularly lower inflation, support an easing of
German - and consequently European - monetary policy after mid-1992, the
effects of monetary expansion will make themselves felt after the usual time
lag of roughly two quarters. The Bundesbank's recent use of the interest
rate whip has shown that its policy is likely to remain restrictive until
mid-1992, as it considers current wage demands as excessive and inflation
unacceptably high. Only then will the consumer price index (year-on-year)
fall below 4 per cent.
In the second half of the year the economy will also benefit from a
(short-lived) stimulus due to advance purchases of consumer durables,
resulting from VAT increases effective from January 1 1993. It is not yet
clear whether Germany's tax amendment law - including, besides the VAT
increase, cuts in some corporate taxes - will be passed by the Bundesrat
(upper house). But even if the legislation is rejected, the planned tax
package would still have some positive effects. It would, for instance,
force the government to cut spending to slim the budget deficit. An
unchanged VAT rate would mean a lower inflation rate in 1993. This could
foster expectations of a further relaxation of monetary policy in 1993 and
thus stimulate the economy.
Investment activity will also be encouraged by the ongoing process of
European integration and the creation of the European Economic Area (EEA).
Besides, there are other structural factors supporting a more optimistic
outlook for Germany. In east Germany the trough in economic activity has
been reached. The economic take-off there will trigger strong investment
growth. This dynamic demand for investment goods will to a large extent be
met by deliveries from western Germany.
A factor that went almost unnoticed will continue to lend strength to the
German economy: namely, the continuing immigration which is increasing the
country's labour force by about 1 per cent and its population by some 1.5
per cent a year.
All in all, 1992 will be a year of transition. Since the start of the year
will be poor, annual averages of growth will be unimpressive: economic
activity in west Germany will increase by only 1 1/2 per cent, employment
will be up by only 1 per cent rather than the 3 per cent achieved in 1991.
Private investment will expand by only 3 per cent to 4 per cent rather than
the double-digit numbers of the past three years. However, east German GNP
is likely to expand by 10 per cent, after a decline of some 20 per cent last
year. This should not be misread as a self-sustained, broadly based
recovery, but rather as a bouncing back after a shake-out.
But during the course of 1992 the economic pace should accelerate. In the
period 1992-95 growth rates should be comparable to those of 1989-90. This
medium-term forecast will look over-optimistic throughout most of 1992,
since sentiment always lags behind facts by half a year. It will look
ridiculously high over the next quarter, when business and consumer
confidence reaches a trough by spring.
Rough economic conditions during the winter do not bode well for forceful
action to solve international problems, be it the Gatt, the former Soviet
Union, Yugoslavia, or even the institutional completion of western Europe.
Here Murphy's law may apply until the summer. But crises - or the perception
of crisis - frequently give rise to a change in attitude. Some optimism may,
therefore, be justified.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Japan 1992 Forecast: The bubble has burst - Japan is facing
a difficult readjustment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HIROSHI TAKEUCHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese economy, a powerhouse of growth in the industrialised world in
the 1980s, is slowing down fast, curbed by recessionary forces similar to
those which have hit much of the globe.
After the longest period of unbroken expansion since the Second World War,
Japan faces a difficult period of readjustment. High interest rates have
ended a boom fuelled by the financial 'bubble' of the late 1980s in which
the prices of investment assets soared to unsustainable levels. Consumers
are cutting purchases of luxury goods. Companies, which made use of cheap
money in the 1980s to invest in plant and equipment, are being forced to
reduce their capital expenditure growth sharply. Meanwhile, export demand is
weak in north America, Japan's largest market.
Real economic growth is likely to fall from 3.5 per cent in the year to
March, to about 3 per cent in the following financial year.
Even though interest rates are expected to fall further as the economy
slows, their current high level will be a drag on the economy. So will the
impact of a fall in property prices, which has been particularly severe in
Tokyo and in Osaka. Land prices are expected to fall further this year (even
so, they are some 30 per cent above 1985 levels, when the price explosion
began). The decline will continue for about a year.
The amount of property for sale will continue to increase because companies
which invested heavily in land, as well as banks and finance companies that
lent them money, will try to unload property to stave off financial crises.
As land prices fall, so investment in property will remain sluggish.
Potential buyers are unlikely to move until they feel prices have bottomed
and interest rates have come down. Housing starts have already fallen
heavily, from 1.8m in 1990 to about 1.3m last year.
Meanwhile, the sharp decline in the stock market, which has affected both
equity prices and trading volumes in the past two years, continues to act as
a restraint on companies wanting to invest in plant and equipment. As soon
as the market shows any sign of recovering, industrial companies and banks
will probably try to raise equity funds by issuing stock - thereby pushing
the market down once more. Banks need equity funds in order to meet
international standards on capital adequacy laid down by the Bank for
International Settlements. Under BIS rules, Japanese banks must have, by
March 1993, capital equivalent to 8 per cent of their assets.
Under these circumstances, it is natural that companies are cutting capital
investment. Investment growth will fall from about 4 per cent in 1991 to
zero next year.
This is a sharp contrast to the three years to 1990 when capital investment
expanded at a rate of about 15 per cent a year. Companies invested in
labour-saving equipment to cope with shortages of workers, in information
technology and in the construction of new factories and offices.
By issuing convertible bonds, bonds with warrants and equity finance,
corporations could raise funds at an effective rate of as low as 0.3 per
cent. Medium-sized and small companies could also borrow at low rates of
interest.
Now the actual cost of capital for big groups has risen to more than 7 per
cent. Also, companies feel less pressure to invest because capacity has
reached satisfactory levels in almost every industry and depreciation costs
are rising because a growing proportion of the plant is new.
Nevertheless, the remarkable development of microelectronics technology is
driving considerable changes in industry and society. Labour shortages will
become more severe. The centralisation of economic power in Tokyo and Osaka
and other big cities has been dramatic and has stimulated demand for
investment. So the underlying reasons for investment will remain strong.
Also, even though spending on luxuries has fallen, overall consumer
expenditure in Japan is still strong, fuelled by considerable increases in
wages. Certainly, the mood has changed since the bubble burst - women's
fashions are more conservative and there are more serious shows on
television. But consumers still have increasing amounts of money in their
hands. Even though the economy is slowing, employers are having to pay
higher wages because of the shortage of workers.
Nevertheless specific sectors are suffering quite severe downturns in
demand. Housing is one example. So is the car industry, where demand for new
vehicles has fallen from 5.1m in 1990 to 4.8m in 1991 due to the increase in
interest rates and changes in parking rules. Would-be car owners in Japan
have to prove that they have a registered parking space before they are
allowed to buy.
The capital goods industries, including steel, chemicals and electricals,
are feeling the impact of the decline in investment growth. Even the
high-growth electronics industry is suffering because financial companies -
big investors in computer systems - have cut orders. The effect on the
cyclical semiconductor industry is particularly severe.
In response to the slowdown in growth, the Bank of Japan has steadily eased
interest rates. This week Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, cut the Official Discount Rate from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent - the
second reduction in less than six weeks and the third in 1991. The purpose
was to boost business confidence. Mr Mieno said the cut had been timed to
precede the last quarter of the Japanese financial year when most companies
would be drafting their investment plans for the year starting in April.
Mr Mieno denied that the timing of the cut had anything to do with the visit
to Japan of Mr George Bush, the US president, next week. He has serious
economic grievances on his agenda, caused by Japan's persistent trade
surplus with the US. However, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese finance
minister, praised the timing of the ODR cut, saying it would meet US
expectations.
The Japanese government will this year implement some measures to boost the
economy, including increasing public investment. Such investments will begin
in the autumn, but they will have only a marginal effect on the economy as a
whole.
The author is chairman of the board of counsellors of the LTCB Institute of
Research and Consulting, and the former chief economist of the Long Term
Credit Bank.

FT  03 JAN 92 / A Hurd day's night: Robert Mauthner on a typical working day
for the UK foreign secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just as well that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, refused to
subscribe to the social provisions of the recent Maastricht treaty, for it
would have disqualified his foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, from doing
his job.
A 48-hour working week - one of the central tenets of the Social Chapter -
was never devised for anyone heading an important department of state, let
alone for a foreign secretary at the centre of important international
events or negotiations. Britain may have lost an empire, but it has gained a
European Community, increasing rather than diminishing the workload of what
is still called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Today's 'restless
natives' are to be found in Europe rather than in the remoter regions of
Africa or the far east, but they are no less time-consuming.
Day-trips or two-day visits to Brussels and other Community capitals, often
involving very late-night return flights to London, have become part and
parcel of the normal working week of a foreign secretary who sees his EC
counterparts rather more often than his own Cabinet colleagues.
But even an average 'non-travelling' working day can last as long as 18
hours, including official lunch and dinner engagements, not necessarily
always enjoyable occasions; a constant round of cocktail party dialogue can
be very boring, even when you have had as much practice at it as Mr Hurd.
A fairly typical day would see the 'SOS' (secretary of state), as he is
familiarly known to his staff, getting up at 7am at his official residence
at No 1 Carlton Gardens. A quick skim through all the newspapers followed by
a light, non-cooked breakfast (in the kitchen, it is said) with his wife
Judy and children Philip, 8, and Jessica, 7, sets Mr Hurd up for the first
ordeal of the day: live radio interviews with Radio 4's Today programme and
Independent Radio News, both of which have sent radio cars to his home.
After listening to the 8am news in the radio car and being put through his
paces by the BBC's Mr Brian Redhead or Mr John Humphreys, Mr Hurd will often
briskly walk the few hundred yards to his office in King Charles Street, his
green Loden overcoat giving him the air of a member of the imperial Habsburg
household.
First stop will be the private outer office on the first floor, where Mr
Hurd's principal private secretary will present him with a batch of
something like 60 telegrams, some of them requiring urgent attention.
Once a week, this will be followed at 9am by a policy co-ordination meeting
of all the FCO ministers and most senior officials and advisers,
particularly on issues of immediate political significance. At such meetings
Mrs Lynda Chalker, a minister of state, might bring up the plight of the
Kurds in Iraq (as she frequently does), or a discussion will take place on
the advisability of recognising Croatia and Slovenia.
During the run-up to the European summit in Maastricht last month, the
frequency of such high-level internal meetings chaired by the foreign
secretary became much greater. Typically, at 10am, in the presence of Sir
David Gillmore, the permanent under-secretary, Mr Len Appleyard, the
political director, and Mr Michael Jay, the assistant under-secretary for
European Community affairs, the Dutch proposal on majority voting for common
foreign and security policy decisions was carefully analysed, the first of
several such discussions on the subject during the day.
The foreign secretary always takes a very active part in these talks with
the experts, frequently disagreeing with the proposals put up to him and
imposing an alternative policy line. However, this is always done by
rational argument; putting down officials in front of their colleagues is
not Mr Hurd's style.
Mid-mornings will often be spent in talks with visiting foreign officials
for which Mr Hurd will have to adapt himself to a completely different
geographical region and subject matter; on this occasion he is calling on
President Masire of Botswana at the Dorchester Hotel. Supported by the
Foreign Office's most senior African expert, Mr Patrick Fairweather, a
deputy under-secretary, Mr Hurd will have to switch his attention from
proposals for extending democratic control over the EC's centralised
institutions and the civil war in Yugoslavia to the spread of democracy in
Africa and the intensification of violence in South Africa.
From the Dorchester, straight to Nomura House in the City, where shortly
after midday the foreign secretary is to attend a British-Japanese
parliamentary symposium on Japanese trade and investment in Europe and the
US. After a few well-chosen words, he has to rush back to No 1 Carlton
Gardens where he is hosting a 'smallish' lunch for the Greek foreign
minister, Mr Antonis Samaras.
Mr Hurd likes Mr Samaras, who is unusually young for a Greek cabinet
minister, and whom he sees as often as every 10 days either in EC or Nato
meetings. Plenty of talk about the consequences of Maastricht, Greece's
application for membership of the Western European Union defence
organisation and, of course, Cyprus and Turkey. But all very informal,
including the toasts.
No Churchillian cat naps after lunch, but a quick conversation with his wife
Judy, who does not have too many opportunities to be with her husband,
except during the interminable if infrequent Commonwealth heads of
government conferences.
In the afternoon the pace quickens. First, a briefing for the new British
ambassadors to the three Baltic states, to prepare them for the difficult
task facing them in these newly-independent countries, presently reviewing
their relations with the recently set up Commonwealth of Independent States.
Then, half-an-hour with ex-US President Jimmy Carter, who has come to talk
to Mr Hurd about his Centre for the Promotion of Democracy and Conflict
Resolution and his experience of monitoring elections in Zambia.
A quick office meeting on an article the foreign secretary has undertaken to
write for a Sunday newspaper on the outcome of the Maastricht conference, is
followed by a meeting with an all-party Kashmir group, a 15-minutes letter-
and telegram-signing session, 30 minutes with Mr Tony Galsworthy, the
British representative on the Sino-British Hong Kong Joint Liaison Group and
a rapid appearance in the early evening at a party given by his old boss,
former prime minister Mr Edward Heath.
The pace continues briskly as the evening gets under way. On many evenings
the foreign secretary attends a cocktail reception or hosts a dinner. Today,
Mr Hurd is giving a dinner at his residence for Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the
Czechoslovak foreign minister, to which he has invited a wide range of
guests including academics, industrialists and journalists. This is the kind
of function Mr Hurd likes best. It is intended as a relaxed prelude to more
official talks with Mr Dienstbier the following day.
The last guests do not leave until about 10.45 pm and then the work
continues. Mr Hurd retires to the sitting room with his red box full of what
are known in the official jargon as 'submissions' - formal proposals and
recommendations put to him by other ministers and officials on subjects
ranging from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the fight against drugs.
They include a number of so-called 'trigger' telegrams which will not be
issued until the 'SOS' gives his formal imprimatur
Bed-time is usually not until 1am, often later. It has been a heavy day, but
no heavier than attendance at an EC or Nato conference abroad, when plenary
sessions are interspersed with bilateral meetings with foreign ministers
from other participating countries, not to speak of the obligatory media
conferences which no politician can afford to avoid.
Injected into this punishing schedule are parliamentary debates,
question-time in the House of Commons and frequent visits to his own west
Oxfordshire constituency and tours of other constituencies.
Yet Mr Hurd still found time to visit Maxim Gorky's house during a recent
visit to Moscow, sprint round the Roman forum during the November Nato
summit, take a quick peep at the picturesque main square in Maastricht after
the gruelling European summit and attend the carol service at his son's
school just before Christmas.
'If there's half an hour to spare, he'll get out,' an admiring, if exhausted
official panted. 'Yet he's always contained and never really explodes,
though he's pretty intolerant of waffle.'
That is hardly surprising given the foreign secretary's tight timetable. Yet
one feels sure that, if push came to shove, he could even spare a couple of
minutes for waffle.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Falklands salute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new year might strike fear and loathing into many stout hearts of oak
but not those in the most southerly outposts of the British empire. Falkland
Islanders, who are among the world's wealthiest people per capita thanks to
fishing licences, are preparing for a year of celebrations; 1992 is the
islands' 'Heritage Year'.
Various beanos will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first sighting
of the islands; the 100th anniversary of the consecration of Christ Church
Cathedral; the 100th anniversary of the Falkland Islands Volunteer Defence
Force; and the rather touchy 10th anniversary of the British victory over
Argentina in the 1982 Falklands war.
Many of the great and good - including the Archbishop of Canterbury next
month - are due to visit Stanley in 1992. Sadly, Prime Minister John Major
has already cried off. In his Christmas message to the Falklands he pleaded
a full diary - 'getting away from Downing Street even as far as Chequers is
quite an achievement these days.'
Perhaps Mrs Thatcher could be asked to stand in?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glad to see that Peter Grant, the ex-Lazards banker parachuted in to the
chairman's seat at the deeply-indebted Lep Group, is not letting its
troubles spoil his new year fun.
Yesterday's formal announcement that he had replaced John Read, architect of
Lep's over-ambitious growth, included a contact number. But when Observer
tried to button-hole Lep's would-be saviour, Grant had gone shooting and was
not expected back for another day or two.
This laid-back behaviour may be acceptable in some City merchant bank
parlours, but it is hardly calculated to reassure nervous shareholders.
Lep's shares have fallen by another third since the first news of Grant's
appointment six weeks ago. The group is without a chief executive and the
job of selling its National Guardian subsidiary - the key to its survival -
is in the hands of a little-known US subsidiary of France's Credit Agricole.
Quite a challenge for most chairmen.

A cynic might feel that the last thing the world needs is another life
insurance company, but that's precisely what Sir Mark Weinberg, the man
behind the development of Abbey Life and Hambro Life, launched yesterday in
the splendid surroundings of Lord Rothschild's Spencer House.
The new Cirencester-based J Rothschild Assurance might seem to face an
uphill struggle initially. Two-thirds of its 180 salesmen have defected from
Allied Dunbar and are subject to a one year moratorium on selling to old
clients. So those salesmen will be relying on referrals for new business.
Many might feel that the best way to lose a friend is to pass his or her
name to a life assurance salesman but Sir Mark's right hand man, Mike
Wilson, is confident.
He says that former clients are sympathetic and that the salesmen see the
task as a refreshing challenge. Since even a good salesman will sell only
120-150 policies a year - but earn around Pounds 50,000 in the process - one
can understand the incentive.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Bundesbank politicking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Helmut Schlesinger took over the reins as president of the Bundesbank
in August, his reputation as a monetary hardliner went before him. But it
seems he has been finding it less than easy to establish a policy-making
consensus at the fortnightly monetary policy council meetings; some of his
council members are even more hawkish than he.
The shock decision on December 19 to raise the Lombard rate by a full half
point was apparently made against the advice of both Schlesinger and his
deputy Hans Tietmeyer. Both men had favoured nudging Lombard up just a
quarter of a point - thereby hoping to avoid a rumpus with Germany's foreign
partners - but were overruled by the rest of the council.
With the death last February of Ottomar Werthmoller, the directorate member
responsible for administration, followed by Karl Otto Pohl's resignation in
the summer, there has been a significant shift in the balance of power on
the council. Neither has been replaced, so that the formerly seven-man
central directorate has dwindled to just five, leaving Schlesinger and
Tietmeyer - and the three other officials - clearly outnumbered by the 11
regional central bank chiefs, who have become greatly more outspoken and
independent during the last decade.
One reason for foot-dragging by the Christian Democrat-led government in
Bonn is that tradition dictates it must choose at least one Social Democrat
for the directorate. All the remaining five are either members of, or
politically close to, parties within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right
coalition - whereas Pohl was a social democrat.
One candidate who would fit the bill to replace Werthmoller is Werner
Schulz, president of the Schleswig-Holstein regional central bank. His
current position is due to be rationalised away under a controversial
Bundesbank streamlining plan. As well as being an SPD man he is also an
ex-commercial banker - he therefore differs from most newly imported
Bundesbankers by actually knowing something about running the inside of a
financial institution.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Grand Theatre, Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera North's 'new' Butterfly puts a run-of-the-mill, efficient staging by
Jonathan Alver into the utilitarian, monolithic set by Lez Brotherston
devised for the company's earlier production. The real novelty of the show
is musical, for Martin Andre conducts what are claimed to be the first
performances in this country of the original version of the score.
The premiere of Madama Butterfly at La Scala in 1904 has become one of the
best known disasters in operatic history. Stung by the public humiliation,
Puccini worked on the piece over the next three years, progressively
rewriting and rewording, and it is the version that emerged in 1907 that was
published and used for performances ever since. For his WNO production in
1978 Joachim Herz unearthed and reinstated some of Puccini's original
thoughts, and Graham Vick's Coliseum production of the early 1980s preserved
many of those amendments; but Opera North's wholesale return to the first
version has no precedents in Britain.
The thrust of Puccini's revisions had softened the edge of the tragedy,
toning down the cultural clash between East and West, making Pinkerton a
less callous, more remorseful figure and Butterfly a tragic heroine in a
more conventionally European mould. Pinkerton's final aria 'Addio fiorito
asil' was one of the additions; without it his final appearance is harsher
and almost devoid of guilt, and the role of Kate Pinkerton bulks larger and
infinitely harder-faced. In the original Sharpless is weaker and morally
bankrupt, while Butterfly herself seems more remote from reality than ever,
adrift in a world half-way between childhood fantasy and adult feeling.
It makes for a rawer, more uncomfortable opera than ever, though the
inclusion in the first act of more japonaiserie between Butterfly's geisha
friends and her relations hobbles the dramatic pace of the act just at the
point at which the approaching love duet is all that matters. That passage
apart, Puccini's initial dramatic instincts were as sure as his second
thoughts, and Alver's production, unselfconsciously detailed, allows them an
unimpeded run.
Andre's conducting too is idiomatic and sharply theatrical, but on Friday
the orchestral playing was consistently too loud for the moderately powered
cast. Only Patricia Bardon's grave, beautifully focused Suzuki was able to
make every phrase tell. Both Keith Latham's intelligently characterised
Sharpless and Richard Taylor's surprisingly unheroic Pinkerton were covered
too often. Maryanne Telese's Cio-Cio San made herself heard most of the time
and accomplished a telling transition from wide-eyed innocent to hopeless
victim, but carved out her vocal lines in a breathless unsatisfying way.
The entirely Anglophone cast sings in Italian; there are no surtitles. Such
purism could have been appropriate had the standard Butterfly been
performed, but seemed unhelpful here. One of the points of resuscitating
Puccini's original version was to reinstate material that deepens the
cultural and psychological context of the opera. Unless the list of Opera
North's achievements now includes making their audiences fluent in Italian,
most of those textual changes will have gone for nothing.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Japanese artists tune into the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Cabinet of Signs, which runs at the Whitechapel Gallery until February 2,
is the first time the huge Japan Festival, now drawing to its close, has
provided an opportunity to see the work of contemporary Japanese visual
artists. The opportunity is welcome. For the eight artists selected present
work which embodies the complex intermeshing of western ways of thought and
art with that eastern sensibility which, in exhibition after exhibition, the
festival has attempted to lay before us.
Cabinet, however, requires that we make an effort for ourselves. These are
no pieces of interesting exotica, but works rooted in what has become an
international vocabulary. While some Japanese artists have expressed concern
about the lack of awareness and understanding of western artistic
developments in their country, what seems most striking about this
exhibition is just how attuned it is to international currents of artistic
thought.
Emiko Kasahara, for example, shows sculptural installations of large tiled
boxes which recall the furniture, sculpture and minimalist preoccupations of
many of her western contemporaries. Her boxes, however, with their ceramic
flower details and mirrored interiors, have a richness of resonance, a
romanticism, that this genre in western use conspicuously lacks. Shinro
Otake shows collaged notebooks whose multiple images from trash culture
sources have been used to make expensive printed books - a neat reversal of
Pop Art practice.
A version of the western, Beaux Arts model of art education is available in
Japan, teaching students to draw from the cast and from life. Traditional
Japanese art, Nihonga, is also taught, and artists are supposed to choose
one school or another for their training and work thereafter exclusively in
that style. Subverting this convention, Yasumasa Morimura works with both
western and Japanese images, using computer technology to insert his own
likeness into photographs of both traditional style Japanese paintings and
also into some old western favourites.
In a series of works specially made for this show, he becomes the heroine of
several familiar Pre-Raphaelite paintings from the Tate collection, using
computer techniques to open up these morbidly romanticised images of western
women to a different gender, a different race and a different time. In
Portrait, Fan as adapted from Rossetti, Morimura wears a kimono and has a
Rolex on his wrist. The eponymous fan is decorated with images from the
works of Gilbert and George.
No lack of knowingness there, then, or of the confidence to subject such
icons to rigorous, if witty, interrogation. The irony takes by surprise,
while the infinite malleability of images such processes now demonstrate to
be possible - 'I can become anything,' says Morimura - raises fundamental
questions about an image's 'worth.'
Transformations of the real, either by such elaborate or by more subtle
means, are what Richard Francis, who with independent curator Fumio Nanjo
organised the show for the Tate Gallery Liverpool, sees as the exhibitions's
connecting theme. It is particularly notable in the work of Hitoshi Nomura,
who has taken a series of photographs of the movement of the sun and moon
across the sky, then assembled them to make large spiral constructions which
form a three-dimensional record of their paths. Tracking the movement of the
moon on computer, he has also transcribed these traces into the notes of a
musical score. It seems a nice irony that this is not played, but displayed,
in the form of a compact disc in a Perspex case.
Hiroshi Sugimoto, who lives and works in New York, also uses photographs.
His black and white studies were taken inside the display cases of the New
York Natural History Museum. The diorama, captured in exquisite silvery
tones, look like snapshots from the beginning of time.
This is a show of subtleties, a show that takes time. It is also a show
which helps to redress the balance, to remind us that the world of Japan
which we have been encouraged to strive so hard to enter these past five
months is, in many of its manifestations, a world rather more like than
unlike our own. Those bullet trains and cute robots do not exist to amuse
but to get people to work and to direct traffic. The quality of the exchange
of artistic experience now is quite different from that of the French
impressionists 'discovering' Hokusai. The genesis and creation of a work can
now be transglobal.
Morimura, already considered a 'world' artist, took part in 'Metropolis' in
Berlin earlier this year. Tatsuo Miyajima, another of the eight, is showing
concurrently at Anthony d'Offay - (until January 11). At the Whitechapel he
has arranged an installation of digital number display units, and invites us
to contemplate their endless activity. At d'Offay, the darkened space of the
upstairs gallery glows with the red and green light from the displays which
have taken over the gallery walls. They flicker silently, eternally
registering from 1 to 99.
Miyajima's installations reveal that their banal perfection, their stalwart,
ceaseless counting becomes no less than a depiction of the infinite. If that
seems unlikely, just take a look.

Robinson on the problems encountered by Littlewoods in setting up shop in St

<TEXT>
The Christmas day dissolution of the Soviet Union and New Year's
liberalisation of prices have dramatically changed the rules of the game for
foreign investors.
The myth of 280m strong 'Soviet' consumers as the last great untapped market
has been laid to rest. Instead investors have to face the new reality of a
jig-saw of republics which are all virtually bankrupt and of hyper-inflation
which is rapidly destroying what remained of rouble purchasing power. Trade
has been reduced largely to primitive barter - both internally and with the
outside world.
It was not what was expected by Littlewoods, the British mail order and
department store group owned by the Moores family of Liverpool, when it
embarked 21 months ago on a plan to enter the Soviet market.
But, unlike other investors who have been deterred by recent events,
Littlewoods has pressed ahead, building on its hard-earned experience.
Philip Abbott, the man chosen to run the first store in St Petersburg was
plucked from running Littlewoods' Harrogate branch. An enthusiastic and
energetic Yorkshireman, he says the company had a lot of learning to do as
it looked for local partners, examined all aspects of hard and soft currency
trading and sought appropriate premises.
Finding reliable Russian partners with the right contacts and a desire to
learn western methods is a pre-condition for success. Littlewoods paired up
with Alexei Abramov, managing director of Gostiny Dvor, a pre-revolutionary
complex of small, bazaar-type shops, a mini-version of Moscow's famous GUM
complex on Red Square.
Littlewoods has chosen a yellow two-storey neo-classical building on Nevsky
Prospekt, the main shopping street of the former imperial capital, a broad
boulevard lined with classical and art nouveau buildings from the turn of
the century, which cuts straight through the faded elegance of the city.
Given the shortage of virtually everything, Littlewoods - or any other
western retailer - is assured of unlimited demand for its products. The
problem is how to find a rouble-based supplier capable of delivering the
right quality and on time. Littlewoods found such a supplier in Sergei
Petrov, chairman of the Mayak textile company which he rents from the state
and manages. Mayak now has a 10 per cent stake in the three way joint
venture, while Littlewoods has a 60 per cent and Gostiny Dvor, the remaining
30 per cent.
Petrov's biggest problem is finding enough high quality cloth to produce the
quality demanded by Littlewoods. The British company, which has invested
around Pounds 1m in its Russian venture, supplies Mayak with some textiles
and also uses its St Petersburg store as a useful outlet for last season's
unsold stock.
Given the hyper-inflation of the rouble, foreign investors have to find ways
of protecting themselves. Littlewoods carefully separates its store into two
departments, one for rouble sales and the other for hard currency. One of
the key management objectives is keeping the hard currency component of
sales in the rouble store to a minimum - about 95 per cent of rouble sales
come from locally sourced products. The hard currency section sells mainly
imported products to anybody able to pay in any of 12 convertible
currencies.
Most of the customers are from the new class of Russian entrepreneurs and
fixers who have access to hard currency and like to display their new wealth
by wearing imported designer clothes. Some are local racketeers who control
the hard currency prostitution rings and other activities now left alone by
a demoralised police force.
In addition to imported goods, which are often held up by supply and
transport difficulties at the tiny airport and overloaded docks, the hard
currency store also sells high-quality raincoats made by Mayak and a small
range of other rouble sourced products.
Any increase in the number of successful joint ventures would raise the
supply of locally sourced high-quality goods capable of sale for hard
currency and make life a lot easier both for Littlewoods and other foreign
retailers.
Meanwhile, access to the hard currency section is controlled by guarded
turnstiles. Simple possession of hard currency opens the door. Access to the
rouble store, guarded by a large policeman, is actually more difficult. In
practice it is by invitation only.
In this city of once powerful defence plants fallen on hard times, local
plant managers compete to be allowed the privilege of letting their best
workers shop at Littlewoods.
'We have a quota of between 300 and 400 rouble customers a day,' says
Abbott. Used to endless hours of queuing, customers wait patiently in line
before being allowed to enter the warm, well-lit and empty store to chose no
more than two garments.
'Given the high rouble inflation rate we are seriously considering a less
orderly approach,' says Abbott. 'If we opened the store to everybody we
would sell out of stock within hours and would then have to keep the store
closed for a week. The advantage to us is that we would take in roubles and
then immediately exchange them for dollars on the St Petersburg stock and
commodity exchange.'
During December alone the rouble fell from Rbs99 to the dollar to over
Rbs130. Against this sort of background 'the quicker we convert roubles into
dollars the better,' Abbott adds.
Foreign investors like Littlewoods also have the option of taking the long
view and re-investing rouble profits in real estate or other assets. Anatoli
Sobchak, the radical mayor of St Petersburg, continually urges potential
investors to re-invest their rouble profits by purchasing assets in the
City.
But this is another tricky area given the still unclear nature of existing
property laws and general legal confusion which surrounds the
extraordinarily complex task of re-creating a capitalist framework after
more than seven decades of state ownership and authoritarian central
planning.
The solution usually depends on the status and contacts of the Russian joint
venture partner, an increasing number of whom are former army and naval
officers or managers of military factories, desperate to become 'biznessmen'
as the armed forces shrink and the military factories run out of orders.
But Littlewoods' choice of Russian joint venture partners gives it the
opportunity to invest rouble profits in expanding its operations and this is
what it is about to do, Abbott said. 'The opportunities for 1992 are
tremendous. We are looking at six new stores. It took us 21 months to open
our first store, but we were learning all the time. Finding and opening new
stores will be a much easier business.'

FT  03 JAN 92 / Management: Singing in the mud, just singing in the mud -
Emiko Terazono says Japanese construction companies are writing songs to
brighten their image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We will sail over the waves to the land of dreams in a white yacht,' croons
a male pop vocalist. A top 10 hit? Not quite: the lyrics are from a company
song for Taisei, the Japanese construction company.
Taisei spent Y30m (Pounds 128,000) making Take Me To A Lively World, a
six-minute ballad. The song was part of a 'visual identity programme'
designed to soften the construction industry's 'three k's' image: kiken
(dangerous), kitanai (dirty), and kitsui (difficult).
Japan's labour shortage has highlighted the construction industry's labour
shortage. As more Japanese youth are shunning three k industries,
construction companies are forced to change their corporate image in order
to attract young recruits.
Taisei's song project was organised by a group of young employees, and the
lyrics were also written by an employee. Taisei distributed 13,000 CDs to
its workers, and the song is played in the mornings and afternoons inside
the offices. It is sung by a professional Japanese pop group, and is
included in the group's recent album.
Mr Yasuhiri Hashimoto, for the company, said that the song would help more
young people get to know the company name, and associate Taisei with a
softer, trendier image. Taisei also changed its company sign to a modern art
design to appeal to the younger age group.
'We also have to be aware of the impressions we give through the
construction sites,' he adds. Taisei is trying to clean up the image of
construction sites by beautifying the temporary walls surrounding them. The
company also avoids using old or rusty machines, and workers are told to
wash the dirt off the tyres of trucks going out on the roads.
The job shortage is serious and getting worse. At the end of last year there
were nearly five construction-related jobs per applicant, compared with the
national average of just over one per applicant.
Construction companies have been forced to increase wages to attract
workers. Real average monthly wages in the industry rose 8.5 per cent from a
year ago, six times as fast as the Japanese average.
Other construction companies such as Obayashi and Kounoikegumi have also
made company songs to be used for television commercials. Haseko, a
condominium constructor, changed its corporate mark, which now uses a green
triangle symbolising the environment, a red circle for humans, and a blue
rectangle which stands for buildings.
Changing names has also become popular. Kajima, formerly called Kajima
Construction, dropped the 'Construction' from its name because its business
also consists of architecture and design, development projects, and new
businesses.
One construction worker at Maeda Construction said that the three k image of
the industry has hurt morale on the work sites.
'I don't think that trying to make things look good on the outside will
solve everything and making songs does sound a little ridiculous, but the
companies have started something,' he says.
Meanwhile, smaller three k companies, lacking ideas and funds for renewing
their corporate image, are having a harder time. Many small companies have
fallen into financial trouble because of the shortage of labour, and some
sub-contractors are finding that a backlog of orders is mounting up.
Recruit, the publishing and job information company, says that its new job
magazine is an answer to some of these needs. The new title, GAT'N, is a
bi-weekly job information magazine dealing solely with blue-collar jobs.
Recruit says it started GAT'N because many people thought blue collar jobs
were only 'three k' and did not know what some of the companies really did.
'For example, we want more people to understand what a welder does, what
skills a welder needs, and how much the job pays,' says a spokeswoman for
Recruit.
GAT'N currently has a circulation of about 140,000 issues a month around the
Tokyo area. Recruit says it has received favourable responses from younger
people, such as people with special skills, and high school and junior high
school drop outs who felt that they had minimal job prospects.

FT  03 JAN 92 / In an age of ink and innocence: Paul Cheeseright reports on
the Pounds 125m management buy-out at the Birmingham Post and Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS OAKLEY is hoping for the triumph of the innocent. He is the man
who, in November, led the Pounds 125m management buy-out of the Birmingham
Post and Mail.
On financial matters, he confesses to having gone up 'a fairly steep
learning curve'. On further reflection he says it was 'not so much steep as
vertical'.
The buy-out was, after all, the largest UK regional newspaper transaction
for years. It took place against the background of an industry recession
which has cut lifelines of advertising revenue and created difficulties for
other groups with managers more experienced than Mr Oakley.
In any event, as Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror and a buy-out
aspirant himself, reminded readers of The Times last year: 'the road to
management buy-out lies littered with journalistic corpses'.
Just as Mr Stott wishes to pull the Mirror group out of the financial morass
left by Robert Maxwell, so Mr Oakley wanted his company to escape from the
growing capital problems of Ingersoll Publications, the US group which took
control of the Post in 1987. To do that, Mr Oakley, managing director under
Ingersoll, and his team had to pay about twice the sum Ingersoll had spent
four years before.
'Success in the management buy-out was based on ignorance,' Mr Oakley said.
'People find it astounding that six people with no City track record could
raise Pounds 125m.'
But the innocents came away from the City with a package of equity and debt:
Pounds 60m of equity held by Candover, buy-out specialists, and CIN
Ventures, an offshoot of the British Coal pension funds, and Pounds 65m of
borrowings, made up of Pounds 50m of senior debt and Pounds 15m of mezzanine
finance. Within this package there is what Mr Oakley called 'a bit for the
management'.
But there is no equity yet for the staff of the Post. There are no immediate
plans to widen the equity base. 'What we need is a good year's performance
under our belts, and then we can think of the options,' said Mr Oakley.
The staff had little to do with the buy-out. Indeed, they knew little of
what was going on during the months of waiting for Ingersoll to make up its
mind on the technique it would use to reduce debt. That said, when members
of the Oakley team returned from London having completed the buy-out, they
found congratulatory posters stuck on their cars. At the very least there
was relief among the staff that the Americans had gone.
They left a clutch of valuable assets, a larger clutch than the name Post
suggests. The jewel is the Sunday Mercury, the best-selling Sunday paper
outside London with a circulation in Birmingham which exceeds those of all
other Sunday papers there except the News of the World.
The Evening Mail, a breezy tabloid, has stabilised circulation at about
220,000 after enduring falling sales for a decade.
The Coventry Evening Telegraph has locked up its city with a very high
proportion of home sales. There are eight weekly newspapers and a local
listings publication called What's On.
The Sports Argus is one of the few Saturday sports papers and sells more
than 60,000 copies. That circulation is more than double that of the morning
Birmingham Post, the problem paper of the group.
In 1989, the latest year for which accounts are available at Companies
House, the newspaper group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 885,000, down from
Pounds 4.56m the previous year. It had gearing of 132 per cent and was
returning 0.59 per cent on total assets.
But there is more to the company than its titles. It owns its headquarters
building in the centre of Birmingham; this would be worth several tens of
millions of pounds given happier circumstances in the property market.
Ingersoll installed new printing equipment in the building; there are four
presses able to provide high-definition colour, but they are under-used,
with only one occupied every night of the week.
The difficulty for Mr Oakley is both nursing these assets through the
recession and making use of spare capacity. With Pounds 65m of debt to
service, he will be watching his cashflow. Some staff felt that the price
paid for the company would inevitably lead to retrenchment. But Mr Oakley is
clear that 'you don't grow a business by continually cutting away at it'.
Certainly no redundancies have been announced and the only casualty seems to
have been the features editor of the Post. 'Over the next 12 months we're
looking at developing our titles and not cutting them back,' said Mr Oakley.
Probably one quick way of reducing the debt burden would be to sell the
headquarters building and move into cheaper premises. Mr Oakley agreed that
'at some point it may make sense to realise the asset and have a move', but
not yet. Not only is the property market weak, but 'we desperately need a
period of stability; the last thing we now need is a move - it would be
counter-productive'.
The choice then is to slog through the recession. Mr Oakley implied that the
management's backers are patient, that there is time to massage the assets.
There were two principles behind the buy-out, he said.
First, 'we did not draw up a business plan we didn't believe is achievable;
it would have been easy to put forward some tempting figures'. Second, 'when
we looked at the price to be paid we were determined not to end up paying
such a price as to find it impossible to service the debt and pay a return
to the backers'.
Mr Oakley listed some of the immediate corporate targets. He wants, for
example, to have the presses, at Birmingham and Coventry, in use all the
time. That means an expansion of the contract printing business. There is
scope, for example, to undertake the regional printing for a national
newspaper. He wants to strengthen the free-newspaper stable - 'we're not
going to see competitors come into our area unchallenged'.
Then there is the question of the Post, where circulation remains stubbornly
low in spite of a change of editor last year and re-launch as a broadsheet.
Mr Oakley argued that its influence outweighs its sales. He noted that 'it
has a business-dominated readership'. But it seems uncertain of its
constituency, insecure in its identity. Life is uncertain in the amorphous
market area where the styles of the Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph cross
over, and it is in this ill-defined slot that the Post operates.
Such tasks would be easier in an expanding economy. While the Post has
managed some growth of advertising in the areas it can influence, there is
little it can do about, for example, the sluggishness of the Situations
Vacant columns. The Evening Mail used to advertise 29 pages of jobs two
years ago. Now it is down to 14 or 15.
'We expect to see some improvement in the economy next year, even if it's
not manifest until the second half,' Mr Oakley said. 'We expect advertising
to increase.' There are plenty of other newspaper proprietors who will hope
that he is right.

The prime minister said it would 'raise false expectations' about the extent
to which the government could help to win an improved compensation package.
He said in a letter to Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, that it
would be 'quite wrong' to give the impression that the government could do
more to help victims of the bank's collapse.
Winding-up proceedings against BCCI were adjourned last month until January
14 to give provisional liquidators more time to negotiate a deal with Abu

FT  03 JAN 92 / BMA will seek doctors' views on fee-charging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL BRITAIN'S 36,000 doctors working in general practice are to be
questioned in a survey which could reshape important aspects of the family
doctor service.
The British Medical Association will use the results of the survey - being
conducted for the BMA by the Electoral Reform Society - in negotiations with
the government on future developments in general practice.
A number of controversial and politically sensitive questions will be raised
by the survey. These include asking family doctors whether they endorse the
BMA's policy of opposition to GP fund-holding under the government's health
reforms, and whether there are circumstances in which they would support
patients paying for consultations with their doctors.
Family doctors have until the beginning of next month to complete the
survey, and the results will be reported to a special conference of the
BMA's general medical services committee in June. Publication of the survey
results could therefore coincide with the general election campaign - in
which the future of the National Health Service is expected to play a
prominent part.
However, Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the BMA's general medical services
committee, said yesterday that the BMA had begun planning the exercise 18
months ago and that the timing close to the election was not deliberate. BMA
leaders would want to negotiate on the results whichever party was in power.
The survey will ask family doctors whether there should be changes in their
present contractual responsibilities to provide patients with medical cover
24 hours a day. If doctors favour changing the current arrangements, the
possibilities of establishing local primary care emergency centres or
stationing GPs in accident and emergency departments of hospitals are
suggested.
Other questions ask whether family doctors would favour ending their
self-employed independent contractor status with the government and moving
to a salaried service.
The hospital service has received most attention since the government
introduced its health reforms in April even though 90 per cent of medical
consultations begin and end with family doctors. An increasing range of
treatment is likely to be carried out in the GP's surgery in future, and the
survey asks doctors whether they would be willing to provide services such
as crisis and addiction counselling, hypnotherapy, physiotherapy, chiropody,
laboratory analysis and x-rays.
The survey might change BMA policy on some issues - most controversially, on
its opposition to fund-holding.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Total personal wealth up sharply since 1976
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL personal wealth in the UK increased more than fivefold between 1976
and 1989, with occupational pensions taking a sharply increased share,
according to government statistics.
The total, including marketable wealth plus occupational and state pension
rights, rose from Pounds 500bn to about Pounds 2,600bn over the period, the
Central Statistical Office says in Economic Trends, published yesterday.
Over the 13 years, there was little change in the overall distribution of
the marketable wealth of individuals. The share of the top 1 per cent fell
slightly, while that of the upper quartile increased a little. The top 1 per
cent owned 21 per cent of the country's wealth in 1976, compared with 18 per
cent in 1989. The top 25 per cent owned 71 per cent in 1976 and 75 per cent
in 1989.
Another study in Economic Trends shows London and the south-east continuing
to have more than their fair share of the national economic cake, although
they experienced below-average growth in 1990.
Provisional figures for gross domestic product (GDP) per head of population
showed wide variations throughout the country, with London at the top of the
scale with Pounds 10,400 and the rest of the south-east with Pounds 9,300.
The highest GDP per head outside the south-east in 1990 was East Anglia with
Pounds 8,400, and the east Midlands with Pounds 8,100. The lowest was
Northern Ireland, at Pounds 6,200 per head.
The figures suggest a continuation of long-term trends, except that the
south-east experienced below-average growth, while the Yorkshire and
Humberside region appears to have grown more rapidly.
Over the past 10 years there has been a significant variation in the
economic performance of the regions. The growth in GDP was most rapid in
East Anglia, followed by the rest of the south-east and the south-west. The
north-west, north and Scotland have grown less strongly, and these regions
contributed a lower proportion of UK total GDP in 1990 than 10 years
earlier.
London's position at the top of the GDP scale in 1989 at 148 per cent of the
national average reflected not only the dominance of the capital as an
industrial and commercial centre, but also the inclusion of commuters'
earnings.
The next-highest GDP per head in a study of areas was Berkshire at Pounds
9,500 (126 per cent of the average), Grampian Pounds 9,100 (120 per cent and
Cambridgeshire and Surrey, both Pounds 8,400 (111 per cent).
At the other end of the scale the GDP per head in Mid-Glamorgan was Pounds
5,400 (72 per cent of average), followed by Merseyside, Cornwall and
Northern Ireland at just over Pounds 5,700 (76 per cent).
A large swathe of northern England is emerging as Britain's most prosperous
area, according to BWD Rensburg, the stockbroking group. Mr John Dyson,
corporate services director, said yesterday a semi-rural 'northern
playground' had emerged, covering an area from the Lake District in the west
to North Yorkshire in the east.
Disposable incomes were often as high or higher than in the most prosperous
parts of the south, but lower unemployment, smaller mortgages on better
property, lower indebtedness, and ease of travel made people feel better-off
than their southern counterparts.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Rivers watchdog curbs ICI effluent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Rivers Authority, the environmental regulator, yesterday
announc-ed new controls on emissions from ICI's outfall at Wilton, Teesside.
It is believed to be the largest industrial effluent discharge point in the
UK.
The NRA described the new legally enforceable limits, which take immediate
effect, as 'tough', but said the further reductions it required in
discharges from the outfall were to be phased in over four years.
Until now there has been little legal control on the concentrations and
types of chemicals released from ICI's Wilton petrochemical and plastics
plants into the Tees estuary through a pipeline which discharges 33m gallons
of effluent a day.
The new NRA consent imposes limits on concentrations of components of the
discharge for the first time. It also requires reductions of 50 per cent and
more in discharges of significant pollutants, including organic acids and
salts, by 1996 and reserves the right to impose additional conditions in the
next two years.
The NRA is now reviewing the consents under which thousands of effluent
pipelines around Britain have operated for decades. It faces pressure from
Greenpeace, the environmental group, to make an example of ICI by imposing
immediate heavy cuts in its Tees effluent discharges. But the NRA said
yesterday the reductions had to be phased or ICI's operations would be
threatened.
ICI welcomed the new limits, saying they were in line with its corporate aim
of cutting discharges by 50 per cent by 1995.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Computer-run tool investment rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of computer-run numerically-controlled machine tools (CNC
tools)in the UK engineering industry may be much smaller than thought,
according to a survey by Benchmark Research for Machinery magazine, which
publishes its results today.
The survey found, however, that recent investment in CNC machines is higher
than assumed. Investment in machine tools which combine modern computer
control technology with traditional machining disciplines is a measure of
productive capability and competitiveness.
The survey identified 400,000 metal-cutting and 115,000 metal-forming
machine tools at 18,600 engineering sites, representing 86 per cent of all
machine tools installed in the UK. This excludes those used in process
industries.
At the engineering sites 47,066 CNC machine tools were counted at 5,312
sites employing more than 20 people.
Along with an estimated 5,770 CNC machines used by smaller companies, the
installed CNC machine tool base in the UK engineering sector is 52,836.
The figure is low, given that CNC machine tools have taken an increasing
share of the market in the past decade. Numerically-controlled machines
accounted for 39 per cent of the market in 1990, against 11 per cent in
1978.
A more encouraging picture is produced if sites using only manual machine
tools are excluded. The 47,066 CNC machines at larger engineering companies
represent 23 per cent of the 202,000 machine tools used.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Revolutionary underground movement: David Goodhart visits a
pit where roof bolts hold the key to increased productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST thing to strike a visitor to Asfordby pit in north Leicestershire
is how eerily empty it is underground.
Asfordby is in its Pounds 290m development stage and will not be fully
operational until the end of next year. That, however, is not why there are
so few miners in its dark tunnels; the workforce has almost reached its
full-production level of 400.
It feels empty because it is the testing ground for a revolution in British
deep-mining technology which is intended to triple productivity, cut the
number of underground workers and make British Coal more competitive.
The key to this revolution is a 3-metre-long steel roof bolt. Such bolts are
used instead of pit props and expensive and labour-intensive steel arches to
support tunnels. They are smeared with adhesive resin and rammed up into
tunnel roofs at regular intervals.
This system has long been used in the US and Australia, which now have only
one back-up worker underground for every one digging coal. In Britain the
ratio is closer to four to one - with two of the four usually transporting,
setting up and maintaining steel arches.
Bolts are quicker to install than steel arches after the coal has been cut
away. At Asfordby that means coal can be cut at a rate of 7 metres a shift
against the average in Britain of 2 metres to 3 metres.
Asfordby is the first British pit to have started virtually from scratch
with roof bolts. It hopes as a result to produce about 1.8m tonnes a year
with 400 workers. That target would be spectacularly better than average
British productivity and has been greeted with scepticism by union
officials.
British Coal hopes each Asfordby miner will produce 18 tonnes of coal per
shift compared with the UK average of 5 tonnes. The cost of production will
be rather more than half British Coal's average of Pounds 1.75 per gigawatt
(the measure of heat value) and will compete even with some open-cast coal.
Asfordby was originally planned as a conventional pit producing about 4m
tonnes of coal a year with 1,400 workers. But British Coal's Nottinghamshire
group decided, in the light of advances in roof-bolting technology and the
squeeze on capital spending, to opt for a mini super-productivity pit
instead - working one seam with four teams - cutting development costs from
Pounds 480m.
When fully operational, it will have three 'continuous miners' - giant
US-made coal-cutters rare in British pits - and one long wall-shearer. It
will also be Britain's first pit to start with a six-days-a-week, 7 1/2
 hour shift pattern in which workers alternate between early, late and night
shifts and have every fourth week off.
This arrangement has been made possible because the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers negotiates for workers at Asfordby. At pit level the differences
between the UDM and the National Union of Mineworkers are not great, but the
six-day week is a matter for national officials. The NUM would not have
accepted it, as it showed at Margam in south Wales where opposition to
six-day working led to the shelving of a plan to invest Pounds 90m in a new
pit which would have created 830 jobs.
Asfordby's new shift system will cut overtime and allow teams of managers,
supervisors and workers to stay together - at least it will do so if Nacods,
the supervisors' union, joins the managers and the UDM in accepting the new
system.
There were grumbles about the shift system at first, says Mr Mick Buck, a
chargeman at the coalface. But most now prefer it, and top-earners can still
make Pounds 30,000-plus a year. Absenteeism, usually a good guide to morale,
is only 3 per cent.
Mr John Longden, group director of Nottinghamshire, says roof bolting cannot
be used in all pits, but Asfordby represents the future for British Coal.
Some critics complain that pits like Asfordby should have been developed
years ago. Others, though, still doubt whether roof bolting is safe.
Mr Neil Greatrex, president of the Nottinghamshire UDM, says British pits
are deeper than those in the US or Australia. 'It looks fine now, but will
it be safe in 30 or 40 years?' he asks.
The Mines Inspectorate has been slow to accept roof bolting, but is
gradually relaxing its objections.
Wooden pit props are still used at Asfordby, but the inspectors have said
they can go. They have also agreed that coal cutting can extend 5.8 metres
(currently 3.8 metres) beyond the last roof bolt.
If the quality of its coal were better, Asfordby might be a prime candidate
for a single-pit sell-off, an idea which does not go down well with the
local managers. 'You buy a car from a company, Ford, not from a particular
Ford plant like Halewood,' says one.
In spite of their pride in what Asfordby should be able to achieve, the
managers and workers cannot escape the gloom that hangs over British Coal
ahead of the difficult contract renegotiation with its main customers, the
electricity generators.
'We kept the lights burning in the strike and we've doubled productivity
since then - what more do they want from us?' asks one disillusioned
manager. The answer is lots of Asfordbys.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Sharp fall reported in hotel management pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE SALARIES for managers in the hotel and catering industry have fallen
sharply in the last year as companies fighting the recession have replaced
older management staff, Michael Smith, Labour Correspondent, writes.
A survey by the British Hotels Restaurants and Caterers Association and
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, found that average salaries for hotel,
restaurant and catering managers fell 7 per cent from Pounds 14,191 in 1990
to Pounds 13,144 last year.
The association said the findings indicated that senior management jobs were
going to junior managers with lower remuneration expectations.
The survey showed that, below management grades, pay levels already
considered poor in comparison with other industries had risen relatively
little on average.
Live-out staff on weekly wages in hotels and restaurants won on average a
3.7 per cent increase from Pounds 142.83 in 1990 to Pounds 148.14 last year.
This compares with average rises in manufacturing towards the end of last
year of 5.5 per cent, according to the Confederation of British Industry,
and much higher increases at the start of the year.
Live-in staff in hotels and restaurants won rises last year of 10.2 per
cent, taking the average to Pounds 139.66.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Success of flexible working questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL companies introducing flexible working practices have generally
failed to anticipate the range of training provision required, according to
a survey of the industry.
The survey was carried out by the Chemical Industries Association last year
in response to the 'widespread interest in flexibility' throughout the
industry.
Responses came from 30 per cent of the association's membership, employing
about 20,000 manual workers.
Companies underestimated the resources needed to implement flexible working
practices, according to a report accompanying the results.
It said: 'The principal reason for this is that in many cases individuals
have to be retrained and reassessed in their core skills before they can
assume any additional skills. Validation is particularly important when the
acquisition of new skills is linked to enhanced rates of pay.'
The report added that pitfalls were likely to be encountered when
introducing flexible working practices. These included pay, training and
fears over job security.
The report said the main dilemma over pay was whether rates should be
enhanced when flexibility agreements were made, or after completion of
training or utilisation of additional skills.
The report said the knock-on effects on other groups of employees,
particularly where there were long-established or formalised differentials,
should also be taken into account.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Bush ready to wage 'dog-eat-dog' campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush is ready to wage 'a dog-eat-dog' campaign for
re-election, but still expects to win a second term in the White House
whether or not the US economy recovers by November.
In a pre-Christmas interview broadcast on US television today, Mr Bush
conceded that many Americans felt worse off than when he entered office
three years ago. It was vital to get the US economy moving, he said.
In the interview with Mr David Frost, the British broadcaster, Mr Bush said
his own economic advisers were forecasting an economic recovery by the end
of the second quarter, with clear results showing in the third quarter.
Fresh measures to stimulate the US economy would be unveiled shortly, he
said. Yesterday, Mr Bush dropped similar hints at a news conference in
Canberra, the first stop on his Far East tour.
Mr Bush appeared to relish the prospect of a tough election battle: 'I'm
certainly going into this as a dog-eat-dog fight. I will do what I have to
do to be re-elected.'
Mr Bush also expressed confidence that the new Commonwealth of Independent
States will be a lasting replacement for the Soviet Union, despite 'some
difficult bumps on the road'.
Turning to domestic issues, Mr Bush complained about the explicit sexual
descriptions during televised coverage of the William Kennedy Smith trial in
Florida, and the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Clarence
Thomas.
'Why, when you get into this kind of vivid, and gory detail of a person's
sexual prowess or lack thereof, why does that have to be brought into
everybody's living room . . . I think we've gone too far in that kind of
thing.'
On President Saddam Hussein, Mr Bush said he could not predict when the
Iraqi leader would fall from power. It would have been nice if the Allies
had insisted on him being removed as a ceasefire condition, but making it a
war aim would have split the US-led Gulf coalition and angered Arabs.
George Graham adds: The slowdown in the US economy continued into December,
according to a widely watched survey of company buyers.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business
activity fell to 46.5 per cent last month, a level which indicates a drop in
activity in the manufacturing sector and the lowest figure since May.
The purchasing managers' index averaged 47.2 per cent for the whole of 1991,
a level which in the past has been consistent with overall economic growth
of only around 1 per cent.
The NAPM survey showed that production and new orders fell in December. New
export orders rose, but slower than in recent months. Employment fell for
the 35th month in succession.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said that construction spending
fell 0.6 per cent in November to an annual rate of Dollars 363.2bn (Pounds
199.5bn), adjusted for inflation and seasonal variations.
Residential construction spending stagnated at an annual rate of Dollars
167.3bn while non-residential private spending fell 3.6 per cent in November
to a rate of Dollars 87.8bn.

Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, leader of the lay opposition party, the Socialist

in the first round of the general election last week. In doing so, it put
itself far ahead of all other parties but the final composition of the
national assembly will not be resolved until a second round on January 16.
The march, during which riot police guarded main public buildings but
generally maintained a discreet presence, was joined by many supporters of
the National Liberation Front (FLN). It had held a monopoly of power until
the riots of October 1988 but last week only picked up 15 seats. Many
workers and supporters of smaller parties were also on the march.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Israeli budget passed after costly haggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, last night dug himself out of
a government crisis which has beset him since New Year's Eve, winning
parliamentary approval for his 1992 budget after concessions to right-wing
and religious coalition factions which may yet have unwelcome political and
economic consequences.
Agreement between the National Religious Party and the Shas ultra-orthodox
religious party on the distribution of funds to their client institutions
removed the last obstacle to a Knesset majority for the budget, which should
have been in effect by the beginning of the financial year on January 1. It
was eventually passed by 60 votes to 53.
The vote was a relief for Mr Shamir - virtually sealed into the parliament
building with his fellow MPs by the heaviest snowfalls in Jerusalem for 30
years - after days of intensive haggling with the small government parties
involving the handout of hundreds of millions of shekels in extra spending
to their vested interests.
However, commitments to two extreme right-wing parties, Tehiya and Moledet,
to increase building and other development in Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories will anger Washington at a time when Israel badly needs
extra US financial assistance in the form of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn)
loan guarantees to help it absorb Jewish immigration.
Officially, the government said the cost of the various last-minute deals
would not inflate the projected budget deficit this year of 6.2 per cent of
gross domestic product. There is some slack in the budget because of lower
than expected rates of immigration.
Officials said the final cost of concessions to the right-wing and religious
parties would be Shk220m (Pounds 55m) which would be taken out of the budget
reserves.
Mr Shamir immediately faced another Knesset wrangle last night on a proposal
to introduce direct elections for the office of prime minister.
The reform is an attempt to end the influence of small parties by creating a
stronger prime minister with powers close to those of an executive
president.
However, the publicly uninspiring Mr Shamir was bitterly opposed to the
measure, which he believes would favour the opposition Labour party over his
Likud party.
Israel said last night it planned to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip for alleged terrorist activities, reviving a policy
of deportation strongly condemned by the US shortly before Middle East peace
talks are due to resume in Washington on January 7.
In reaction, PLO officials in Amman said they would instruct the Palestinian
delegation not to go to Washington. However, Faisal Husseini, who heads the
delegation's advisory committee, said a decision had not yet been taken.
The expulsions are the first since four Palestinians were deported last
April. To date, 66 people have been expelled since the start of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in December 1987. The practice has
evoked international protests that it is illegal.
The move, against which the 12 may appeal, followed the killing on Wednesday
of a Jewish settler in Gaza. Alarmed settlers responded yesterday by
establishing a new settlement at the site of the latest killing and calling
for tougher army action against the uprising.

to open markets for US products. Even so, the shop manager felt he was
neglecting the US domestic market, in which well-paid Americans once
provided the base of US prosperity.
Polls show the manager's concern is shared by Americans across the country.
Job losses - or fear of them - cast a long shadow. The president's quest for
'jobs, jobs, jobs' through exports seems to offer only distant promise.
Official government statistics suggest that this, the ninth US recession
since the 1930s, is less severe than its predecessors. The Bureau of Labour
Statistics says the total number of unemployed - 8.5m  - is less than it was
a year ago and lower than at similar points in the 1981 and 1973 recessions.
But it is the longest downturn since the Great Depression and is reaching
beyond those manufacturing workers who are accustomed to lay-offs. The
restructuring of the services sector and the trimming of management in the
country's leading industries has inflicted job losses on middle-class,
middle-aged managers and professionals.
In November, 16 months after the US economy officially went into recession,
employment of managers, technicians and other white-collar workers had
fallen by 209,000, according to the Labour Department Household Survey. The
same group had gained 836,000 jobs 16 months after the recession that began
in 1981, and 794,000 after the one that started in November 1973.
There is, however, widespread scepticism about the official unemployment
figures. Mr Howard Rosen, a research associate at the International
Institute of Economics, said the Labour Department figures tend to count
only the 'immediately unemployed'. The long-term jobless are less likely to
be included.
One who would not be counted is Mr George Proper, 57, a former personnel
director, who related a bleak saga of his job searches to the Congressional
joint economic committee.
'This is not just a crisis of the unemployed,' he said. 'It is a crisis of
the middle class, and the middle-management employees throughout the United
States.'
When he lost his job in 1984, Mr Proper sent out hundreds of curricula vitae
but failed to get one offer. Declared a 'dislocated worker' by New York
state, he was retrained as a typesetter. This new profession lasted until
December when the system in which he was trained became obsolete. He was
retrained again to operate computers in five areas of software, but
computer-operator jobs go mostly to women.
Mr Proper went back to college and earned a master's degree in theology,
hopeful of a job in counselling or administration in a church parish. Most
interviewers now say he is 'over-qualified'.
American college graduates, who once viewed a diploma as a passport to a
secure future, are also getting a cool reception in the job market. A
Northwestern University survey concluded that 1992 college graduates will
face the worst job market in 20 years.
'An overwhelming 69 per cent of corporations expect their business to
decline or - at best - stay even during the new year,' said Mr Victor
Lindquist, author of the survey.
More middle-class job cuts are still to come. The 74,000 job losses - many
of them white-collar - at General Motors make up one of the most recent
examples. These losses mean declining tax receipts and further lay-offs in
state and local government.
Many white-collar workers will never regain good jobs. Mr Proper is now
working as a clerk-typist for the Kelly Girl temporary employment agency,
earning Dollars 10 (Pounds 5.40) an hour - not quite enough to cover his
mortgage. His wife and two grown-up, college-educated daughters contribute
to the family income with their own modest wages from clerical jobs.
Mr Proper says he will mark time to survive until he reaches 62 and can
supplement his income with a state pension - 'and then I will work until I
die.'

<TEXT>
MR Percival Patterson, Jamaica's finance minister, has been replaced in a
cabinet reshuffle announced by Mr Michael Manley, the prime minister.
Mr Patterson, who was also the deputy prime minister, leaves the cabinet.
The new finance minister is Mr Hugh Small, previously the industry minister.
The cabinet and all junior ministers had offered their resignations last
week to allow Mr Manley to change portfolios. Mr Patterson subsequently told
the prime minister that he did not want to be considered for a cabinet post.
Mr Patterson has been under pressure to resign since he authorised a waiver
of import duties for an oil company headed by a member of the executive of
the ruling People's National Party. An earlier casualty of the furore over
the waiver was Mr Horace Clarke, the energy minister, who resigned last
week.
Mr Patterson's resignation is a setback in a political career in which the
next step was expected to be the prime ministership, with indications that
Mr Manley would step down this year. Government officials say Mr Manley is
now likely to delay his departure from politics.
In announcing the new cabinet, Mr Manley reduced the number of ministries,
and said he would present new economic policies in a few days. The
government is trailing the opposition according to opinion polls. The polls
suggest that the government's support has been eroded because of the
economic and social effects of its programme to economic deregulation.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Vance talks lead to accord on ceasefire in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav federal army and the breakaway republic of Croatia yesterday
agreed on a ceasefire, to take effect from 6pm today, after four hours of
talks with Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations envoy.
If the ceasefire - the 14th such accord - were honoured, the way would be
paved for the dispatch of UN peace-keeping forces to Croatia. Mr Vance
called the agreement 'an important step forward'.
Under the accord, signed by Colonel General Andrija Raseta, deputy commander
of the Serb-led federal army in Croatia, and Croatian defence minister Gojko
Susak, neither side would return fire in the event of a violation until
joint liaison teams had investigated the incident.
The talks took place in Sarajevo, capital of the central Yugoslav republic
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, which also appealed yesterday to Mr Vance for
peace-keepers.
The deputy prime minister of Bosnia, Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, said troops
should be sent to Bosnia, 'not only to preserve the peace, but to preserve
the territorial integrity of the republic'.
Last month, Bosnian Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, declared a 'Serbian
Bosnia', in a move which confirmed suspicions that certain Serb-inhabited
regions of the republic would try to form the boundaries of a greater
Serbia.
Bosnia, despite Serbia's opposition, has asked - along with the republics of
Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia - for recognition by the European
Community. The EC will grant this on January 15, subject to respect for
human and ethnic rights having been established, and to no forcible change
being made to any of the republics' frontiers.
Bosnian Moslem officials yesterday said they feared that any carve-up of the
republic by Serbia and Croatia would lead to bloodshed between its three
largest ethnic communities of Moslems, Serbs and Croats.
The 734,000 Croats, organised under the Bosnian equivalent of Croatia's
ruling Croatian Democratic Union, are divided between those living in
western Hercegovina, who are considering long-term unity with Croatia, and
those in multi-ethnic communities in the republic who want to retain its
unity.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Russian prices rise far higher than predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHOCK therapy came to Russia yesterday with prices leaping four or five
times - far more than the doubling predicted by the government for the first
month of the reform.
Shops which last year offered only a few cheap goods were still virtually
bare but the few goods available were now expensive, spelling poverty for
average wage-earners and real hardship for the low-paid.
Ukraine, the second largest republic, also freed its prices yesterday, with
journalists reporting rises of between three and six times, in line with the
Russian experience. Ukraine is to give its citizens Rbs400 worth of coupons
from next week in their salaries as compensation. Belorussia, the third Slav
republic, will free its prices today and will also introduce coupons.
No disturbances were reported in Moscow yesterday, as the price of 10 eggs
rose to Rbs11 from Rbs2, a kilo of indifferent meat to between Rbs21 and
Rbs31 from around Rbs8, and butter to Rbs45 where before it had sold for
Rbs10. The minimum wage and pension is Rbs342 a month.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform,
told the evening paper Izvestia that price inflation would run at 100 per
cent a month for January and February, and that prices would rise threefold
in the first quarter. Production would fall over the year by 10-12 per cent
and unemployment would rise sharply.
He predicted, however, that the rise in prices would moderate to about 12
per cent a month by the middle of the year and to 'a few per cent' by its
end. He said he feared that political pressures to pay extra compensation
would prove too great to withstand, and that a new inflationary spiral 'in
which money would lose all meaning' would be instituted.
Business people and economists were full of foreboding on the effects of the
price rises - while conceding that the economic situation had become so
desperate that the government had had little choice. Mr Sergei Shibayev,
managing director of the Moscow office of accountants Ernst and Young, said:
'This was the only thing available perhaps to make things better by the end
of the year.'
He added: 'It will give some kind of signal to producers and business: the
problem is that other signals are also being given. The top rate of income
tax is 60 per cent - you cannot create capital in that way.'
Tax rates, agreed in the past few weeks, reflect the government's hunger for
both roubles and hard currency in order to balance the budget, after the
past year in which almost no income came in. Personal income tax bands rise
from 12 per cent to 60 per cent; a new value added tax is set at 28 per
cent; profit tax is put at 32 per cent; and the government has retained the
system under which enterprises which earn hard currency must sell 40 per
cent of it to the government at a low rate.
Mr Mikhail Berger, the chief economic commentator of Izvestia, said the
government hoped to match Poland's experience, with goods coming through to
the shops after a couple of months.
Dr Alexei Kireyev, a former Gorbachev adviser, said both the government and
the population were badly prepared. 'They are already very poor and I think
the therapy may be too shocking for many.'

FT  03 JAN 92 / Up to 90% of Muscovites 'will fall into poverty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 60 per cent of Muscovites have been pushed below the poverty line
in recent months, according to a survey of living standards carried out by
the Norwegian trade union research organisation, FAFO International, for
Moscow city council. This figure is likely to rise to 85-90 per cent as
prices triple in coming weeks, Mr Erik Hansen, head of FAFO's East Europe
studies department, warned yesterday.
The report, based on live interviews with 2,500 Muscovites between June and
August, says: 'We are witnessing a phenomenon so far unknown to sociology;
middle income families have overnight been turned into low-income families'.
Real per capita income of the poorest sections of the population fell by 20
per cent after last April's limited price reforms, while the incomes of
middle income households fell 250 per cent 'forcing them to learn a new
consumption pattern formerly characteristic of low income households'.
The report shows that even before the abolition of official prices for all
but a handful of basic items this week, the average Moscow household spent
80 per cent of its income on food, while 'a significant part of the
population spends all its income on food, leaving nothing for the purchase
of clothing, footwear, leisure and consumer durables'.
Under the former Soviet system, Moscow and St Petersburg (formerly
Leningrad) enjoyed significantly higher living standards than most Soviet
cities and received priority supplies of food and other products. They have
been hit particularly hard by the collapse of the centralised distribution
system and cuts in spending on military industries which are big employers
in both cities.
The dramatic impoverishment which has reduced much of the middle class to
penury now threatens the very survival of the poorest strata of the
population, the report indicates. The freeing of prices will hit hardest
those like the elderly, the handicapped, the chronically ill and single
mothers who are unable to adapt to the new circumstances, it says.
More than 40 per cent of the workforce fear losing their jobs. This
proportion reflects the danger accurately, says the report, given that
'privatisation of small and medium enterprises, combined with further
cutbacks in the standing army and military production could create a reserve
army of unemployed in the Moscow region of 25-35 per cent of the present
workforce'.
Fear of crime and violence is growing, too, as is concern that Moscow,
despite its problems, will attract a stream of 'refugee-migrants' who will
put additional pressure on the city's already overcrowded and inadequate
housing, health and other facilities.
Although the report gives a bleak picture of contemporary and future living
conditions in the Russian capital, it also indicates that 42 per cent of the
overall population, mainly young and better educated, are prepared to face
market conditions and are willing to raise their qualifications, invest
capital and adapt.
But the dry statistics also reveal that, barring large foreign aid, 1992
could be the most traumatic year for Muscovites and millions of other former
Soviet citizens since the collapse of the Soviet economy in 1919.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Rebels give Georgian leader deadline to resign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIA's besieged president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was yesterday given until
midday today local time (9am GMT) to resign by the leaders of the armed
opposition or face an all-out assault on the building where he has been
trapped for 12 days.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, a nationalist and former anti-Soviet dissident, was elected
as Georgia's leader by a landslide victory in January 1991. He vowed
yesterday to continue in office and said he was able to rule the republic
from the basement of Tbilisi's government building 'indefinitely'.
Speaking to a small group of journalists inside the heavily guarded and
fortified basement in central Tbilisi, Mr Gamsakhurdia denounced attempts by
the armed opposition to overthrow him as a 'coup by the Tbilisi mafia and
former communists.
'They are receiving both weapons and support from Moscow, as well as from
all the criminals and mafiosi in Georgia,' Mr Gamsakhurdia said.
His comments came as opposition leaders made a television broadcast
announcing the formation of a temporary government committee, including
representatives of all the groups which make up the loose opposition
alliance.
The committee imposed a curfew in the capital Tbilisi of 11pm local time, in
an effort to reduce the number of casualties in the fighting in the city.
The Georgian interior ministry said that at least 62 people had died, with
500 wounded.
In a wood-panelled canteen converted into a makeshift broadcasting studio
several metres below ground, Mr Gamsakhurdia admitted that he could not
control the entire republic.
But, looking healthy and relaxed, he said he doubted the opposition's
ability to launch an all-out attack on the government and insisted he could
continue to act as president for an indefinite period.
He compared his position with that of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the
Lithuanian president, when he was surrounded by Soviet forces in the
Lithuanian television centre last January.
'Landsbergis was surrounded, he had no control over the television or the
newspapers, he had no airport, but still was still able to rule the
republic.'
His claims seemed to have some foundation. Mr Gamsakhurdia has the use of an
extensive basement complex apparently designed for such a situation by
Georgia's former communist masters when the government palace was
constructed by German prisoners of war at the end of the Second World War.
The complex has electricity from its own generator, heating and running
water. It has also been receiving supplies through a route which government
forces have managed to secure into the parliament through the narrow streets
of Tbilisi old town.
Mr Gamsakhurdia is also supported by some highly trained troops, including
elite Omon soldiers.
The streets of Tbilisi were quiet yesterday apart from occasional bursts of
machine gun and rifle fire, but the opposition dropped several petrol bombs
on the government building from a helicopter in the morning.
The helicopter also attempted to drop a petrol tank on the Interior
Ministry, two miles from the government building, but was driven back by a
sniper on the roof top.
Mr Gamsakhurdia repeated his consistent claims that Moscow supported the
opposition to his presidency, and was participating in a plot to keep
control of Georgia, which occupied an important strategic position as the
gateway to the Caucasus.
Mr Gamsakhurdia said negotiations between the two sides were impossible as
long as the opposition continued to insist that his resignation must precede
any talks.
He said that opposition claims that Georgia was not ready for presidential
rule were misguided. 'They do not understand the concept of a legislative
parliament and an executive presidency.'

FT  03 JAN 92 / Investment banks resign as advisers to Shandwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANDWICK, one of the world's biggest public relations firms, has been hit
by the unexpected resignation of two leading UK investment banks as its
advisers.
Morgan Grenfell resigned as Shandwick's merchant bank and Warburg Securities
quit as its stockbroker just as the City was setting off for its Christmas
holidays.
'Morgan and Warburg felt they had not been kept properly informed about
Shandwick's worsening financial performance', said a financier with a close
knowledge of the deteriorating relationship between the firms.
'We think we kept people properly informed', commented Mr Peter Gummer,
Shandwick's founder, who has been giving public relations advice to Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
Three weeks ago, Shandwick's market value more than halved during a single
day when it announced that it expected to make a Pounds 1m loss for the 15
month period to October 31.
However, only six months ago Shandwick was much more optimistic about its
prospects and announced that interim profits had risen by 12 per cent to
Pounds 8.12m.
Shandwick's share price has plummeted from 145p in late November to 43p last
night, wiping more than Pounds 80m off its market capitalisation.
The financier added that the relationship between Shandwick and the City
firms had been difficult for some time. 'There was a history to their
decision to quit,' he said.
A year ago, Mr Gummer came in for intense criticism from shareholders over a
proposal he put forward to sell 2m of his own Shandwick shares to a scheme
for rewarding his employees - or Esop - at 90p a share.
Shareholders felt the Esop should have offered to buy shares from all of
them, not just from Mr Gummer. In the event, Mr Gummer sold 1.25m shares to
the Esop at the lower price of 51p a share.
Mr Gummer, brother of Mr John Gummer, the Conservative cabinet minister,
said he had already found a replacement for Morgan in the form of Lazard
Brothers and expected to appoint a new stockbroker 'within a matter of
days'.
He blamed a worldwide recession for the deterioration in the firm's
financial performance. In order to cope with the drop in business, he had
had to reduce staff numbers by 200 'very recently', out of 2,000 in total.
Shandwick's rivals are all braced for a difficult year, following the rapid
expansion of their industry during the 1980s.
It is understood, however, that Warburg retains confidence in Mr Gummer's
ability to groom its image and is keeping the firm as its own public
relations adviser.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Soaring prices leave Russians in the cold

<TEXT>
A HEAVY snowfall, which emptied Moscow's streets and made those who dared to
venture out all the more vulnerable, seemed an appropriate accompaniment
yesterday to the harshest economic reform Russia has seen in decades.
Instead of the usual crowd of Muscovites scurrying to work with their
ubiquitous shopping bags, just a few people braved the snow, suggesting that
Russia was taking a second day off in addition to the new year public
holiday.
But with authorities and citizens alike braced for the worst as President
Boris Yeltsin freed prices after 74 years of Communist controls, many shops
were closed, allegedly for stocktaking.
If they were open, the state stores were largely empty - either of customers
frightened off by new prices, or of goods because suppliers had not
delivered.
Prices increased by far more than the 100 per cent which the government
predicted for the first month without controls. And it did not release any
extra stocks to help limit the increases.
Lena, an art historian, on her shopping trip stopped first at her local
supermarket, Gastronom number 44, in the same Stalinist skyscraper which
houses the Ukraine Hotel. On offer was champagne at Rbs121 a bottle and lots
of low-grade sausage at Rbs59 a kilo.
Complaining that until recently such sausage cost just Rbs2.20, Lena, who
has been earning Rbs500 a month (close to the average monthly salary) walked
straight out.
Zhenya, a cashier, shrugged her shoulders. 'If nobody buys then I suppose
we'll have to lower the prices,' she said. But her boss, Mr Boris Strukov,
the shop manager, said that January was always a 'bad month' because people
always built up large stocks just before New Year's Eve.
Was Mr Strukov afraid that people could come to turn their shock into anger?
Yes, he said. That was one reason why he no longer stocked vodka, since late
last year a group of angry shoppers had surrounded a truckload of the stuff
demanding that he sell it to them instead of the industrial workers for whom
it had been reserved.
Lena agrees about the importance of the stocks. Although she has a number of
foreign friends with access to well-stocked foreign currency shops, Lena
feels vulnerable because as a member of the 'intelligentsia', she shuns
queues and consequently has few reserve supplies. Nor does she have access
to the supplies available to factories.
Next stop, a bakery in Leningrad Prospekt, a co-operative shop selling her
favourite Georgian bread, turned out to be closed for the holidays. At
another bakery the cheapest white loaves were selling for Rbs1.08, up from
30 kopecks. Lena bought one loaf as a small queue quickly formed behind her.
Then on to the peasant market - where prices have long been high and goods
abundant - for vegetables. But the doors of the covered market near
Profsoyuznaya (Trade Union) Street were also closed, with only pensioners
and other small-time speculators touting items which have been missing from
state shops for months, such as bags of coffee. They cost Rbs140, said one
old lady.
At another supermarket the usually well stocked grocery section was sealed
off. 'The suppliers haven't delivered,' said one assistant.
Only bread was for sale, and a sign said people could not buy more than 2kg
each. Upstairs, shampoo was an astronomical Rbs24. Still, Lena bought a
bottle, ending her first day of market-priced shopping.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Leigh-Pemberton seeks to ease fear of sterling crisis: Bank
rules out early rise in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS of a sterling crisis receded yesterday after Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
governor of the Bank of England, ruled out any immediate move to increase UK
interest rates and insisted that the pound would not be devalued within the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's comments helped the pound to gain strength against a
weaker D-Mark, although in both London and New York the recent rally in
share prices showed signs of fizzling out.
The governor's remarks appear to be part of a concerted effort by the
government to convince the world that the pound will stay within its ERM
bands, damping pressure by currency investors to sell the unit.
Last night in London the pound closed against a weaker D-Mark at DM2.8550,
up 1 3/4 pfennigs on Tuesday's close and roughly 2 1/2 pfennigs above its
effective lower limit in the ERM. In New York it closed at DM2.8533.
The support for sterling by foreign-exchange investors had little influence
on the London stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index shed an early 37-point
gain to finish 0.3 down on Tuesday's close at 2,492.8.
Much of the decline was in reaction to a weak opening on Wall Street,
although the Dow Jones Industrial Average later rallied, closing up 3.58 at
3,172.41.
In thin trading, many big UK institutions failed to provide the buying
pressure necessary for the London market to continue its 4 per cent rise
over the past two weeks, during which prices on Wall Street have increased
by 8 per cent.
In his comments on Channel 4 television, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said sterling
had a 'better tone', and repeated the message earlier this week from Mr John
Major, prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, that devaluation
was not an option. Such a move would be a 'knee-jerk' reaction that could
damage confidence and ruin efforts to stabilise the pound following ERM
entry 15 months ago, he said.
The governor also insisted that the economy was on course to recover. 'We
must keep our nerve,' he said.
The pound has been under pressure since just before Christmas when all the
other ERM members increased interest rates, following Germany's lead. That
has led to speculation that Mr Lamont might be forced to take the
politically unpopular step of increasing borrowing rates in the run-up to
the election and while the economy is still flagging.
Mr Lamont's policies received support yesterday from Mr Terence Higgins,
Tory MP for Worthing and chairman of the Commons Treasury and civil service
select committee. He said the chancellor was right to resist a rise in
interest rates and any realignment of sterling within the ERM.
On currency markets, meanwhile, many dealers remain wary about the prospects
for sterling. While the pound has failed to drift close enough to its lower
limit in the ERM during the past two weeks to ring alarm bells in the
Treasury, more investors might be tempted to sell the unit in favour of
other currencies once trading picks up after the holiday break.

FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY two-way business in the FT-SE futures contract provided the feature of
the derivatives markets yesterday. The March contract on the Footsie, which
has now taken over from December as the active contract, extended the strong
premium achieved on New Year's Eve as two US houses struggled to unwind
substantial positions taken aboard over the Christmas period.
March traded throughout at a substantial premium, which stood at around 65
points at the close, against a 29-point fair value premium, the estimated
level which allows for dividend flows and financing costs. However, the
follow-through in the underlying stocks was disappointing and traders said
the stocks were being sold in late trading.
Traded options were also busy, with the Footsie option taking up much of the
attention. Of the day's total of 26,261 traded contracts, against 22,087 on
Tuesday, 12,252 were FT-SE contracts. Individual share contracts were more
active than last week as traders positioned themselves for the new year
recommendations. Asda headed the list with 2,062 contracts, with its nearest
rival, Hanson, recording 1,595 contracts, and British Airways (1,382) and
BTR (1,169) next.

FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sharp reversal of early share gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHLY volatile session opened the new year in the UK stock market, with
active trading in stock index futures failing towards the close to sustain
the underlying blue chip shares. In early trading the market raced through
the FT-SE 2,500 mark to touch 2,530.8, an area last seen in mid-November.
But London fell into negative territory when Wall Street opened smartly
lower and the final reading showed the Footsie 0.3 off on the day at
2,492.8.
Traders expressed disappointment at the evident unwillingness of the
institutions to support share prices at the higher levels reached over the
thinly traded Christmas period - especially in view of sterling's firmer
performance yesterday. The Christmas advance had been in part spurred by
demand for the Footsie futures contract from two leading US securities
houses, and there were signs of strain between the stock market and the
derivatives sector.
The March futures contract, which took over from the December contract
yesterday, remained at a strong premium to the cash index but the underlying
stocks were sold towards the close of the trading session as Wall Street's
Dow Average opened 18 down following the latest report from US purchasing
managers.
The early spurt put a gain of 37.7 on the Footsie but the later swing in the
market showed up significantly in prices of those stocks traditionally seen
as solid blue chips. SmithKline Beecham, finally a mere few pence higher,
had shown a near 60p gain in the middle of the day.
'This is a worrying trend,' commented Mr Ian Stephenson at Salomon
International. Extreme volatility in relatively light trading volume has
become a factor in the London market, presenting market traders with
significant problems.
Equity turnover was slow at first but speeded up later when share prices
came under pressure. The final total of 457.1m shares compared with 318.1m
for the half session on New Year's Eve.
Equities made little immediate response to assurances from the Governor of
the Bank of England that there was no immediate need to raise interest
rates, although government bond prices rose smartly. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr
Ian Harnett said that economic pessimism had been overdone in the weeks
leading up to Christmas and that the London market was likely to extend its
rally towards Footsie 2,700 ahead of the UK general election which must be
held this year. For the moment, however, equity traders are waiting for the
UK fund managers to show their hands in the London stock market.
At Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, Mr Sushil Wadhwani reiterated the
view that UK equities are undervalued, suggesting that the market could rise
by about 30 per cent this year if the Conservative government is re-elected.
Goldman questions the wisdom of moving from UK equities into government
bonds.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, warned that the rise in German
interest rates and possible setbacks on Wall Street could mean further
downside for UK equities in the near term. However, it believes that
short-run problems should not distract from longer term prospects. Kleinwort
predicts that, on a year's view, UK equities will offer good, real, returns
 -'well ahead of gilts and cash'.

FT  03 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region trades quietly
after closing gains of 1991
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the region was thin yesterday, reflecting a pause after the
closing gains of 1991. Tokyo, New Zealand, Seoul and Taiwan were closed.
AUSTRALIA ended slightly lower after swinging wildly in morning trade. The
All Ordinaries index was 18 points ahead at one stage but closed a net 3.5
off at 1,647.9. Volume at 54.4m shares was the lowest in almost 12 months.
Timber group Bunnings was steady at ADollars 4.00 after Wesfarmers launched
an ADollars 163m takeover bid. Wesfarmers fell 17 cents to ADollars 4.90.
HONG KONG ended slightly higher in the absence of any clear direction. The
Hang Seng index inched up 4.45 to 4,301.78. Most actively traded were Cheung
Kong, up 10 cents at HKDollars 19.80, and HSBC Holdings, unchanged at
HKDollars 35.75. Turnover rose to HKDollars 1bn from Tuesday's HKDollars
910m.
SINGAPORE closed weaker on slight volume, the first decline after six
consecutive gains. The Straits Times Industrial index finished at 1,479.35,
down 11.35 from Tuesday.
KUALA LUMPUR was affected by the absence of buying by the government
investment fund, which has driven prices higher in recent weeks. The
composite index receded 4.06 to 552.16 in volume of 23.3m shares, against
64.7m on Tuesday.
MANILA gained ground in a mood of general market optimism. The composite
index climbed 20.91 to finish at 1,172.78, the highest since it closed at
1,173.59 on May 31.
BANGKOK was disrupted by a computer breakdown whichsharply reduced trading
volume. The SET index closed 0.66 up at 712.02 after turnover of Bt 1.63bn.
JAKARTA ended little changed in very slow trade. The official index eased
0.44 to 246.95. Turnover was a meagre 1.67m shares, against more than 16m on
the last day of trading in 1991.
BOMBAY scored its second successive high on expectations of low
carry-forward charges. The BSE index rose as high as 1,973.59 before
finishing at 1,969.16, up 11.83.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Another lean year predicted for
base metals producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE METALS producers are in for another lean year and aggregate real prices
will in 1992 be no more than 5 per cent above 1986 levels, suggests the
Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group in its latest
quarterly forecast report.
MMRS expects a 'slow and tentative' recovery in economic growth this year so
the rise in base metal consumption will be hesitant until the second half,
it says. 'We doubt if the aggregate increase will exceed 2 per cent over the
year as a whole.'
Therefore the onus will be on metals producers to rein back output in order
to prevent stock/consumption ratios rising considerably further. In 1991
there were voluntary cuts in production in all the main traded metals except
copper, MMRS points out. 'In the coming months cuts will not only have to be
maintained but also have to be added to. Even then we do not expect a
build-up in stocks to be entirely prevented.'
While there might well be a substantial recovery in metals prices, this
'merely reflects present distress.' Year-on-year price increases in 1992
will be 'very modest indeed.'
However, only copper is forecast by MMRS to fall further in price this year.
Average London Metal Exchange cash prices are forecast to be in the
following ranges in 1992: aluminium, 60 cents to 70 cents a lb (60 cents in
1991); copper, 95 to 100 cents a lb (106 cents); lead, 25 to 29 cents (25
cents); nickel, 360 to 380 cents a lb (369 cents); tin, 265 to 276 cents a
lb (249 cents); and zinc, 53 to 57 cents a lb (50-51 cents).
MMRS says forecasting is particularly difficult at present because of the
surge in metal sales from the former eastern bloc countries. This has had a
big impact on prices because so much of the material ended up being highly
visible in London Metal Exchange warehouses.
'Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that these flows will quickly abate.
While the accelerating political break-up of the former Soviet Union makes
any forecasting well nigh impossible, most of the same factors which led to
the massive exports of the past two years, namely domestic demand collapsing
faster than production and the desperate need for foreign exchange, will
remain in place,' says MMRS.
'Neither is metal consumption in countries of eastern Europe likely to pick
up in the short term. East-west trade flows will therefore almost certainly
remain a bearish influence in 1992.'
MMRS suggests all three precious metals are set to claw back some of their
recent price falls in 1992. But in the absence of the external ingredients
for a bull market, investor interest will be slow to be rekindled. Price
gains are likely to be modest. It forecasts gold will average between
Dollars 350 and Dollars 400 a troy ounce in 1992 (Dollars 360 and Dollars
365 in 1991); platinum will average Dollars 370 to Dollars 410 a troy ounce
(Dollars 370-Dollars 380); and silver will average Dollars Dollars
4.25-Dollars 4.75 a troy ounce (Dollars 4.03-4.07).

costs rapidly

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JUERGEN WEBER, the chief executive of Lufthansa, warned employees
yesterday that the German airline would have to bring its costs down rapidly
to avoid 'bitter consequences' from the competition. 'Lufthansa operates too
expensively, expenditure is above income,' he said.
He added that the airline also had some catching up to do in the area of
service. 'Our customer service systems are by no means 'state of the art'.'
The airline has already said that it would make an operating loss in 1991 as
a result of poor business in the first quarter when the industry was hit by
the Gulf war. Subsequent profits were not enough to offset the loss in the
first three months, so that the nine months result showed a pre-tax loss of
DM159m (Dollars 99m).
Lufthansa will offset last year's loss through aircraft sales and transfers
from reserves. Mr Weber said it was small comfort that 1991 was a bad year
for all airlines and that Lufthansa had done better than most of its
European competition. 'Our reserves are not meant to be used as a
comfortable cushion; they will be quickly used up,' he said.
The airline, which is 52 per cent state-owned, has been bringing in new
productivity measures such as improved communications and data processing
systems. It is also streamlining its management structure. Among steps taken
to upgrade services was the introduction of an automatic ticketing system at
Frankfurt last year.

<TEXT>
BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), Portugal's fastest growing private bank,
and Banco Popular Espanol of Spain have joined forces to launch a new bank
in France to be named Banco Popular Comercial (BPC).
In a separate move, BCP also plans to launch this year a new housing finance
bank in Portugal in association with Cariplo, Italy's state-owned savings
bank and its largest financial institution.
Both moves are designed to deepen the Portuguese bank's internationalisation
ahead of January 1993 when the European Community's financial markets will
be fully open, said Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP president. BCP already
has reciprocal crossholdings of 1.5 per cent with Banco Popular and Cariplo.
The two new banks will both be owned equally by BCP and each of its foreign
partners, although in the case of the bank in France, one of the two
partners' shareholding will be a fraction of a per cent higher to conform
with French banking requirements for a majority shareholder. BPC's initial
capital will be FFr400m (Dollars 77m), and it will be presided over in turn
by the two shareholding institutions.
The bank will function through Banco Popular's 18 branches in France. It
will aim to attract French private and corporate customers interested in the
Iberian market, and to provide financial services for Portuguese and Spanish
companies active in France.
The new housing finance bank will be owned equally by BCP and Cariplo which
recently formed a joint real estate leasing company.
In the past two years, BCP has pursued a policy of establishing links with
foreign banks as a way to gradually strengthen its international presence
and activities. 'I don't believe a Portuguese bank can succeed on its own
abroad. Portugal has neither the tradition nor the financial power to do
this,' Mr Goncalves said.

WESFARMERS, the Western Australian farming and commodities group, yesterday
announced a ADollars 163m (USDollars 124m) hostile bid for Bunnings, a
timber, hardware and metal products company in which it has a 19.9 per cent
stake.
The offer follows indications that BTR of the UK is seeking to dispose of a
24.6 per cent stake in Bunnings acquired as part of its recent Pounds 1.5bn
takeover of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group.
Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said the offer price valued the company
at only 10 times forecast profits in the current year.
The success of the offer is likely to be decided by the attitude of three
shareholder groups - BTR, the Bunning family and other directors, who hold
24 per cent, and the AMP Society, with 10 per cent.

FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe tussle dents
Parretti's pride - How the end of the year turned sour for the Italian
financier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To say that 1991 ended badly for Mr Giancarlo Parretti would be an
understatement.
With the panettone still fresh on the cake-stand, the 50-year-old Italian
financier was arrested in Italy on December 27, supposedly on charges of tax
evasion. Instead of boarding a flight to Tunisia, Mr Parretti was taken into
police custody at Rome's Ciampino airport and subsequently transported to
Sicily for questioning.
That was only the beginning. Less than a week later, on December 30, a US
judge awarded continuing control of MGM-Pathe Communications, the Hollywood
film company which Mr Parretti acquired in 1990, to his bankers, Credit
Lyonnais Bank Nederland (CLBN).
This ruling, which was backed up by 89 pages of damning commentary,
represented the culmination of a complex legal battle between the Italian
businessman and the French-owned bank over control of the studio. In the way
of US court actions, hearings had begun as long ago as August.
Not surprisingly, the Credit Lyonnais camp has been cock-a-hoop. 'We intend
to see that the lion roars again,' was the formal comment from Mr Alan Ladd,
the MGM chairman installed at the behest of CLBN last year, although the
studio made a Dollars 159.9m net loss in the first half of 1991 and there
has been talk of negative cash flow of about Dollars 200m for 1991 overall.
More unexpected, perhaps, was the response from Mr Parretti's public
relations people. As 1991 died, out came a release describing the ruling as
'unfortunate', and the court action as 'lamentable'. More pertinently, it
suggested that a 'lender liability suit', counter-filed against CLBN in the
Los Angeles courts, would still be pursued.
In truth, however, the December 30 ruling by Mr William Allen, the Court
Chancellor, has shed little glory on anyone. At the heart of the Delaware
legal battle has been a 'corporate governance' agreement which CLBN obliged
Mr Parretti to accept last spring, after the heavily-leveraged acquisition
of MGM turned into a financial disaster. The bankers hoped that the
agreement would effectively insulate the company from Mr Parretti's
interference.
That proved over-optimistic. In the court action, CLBN - together with its
various management appointees, including Mr Ladd - claimed that Mr
Parretti's behaviour and repeated violations of the agreement entitled it to
change directors and wrest control. Mr Parretti, by contrast, argued that
the bank manipulated him and MGM into a precarious situation, with the very
intention of seizing the reins.
Not only did Chancellor Allen side with CLBN, but he did so in unequivocal
terms, repeatedly dismissing Mr Parretti's testimony as untrue. 'I have been
forced to conclude,' he declared at the beginning of his judgment, 'that
defendants' principal witness, Giancarlo Parretti, did not give truthful
testimony when he testified under oath in this court.' Justifications for
this assertion are numerous.
Indeed, the Chancellor even goes on to quote - and give credence - to a
conversation between Mr Parretti and Mr Charles Meeker, a Los Angeles lawyer
brought in by CLBN as president of MGM. Mr Parretti, Mr Meeker claimed,
threatened him along the lines of 'You have to understand. I am crazy . . .
I want you to understand, Meeker, that I am crazy . . . I want you to
understand that I am really dangerous. I am very dangerous.'
That said, Chancellor Allen also makes clear how speedily doomed the MGM
acquisition was - with a cash crisis descending 'almost immediately' - and
how wantonly exposed CLBN became. He is not required to explore why a
subsidiary of a leading bank arrived at this position without ensuring
sufficient controls, but the question hangs in the air throughout his
ruling.
Finally, the Delaware judgment cuts through some of the claims and
counter-claims over where financing for the MGM deal was eventually secured.
If nothing else, this was the height of financial ingenuity. Chancellor
Allen's description of the funding as 'Byzantine' barely does it credit.

FT  03 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Strong results in US
securities
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US securities industry's strong financial performance in 1991 has been
underlined by figures showing that New York Stock Exchange member firms
reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 824m in the third quarter of the
year, compared with a loss of Dollars 124m a year before.
The third quarter performance took place against a background of keen
investor involvement in securities trading as US interest rates continued to
fall.
In the third quarter of 1990, the market was plagued by uncertainty
surrounding the Gulf crisis.
The figures cover NYSE member firms that do business with the public, rather
than specialist market makers. The underlying 1991 quarterly performance was
even better than the figures suggest because they include a one-time Dollars
200m pre-tax provision by Salomon Brothers for potential liability from its
Treasury auction rigging scandal.
The 322 firms covered by the figures saw revenues rise to Dollars 15.25bn,
up 16.5 per cent, from the Dollars 13.01bn in the third quarter of 1990.
Second quarter 1991 revenues totalled Dollars 14.85bn and after tax profits
were Dollars 859m.
Profits in the third quarter represented an 8.9 per cent annual return on
member firms' average net worth of Dollars 37.95bn during the period.

BETWEEN SKr20bn (Dollars 3.6bn) and SKr30bn net of Swedish corporate stock
is likely to be bought by foreign investors in 1992, according to estimates
by the country's shareholders' association.
This is the expected result of a change in Swedish law which came into force
this week, enabling foreigners to buy without prior government permission an
unlimited number of Swedish shares.
Under legislation enacted in 1916 foreigners were not allowed to acquire
voting shares or equity in Swedish companies without permission from the
public authorities every time the purchase exceeded 10, 20, 40 or 50 per
cent of the company's shares.
The reform promises to increase foreign interest in Swedish shares. This
will be helped by the sell-off of Swedish state-owned companies due to start
this year.
The reform, however, does not mean the end of the country's two tier system
of free and restricted A and B shares. These enable Swedish shareholders -
such as the powerful Wallenberg dynasty - to maintain control of companies
by owning a substantial slice of the voting shares but only a small portion
of the total equity. Any change must await agreement on European Community
company law.

sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAIRD Group, the waste management company, has sold, for a total of Pounds
6.17m, a large part of its dry waste division to Cleanaway, the UK operation
of Brambles Industries, the Sydney-based transport and freight group.
Mr John Ashton, Caird chairman, said that the disposal was the latest step
in the company's strategy to concentrate on its core landfill and hazardous
waste treatment businesses.
This strategy was initiated in the face of the Pounds 78m hostile, but
eventually lapsed, bid in September 1990 from Severn Trent, the privatised
water company.
The disposed businesses consist of the English dry waste collection
activities but exclude the operation at Barrow, which is to be sold
separately.
In the 11 months to November 30, the businesses that Cleanaway is buying
made operating profits of Pounds 475,000 on revenues of Pounds 7.18m. The
consideration consists of a Pounds 5.42m cash payment and a further
estimated Pounds 745,000 after Caird has collected debts and paid off
outstanding amounts.

FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Something profitable to sing about for
burly chassis maker - James Abbott on Trinity Holdings' ascendance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES ABBOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS LIFE is looking rosy for Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman and chief
executive of Trinity Holdings, which manufactures fire engines, buses and
other commercial vehicles.
On December 20 the Ministry of Defence confirmed a Pounds 5m order for 147
chassis for troop buses, won against fierce competition from international
manufacturers such as Volvo.
For Trinity, the deal capped a good year, the third since Mr Hollyhead and
his fellow managers bought the company for Pounds 26m, with the support of a
syndicate of eight banks led by Bankers Trust Citicorp. The managers own 51
per cent of the equity, the banks the rest.
Trinity was formerly the engineering division of Hestair, which sold it to
concentrate on its employment bureaux. However, that business turned sour
and Hestair was bought by BET, the business services conglomerate.
In contrast, Trinity has gone from strength to strength. Turnover is up from
Pounds 55m in the last year under Hestair to Pounds 90m in 1991. Pre-tax
profits have risen from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 5.5m.
Trinity has been toasting the new year with its fattest-ever order book: it
has taken Pounds 45m-worth of orders in the last four months.
This growth has been achieved in the face of markets which are either
stagnant or declining. Trinity's products are hardly the stuff of quick-buck
salesmanship; behind the growth lies a knack for accurate assessment of the
needs of its target markets.
Typical of these products is the Dart midibus, produced under the Dennis
marque. Developed in the last months of Hestair ownership by the team that
was to buy Trinity, the Dart fulfilled a need in the competitive UK bus
market.
Bus operators had set up new routes in the mid-1980s which penetrated
housing estates and ran at increased frequencies. Many of these routes were
worked by minibuses made from van chassis with bus coachwork. In many cases
these vehicles were not up to the rigours of bus operation - on some routes
in London, brakes had to be replaced after just three days.
'The smallest feasible, big bus is what people wanted,' says Mr Steve Brown,
engineering director. This thinking resulted in the Dart: a short wheelbase
chassis that is highly manoeuvrable, but built to the same exacting
standards as a traditional bus.
The Dart has proved extremely successful: more than 400 have been sold to
London alone.
The Dart has helped Dennis become one of the top sellers of bus chassis in
the UK, and the company has recently begun marketing in the Benelux
countries.
While Dennis has long sold buses to Hong Kong and other east Asian markets,
this is the first foray into the fiercely competitive European bus market.
The same prescription of carefully tailoring to the market's needs has been
applied to fire engines and dustcarts. Larger rivals adapt truck chassis for
these purposes, which leads to second-best solutions.
By contrast, Trinity purpose builds for these specialist markets. For
instance the Rapier, Dennis' new fire engine, has a wheelbase designed to
accommodate the water tanks and give an appropriate centre of gravity. 'It
handles like a Ferrari,' boasts Mr Hollyhead.
These products are also being pushed into Europe. Sales there of 120
dustcarts over the past few years have kept output up in the face of a 40
per cent drop in domestic demand following the contracting-out of local
government services.
While strict attention to market needs has been winning orders in the UK and
abroad, careful housekeeping at home has led to improved results on the
bottom line.
Better inventory control, for instance, has cut stocks from Pounds 14m to
Pounds 9m, while debt and credit control has also been improved. 'It's
marvellous how one's mind is focused when it's your own money,' says Mr
Hollyhead.
In a deftly timed asset disposal in summer 1989, Trinity sold its Duple
coach name, along with jigs and drawings, to Plaxton for Pounds 4m. 'Another
three months and we'd have had to shut it anyway,' says Mr Hollyhead.
While Plaxton has hit financial trouble, Trinity has been able to redevelop
the Duple site at Blackpool; altogether, getting rid of Duple will have
raised about Pounds 11m.
Much of this has been spent on a new Pounds 10m bus chassis and fire engine
factory at Guildford, Surrey.
With a continuing strong flow of orders backing his optimism, Mr Hollyhead
expects Trinity to be in a position to repay by the end of 1993 all its
borrowings, which currently stand at Pounds 8m.

FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ferranti offshoot files for Chapter 11
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI Healthcare Systems Corporation, a US subsidiary of the UK
electronics group, has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code.
The step was taken by the Maryland-based company, which is involved in
management services for hospitals, to allow it to carry on trading while
dealing with certain problem contracts, Ferranti said.
Healthcare Systems Corporation was formed when Ferranti acquired the
healthcare systems division of Pentamation, a US systems company, for
Dollars 16m (Pounds 8.7m) early in 1988.
In the last financial year, it incurred an operating loss of Pounds 3.9m on
turnover of Pounds 5.4m, consuming about Pounds 2.5m cash over the period.
Before its acquisition, the Pentamation division posted turnover of Dollars
18m.
The problems centre on one unprofitable contract in the US. Although the
healthcare business in the US, which provides computer data centres and
individual systems to hospitals and surgeries, has suffered during the
recession, Ferranti said it did not intend pulling out of the market,
'When you are in the state that Ferranti is, in funding to the tune of
Pounds 2.5m to support a company that is making a loss of Pounds 3.9m, you
have to take remedial action,' the group said.
The parent company has been through a rocky period following the revelation
two years ago of a Pounds 215m fraud in International Signal and Control
Group, its US defence subsidiary, during which it has had to reduce
substantial bank borrowings. In the six months to September 30 it incurred
losses of Pounds 28.8m while assets fell from Pounds 190m to Pounds 98.8m.

FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: US drug approval for SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the drug company, has secured its first US drug approval
since it was formed in 1989 by the merger of SmithKline Beckman of the US
and Beecham of the UK.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved Relifen, the company's
arthritis drug, giving SmithKline access to the US non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) market worth about Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds
930m) a year.
This class of drugs is used to treat severe arthritis, especially rheumatoid
arthritis and osteo-arthritis. Current market leaders are made by Ciba-Geigy
of Switzerland and Syntex of the US.
Approval for Relifen was expected following the recommendation of the
advisory committee to the FDA in early December. The speed of approval
surprised even SmithKline. 'We didn't expect it for another few weeks.'
There will be a formal US launch before the end of January when the US
price, which will partly determine the profitability of the drug, will be
revealed. In the UK a year's supply costs Pounds 102.
Mr Jonathan de Pass, an analyst at BZW, estimated that US sales of Relifen
in the first year would be at least Dollars 200m.
SmithKline shares leapt 6 per cent before profit taking and concerns over a
US medical report that some ulcer drugs should not be taken with alcohol
left the price only slightly higher on the day.
SmithKline makes Tagamet, the world's second best-selling ulcer drug. Shares
in Glaxo, which makes Zantac, the best seller, dropped 15p to 838p.
Wellcome's Aids treatment Retrovir, or AZT, received its second boost in a
week yesterday from Aids researchers. They have found evidence that when
Retrovir is used in combination with ddC, made by Roche, the Swiss drug
company, there was an increase in the level of white blood cells which are
crucial in fighting the Aids virus.
Wellcome shares climbed 24p to 1125p.
The news comes after research findings that suggested that a mixture of
Retrovir and Zovirax, Wellcome's other big selling drug, did well against
Aids.

FT  03 JAN 92 / The storm abates for UK property: Vanessa Houlder reports on
claims that values will soon recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years, a hurricane has raged in the UK commercial property
market. Some Pounds 70bn - more than a quarter of the total - has been
knocked off the value of shops, offices, factories and warehouses around the
country.
Now the storm may be abating. 'The property market appears to have reached
its turning point,' says Hillier Parker, a firm of chartered surveyors which
continually monitors the mood of the market.
'The investment market is improving faster than expected,' says another
surveyor, Savills Commercial. 'The sharpest positive movements in the IPD
Monthly Index since October 1989 suggests a return of investor confidence,'
says the Investment Property Databank, a research company.
Bargain hunters are sifting potential acquisitions. 'Conditions like these
come round once or twice in a generation,' says Mr Matthew Oakeshott, a
director of OLIM, a fund management group.
But confidence is fragile. For every bull, there is a bear; and even
optimists qualify their enthusiasm with caveats about the importance of
selecting the right location and tenant. While pockets of retail and
industrial property are looking robust, values of Central London offices are
still falling fast.
The bulls' case rests on the level of property yields, the ratio of annual
income to capital value, which have reached record heights over the past
couple of years. When compared with yields of less than two-thirds their
current level in the early 1980s, this can be interpreted to mean that
property is very cheap. Buyers are further encouraged by signs that yields
have started to fall in the autumn, reflecting the reduction in interest
rates and an improvement in investor confidence.
But those expecting a cyclical rebound may be disappointed. Some
commentators wonder whether the market will ever be quite the same again.
Mr Geoff Marsh, head of Applied Property Research, a research company,
believes that the market is undergoing a fundamental restructuring. 'This is
not a conventional cycle,' he says.
Indeed, the very elevation of yields suggests that the market is in
uncharted territory. For the first time in 30 years, property yields are
converging with long dated gilt yields, according to the Investment Property
Databank.
This is a throwback to the years before inflation became a threat to
investors. In those days, gilts traded at lower yields than property,
because they carried less risk.
Once inflation became a way of life, property became a better bet than gilts
because it held out the prospect of real rental growth.
Now, as in the pre-inflation era, property yields are converging with those
of gilts. This suggests that the prospects of rental growth for property are
barely enough to compensate for the risks, management effort and maintenance
costs of holding property.
In part, it reflects waning support from property's traditional supporters,
the UK institutions. Property, which used to be discussed in the same breath
as equities and gilts, became less important during the 1980s. Disillusioned
with the relatively poor performance of property, fund managers shifted
money into the new option, international equities.
The crash of the last two years has further undermined property's
traditional virtues, stability and counter-cyclical performance. The
difference between the property crash and the equity crash of 1987 was its
extended nature rather than its severity. And far from being
counter-cyclical, the peak of the property market in August 1988 coincided
with the high point of the economic boom.
But the main reason for high yields is visible to anybody who looks out of a
window, especially in London. The surge in construction in the late 1980s,
combined with the recession, has left thousands of 'To Let' boards outside
shops and offices. In the City of London, one of the worst affected markets,
nearly one in five offices is empty.
This surplus space is giving new power to tenants, after decades in which
landlords have dictated terms. The 25-year lease, with upward-only increases
in rents every five years, is seen as restrictive by many large tenants, who
would favour an opportunity to break a lease at 10 or 15 years. 'The only
real way to set a rent is when both parties can walk away from each other,'
says Mr Mike Ruddell, who is head of property at Boots the Chemist.
It may be that this shift in the balance between tenant and landlord lasts
only as long as the surplus space remains on the market. If, however,
shorter leases are here to stay, it will change the nature of property
investment. Instead of tucking away a property like a bond, investors will
need to woo tenants and manage their property more actively to maintain its
value.
Skilled landlords may be able to preserve their rental income, but the
reduced security of the investment will force an increase in yields. In a
recent survey by Chesterton, the chartered surveyors, Japanese investors
believed that yields should increase by at least 1.5 per cent to compensate
for the reduction in a lease from 25 years to 10 years.
Another source of pressure on values is the imbalance between buyers and
sellers. An enormous amount of property needs to find a buyer over the next
few years, if the Pounds 40bn of loans outstanding to the UK property sector
is any guide.
At present, it is not clear where the demand will come from. Many potential
buyers, such as property companies and Japanese investors have retreated,
although their place has been partly filled by new buyers, particularly from
continental Europe. Furthermore, the UK institutions, led by the Scottish
funds, are gradually going back into the market, particularly for retail and
industrial developments.
But it is hard to see the institutions rescuing the over-borrowed property
industry as they did in the last serious property crash.
'In similar circumstances in 1974, pension funds and insurance companies
stepped in to fill the gap. Twenty years later institutional demand for
property assets is no longer so fresh and the size of the problem is a far
greater challenge,' according to Debenham Tewson, chartered surveyors.
The twin depressants of poor investment demand and poor occupier demand will
probably continue to dog the market next year. One forecast by brokers BZW
(who are among the most bearish analysts) suggests that capital values will
fall by another 6 per cent in 1992.
The pessimists believe that a slight hardening of yields will fail to
compensate for a fall in average rents. Economic recovery will not
necessarily feed swiftly into enhanced demand: after the last recession it
took at least four years for a recovery in rents.
So it is premature to call the turn for the property market as a whole. But
this does not mean that individual property buyers are wrong. Both the
difficulty of acquiring good property in a rising market and the different
prospects of various parts of the market make it worth sorting the wheat
from the chaff.
There is a world of difference between a high yielding building let on an
inexpensive rent on a long lease to a financially strong tenant, and an old
fashioned, poorly located building with a financially-stretched tenant.
The best properties, with good, secure income, are in high demand. For
example, industrial property, which commands a high yield, actually rose in
value in 1991. The snag is that this rise in value only applies to a small
proportion of the property market: perhaps as little as 15 per cent of the
typical portfolio, estimates BZW.
That excludes a lot of buildings: old buildings which do not meet the needs
of modern businesses; or new buildings in obscure places which may never
find a tenant.
Even if the eye of the property hurricane has passed, dark clouds still hang
over much of the market.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Sears sells last US business for Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the UK retailing group, yesterday announced the disposal of its last
remaining interest in the US and reported a 'very good start' to its sales
season in the UK.
The company has sold Miss Erika, its US women's fashion wholesaling
business, at book value for Pounds 22m in cash. Miss Erika has been bought
by a group of investors including members of the management team.
The company, which sells to more than 3,000 retailers in the US, made
operating profits of about Pounds 5.9m in 1990-91 although it has
encountered worse trading conditions in the current year in the face of the
severe US retail recession.
Sears has been steadily pursuing a policy of disposing of peripheral assets
to concentrate on its core European retailing interests.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said: 'We have been planning to sell
Miss Erika for the past 18 months. The business depends on only three people
and there was a lot of capital tied up in it. We wanted to put the money
into areas where we could sleep at night.'
Sears is not planning any further disposals apart from the Galliford
housebuilding business.
Commenting on current trade, Mr Maitland Smith said the first three days of
the New Year sales had been better than expected. But he warned: 'I think
when you get a strong start it peters out very quickly. People may have
worked out what they wanted to buy beforehand and have gone out and done
it.'
He said women's fashion and men's suits had been selling well, although
areas such as furniture had remained depressed. 'As for Scotland it's as if
there is no recession,' he added.
He said Sears' sales in the run-up to Christmas had been running about 2 per
cent to 3 per cent higher and that the company had achieved better margins
than a year ago. 'Christmas was very late to come and was not bad but we are
comparing it with a miserable time last year,' he said.
Mail order sales had been particularly good in London, he said, perhaps
reflecting fear of incendiary devices in high street stores.
However, he foresaw no quick upturn in consumer confidence in 1992 and
expressed concern about business levels after the seasonal sales had
finished.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Zale may be forced into Chapter 11

<TEXT>
ZALE CORPORATION, the largest retail jeweller in the US, said yesterday that
it was studying a bankruptcy petition filed on Wednesday night by
bondholders, but believed that an out-of-court reorganisation was in
everyone's best interests.
The heavily-indebted company, based in Dallas although owned jointly by
Peoples Jewellers in Toronto and Zurich-based Swarovski International
Holding, has already defaulted on a Dollars 52m (Pounds 27.8m) interest
payment on its junk bonds.
The subsequent 30-day 'grace period', in which payment could still be made,
was due to expire yesterday.
On Wednesday night, some of the ailing company's bondholders pre-empted the
final default, by filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition with the Texas
courts.
The action, which was led by Barre &amp; Company, the Dallas-based investment
firm, forces Zale either to contest the bankruptcy petition in the courts,
or to accede to the bondholders' demand and seek protection under Chapter 11
of the US bankruptcy code.
Yesterday, Zale said it was still studying the situation, although it
described the petition as 'unfortunate'.
It claimed, however, that a co-operative agreement between the various
interest groups was 'in the best interests of all parties', and that an
out-of-court restructuring would be the speediest and most efficient
solution.
The company, which technically has several weeks in which to respond to the
bankruptcy filing, added that no date for a court hearing had yet been set.
Earlier this week, Zale offered outlines of a reorganisation scheme, when it
announced plans to close 400 of its 2,000 stores, together with a
'downsizing and cost reduction' plan at its corporate headquarters.
The company also announced that it was halting all debt payments.
Part of the problem at Zale, which has been suffering heavy losses recently,
derives from hefty debts taken on when the company was acquired by Peoples
Jewellers and Swarovski in 1986.
Further debt was then issued, with the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert, when
Zale bought out the rival Gordon jewellery retail chain, in the late-1980s.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Price stability, Shakespeare and the life of the
gold standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M. OPPENHEIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Walter Eltis ('Sound money - a Dutch treat', December 30) reminds us of
the price stability achieved by Britain under the Gold Standard from 1711 to
1931. He does not, however, tell the whole story.
For one thing, price stability preceded establishment of the gold standard
by at least a century. The crisis of 1695 which Eltis describes was an
interruption to monetary stability just like the French Revolutionary and
Napoleonic wars a century later or the world wars this century.
In Shakespeare's Henry IV, part 1, written (probably) in 1597 when the
inflation of the 16th century had ended, Falstaff incurs the following bill
for refreshments at the Boar's Head tavern: 'Item, a capon, 2s 2d; Item,
sauce, 4d; Item, sack, two gallons, 5s 8d; Item, anchovies and sack after
supper, 2s 6d; Item, bread, a halfpenny'.
Even ignoring the fact that a halfpenny of bread was meant as a joke ('O
monstrous] but one halfpennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of
sack]'), these numbers would have been familiar to London office workers in
the mid-1950s, when the cost of a standard restaurant lunch was 5 shillings.
Second, in the 19th century the monetary expansion required by economic
growth would never have come about if money stocks had been tied to the
availability of gold reserves. What saved the day was financial innovation
in the form of banking development which allowed continuous diminution in
the ratio of gold to national money supply.
The gold standard was an excellent institution, but its long preservation
was as much a result of price stability as a cause of it.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Chancellor is right to reject the quick fix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HOWELL MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The voices from the backbenches and elsewhere calling for an economic
quick fix, exemplify the reasons why, for too much of the post-second world
war period, the pound has been a weak and suspect currency.
How right the chancellor is to reject all the special pleading, however it
is dressed up. He is right, too, that an attempt at unilateral realignment
now, even if it were possible, would probably lead to higher interest rates,
more misery and still slower recovery, as well as to immense and lasting
longer-term damage.
But how much better still it would now be if monetary and exchange rate
policies were handled by an independent central monetary authority (although
obviously with an ultimate political override). It would then be understood
by markets beyond doubt that these matters were, to a degree, insulated from
short-term political panics and pressures.
An extra blessing would be to obviate the need for newspapers to trawl
around for the opinions of lesser political fry over holiday periods, or to
endow these opinions with any significance beyond their own minute worth.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: No position for an unqualified assertion on pensions
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL ELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have not suggested, as Bryn Davies (Letters, December 30) implies,
that in the Barber case the European Court of Justice changed the law as
opposed to interpreting Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome.
The court did, however, conclude that with limited exceptions 'the direct
effect of Article 119 of the Treaty may not be relied upon in order to claim
entitlement to a pension with effect from a date prior to that of this
judgment' (May 17 1990).
Although - indeed because - these words are open to further interpretation
by the European Court, I certainly maintain my view that Mr Davies is not in
a position to make the unqualified assertion that the Maastricht protocol
takes away the right of employees to equal pensions from the time when the
UK acceded to the treaty (January 1 1973).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER MINTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'An honourable case for change' (December 30), attempts to
justify an abolition of the hereditary principle within the House of Lords
on the basis that it would remove a great deal of snobbery from the UK.
As anyone who has lived and worked in either France or Germany realises,
social snobbery is not the prerogative of England alone. The very fact that
no new peers are created on the Continent (with the exception of the
Vatican) means that in many circles titles are regarded with a kind of awe
due to that which is unobtainable. The difference between the continentals'
fascination with aristocracy and our own is primarily that, in England, it
is continually discussed and deplored by newspaper editors.
As far as hereditary privilege being undemocratic, what could be more
Athenian than to have an element of the legislature selected purely on the
basis of accident of birth?

FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Banking on a real demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY HYMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May a retailer express a view about the letter from Mr John Saunders
(Letters, December 21), National Westminster Bank Professor of Marketing at
Loughborough University Business School, who talks of the 'unholy trinity of
church, unions and retailers'.
Trading on Sundays may well bring greater convenience to customers in
certain fields, such as DIY, furniture and local neighbourhood services.
There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the public is crying out for
a seventh day on which to purchase food or clothing.
When the law is rationalised, as it surely will be, some of us who will not
contravene current UK legislation may wish to ease congestion and assist
customers by opening on the occasional Sunday. I would suggest, however,
that in view of his title, Mr Saunders might like, as a first priority, to
point up the archaic and arbitrary nature of bank opening hours. It would be
infinitely more helpful to the nation if banks opened for a whole working
day on five, or, perish the thought, six days a week.
Now that would be meeting a real demand, as opposed to the fanciful one that
shoppers are stampeding to Sunday trading venues.

</HEADLINE>

   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chancellor ('Ingredients for recovery are in place', December 31),
was quite right, of course, to set his face against a sterling devaluation
and its consequences.
'Never again]' should be Britain's watchword.
But how about a revaluation of the D-Mark against all other currencies,
sterling included, none of which would therefore be singled out for special
treatment and be made to feel humiliated?
The consequences here, by both helping the D-Mark to regain price stability
(after the added strains of German monetary union) and taking some of the
pressure off its partners, could be beneficial to all concerned.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Progress in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa starts the new year on a hopeful note. Progress in
constitutional talks, coupled with tentative moves towards an interim
government, represents the most important step in the country's transition
to democracy since the release of Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National
Congress (ANC) leader, nearly two years ago.
The agreement on a set of constitutional principles, endorsed by delegates
attending the inaugural session of the Convention on a Democratic South
Africa (Codesa), is in itself encouraging. While the principles adopted are
taken for granted in western democracies, they represent a revolutionary
change for South Africa, incorporating as they do commitments to an adult
franchise and a multi-party system, a bill of rights and an independent
judiciary.
But equally significant were the efforts to find common ground for the
management of South Africa's transition to democracy. In an historic
recognition of black political rights, President FW de Klerk offered black
South Africans seats in the country's parliament as a step towards what he
called the 'expeditious' creation of 'a government that is broadly
representative of the people'.
He also agreed that proposals for new legislation drawn up at Codesa and
approved by consensus would be implemented by the current parliament, where
the ruling National Party has a comfortable majority. Given that the working
definition of consensus is the joint approval of delegates from the National
Party and the ANC, the government can exercise a veto.
Important concession
Nevertheless, it represents an important concession. It marks an
acknowledgment that effective power is shifting from parliament to the
convention, attended by 19 parties covering most of the political spectrum,
with representatives from all races.
Taken together, the moves could form the basis for the resolution of two key
ANC demands: the creation of an interim government, and the election of a
constituent assembly to draw up the new constitution. Even though the two
sides differ on its duration - government envisages five years or longer,
the ANC no more than 18 months - the framework for a transitional
administration is taking shape.
Formidable problems remain, however. Hopes for an end to political violence
have been set back by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's refusal to attend the
opening session of Codesa, although his mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party
was represented. Chief Buthelezi has no significant support beyond his
ethnic base, but his capacity to play a spoiling role is considerable.
Potent force
Meanwhile, the extreme white right wing is a force to be reckoned with.
There will not be another general election under the current constitution,
and, in theory, the promised referendum seeking approval for a new one need
not be held before 1994. But the pace of change is such that Mr de Klerk may
feel obliged to test white opinion well before then.
Failure to do so could increase the danger that extremists, convinced that
they reflect the views of a majority of whites, will be tempted to mount a
violent last ditch resistance to change.
But perhaps the most difficult hurdle is in the constitutional arena.
For all the progress on principles, a fundamental divide has yet to be
bridged. There is nothing in the ANC's public position which suggests that
it is prepared to accept a system short of conventional majority rule. Mr de
Klerk, on the other hand, has made it clear that he expects proportional
representation in parliament to extend to an entrenched role for the
National Party in the executive arm of government.
Underlying these issues is the depressed state of the economy marked by
rising unemployment and a growing crime wave which exacerbate political
tensions.
Given the complexity of their problem, South Africa's leaders have made
remarkable progress. But the next steps on the road to democracy may prove
to be the most difficult.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Whenever on Sundays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by some supermarket chains to open their larger stores on this
and subsequent Sundays into the new year presents the British government
with an awkward dilemma. Widespread Sunday opening of shops flourished in
the run-up to Christmas, contravening the Shops Act 1950 which makes it a
criminal offence to sell most non-perishable goods on Sunday in England and
Wales. Ministers hoped that that this law-breaking would die away at the end
of the festive season, allowing them to shelve the divisive issue of
reforming the shop hours legislation until after the general election. Those
hopes have now been dashed, however, and the government must act to avoid
condoning illegal behaviour by the large store groups.
The preferred option must be to decriminalise Sunday trading - as has
already happened in Scotland without damage to the social fabric. There are
more important tasks for the courts than enforcing laws which permit the
sale of pornography on the Sabbath yet threaten a Pounds 1,000 fine for
anyone who sells a Bible.
The most immediate argument in favour of repealing the law on Sunday trading
is one of convenience for the customer. Most adults now work from Monday to
Friday, yet they are compelled to join a scrummage on Saturdays to procure
the staff of life. Shops should be free to open on the days of the week
which are most convenient for customers.
Lower prices
That Saturday scrummage indicates a second benefit from seven-day trading:
more efficient use of capital in retailing. If all shops opened on Sunday,
the short-term effect of opening for an extra day would be higher costs. But
in the longer term, spreading the shopping currently done in six days over
seven will require fewer shops. If retail space is reduced, this should mean
lower prices.
Nor can it be assumed that the sole effect of Sunday trading will be to
time-shift the current volume of shopping. Record shops and DIY superstores
have long known that opening on Sunday brings in customers who will find
something else to spend their money on if they cannot go shopping.
While the arguments are strong in favour of legalising Sunday trading, this
cannot be achieved simply by turning a blind eye to flagrant law-breaking.
The current confusion arises from doubts over the validity of the Shops Act
1950 following a series of judgments by the European Court. The Act appears
to conflict with article 30 of the Treaty of Rome which covers free trade
within the EC, and Britain's Law Lords have sought clarification from the
Court on the complicated rulings. But until clarification is given, Sunday
trading remains illegal.
'Bizarre' legislation
Those retailers who have exploited the confusion to flout the law deserve
opprobrium. But it is the government which must enforce or reform
legislation which the prime minister has described as 'bizarre'. If the
government wants to retain the law, it should ensure that it is obeyed - and
fines which are too low to deter should be raised. Instead, the buck has
been passed to the local authorities which dare not seek injunctions to stop
Sunday opening for fear that they will have to pay compensation for loss of
earnings.
Much better for the law to be repealed, perhaps with safeguards for those
who work in shops. But it is unrealistic to hope - as ministers do - that a
compromise can be found acceptable to supporters and opponents of Sunday
trading.
The government fears that reform would suffer the fate of an earlier attempt
to liberalise shop hours, which was wrecked in 1986 by an alliance of
sabbatarians and the shop workers' unions. But a quick bill could be passed
through parliament before the special interest groups had set their word
processors to work. And with the imminent election as an additional weapon
in the whips' armoury, it should be easier to deter backbench rebellion.
What cannot be allowed is for the present confusion over the law - and the
law-breaking which goes with it - to continue.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Personal View: Nuclear objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can the west seize the present moment of opportunity to secure and disable
nuclear weapons on the territories of those former Soviet republics that
wish to be nuclear free? The answer is yes - but only with a strategy that
marshalls all western instruments of influence and exercises them with a
sense for priorities.
Since the fall of the Berlin wall, the west has committed more than Dollars
70bn in credits, grants, and loans to the former Soviet Union. What has been
missing in this response is not money, but effective linkage between western
support and the recipient's actions.
Western governments must begin by recognising that the disintegration of the
Soviet Union could present the single most serious threat to international
security since the second world war.
Western defence budgets are in effect an insurance policy designed to deter
and defend against potential threats to international security. Some portion
of these budgets should, therefore, target the possible threat posed by the
disintegration of the former communist superpower.
If, as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union, scores of its 30,000
nuclear weapons find their way into international arms bazaars, the west's
entire conception of national security will change fundamentally.
Western governments must not fall into the trap of believing that these
30,000 nuclear warheads are simply 'the new republics' problem', for their
disposition will affect the west's own vital interests. Any use of the
nuclear arsenal against the west, or its vital interests, whatever the
circumstances, will harm us.
Nor should western governments accept claims that such an outcome is
inevitable or beyond its control. It certainly cannot guarantee the outcome.
Nor can the republics. But what the west does now can significantly affect
the probabilities. The longer it waits, the higher the cost and the smaller
the effect anything it does will have.
The west's overriding objective must be clear; namely, ensuring a single
operational control over all nuclear weapons in the territory of the former
Soviet Union.
Western leaders have affirmed this objective publicly, and communicated it
to the republics. One finds desired echoes in last month's Brest declaration
which led to the creation of the new commonwealth comprising 11 former
Soviet republics. But fine words must become deeds ' specifically
irreversible actions.
The west must insist that the newly sovereign republics earn diplomatic
recognition and normal relations. The republics must demonstrate they
recognise the obligations as well as the rights of independence. Above all,
they should sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear weapons
states.
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Byelorussia, all members of new commonwealth, have
publicly affirmed their intention to become nuclear-free states and to sign
the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But do not count on today's preferences
lasting as circumstances change or less responsible people become more
influential. One can already find signs of growing interest in some
republics, and even appetites for, maintaining control of the nuclear
weapons on their territory.
for control of all nuclear weapons in republics that desire to be
non-nuclear to be internationalised immediately. Ukrainian President Leonid
Kravchuk said last week: 'If Americans will help to destroy the nuclear
weapons then we will destroy them tomorrow.' We should take his 'da' for an
answer and directly translate his words into irreversible deeds.
To this end, the west should not confine its role to encouragement from the
sidelines. Rather, it should now establish a new international agency with
money, technology, and a mandate to assist in disabling and destroying these
weapons. The US Congress has appropriated Dollars 400m that can be used at
President George Bush's discretion for these purposes. Other G7 governments
which choose to participate in the proposed new international agency would
make matching contributions.
These contributions of funds, technology and explicit western co-operation
could make a decisive difference in keeping all parties focused every day on
the most rapid and secure disabling and destruction of these nuclear
weapons.
In his response to Mr Bush's historic arms control initiative last
September, President Mikhail Gorbachev pledged to eliminate more than 15,000
nuclear weapons. Since then, three months have passed and no nuclear weapons
have been disabled and destroyed. Three months hence this objective may be
unattainable. The moment for action is now.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Parsifal - La Scala, Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So much for planning ahead. Months ago, on leaving for an extended stay in
America, I carefully booked my seat for the last performance of Parsifal,
the new production scheduled to open the season at La Scala in Milan. It was
to be conducted by the theatre's musical director Riccardo Muti, with
Placido Domingo in the title role. In New York, I read about the triumphant
reception, the memorable musical performance, the glamorous opening night.
Back in Italy, a few days ago, as I was packing my bag for Milan and giving
Ernest Newman a hasty re-read, I learned that my performance would not be
conducted by Muti; and, further, most of the premiere's cast had dispersed.
I went to the performance anyway, and my faith was rewarded. You can learn
much about an opera house on an un-glamorous night, and, all things
considered, La Scala came off well. First of all, the orchestra sounded
fine. The replacement conductor - the, to me, totally unknown Niksa Bareza -
may not have Muti's special intensity, but he has the same sense of musical
architecture, and the reading was carefully shaped, dramatically gauged. Not
electrifying, perhaps, but immensely satisfactory and truly felt. If the
interpretation lacked a certain Nordic depth, it had, in compensation, a
silken, Mediterranean sheen. And the clarity of the old houses's acoustics
allowed the voices full scope.
Of the original cast Wolfgang Brendel remained: an unusually vigorous
Amfortas, with praiseworthy enunciation: opposite him, so to speak, Kurt
Rydl was a convincing Gurnemanz: the voice was not always steady, but the
singing implied the compassionate, all-understanding humanity that is
essential to the part and to the whole drama. Monte Pederson was a dark,
menacing Klingsor, and Gabriele Monici did his duty as Titurel effectively.
In reality, though Parsifal and Kundry are the crucial figures in the opera,
neither interpreter has an immense amount of singing to do; and the efficacy
of their roles depends more on authority of presence than on vocal prowess.
Still, the replacements for Domingo and for Waltraud Meier (the Kundry of
the premiere) were somewhat puzzling and ill-paired. Warren Ellsworth (the
Parsifal of the Welsh National Opera's production some years ago) is surely
the most boyish-looking Wagner hero ever seen on a great opera stage:
jug-eared and gangling, he is the very picture of adolescent innocence. The
voice, too, sounded appropriately youthful in the first act; but, as the
opera continued, the listener inevitably wanted greater power and
expressiveness. Nevertheless, this was an acceptable, if under-scaled
Parsifal.
The Kundry of Dunja Vejzovich was another matter. The voice is certainly
large enough, but at full volume it produces a less than pleasant sound. At
the beginning of 'Ich sah das Kind', the singer established a softer,
narrative tone, suited to the text and dramatically convincing; but in the
later part of the second act she became shrill and imprecise, absurdly
unseductive. She was not helped by the foolish costume (by Ettora d'Ettore)
and a copper-coloured doormat of a wig.
The Muti era - as it must now be considered - has not been distinguished by
much positive visual excitement. Indeed, some of the conductor's most
captivating performances musically were heard in conjunction with some of
Luca Ronconi's most disastrous vagaries; and regular Scala-goers harbour
doubts about Muti's visual sensibility. It is hard to conceive how he found
acceptable the staging of Cesare Lievi, who treated Amfortas as a
malingerer, denying him his usual litter, and allowed Kundry to survive at
the end, when Amfortas, Gurnemanz, and Parsifal simply strolled off the
stage, defying Wagner's specific directions and flattening the culmination
of the great work.
Lievi's brother Daniele (with Peter Laher) was responsible for the sets (the
magic garden looked like the swimming pool area of a better-class motel).
But then there was little magic in the whole conception: the transformation
scenes were bewilderingly fudged (doors opening to reveal shining, posturing
knights); the mop-headed flower-maidens in their Victorian dress looked like
Shirley Temple dolls, dressed by May of Teck.
And yet, the house, the orchestra, some of the singing, and above all, the
music itself made the evening a pleasure. Parts were sometimes unacceptable,
but their sum was still satisfying. The old magician of Bayreuth still has
the power to emerge victorious from severe trials.

Two new drama serials and two odd movies. We are warned that The Good Guys
(9.00 ITV) 'was specially created for Nigel Havers and Keith Barron because
they particularly wanted to work together, and was made by the production
company set up by Havers and his agent'. Sounds like a formula for disaster,
but the proof of the puddding ... They both play characters named Guy who
share a flat and the most encouraging factor is that the writer is John
Fortune.
The other new series, Love Hurts (9.30 BBC1), is written by Maurice Gran and
Laurence Marks who were responsible for 'Birds Of A Feather' and 'Shine On
Harvey Moon'. This time we are warned that the star Adam Faith 'came before
the story' because, according to Marks 'we've wanted to work with him for a
long time'. Marks promises us 'smiles and tears' which sounds like post
feminist code for what ad men used to call 'a woman's story'. The Navigator
(9.00 BBC2) is not Buster Keaton's wonderful comedy but a 1988 New Zealand
film fable about a psychic child in Cumbria at the time of the black death.
Rope (10.40 ITV) is one of Hitchcock's oddities: he shot the whole thing in
10-minute takes.

This is the musical one, with book and songs by Piers Chater-Robinson, more
familiar at schools than at theatres. It holds to Barrie's story without any
major alteration, inserting songs where appropriate. 'We are the Darlings,'
sing the Darling children. Peter and Wendy sing about growing up, and later
about flying; and, ensconced in the Never-never-land, Wendy sings of her
wish for a pretty house, provided at once, though she never lives in it.
Need I say that Peter leads a song aimed at the audience, 'Yes, we believe,
Oh, we believe in fairies.' There was a half-hearted, mainly adult,
response. Not that the children at the matinee were less than enthusiastic;
their chat sometimes drowned the dialogue.
Peter is played by Lorraine Brunning, looking very much boy size and shape
and using good boyish movements. The old tradition that she should also be
glamorous is dispensed with, none the worse for that. Wendy (Caroline
Mander) is more a little mother than a little girl, but this is due to
Barrie. Her brothers are as neutral as usual, though if John (Peter Thain)
wants to join the Coldstream he mustn't wear glasses. The Lost Boys are
given much more fun, though they might have put more zing into their
pirate-fighting. Dave King is a gentlemanly, not a terrifying Hook, but he
has a villainous farewell song to Peter. I hoped I should see him walk the
plank, but he is swallowed on his own quarterdeck by the ticking Crocodile.
Nettie Edwards's useful sets merge very well when required, but the lighting
(Nick Hunt) was for me too autumnal throughout. Choreographer Bill Deamer
has given the only big routine to the Redskins, of all people, who also play
the pirates. Director Sheila Mander is very good with young people; I only
have one quarrel, that she should allow Peter (of all people]) to demand
'Shall I hit him on the bum?' when he has a pirate bent over before him. The
production runs until 18 January.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: The word is out on silent trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrians started it all. Tired of hearing its citizens grumble about
the noise from trucks rumbling along their roads at night on the transit
routes between Italy and Germany, the government decided to act.
For two years, lorries passing through Austria after dark have had to
conform to noise levels in advance of EC standards. Only vehicles that do
not exceed 80 decibels (A) - the A denotes a measurement based on the human
ear - are allowed on Austria's motorways between 10pm and 5am.
This level, roughly that of normal traffic heard from 10m away, compares
with 60dB for conversation at a distance of one metre and 100dB or more for
discotheque noise. The generally accepted threshold of pain is 130dB.
Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, so a reduction of 4dB means a
60 per cent drop in noise.
For the truckmakers, the tighter Austrian rules posed problems, and the
manufacturers did not have much time to adjust their designs. 'Austria was
very much the forerunner,' says Klaus Schubert, technical director of German
truckmaker MAN Nutzfahrzeuge. The EC, which currently insists on 84dB for
new trucks compared with 88dB before October 1990, will not reach 80dB until
1995, though this will apply to both day and night driving.
MAN trucks, part of the MAN engineering group, has researched vehicle noise
since 1965 and reckons it has a head start, though its rivals are also
working hard. However, there is no single obvious solution to the noise
problem.
'Getting down to 80dB means lots of small steps in development,' says Karl
Feitzelmeyer, head of testing at MAN trucks. Progress has come from
improvements in components such as gearboxes, use of more rigid engine
blocks, more efficient fuel-burning and the partial enclosure of
noise-producing areas, such as engines and transmission equipment, with
sound-absorbent plastics. Propeller shaft vibration has been largely
eliminated through better design, while air suspension reduces mechanical
rattling.
In 1989, the company introduced its MAN Silent range, which performs better
in noise tests than conventional trucks. The range incorporates all the
above features and costs 5 to 10 per cent more than standard trucks. So far,
MAN has sold around 4,000 Silent trucks for the Austrian market. Other
markets are opening up: the Netherlands, for example, provides special tax
incentives for purchases of quieter trucks.
On a test track in Munich, two trucks from the Silent range were recently
put through their paces against a standard vehicle. All three gave full
acceleration from a speed of around 40kph (25mph) past a microphone and
sound measuring apparatus. The Silent trucks were definitely quieter, the
ear's impression backed up by the evidence on the graph. This showed that
the Silent vehicles recorded 80dB and 79dB, with the standard truck clocking
up 84dB.
At higher speeds, the difference was less marked. Above 60kph, the noise
from tyres and road surface predominates, so that manufacturers can achieve
nothing on their own - although the MAN Silent trucks are fitted with
specially quiet tyres. Schubert hopes future tyre standards will cover noise
as well as maximum speed, load and air pressure, making it easier to
integrate them with truck manufacture.
Further progress on noise will be difficult; as Schubert notes, 'we are near
the limits'. MAN's present range of standard trucks dates from 1986 and is
one-third of the way through its lifecycle. It can retro-fit its non-Silent
trucks to meet Austrian requirements.
Noise-related improvements increase the weight of the vehicle and make
servicing and repairs more awkward. There is also a conflict between making
trucks easier on the ear and maintaining traction and drive qualities. Yet
the time will come, reckons Schubert, when most of MAN's output consists of
noise-reduced trucks. Owners are waking up to the evils of noise, but only
because the laws are making them do so.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Technology: Satellite sets sail - James Buxton and Keith
Wheatley report on a canoe expedition that will test communications
equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Later this month, John Ridgway, who became famous for rowing the Atlantic in
1966 and has sought new adventures ever since, will lead a party on what
many think is the ultimate test of canoeing: paddling round Cape Horn.
The canoeists will face drifting pack ice, gales that can surge from calm to
Force eight in 10 minutes and 'williwaws' - squalls which can gust off
glaciers at up to 130mph. Where they canoe beneath cliffs, they may
encounter waves than can throw a canoe clean into the air.
The only reassuring fact about the expedition, which should make Ridgway's
23-year-old daughter Rebecca the first woman to canoe round Cape Horn, is
that it will be in touch to an unprecedented degree with helpers in Britain.
BT, formerly British Telecom, is using the expedition, of which it is the
main sponsor, to test satellite telecommunications equipment that will
enable the canoeists to position themselves, obtain weather forecasts, send
back news reports and allow the 53-year-old Ridgway to keep in touch with
the management of the salmon farm at his adventure school home at Ardmore,
near Cape Wrath in Scotland.
Assuming it survives this arduous test, the equipment will be installed on
yachts competing in the 1993-94 Whitbread round the world race, which also
passes Cape Horn.
The expedition consists of a five-person main team in single seat kayaks,
two double canoes (including a TV cameraman from Independent Television
News) and the 47-foot Chilean fishing boat Skyring as support boat.
The expedition, which will last about two months, will hug the coast down
the Beagle Channel, with the canoe party camping onshore at night and the
Skyring staying at sea. The party then cross the Bahia Sea to the Wollaston
islands, the archipelago which includes Cape Horn.
Having landed on Cape Horn island, the canoeists will wait for a window in
the almost permanent gales until they can circumnavigate the island. They
then return in the support boat.
On board the Skyring, Nigel Tedeschi, a BT research engineer, will operate a
miniaturised Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver which, using a small
satellite aerial the size of a motorcyclist's helmet, will calculate the
boat's position using three satellites.
The position will be transmitted using a rugged notebook-sized computer and
portable C-Sat terminal up to the Inmarsat-C satellite, and from there via
an earth station in the Netherlands to BT's research establishment at
Martlesham, Suffolk. Here it will be fed into a new computerised tracking
system being developed for the Whitbread race which will supply
laser-printed maps showing the canoeists' daily progress to ITN and Anglia
TV, also following the voyage.
Since the support boat and the canoeists will not always be together, a
second GPS receiver and aerial will be carried in one of the double canoes.
It will record a half-hourly fix which will be handed over to Tedeschi when
the canoeists liaise.
The expedition's position will also be relayed from Martlesham to the
Meteorological Office in Aberdeen. There it will be fed into a computer
model of the weather around Cape Horn composed from reports from a variety
of stations and passing ships.
Aberdeen will issue a daily weather forecast including the expected height
of waves each morning, stepping up their frequency for the crossing of the
Bahia Sea and for the circumnavigation of Cape Horn Island. 'Depressions can
come through there at the rate of three in 24 hours,' says Ridgway. 'We need
to wait for an anticyclone for the voyage round the island.'
The weather forecasts will be sent at speeds of up to 600 bits per second to
the C-Sat terminal on the Skyring, where Tedeschi will pass them to the
canoe party.
For the voyage around the Horn, the C-Sat terminal and the computer will be
installed on one of the double canoes so that stories can be written and
filed from the canoes. 'The kit all fits very snugly into the bulkhead,'
says Tedeschi. The terminal is about the size of a car radio.
All yachts in the Whitbread race will be equipped with this C-Sat system,
for which BT envisages a large market among yachtsmen. Some, however, will
also install equipment which will remedy a shortcoming of the last Whitbread
race: the lack of 'off-the-deck' TV footage.
To achieve this, BT has adapted videophone technology to the problem of
bringing pictures from remote sites with minimal power sources. It has
developed a small codec, a device which converts video signals from a camera
into compressed digital data for satellite transmission.
Signals from the codec will be transmitted over the Inmarsat-A satellite.
Without compression through the codec, such a signal would require a
satellite pathway more than 2,000 times larger than that available to a
moving source such as a racing yacht, requiring much larger equipment.
The VC-9000 codec (which weighs only 8kg, one-fifth the size of a US rival)
can handle data at 64 Kbits per second, much faster than any previous unit.
It also requires only 400 watts of power to transmit.
This will allow live TV pictures to be transmitted from yachts anywhere in
the world and interviewers in the studio can interrogate yacht skippers at
sea.
'We have taken the videophone to sea. The implications for all kinds of
remote sporting events and expeditions are enormous,' said Edward Scott of
BT. 'But so are they also for businesses that operate in remote areas.'
Oil companies exploring in remote parts of the Soviet Union are interested,
he says. 'The problems of sending back vast quantities of seismic data are
quite similar to the technical parameters of moving television pictures
about.'

SKI wear is high fashion, and even the smallest item has to be carefully
chosen. For those who even pay attention to their ski bindings the flashiest
pair this year will almost undoubtedly come from Salomon, of Annecy.
It has adopted a sublimation printing process, developed by fellow French
company OTI, to decorate the mini clamps which hold boot to ski. The
bindings are made from Du Pont's Delrin acetal resin. Decorative ink
patterns are applied to the surface of the polymer at high temperatures - up
to 300 deg C. This means that the ink completely penetrates the material so
that the image is indelible.

ISRAELI technologists have built a pilot plant to test a promising
commercial process for the transport of solar energy from desert regions to
industrial areas hundreds of kilometres away by pipeline, writes Thomas
Land.
The world's first methanator specifically for solar energy applications has
been built at the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot in Israel. It is
a central component of the chemical heat pipe, which converts solar
radiation into chemical energy, making it possible to store the energy.
The solar facility contains 64 computer-controlled mirrors that track the
sun and concentrate its energy on to a 54m high receiving tower. This
concentrated solar energy is absorbed in a special chemical reactor where
methane and other hydrocarbons are converted into gas. The energy-rich gas
is stored and transported by pipeline. The methanator is used to convert the
gas back to methane and in the process releases heat.

THE market for local area network (LAN) products in western Europe grew by
63 per cent last year, higher that the worldwide growth for such products,
according to market analysts International Data Corporation, of Amsterdam.
The overall market value of the European market in 1990 was Dollars 339.4m
(Pounds 186.40m), up from Dollars 207.9m in 1989. And by 1995, says IDC,
more than 1m personal computers in Europe will be running a networked
operating system.
The leading supplier was Novell with its Netware 286 product, which scooped
45 per cent of the market. The second company had just 9 per cent market
share.

ONE of the problems of setting up a data communications network to link
offices across Europe has been the different approvals procedures and
incompatible equipment.
One of the few ways of avoiding the headache has been to go for one large
supplier which operates in each country, but that involves becoming tied in
to their products.
Now a group of 11 independent datacoms companies has set up an alliance in
order to compete with much larger rivals. The 11 include Pandacom of
Frankfurt, Teleinform of Zurich, and Data-range of High Wycombe, in the UK.
The aim of the group is to enable those wanting to set up a European-wide
network to do so through a single point of contact. The group, European
Network Associates, will have a core product strategy to ensure that
equipment sold in one country will be available in the others. The group is
also hoping to be able to influence the approvals and standards setting
procedures.

HARBOUR ASSURANCE CO (UK) LTD v KANSA GENERAL INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE CO LTD
AND OTHERS (FT, October 15)
The plaintiff claimed a declaration that it was not liable to the defendants
under allegedly illegal retrocession agreements on the ground that they had
carried on unauthorised insurance or reinsurance business in breach of the
Insurance Companies Acts. The defendants contested the allegations and
sought that the proceedings be stayed under section 1 of the Arbitration Act
1975. They argued that the arbitration was a severable and self-contained
agreement that survived the hypothetical illegality.  On a preliminary issue
as to whether an arbitration clause calling for all disputes to be referred
to arbitration was null and void by reason of the illegality, Mr Justice
Steyn stated that an issue of initial illegality was always beyond the
arbitrator's jurisdiction (see Smith, Coney &amp; Barrett v Becker Gray &amp; Co
(1916) 2 Ch 86). While the distinction between initial invalidity and
illegality was not one which should nowadays prevail, Gray compelled the
court to hold that the principle of separability did not extend to ab initio
illegality of the contract in which the arbitration clause was embedded. The
application for a stay of the illegality issue would be dismissed.
MARC RICH &amp; CO AG v SOCIETA ITALIANA IMPIANTI PA (FT, October 16)
The Court of Appeal referred to the European Court a question on a
preliminary ruling concerning the first paragraph of the Convention which
provided that it was to apply in civil and commercial matters but, under
Article 1(4), did not apply to arbitration. The question was whether 1(4)
extended to (a) any litigation or judgments and, if so, (b) to litigation or
judgments where the initial existence of an arbitration agreement was in
issue. The court decided that by excluding arbitration from the scope of the
Convention on the ground that it was already covered by international
conventions, it followed that the contracting parties intended to exclude
arbitration in its entirety, including proceedings brought before national
courts. Appointment of an arbitrator by a national court was a measure
adopted by the state as part of the process of setting arbitration
proceedings in motion. Such a measure therefore came within the sphere of
arbitration and was covered by the exclusion in Article 1(4) of the
Convention.
ROSSEEL NV v ORIENTAL COMMERCIAL AND SHIPPING (UK) LTD AND OTHERS (FT,
October 18)
The plaintiffs, who were judgment debtors, obtained a charging order over
property, allegedly owned beneficially by a Mr Bokhari, pursuant to the
Charging Orders Act 1979 and Order 50 rule 1 of RSC. That order was
discharged on application of members of the Hitta family who claimed to be
legal and beneficial owners of the property. Rosseel argued that although
the family owned legal title of the property, the whole beneficial interest
was held by Mr Bokhari and that the transaction transferring ownership was a
sham. Allowing Rosseel's appeal against the discharge of the order, the
Court of Appeal stated that where there was a real dispute it was necessary,
in order to do justice, that an issue should be tried. The court could, in
the exercise of its power to regulate its own procedure, direct such an
issue. It could not be accepted that the direction of an issue would be
hardship on the Hitta family; there was no hardship if, having made a claim
which on its face was highly suspect, they were called upon to discharge the
burden or take the consequences.
KENNETH ALLISON LTD v A E LI MEHOUSE &amp; CO (FT, October 22)
The plaintiff issued a writ against the defendant firm of accountants and
the senior partner's personal assistant, after referring the matter to him,
said that she had been authorised to accept the writ. The defendants
succeeded at first instance and in the Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson
dissenting) in their contention that the writ had not been duly served.
Allowing the plaintiffs' appeal, the House of Lords stated that the crucial
question was whether the express provision in the Rules for consensual
service in contract cases excluded consensual service in any other case. In
the light of the legislative history it did not. Lord Donaldson had summed
the matter up correctly when he said that the Rules were the servants of the
courts and of their customers, not their master, except where expressed in a
wholly mandatory and exclusive fashion. The Rules concerned with the service
of writs were not so expressed.
CURACAO TRADING CO BV v J HARKISANDAS &amp; CO (FT, October 23)
An umpire was appointed under the Rules of the International General Produce
Association (IGPA) in a dispute over a contract in which the sellers had
failed to deliver. They pr ovided that an umpire could make an interim award
which the appeal committee had power to reassess or amend. Rule 132(a)
provided that whenever it was decided that a party had failed to fulfil the
contract terms, the arbitrators were to base the invoicing back price on the
estimated market value ruling on the day of default. In his first award, the
umpire found in the buyers' favour; his award was upheld by the IGPA appeal
committee which also stated that the contract should be closed in accordance
with Rule 132(a). The sellers objected on the ground that the arbitration
procedure had been exhausted but a second award was made under that Rule and
the buyers were given leave to enforce it as a judgment. Refusing
application to set aside the order, Mr Justice Hirst stated that it was
fully consistent with Rule 132(a) that the appeal committee's direction that
the contract should be closed in accordance with that Rule should be
fulfilled at a further hearing before the original umpire.
INDIAN GRACE (FT, October 25)
The cargo-owners claimed from the shipowners for 136m rupees for the total
loss of the whole cargo after 51 shells had been jettisoned as result of a
fire in the hold. That claim was agreed to be subject to English law and
jurisdiction. They also gave notice of a smaller claim seeking damages for
the 51 shells not delivered in the court in Cochin which concluded that the
shipowners were liable for short delivery. Six months later the writ in the
English action was served but was struck out on the grounds that the cause
of action was the same as that in the Indian action; and that section 34 of
the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 was an absolute bar to
bringing proceedings. Dismissing the cargo-owners' appeal, the Court of
Appeal stated that Section 34 of the 1982 Act provided that no proceedings
might be brought by a person in the UK on a cause of action in respect of
which a judgment had been given in his favour in foreign proceedings between
the same parties, unless that judgment was not enforceable or entitled to
recognition in the UK. Parties could not, by agreement or by reservation,
confer on the court a jurisdiction of which it had been deprived by statute.
CARGILL SRL MILAN v P KADINOPOLOUS SA (FT, October 29)
The plaintiffs were buyers of a cargo of wheat from the defendants on Gafta
Form 64 but they rejected the cargo on its arrival in Sicily. An arbitrator
was appointed who held in his absolute discretion, in an 'interim award',
that the claim had been deemed to have lapsed, been withdrawn or abandoned.
The sellers then appealed to the Gafta Board of Appeal invoking Rule 8.2
which stated that if a party were dissatisfied with an award, a right of
appeal lay to the Board. The Board then allowed the arbitration to proceed.
The buyers unsuccessfully contended before the High Court and the Court of
Appeal that the arbitrator's decision that the claim was withdrawn was not
an arbitration award so that there was in fact no right of appeal.
Dismissing a further appeal, the House of Lords held (a) that although the
arbitrator's decision did not determine the merits of the claim, it did
finally dispose of the matters in dispute and that such a determination was
properly the subject matter of an award; and (b) under Rule 8.2 a party had
a right to appeal if dissatisfied with an award and the appeal correctly
took the form of a re-hearing so that the Board of Appeal had jurisdiction
to substitute its own discretion for the arbitrator's.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Appointments: Logica loses Hollick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasingly bulging schedule has prompted Clive Hollick, chief executive
of financial services conglomerate MAI and labour peer, to step down as
non-executive director of Logica, the computer services company.
On Logica's board since 1987, the 46-year old Lord Hollick had been valued
for his financial savvy - 'his sharp and open commercial mind', the company
says, was a useful balance to the wisdom of the in-house computer boffins.
Hollick cites competing claims on his time following his appointment as a
non-executive director of British Aerospace. Sir Graham Day, interim
chairman of BAe, is deputy chairman of MAI.
Hollick is also being kept busy in other directions. Neil Kinnock named him
a Labour peer last year, in recognition of his contribution in setting up
the left wing think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research; and he
says he intends to play an active part in the Lords.
At the same time, Meridian Broadcasting, which is controlled by MAI, won the
south of England franchise in last year's bidding for the re-allocation of
commercial television licences; this represents a significant departure for
Hollick's business interests.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Conference to discuss reconstruction in El Salvador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONFERENCE to co-ordinate foreign help for the reconstruction of El
Salvador is likely to take place in the next six months, following agreement
this week of a peace plan to end a 12-year civil war.
The government of President Alfredo Cristiani tentatively estimates the
reconstruction programme will cost Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 980m) over a
five-year period, both to repair war damage and to direct extra resources
into health and education, particularly in neglected rural areas. The World
Bank, which will co-ordinate the aid effort, is expected to call the
conference after the ceasefire goes into effect on February 1.
The US, El Salvador's largest aid donor, is expected to play the biggest
role in the reconstruction plan, which would also probably involve Canada,
Japan, the EC and others.
There are still details to resolve in the peace accord, which took 20 months
to reach. On Sunday, the two sides meet to establish a timetable to dissolve
the military structure of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front, the
left-wing opposition guerrillas, and to reincorporate its members to the
'political and institutional life of the country'. Hours after the agreement
was announced, troops clashed with guerrillas and at least one soldier was
killed.
As the country where the Reagan administration in the US declared it would
'draw the line' against communism, El Salvador became the recipient of the
third-largest amount of US aid during the 1980s, after Israel and Egypt.
The military continued to soak up resources through the decade, diverting
funds from social spending and public investment, which dropped in 1990 to a
meagre 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product.
As well as raising investment and savings, the government will also have to
increase tax revenues. At about 7.8 per cent of GDP in 1990, these were
among the lowest in Latin America.
Before the civil war, El Salvador had sustained economic growth for three
decades. This proved insufficient to guarantee security, largely because of
the high concentration of income, wealth and land in the hands of relatively
few, and the enforcement of this by military repression.
Since then, there have been some successes with land reform, and remittances
from the large number of Salvadoreans living in the US, which benefit half
of all the families in El Salvador, have had an impact on income
distribution. Even so, distribution issues will remain critical, along with
efforts to diversify the economy.
El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Latin America and its
long-term growth is likely to depend on a further diversification away from
agriculture.
The government's economic reform programme is supported by the International
Monetary Fund and has been described by the World Bank as 'one of the most
ambitious reform efforts in Latin America.' Although this included safety
nets, there remain concerns about the impact of the programme on the poor.
There is some scope for a return of flight capital but El Salvador will be
heavily dependent on foreign funds for years. The international financial
institutions will be essential allies if this is to be obtained.
With foreign debt of Dollars 1.86bn, 70 per cent of which is concessional,
El Salvador's debt burden is among the lowest in Latin America and may be
expanded. Nevertheless, it will be heavily dependent on the friendly
countries, in particular the US, that have pledged support for
reconstruction. Whether that support will in fact be forthcoming, for a poor
country of 5m people no longer seen as having much strategic importance, is
another matter.

FT  03 JAN 92 / US purchasing data point to decline in manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TEMPE, ARIZONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US manufacturing economy declined in December and overall economic
growth was sharply lower, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Management (NAPM), Reuter reports from Tempe, Arizona.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.5 per cent from 50.1 per
cent in November. A reading above 50 per cent indicates that the
manufacturing economy is generally expanding, while one below 50 per cent is
a sign it is generally declining.
NAPM said the survey was below the key 50 per cent level for the first time
since June, when it rose to 50.9 per cent.
'The overall economy's growth in December was the weakest since it emerged
from the recession in May 1991,' said Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM
survey committee.
NAPM said the third consecutive monthly drop in new order growth rates
helped push the index lower.
'Three straight months of lower growth rates for new orders ended in a
decline in December and pulled all of the other indicators down with it,' Mr
Bretz said. The new orders index fell to 49.9 per cent, down from 53.4 per
cent in November, and the lowest since 45.9 per cent in April.
Mr Bretz added: 'Cautious manufacturers seem ready to wait for an increase
in new orders before expanding production, a scenario which suggests a
continuation of the economic malaise into the first quarter of 1992.'
The PMI index averaged 47.2 per cent for all of 1991. Experience indicates
that this rate is consistent with a 1 per cent rise in real domestic growth
for all 1991, Mr Bretz said.
The PMI index started 1991 with a 37.7 per cent reading in January. In
December 1990, the index was 40.5 per cent.
In December, employment fell for the 35th consecutive month, NAPM said, as
its employment index fell to 39.6 per cent. That was down from 44.4 per cent
in November and the lowest since May's reading of 37 per cent.
But prices rose in December for the third consecutive month, with NAPM's
price index slipping to 50.4 per cent from 51.3 per cent in the previous
month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA is threatening delays in its foreign payments as a weapon to deter
further economic sanctions, diplomats and Libyan officials said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Tunis.
The Central Bank of Libya, commenting on Wednesday on the routine renewal of
US sanctions, said the restrictions could make it impossible for Libya to
pay foreign companies and workers or contribute to international
organisations.
But foreign businessmen in Tripoli said the Libyan government had given no
sign that payments would be held up. According to the representative of one
European company: 'Contracts are being carried out normally and I don't
expect that there will be any disruption immediately.'
A Libyan banker, who asked not to be named, said the US decision last week
to extend sanctions for six months was no different from extensions
Washington has announced at six-monthly intervals since 1986. The sanctions
freeze Libyan assets in US banks and ban trade with or travel to Libya by US
companies or individuals.
The central bank, however, portrayed the renewal as an escalation in the
dispute between Tripoli and Washington over the bombing of a Pan Am airliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
The US and Britain have accused two Libyan agents of planting explosives
aboard the aircraft and have demanded that Libya extradite the men to stand
trial in the west.
Washington is considering further measures against Libya, not excluding
military action, if the men are not extradited. Diplomats said that as a
precaution Libya had transferred billions of dollars from banks in Europe to
banks in the Middle East.
Libyan officials have said privately that contracts with European companies
could be used as to deter Europe from following the US lead in applying new
sanctions.
The main European countries targeted are Italy, France, Belgium and Germany.
South Korean and Turkish companies also have large contracts with Libya.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Kenya defector to launch second opposition party

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MWAI KIBAKI, one of Kenya's most prominent politicians, who resigned last
week from the cabinet, yesterday branded President Daniel arap Moi a
dictator and said he would formally launch a second new opposition party
next week.
The Democratic Party joins the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD)
in a prospective challenge to the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu)
at forthcoming multi-party general elections.
It was unclear yesterday how many of the recent defectors from Mr Moi's
government would join the Democratic Party, but it is increasingly apparent
that the formation of a new party has dealt a severe blow to Mr Moi and has
hastened the fragmentation of Kanu.
Together, both parties will raise a formidable challenge to Mr Moi in the
election this year, particularly in the critical Central Province, the
homeland of the large and wealthy Kikuyu tribe.
The resignation from the government of five Kikuyu politicians in the past
week has demonstrated what little support Kanu has in Central Province,
which contains about a quarter of Kenya's population.
Questions remain about the credibility of many of the defectors who served
for years under President Moi without having raised their voices in support
of allegations of corruption, ballot-rigging and authoritarianism which have
tarnished the Kanu government.
However, the momentum appears to favour the opposition. Kanu, for the
moment, seems incapable of the overhaul and cleansing needed if it is to
face a critical electorate.
Concerns about political stability are also being raised, given the
continuing inability of the government to quell bitter tribal clashes over
land in the Trans Nzoia district of western Kenya.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Breathtaking silence from the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE historic decision to liberalise prices in Russia and other members of
the Commonwealth of former Soviet republics has met with breathtaking
silence in the US.
At first glance this is surprising. Successive US administrations have urged
Soviet Russia to abandon communism and adopt free markets. Therefore,
President Boris Yeltsin's willingness to take steps which President Mikhail
Gorbachev shunned ought to have prompted widespread applause.
But the Bush administration remains fearful of backing a programme it
believes is technically flawed and President Bush has so far refused to
stake any significant political or financial capital on Mr Yeltsin's
reforms.
Some conservatives in Washington have criticised the White House for failing
to state more clearly its support for Mr Yeltsin. Instead, there have been a
spate of leaks about Central Intelligence Agency reports outlining the risk
of social chaos this winter in reaction to economic reform.
The administration, however, prefers to stress its willingness to provide
humanitarian aid such as food and medicine, to be co-ordinated at an
international conference of donor nations in Washington on January 20.
In defence of their own passivity, US officials point out that no one is
sure what the effect of the price reform will be, whether it will create
regional or local food shortages, or, more probably, lead to brief but
painful hyperinflation.
Another cause of scepticism is the quality of Mr Yeltsin's young reform
team. Although men such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister,
draw praise for political courage, doubts remain about their knowledge of a
market economy and ability to overcome resistance to reform within the old
communist bureaucracy.
One informed observer commented that the Yeltsin/Gaidar plan was 'very weak'
on budgetary questions, while the monetary aspects were 'non-existent'.
Another senior US official was privately critical of the Russian plan,
saying it did not address important questions such as realistic prices for
energy.
Despite the criticism, officials point out that price liberalisation has
galvanised the administration to support full membership of the
International Monetary Fund for Russia, and other reformist republics, as
soon as possible. This includes the US Treasury, which opposed membership
for the former Soviet Union last autumn.
Full IMF membership would confer the power to borrow funds, in conjunction
with a full reform programme. This prospect is 'some way off', according to
those involved, but that does not prevent important technical advice being
given to the republics at present.

MOST French ports were paralysed yesterday by a 48-hour strike, Reuter

The stoppage was the fourth since November, when the government proposed a
dock reorganisation involving the loss of 1,760 jobs.
Cargo movement was halted at Marseille, France's largest port, and at the
country's main grain port of Rouen on the Seine River. However, in
Brittany's ports of Saint Nazaire and Brest, dockers were working as usual.
The government wants to replace the current dock labour system with one

FFr2bn (Pounds 200m) into making the ports more competitive.
The dockers' leaders are expected to present a counter-proposal next week.

FT  03 JAN 92 / IMF entry some way off for republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT could take at least nine months for Russia to become a member of the
International Monetary Fund despite the launch of its radical price reforms,
western diplomats and officials said yesterday.
Apart from statistical difficulties - 'depending on which exchange rate you
use to measure Russia's economic wealth, it can be ranked either with the
United Kingdom, Holland or Colombia', explained one western expert - there
are also likely to be objections from existing members which risk being
supplanted in the IMF's pecking order. Another problem is avoiding offending
individual commonwealth republics by admitting say, Russia, long before
Ukraine.
In a significant shift in policy, the Bush administration supports full
membership of the IMF for Russia and other reformist republics as soon as
possible. The shift recognises that the IMF is best placed to shoulder the
burden of direct financial aid and to offer expert advice on a comprehensive
reform programme.
The IMF's main task now is defining individual republics' so-called quota -
this determines a member's capital in the Fund and by definition the amount
of money it is allowed to withdraw. The US, with the largest quota, has the
biggest influence on the outcome.
An IMF team arrives in Moscow next week for a three week mission to help
draw up a shadow economic reform programme for Russia - embracing other
essential reform elements such as a budgetary and monetary policy.
The first opportunity for discussion of IMF membership for Russia and other
republics will come at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in New York soon.
The ministers are expected to discuss Soviet economic problems as well as
western interest rate policy.
The former Soviet Union's economic troubles will dominate another
international gathering when the Soviet Union's 18 main Paris Club creditors
meet in Paris today to finalise an agreement deferring repayment of
principal on long and medium-term debts.
Agreement has so far been held up by US demands that Russia should publicly
promise not to prop up the foreign banking subsidiaries of Vnesheconombank,
debt manager for former Soviet republics. The US is saying that this would
be a waste of money saved by western debt concessions, but the demand for a
public disavowal of the banks is opposed by European countries with such
subsidiaries on their territory, such as Germany, France and Britain.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Bosnia-Hercegovina appeals for peace-keeping troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE central Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina appealed yesterday to Mr
Cyrus Vance, the United Nations envoy, to send international peace-keeping
troops there as soon as possible.
The request was made in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, where
Mr Vance was holding talks between the Yugoslav federal army and
representatives from the Croatian government.
Both sides discussed how federal army troops could be withdrawn from
Croatia, and how a ceasefire could be implemented.
Sending peace-keeping forces is conditional upon a lasting ceasefire in
Croatia.
Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy prime minister of Bosnia, said troops should
also be sent to Bosnia, 'not only to preserve the peace, but to preserve the
territorial integrity of the republic'.
Last month, Bosnian Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, declared a 'Serbian
Bosnia' in a move which confirmed suspicions that certain Serb-inhabited
regions of the republic would try to form the boundaries of a greater
Serbia.
Bosnia, despite Serbia's opposition, has, along with the republics of
Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia, asked for recognition by the European
Community. The EC will grant this on January 15, subject to respect for
human and ethnic rights, and no forcible change of any of the republics'
frontiers.
Bosnian Moslem officials yesterday said they feared that any carve-up of the
republic between Serbia and Croatia would lead to bloodshed between its
three largest ethnic communities of Moslems, Serbs and Croats.
The 734,000 Croats, organised under the Bosnian equivalent of Croatia's
ruling Croatian Democratic Union, are divided between those living in
western Hercegovina, who are considering long-term unity with Croatia, and
those in multi-ethnic communities in the republic who want to retain its
unity.
Bosnian officials want peace-keeping troops to be based around, among other
areas, Mostar, in the south of the republic which has been used as a base
for federal army attacks on the Croatian resort of Dubrovnik.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Mud flies in fight over Shannon airport's status: An
international gateway that may lose the compulsory stopover that feeds its
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANNON airport, in the west of Ireland, is fighting for its life. At stake
is what is known as 'the Shannon stopover' and the airport's designated
status as the Republic of Ireland's international gateway to the US and
Canada.
Last month, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IAPA) added its voice to
a growing lobby in Ireland for abolishing the stopover, opening the
possibility of direct flights between the capital, Dublin, and US cities
such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
At present, all transatlantic flights in and out of Ireland must call at
Shannon, under a US-Ireland agreement dating back to the 1960s. This, says
Captain Donal Lamont, an IAPA leader, is holding back expansion and fleet
renewal plans of Aer Lingus, the national carrier.
Most business travellers (the most profitable market segment) to and from
the US now go via London's Heathrow, as the latter has direct access to 26
US gateway airports, while Dublin/Shannon only has four.
Aer Lingus operates three ageing Boeing 747 jumbos to Chicago, New York and
Boston, but wants to open a route to Los Angeles using two leased Boeing
767s. The jumbos will have to be replaced within five years. But, unless Aer
Lingus can win back business travellers, says Capt Lamont, it will be unable
to generate enough revenue to renew the fleet, and may even have to curtail
some of its transatlantic services this year.
The debate has divided all the main political parties. At stake is the
future of the national airline against the economic survival of the Shannon
hinterland. Supporters of the stopover claim that as many as 100,000 jobs
depend on it, directly or indirectly.
Shannon airport was created out of cow pastures beside the Shannon river in
the war years of the 1940s, when propellor-driven aeroplanes on
transatlantic journeys needed a refuelling stop on the edge of western
Europe. It became the world's first duty-free airport in 1947.
When longer-range jet airliners, not needing Shannon, appeared, the
government of the day began to promote tourism in the west of Ireland and
established the world's first industrial free zone around the airport.
The airport became the focus of regional development, and the stopover was
made compulsory in order to ensure that development continued. Considerable
investments have been made in tourism and the electronics industry, and 70
per cent of transatlantic tourists visiting Ireland get off at Shannon.
Mr Foster Kerrison, co-ordinator of the Shannon Status Committee, a group
lobbying to keep the airport's position as an international gateway,
believes abandonment of the stopover would put an end to all other scheduled
services to the airport, on which much of the industry in the region
depends. This is despite assurances by Aer Lingus that it will keep a daily
transatlantic flight to Shannon throughout the year.
'The airlines would only fly into Shannon when it is profitable,' he says -
that is, during the summer tourist season. Dublin airport, he adds, would
have to invest large sums if US carriers were to open new routes to Ireland,
with the possibility of direct flights to Dublin, whereas Shannon is at
present working at only half-capacity.
Apart from Delta Airlines, which flies out of Atlanta in the US, Aer Lingus
has a virtual monopoly on the Dublin/Shannon-US routes. If other US carriers
were to fly directly to Dublin, Aer Lingus could face stiff competition.
Says Mr Kerrison: 'We are not convinced that Aer Lingus has done its sums
correctly.'
One alternative under consideration is to develop Shannon as a hub for
transatlantic flights from regional UK airports. Few of the latter have
scheduled direct services to the US, and travellers must go via the
increasingly congested Heathrow or London's Gatwick.
There was an interesting development last month - an agreement by Aer Lingus
and one of the former Soviet republics to operate a joint service to the US,
using Shannon as a connecting airport. The small republics' airlines only
have short-range aircraft but, by using Aer Lingus as the transatlantic
carrier, they could contemplate operating routes to the US via Shannon.
Aeroflot, the Soviet national carrier, already has a big refuelling facility
at Shannon for its own transatlantic services. Use of that seems to be part
of this latest deal.
The stopover debate is likely to be intensified, especially as Mr Seamus
Brennan, Irish transport minister, indicated recently that he might be
willing to rescind the arrangement if increased traffic to Ireland would
result. The two opposing lobbies are not even talking to each other at
present, their debate taking place through the media in sometimes vitriolic
exchanges. 'There are some places I'm afraid to go to in Dublin right now,'
says Mr Kerrison.

FT  03 JAN 92 / Germans queue to see their Stasi files

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of east Germans queued patiently yesterday to find out whether
their acquaintances, friends or family members had informed on them to the
all-pervasive Stasi security police.
Mr Uwe Kussmann, an east Berlin house painter, and his wife Barbel were
among the first to apply in east Berlin to see the file kept on them by the
now-disbanded Stasi, or Ministry of State Security.
The Kussmanns' repeated applications to leave East Germany in the 1980s were
rejected, along with those of many other citizens. Both were harassed at
their jobs and isolated by their workmates.
Mr Klaus Lange and his wife Ulrike suffered the same treatment at work and
were rejected by their colleagues. 'Everyone obeyed the Stasi in order to
avoid complications,' Mr Lange recalled.
Both the Kussmanns and the Langes said the past was not over for them.
'(Erich) Honecker wants to visit his daughter and grandchildren in Chile,
but I was never allowed to visit my grandmother in the west,' he remarked
without bitterness.
Mr Honecker, former leader of East Germany, was given refuge recently in the
Chilean embassy in Moscow and would face trial if he were returned to
Germany.
Along with other east Berliners, outside an unmarked building in east
Berlin's Behrenstrasse, Mr Gerhard Schroder and his wife Helene applied to
see their files. The building houses the federal agency administering Stasi
information collected on nearly 2m citizens.
In 1964, the Schroders were looking forward to a visit from relatives in
West Germany. A stranger approached Mrs Schroder while she was hanging out
the laundry. 'He wanted to know all about our relatives. I told him he was
cheeky and to mind his own business,' she said.
From then on, Mr Schroder, who had joined the Communist party in 1961, had
trouble at work as a mechanic for Interflug, the East German airline. He
left the party in 1970.
When an application by the Schroders for reunion with their relatives in the
west was rejected in 1986, they stopped hanging the East German flag from
the window of their flat on public holidays - an act of defiance that was
reported to the Stasi.
The Schroders now want to find out who informed on them. 'It isn't a
question of seeking revenge. We simply would ignore the person,' he said.
One east German who sought access to his file, a dapper man in his 50s with
a moustache and gold-rimmed glasses, refused to give his name, saying only
that he was a goldsmith by trade.
'The Stasi is still around so I have to be careful,' he said.
He served seven months of pre-trial detention in 1984, on charges of helping
someone escape to the west. Although the charges could not be proved, he
said, he was forced to sell his home outside Berlin to the Stasi. He
displayed photos of a luxurious bungalow with an outdoor swimming pool.
'I know that the man who is illegally occupying my house is a top Stasi
officer and I want to get the names of the people responsible for my
arrest,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jurgen Mollemann, the German economics minister, yesterday demanded a
meeting of the ruling coalition parties to debate his call for a statutory
limit of 5 per cent on this year's pay rise for civil servants.
Speaking last night after Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, rejected
his proposal and openly rebuked him for interfering, Mr Mollemann said there
were precedents, including a nil pay increase in 1982, and a 2 per cent
limit the following year.
A coalition meeting would embroil his FDP party chairman, Mr Otto Lambsdorff
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, chairman of the CDU, in a debate which could
further aggravate embarrassing tensions between the coalition partners. They
are at odds over new social security proposals, environment and fiscal
policy.
Mr Lambsdorff yesterday sprang to Mr Mollemann's defence as his proposals
drew wide criticism and mockery. Supporting statutory measures, Mr
Lambsdorff said remarkable situations called for remarkable solutions. The
succession of union demands for two-figure pay increases this year was
'Utopian'.
Mr Seiters, a member of the CDU, had said earlier: 'The repeated public
suggestions from the economics minister are neither appropriate nor
helpful.' As the minister responsible for public servants' pay, he had no
intention of adopting the idea.
Mr Mollemann, who proposed in a newspaper article, published yesterday, a
plan to enable the government as an employer to 'send a signal' to private
sector pay negotiators, was attacked by trade union officials who claimed
that statutory pay controls were unconstitutional.
'We are really very little interested in the rantings of Mr Mollemann,' said
the 4m-member IG Metall union. The DGB trade union association remarked that
no one took the minister seriously any more, adding that it had no wish to
shorten his political career.
White-collar unions, however, warned that Mr Mollemann was asking for strike
action if he did not stay out of pay negotiations. Free collective
bargaining was a constitutional right and not a football to be kicked around
by a minister standing off-side, said the OTV public services union.
Over the past few months, as unions representing steel, banking and public
service workers have put in claims for 1992 pay increases of around 10 per
cent, Mr Mollemann has repeatedly insisted that all settlements should have
'a 4 before the decimal point'.
Rejecting the renewed criticism, he said last night that he would prefer to
hear constructive alternatives instead.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Finns fearful for Baltic joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINNISH companies account for most of the investment in joint ventures in
neighbouring Estonia, but some businesses fear that chaos in the rest of the
former Soviet Union could hamper further foreign projects.
Of the roughly 250 joint ventures established in the former Soviet republic
in the past four years, 120 are of Finnish origin. Only a handful, though,
are up and running so far.
Estonia is better placed for foreign investment than neighbouring Latvia and
Lithuania because of close linguistic, cultural and geographic ties with
Finland and consequently with the rest of the Nordic region.
'Considering how expensive production and labour costs are in Finland, it is
only natural that many Finnish companies like ourselves are keenly seeking
to set up production units in Estonia,' says Mr Christian Grondhal, senior
vice- president of Novera, a Finnish construction and agricultural machinery
group which owns 51 per cent of Estonia Engineering, a Finnish-Estonian
joint venture.
However, Mr Grondhal warns that if labour and production costs rise sharply,
Estonia will lose its attractiveness to foreign investors.
Salaries are low in Estonia by western standards, in some cases between
Dollars 10 and Dollars 20 a month. But many Estonians are already offering
office rent at prices similar to Helsinki's, although one foreign company
has been reported as paying Dollars 4 a month for office space in the centre
of Tallinn.
Apart from Novera, which plans to build a prefabricated bathrooms production
unit in Tallinn, other Finnish companies are also setting up similar
facilities in Estonia. Ahlstrom a Finnish boiler group, will build a
glass-wool plant in eastern Estonia, and Partek and Lohja, two construction
groups, will begin to fabricate building materials.
New trade agreements between Finland and Estonia, which will be ratified
this year, are expected to encourage such a development. If approved by the
Finnish parliament, Estonian manufactured goods should be able to enter
Finland without any tariff restrictions.
But the process of rebuilding Estonia's obsolete industry will be an
expensive endeavour. Last October, Imatran Voima and Vattenfall,
respectively Finnish and Swedish utility groups, and the Estonian Ministry
of Industry and Energy signed a co-operation agreement to begin the process
of modernising Estonia's ageing power sector.
Some analysts say the task of modernising Estonia's energy sector to meet
western standards will the require investments of billions of Finnish marks.
According to Mr Grondhal, trading has been the most important activity of
Estonia Engineering, a medium-sized joint venture by Estonian standards. Its
turnover has increased from FM10m (Dollars 2.4m) in autumn 1989-1990 to an
estimated FM13m-FM15m this year.
'Even if we offer the expertise and, most important, solve the financing
problem for Estonian dairies, fisheries and slaughterhouse through complex
barter arrangements,' said Mr Grondhal, 'these trade arrangements in some
cases may take a year to work out.'
One recent example was a fishery in eastern Estonia, on Lake Peipsi. Through
Novera Group's European contacts, Estonia Engineering helped the local
fishery to acquire a FM3.5m cold-storage space with a capacity of 500
tonnes, through the sale of fish. The local fishery paid the fish to Estonia
Engineering, which in turn sold it for hard currency in the west.
Other items which Estonia Engineering has been able to sell from Estonia in
the west through barter and cash deals are hides, powdered milk, cheese and
butter.
Mr Aarne Rapp general manager of Estonia Engineering, believes hardships
await his country as it attempts to shake off the vestiges of half a century
of Moscow rule. 'Chaos in Russia and chronic shortages of commodities in
Estonia can become strong disincentives for Finnish and foreign firms to
invest in this country,' he concludes. 'Such a situation would spell
disaster.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Plea to aid Haiti businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MIAMI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international trade embargo against Haiti has cost the Caribbean state
about Dollars 150m in lost earnings so far, according to representatives of
US companies with investments in Haiti.
Factories which depend on export trade will have to close and thousands of
jobs will be lost, the US companies, supported by Haitian business leaders,
say.
The embargo was imposed on the French-speaking republic of 6m people after a
military coup at the end of September. President Jean- Bertrand Aristide was
sent into exile. The Organisation of American States, along with several
European countries and Japan, imposed the embargo, saying he should be
restored to the presidency. The US and other members of the OAS say the
embargo will continue until the Haitian constitution is restored.
Over 6,000 Haitians have tried to flee for the US since the coup, amid
reports of reprisals by the army against Mr Aristide's supporters. All but a
few have been allowed into the US.
Haiti's economy depends mainly on the export of assembled garments, toys and
baseballs, mostly for the US market, and on coffee and fruit. 'We employed
500 workers in our operations in Haiti, and they are now unemployed,' said
Mr Andrew Postal, president of Judy Bond, a New York garment company. 'We
are closing our plants in the country.'
Speaking at a conference in Miami on US trade with the Caribbean, Mr Jean
Edouard Baker, president of the Haitian Business Association, said the work
week in Port-au-Prince, the capital, had been reduced to three mornings, and
electricity supplies were 15 per cent of demand. 'The industrial sector in
Haiti has been crippled,' he said.
Mr Donald Zimmerman, who heads a family business which assembles women's
undergarments in Haiti, said people there were starving and dying as
politicians discussed their fate. 'The US government has put Haiti back into
the stone age and I am urging a reconsideration of policy.'
The US is unlikely to yield, according to officials at the conference. The
administration was aware of the problems being created for business by the
trade embargo, but the embargo would stay until the political situation was
resolved, said Ms Donna Hrinak of the State Department.
She said: 'We know we are asking the Haitian people to do a lot, but how
much a price can one ask for democracy?'

Sizeable changes in aluminium and zinc stocks at London Metal Exchange
warehouses were reported on New Year's Eve and prompted an apparently
perverse reaction. Aluminium stocks moved closer towards 1m tonnes with a
32,225 tonnes rise taking the total to a record 987,150 tonnes. Traders said
this produced some dealer selling before trade buying interest reversed the
trend so, despite the stock rise, aluminium for delivery in three months
ended New Year's Eve Dollars 1.75 up at Dollars 1,150.50 a tonne. Zinc
stocks fell by 4,600 tonnes to 152,000 tonnes after a big shipment out of
Rotterdam. Traders said this was possibly the tail-end of a large merchant
shipment of Peruvian metal to the US. Three-month zinc prices closed on
December 31 down 50 cents at Dollars 1,115 a tonne. Dealers said trading was
very thin. Copper prices were under modest downside pressure after news that
LME stocks rose by 1,925 tonnes to 327,425 tonnes, the highest since March,
1984. Cocoa futures closed with moderate losses after active fund-selling.
With New York also sharply weaker, near-March tested what was seen as key
support at Pounds 742 a tonne. Dealers said there was no fundamental reason
behind the drop in price, other than long speculator liquidation.

Reuter reports from Sydney.
The New South Wales Court of Appeal rejected his attempt to stay the order

On Monday Mr Bond was served with a notice requiring him to pay the money

The judge said Mr Bond could now request a stay from the High Court,
Australia's top court, or seek an extension of the payment order in Federal
Court.

<TEXT>
IKEA, the Swedish-based furniture retailer, is making a cash bid for Stor, a
Californian home furnishings chain, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
Stor is a relatively small operation with four outlets - three in southern
California and one in Houston, Texas - and Ikea's Dollars 3.10 a share offer
values it at Dollars 19.8m. However, this is the first time the privately
owned Swedish group has made an acquisition in the US and the extra outlets
will significantly boost its fast-growing presence in North America.
Ikea said one of the four Stor stores duplicates a site it plans to open in
California. This store will be closed. The remaining three stores will be
converted to the Ikea format. Annual sales of the four Stor outlets stand at
around Dollars 70m.
At present, Ikea operates seven outlets in the US, mainly on the east and
west coasts, and annual sales last year were Dollars 284m.
This represented a 68 per cent increase on the previous 12 months, making
the US one of the retailer's fastest growth markets.
Aside from the three ongoing Stor outlets, Ikea plans to open two stores in
California in the spring. This should give it at least a dozen US outlets by
late-1992.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Laister may quit as head of MCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LAISTER said last night he was considering resigning as chairman of
Maxwell Communication Corporation following High Court approval on Tuesday
of an arrangement covering the company's administration in the US that
removes the MCC board's powers.
The arrangement between the UK administrators and the US examiner, appointed
by the New York bankruptcy court, was designed to harmonise insolvency
proceedings against MCC and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.
If the New York bankruptcy court approves the arrangement on Friday, as is
likely, Price Waterhouse as UK administrators will be effectively recognised
by the US court as 'debtor in possession'.
MCC board members will then lose the power to reconstruct the company under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy law and will leave Mr Laister with no executive role
either in the US or the UK where MCC is in administration.
'I have done what I became chairman to do, apart from the matter of MCC
pensioners,' Mr Laister said, adding that the placing of MCC in the US in
Chapter 11 was a necessary step.
He said he was concerned that any reconstruction would ensure MCC's UK
pension funds were adequately refinanced. Some Pounds 73m of the Pounds 95m
in UK pension funds appears to have been taken and only about one third of
assets currently needed were actually in place, he said.
Mr Laister took over as chairman of MCC on December 3, following Mr Kevin
Maxwell's resignation in order to avoid conflicts of interest. He had a
frosty relationship with Price Waterhouse.
He surprised MCC's bankers and Price Waterhouse by applying for Chapter 11
protection from creditors in the US where 80 per cent of MCC's assets are
held.
He then criticised a Price Waterhouse report to bankers detailing the losses
at MCC which alleged 'extensive misfeasance' among senior executives as 'a
shoddy piece of work'.
The eclipse of the MCC board by the transatlantic co-operation between
bankruptcy officials should now allow an orderly wind-down of the MCC
empire.
In its application to the High Court, Price Waterhouse specifically called
for Mr David Shaffer to remain as American chief executive of MCC because of
his detailed knowledge of Macmillan and Official Airlines Guide, two of the
largest assets.

FT  02 JAN 92 / New US corporate issues hit Dollars 579.7bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEW ISSUES of underwritten corporate securities reached record levels during
1991 in the US, generating more than Dollars 4.5bn in fees for Wall Street
investment banks.
Total corporate new issues - of both debt and equity-related securities -
reached Dollars 579.7bn (Pounds 311bn) last year, according to IDD
Information Services, the US financial information company. The previous
record was set in 1990, when the figure amounted to Dollars 312.1bn.
The surge in new issue volume is attributed partly to record stockmarket
levels which encouraged many companies with debt-ridden balance sheets to
seek new equity funds, and partly to the dramatic decline in interest rates.
The sharpest growth was seen in 'common share' offerings, up by 185 per cent
to Dollars 54.8bn, whereas initial public offerings - or flotations - were
up 140 per cent to Dollars 24.3bn. There was also a marked increase in
preferred stock financings thanks to the use of PERCs, a new Morgan
Stanley-designed financial instrument. Straight debt issues rose by 75 per
cent to Dollars 497.4bn.
The trend has brought healthy underwriting fees for Wall Street investment
banks, although these remained below the record Dollars 5bn in 1986.
Disclosed underwriting fees totalled Dollars 4.54bn last year, more than
double the 1990 figure, with Merrill Lynch holding its position as the
leading US corporate underwriter.
IDD attributed part of the surge in fees to the large number of equity
offerings, which traditionally carry the highest percentage fee for
underwriting investment banks.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Stasi files on 2m Germans are opened to public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of thousands of files kept by the former East Germany's Stasi
security police will be opened today, threatening to split families and ruin
friendships as unpleasant secrets about the past are uncovered.
The files on nearly 2m citizens - both informers and those who were informed
on - occupy some 200km of shelves in several government buildings in central
east Berlin.
Mr Joachim Gauck, head of the Berlin-based federal agency which administers
the Stasi documents, said citizens would have to apply in writing to see
their files. He expected about 70,000 east and west Germans to do so each
month.
His newly created agency, with branch offices in main cities, has more than
800 employees. It aims to increase that number by about 200 a month - to
3,400 - to cope with the demand for files. That will be more than the
Treuhand agency, charged with privatising nearly 10,000 former east German
state companies, which employs just under 3,000.
Mr Gauck warned people to reflect on the possible consequences before
applying to read their files. 'A human catastrophe could come about if
someone discovered that a member of his own family informed on him,' the
51-year-old east German pastor suggested.
Parents were known to have foiled plans by their own children to escape to
the west by informing the Stasi.
In some cases they were afraid that the children would be shot at, and
possibly killed, by border guards. Communist functionaries feared loss of
their privileges if their children escaped.
Ms Barbel Bohley, a founder of the New Forum movement which helped topple
the Communist regime, will be among the first to gain access to her own
voluminous file.
She recently learned that a close friend and fellow opponent of the
Communists served as a longtime informer for the Stasi, or Ministry of State
Security.
A senior east German official said last year that he opposed opening the
Stasi files as it would lead to 'murder and homicide.'
However, Mr Gauck said that opening the files was an essential part of
'coming to terms' with east Germany's recent past.
Some Germans argue that Bonn wants east Germans to atone for the Communist
past in a way that perhaps west Germans have failed to do over their Nazi
past.
Among those working for Mr Gauck are more than 12 former Stasi officials
with an intimate knowledge of the complex filing system containing more than
6m entries. Many of these consist of code names as well as actual names of
the 300,000 informers and their more than 1.5m victims.
Among the Stasi files is one on this correspondent who has reported from
East Germany since 1961 and was kept under surveillance on many occasions.

FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Chasing cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By a process of elimination, it may turn out that 1992 is a good year for
the UK investor to be in cash. At any rate, that looks a prudent strategy
for the opening months of the year. The UK will be in the fallow period
before an election. In the US, it is not yet clear that there will be a
speedy reversal of the 'deep-seated concern' among the population which the
chairman of the Federal Reserve last month claimed not to have seen in his
65-year lifetime.
The obvious risk is that the markets will scent recovery again and race off
on their traditional January rally. But having done so a year ago, they may
be the less ready to fall for the same one again.
In a parochial UK context, investors might do well to consider how often
they have told themselves that the construction sector or the more
bombed-out retailers could not fall any further. The whole argument for a
sharp rise in equities a year ago was not merely that the economic recovery
on both sides of the Atlantic was imminent, but that it would be
conventional in form. It now seems unlikely to be either.

FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Dividend doubts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the explanation, the historically minded investor might well
conclude that just because bonds may be more attractive relative to equities
than they were, that need not mean that they are attractive enough to buy.
But perhaps equities are not particularly attractive either. The other
central issue troubling the investment community at present is the outlook
for dividends. By the end of the 1980s, it was clear that the proportion of
UK output accounted for by corporate profits had for some years been
unsustainably high. Over the past year, the question has been whether the
proportion of profits paid out to shareholders has not been unsustainably
high as well.
It is sometimes argued that this problem is overstated, since a high
proportion of the UK market is accounted for by large, non-cyclical stocks
such as the privatised utilities and the pharmaceutical companies. But when
boards come to set their dividends, context is all. Many of the utilities
are under severe political pressure to exercise dividend restraint. The
pharmaceutical companies are seeing their nominal growth rates fall steeply
with inflation and through worldwide pressure on drug pricing. Neither group
is likely to cut the dividends. But if cuts become fashionable elsewhere,
they have plenty of incentive to be stingy.

FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Backing bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the context in which investors have to address a pressing strategic
problem: the attractions of bonds versus equities. In the 1990s, the UK and
a number of other economies may be facing a change in the terms of the
trade-off between inflation and growth. If inflation is to be conquered -
which is scarcely guaranteed - so much the better for bonds. If the price is
a lower growth rate, so much the worse for equities.
The trouble is that, historically, equities have outperformed bonds by a
wide margin in all but the most extreme conditions. According to the BZW
Equity-Gilt Study, the total real return on gilts in the depression decade
starting in January 1929 averaged 6.7 per cent a year against 5.2 per cent
on UK equities. But very few investors, however bearish, expect output to be
hammered in the 1990s as it was in the 1930s. A better parallel with life in
the ERM might be the decade up to the UK devaluation of 1967, under the
Bretton Woods system. In that period, UK growth and inflation both averaged
around 3 per cent. The average real return on gilts was 0.9 per cent, on
equities 11.6 per cent.
The persistent tendency of fixed interest securities to perform worse than
equities is something of a puzzle. The BZW series goes back to 1919 for the
UK and 1926 for the US. In that time, the total annual return on equities
has been 8-9 percentage points higher than that on Treasury bills in both
markets. To say that investors have blindly overpaid for bonds throughout is
to argue for market inefficiency on a heroic scale. But neither is it quite
satisfactory to explain the difference in terms of risk. In the UK market,
the dominant holders of equities are institutions who diversify the risk of
any given share across their portfolio. If Asda does badly, so much the
better for their holdings in Tesco and Sainsbury.

FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Marking time in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the ebullient end to the old year in the equity markets, UK
investors pondering the outlook for 1992 might draw a dispiriting parallel
with this time last year. Then the immediate topic was the Gulf war. Now it
is the election. Then it was assumed that, hostilities apart, the economy
would be in conventional recovery by the mid-year. Now there is no such
assumption. It might perhaps be argued that the resolution of the election,
like that of the war, would free the market of uncertainty. But the outlook
for the world economy remains so fundamentally unclear that the intentions
of UK voters - however anxiously debated by the market - seem almost trivial
by comparison.
The problems faced by the UK economy are nothing if not familiar. The risk
about ERM entry always was that the harsh medicine through which the ERM
achieves its ends might coincide with the downturn in the cycle. Not only
has that risk materialised; there has also been continued inflationary
pressure in Germany, so that the UK is saddled with a regime of German
monetary stringency at just the time when laxity is badly needed. For those
of an apocalyptic turn of mind, the 1990s offer the prospect of successive
UK governments making a desert and calling it price stability.
Until recently, the US offered grounds for greater optimism. Since there had
been no structural changes to the US economy, there seemed no reason why it
should not recover in the normal cyclical fashion. But perhaps the US, like
other economies around the world, has suffered a structural change of sorts:
the de-regulation of the banking system in the early 1980s, which led to an
explosion of competitive lending. In a normal cycle, the purging of excess
debt taken on in the boom times would be a sharp but finite process. The
question is whether in the late 1980s the level of debt, for individuals and
corporations, reached the point where the normal psychology of recovery is
now being suppressed.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UN envoy says Croatia and Serbia agree to peace force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WARRING republics of Serbia and Croatia have agreed to an ambitious plan
for a 10,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force to be sent to
Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy to the country, announced
yesterday.
'I have seen steps taken that have not been taken before - the acceptance of
our proposed plan in its entirety by both sides,' Mr Vance said after
meeting President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia.
Mr Vance was in an optimistic mood which contrasted with gloomy remarks he
made about peace prospects when he arrived in Yugoslavia on Tuesday. 'The
situation is radically changed since I came . . . We have a way to go but
we, I think, have made some real progress.'
His mission is under pressure to achieve a ceasefire and agree on a
timetable for deploying peacekeeping troops before January 15. On that day,
the European Community is due to decide whether to recognise those republics
seeking independence - Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia -
subject to certain criteria on human rights and ethnic minorities being met.
If the EC goes ahead, it will change the face of the negotiations.
Mr Vance said he could not give an exact date for the deployment of UN
forces, explaining he would first have to report to new UN secretary-general
Boutros Boutros Ghali and the UN Security Council.
He said he was trying to arrange a meeting today between Croatian and
federal defence officials to discuss details of a truce.
In spite of his optimism, Mr Vance has made it clear that the UN will not
deploy a 'Blue Helmets' peacekeeping force unless an effective ceasefire has
taken hold in the fragmenting Balkan state.
Fighting in Croatia, which has scuttled 14 ceasefire agreements so far,
continued across the breakaway republic yesterday.
Zagreb radio reported the first war victims of the new year, saying three
people had been killed in fierce clashes between Croatian forces and the
federal army around the coastal town of Zadar. Violent clashes around other
villages and towns were also reported.

FT  02 JAN 92 / The usual suspect is cleared of playing Footsie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSPIRACY theorists were alerted when the FT-SE 100 index recorded its
biggest one-day rise of the year on New Year's Eve.
Add in the involvement of the usual suspect in financial conspiracies - the
futures market - and the evidence for some form of manipulation appears
compelling.
On the surface, there would seem little to cheer the UK markets.
Expectations for economic growth in 1992 have been dwindling and the recent
rise in German interest rates means that the next move in UK rates is more
likely to be up than down. Surveys have shown that both business and
consumer confidence have been adversely affected in recent months.
So why did the markets move so sharply, and who might have stood to gain?
There are certainly advantages for fund managers in such a rise. Fees are
often based on a percentage of the funds under management at the end of the
year; so the New Year's Eve boost will mean slightly higher fees for many
managers.
It was also good news for those managers who slanted their portfolios
towards equities in 1991. According to Mr Mark Brown, equity strategist at
Phillips &amp; Drew, Tuesday's 3 per cent market rise ensured that the returns
on UK equities over the year (at between 21 and 22 per cent) just tipped the
20 per cent returns on bonds.
However, it was hard to see evidence of market manipulation by fund managers
on Tuesday. Trading volume of 306.7m shares was healthy for a half day's
trading but not exceptional. Many senior fund managers were enjoying a long
Christmas holiday and were not at their desks.
The futures market did play a role. The expiry of the December futures
contract means that investors who had sold FT-SE 100 Index futures - in
effect, gambling that the market would fall - needed to buy shares to square
their positions.
It is always hard to pinpoint the effect of the futures market on the cash
market but there was a surge in business before the expiry of the contract
between 10.10am and 10.20am on Tuesday.
The chief evidence against the conspiracy theory is Monday night's rise on
Wall Street.
It may seem odd that London still responds so sensitively to the US market's
moods, given the UK economy's gradual integration into Europe. Many of the
UK's leading stocks are also traded on Wall Street, however, and Mr Brown
says about half of quoted companies' overseas earnings come from the US.
Mr Paul Manduca of fund management group Touche Remnant says: 'The US
economy is still seen as the major motor of the world and markets have been
encouraged by lower US interest rates and Bush's promise to provide a
further stimulus to the economy.' European markets also rose in response to
the Wall Street rise, making it more difficult to point the finger at London
market manipulation.
History might also suggest that the UK markets were anticipating the
so-called 'January effect'. The FT-A All-Share Index has risen in 22 of the
last 27 Januaries with an average rise of 4.9 per cent, three times the
average for all other months.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Consumer body targets banks: Which? report highlights bad

   FOR THOSE who resolve to be

<TEXT>
even more - financially prudent in 1992, the Consumers' Association suggests
cutting some habits which may be costing more than they should.
The association targets what it calls the financial bad buys of 1991. The
list includes services from such names as Sun Alliance, TSB, Argos, Midland
and National Westminster banks. The association urges consumers to look hard
at thevalue for money they are getting. Its verdict: not great.
The association, a registered charity, publishes its criticisms of the
financial services sector in the latest issue of its monthly magazine
Which?.
If you decide to make 1992 the year you finally take out some life
insurance, exercise caution, the association warns. According to Which?, a
29-year-old woman would not do well if she opted for Reliance Mutual's
15-year policy paying out a lump sum of Pounds 50,000 at a cost of Pounds
205.80. Scottish Equitable would provide equivalent cover for only Pounds
47.
Midland Bank's current account 'gets the prize' for worst current account
deal. Which? says: 'Not only does it not pay interest on a credit balance,
Midland came out worst in customer satisfaction and efficiency.'
NatWest's Current and CurrentPlus accounts fare little better. Which? says:
'With either of these accounts, if you had gone overdrawn by Pounds 500 for
one week, been sent a letter and bounced just one cheque, you'd have been
charged Pounds 84.19.' Those charges include interest, arrangement fee for
the overdraft, plus standard charges for bouncing a cheque and sending a
letter.
Be careful too when using stores' own credit cards. Rumbelows, the
electrical goods supplier, and Argos, the catalogue store, were found to
charge 'a whopping 41.7 per cent APR'. Argos has since dropped its rate to a
still impressive 37.6 per cent.
If you are one of the estimated 80,000 mortgage holders who might lose their
home in 1992, the report has some useful tips.
The association looked at 50 different mortgage lenders between April 1986
and September 1991. A mortgage from Bretton Financial Services - a Royal
Life company - averaged 13.38 per cent annually. It cost Pounds 1,850 more
than the cheapest, from Tunbridge Wells Equitable, which charged an average
12.5 per cent. The TSB, averaging 13.1 per cent, was the most expensive
high-street mortgage lender unearthed.
Once you have the home, take out the insurance. But think carefully before
turning to Sun Alliance. Which? reports that for a house with a rebuild cost
of Pounds 75,000 in a high risk area, a Sun Alliance policy cost Pounds
187.50 a year more than a similar policy from Top-UK.
Ms Jane Vass of the Consumers' Association said: 'With financial services
more than any other area, it's a case of buyer beware. But even taking that
into account, some of our bad buys are astonishingly bad.'

   From Mr JOHN NOBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, around Easter 1991 I received an unexpected and welcome piece of news.
It came from the liquidator of Baku Consolidated Oilfields Ltd. It
transpired my grandfather had been a shareholder in this company, which had
lost all its assets in the 1917 Russian revolution. Now that the Soviet
Union had made amends and paid compensation, we could anticipate around
Christmas a distribution to original contributories or their heirs.
On Christmas Eve I received a further letter from the liquidator, informing
me that the Inland Revenue proposed to skim off 35 per cent of our money by
way of 'corporation tax'. After 74 years of zero return, our payment is to
be further delayed and substantially reduced.
I wonder on what proper grounds of equity and tax law this mean-minded
side-swipe could be based? Is this policy being adopted by the government in
all similar compensation cases?

political and economic outlook abound. Here, FT specialists weigh up their
answers to 12 questions of pressing concern around the world this year

JOHN LLOYD, JUDY DEMPSEY, ROGER MATTHEWS, ALEXANDER NICOLL, DAVID LASCELLES
and JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINETEEN NINETY-TWO SEES ELECTIONS IN THE UK AND US. WILL THERE BE A LABOUR
GOVERNMENT IN BRITAIN?
Joe Rogaly writes: Possibly. The answer would be 'probably' if Labour had
not done so badly in 1987. If Mr Neil Kinnock is to become prime minister
with an overall majority at his command Labour needs to capture close to 100
parliamentary seats from the Tories, many of them in the south-east. This
would require a huge swing from the government to the opposition, the likes
of which has not previously been achieved.
Against that, the Tories will be bereft of their present overall majority if
they lose just 50 seats. Most would go to Labour, but some would go to the
Liberal Democrats. No single party would have a majority in the commons.
Parliament would be hung. The consequences of that are unpredictable. If the
Conservatives remained the largest party they might try to win the support
of the Ulster unionists, but not all of them could be counted on. To do a
deal with the Liberal Democrats on a promise of proportional representation
would require a historic U-turn by Mr John Major. His party might not accept
it.
Thus the Tories might try to hang on to No 10 Downing Street by their
fingertips. They could easily fail. Labour would then have to be given a
chance to cobble together a coalition. If Labour was the largest party it
would form a government and try to win popularity in time for an early
second election.
All of this presupposes that the economy will not show perceptible signs of
recovery. If there are signs of recovery, the Conservatives' winter of
discontent would be forgotten. Mr Major would win his mandate. All bets for
Labour would be off.
AND IN THE US, WILL GEORGE BUSH BE BEATEN?
Lionel Barber writes: No, but he will have a run for his money. President
Bush won the 1988 election because he buried a weak liberal candidate with
the slogan: 'Experienced leadership for America's future'. Mr Bush will
repeat the message in 1992, but he will find it a much tougher sell.
Americans are in a sullen mood, disillusioned with their political leaders
and worried about the future.
The recent slump in Mr Bush's approval rating stems directly from the sharp
drop in public confidence in an early recovery. Mr Bush, who promised to
create 30m jobs as president, has seen total civilian employment actually
fall during his first three years in office. Unless he can point to tangible
signs of an upturn by late summer, Mr Bush remains vulnerable.
Whether he is beatable depends, to some extent, on which Democratic
candidate emerges from the six-strong field. The absence of Governor Mario
Cuomo of New York means that the Democrats do not have a national figure to
field against Mr Bush: Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early
Democratic front-runner, has never run in a presidential campaign; Senator
Tom Harkin of Iowa is all gnashing teeth and clenched fists; Senator Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, the telegenic Vietnam war hero, sounds a lot like Mr
Gary Hart in 1984 and may fizzle in similar fashion.
The poor performance of the US economy offers Democrats their first chance
in 20 years to recapture the ethnic blue-collar vote. This will help the
party in the north, but not necessarily in the south which remains solidly
Republican. Other factors helping the Democrats are Mr Bush's restive
conservative wing and the fact that the communist threat will no longer
dominate debate.
But Mr Bush's patrician tendencies obscure his skills as a political
street-fighter. It may be a close election, but at this stage a Democrat win
still looks less than likely.
WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMY? ARE WE IN A GREAT DEPRESSION LIKE THAT OF THE EARLY
1930S?
Samuel Brittan writes: I am often asked this question by broadcasters. When
I answer with a resounding 'No', I am usually asked if I know of any other
commentator willing to answer 'Yes'. The macho-pessimistic view is of course
contradicted by the most cursory examination of the facts. Between the Wall
Street crash of 1929 and the bottom of the depression in 1933, US output
fell by 30 per cent, and money incomes fell by 50 per cent. The fall was
nearly as large in Germany. In Britain there was no Great Depression as such
but a 6 per cent fall in output after an incomplete recovery in the 1920s -
the incompleteness is conventionally ascribed to Winston Churchill's return
to gold at the wrong parity, a diagnosis which some economic historians are
beginning to question.
This constant harping on the Great Depression is an enemy of serious
thinking. So is the obsession with prediction at the expense of
understanding and policy analysis. Hardly anyone has responded to my
invitation to discuss whether a temporary setback to economic activity to
allow consumers and businesses to repay what they feel to be excessive debt
is healthy or dangerous; or at what point it changes from one to the other.
Both Keynes and Milton Friedman have a great deal to answer for in their
preoccupation with aggregate levels of output and prices and with
unattainable stabilisation goals. We are unlikely to learn more about
business cycles without returning to the study of the relative behaviour of
different sectors, industries, and even companies - a study which will have
to be taken up from where it was abandoned in the early 1930s.
As for policy: the New Year is a time for restating one obvious truth. This
is that governments and central banks would be in a much better position to
use monetary policy, public works programmes, and the like, to combat
recession if they were starting out from a record of reasonable price
stability and budgets which were not too far from balance. Our present
predicament springs in large part from the needless overthrow in
non-emergency contexts of the 'old-time religion' of sound money by a
coalition of right-wing Reaganites and left-of-centre growth merchants.
WILL THE VALUE OF SHARES RISE?
Barry Riley writes: Sentiment in the stock market was so bad for most of
December that it was scarcely surprising that Christmas week brought
something of a bounce back. This might continue for a while in January,
usually a good month for share prices.
However, there are a lot of hazards ahead. Wall Street is vulnerable to
shocks if the US economy continues to lag, and in Europe the Bundesbank is
determined to beat German inflation, if necessary at the expense of reducing
economic growth across Europe as a whole to a crawl.
In the UK the election is likely to generate a lot of volatility. The
prospect of a Labour government would scare investors, although they would
probably recover their nerve to a large extent after the event.
In general share prices are well-supported by dividend yields averaging over
5 per cent, but a lot of dividends are going to be cut in 1992 so individual
share prices could go in all sorts of directions. Meanwhile profits are
generally weak, and recent hopes of a recovery in company earnings have
turned out to be premature.
All in all, you are likely to make some money on shares over 1992 taken as a
whole, but you will need to pick stocks with care, because there are going
to be further individual company shocks, and you may also need strong nerves
at times. The ride might be a little safer and less volatile in government
securities.
WILL THE EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM BE
REALIGNED?
Martin Wolf writes: Yes.  1992 will see the European Community tide ebbing
fast:
Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty will provoke debates in countries as
far removed in their attitudes to the EC as Germany and the UK.
Completion of the 1992 programme will be painfully difficult; its economic
effects will be disappointing.
The debate between the economically liberal north and the interventionist
south will reach new peaks of intensity. The attempt to construct a common
foreign policy will founder on irreconcilable differences of interest among
the EC's major countries.
And the ERM will be realigned.
Realignments are most likely to be confined to Italy and the UK acting, as
over the Western European Union, in concert. The Bundesbank will lower
interest rates, but too little, too late, to avoid another year of slow
European growth, this time including Germany.
Complaints about German fiscal and monetary policies will become ever more
outspoken, but they will have no influence upon the German reality. The
desperate plight of, first and foremost, eastern Germany and then eastern
Europe and the new Commonwealth of Independent States, will continue to
exclude everything else from German politics.
For Germany's partners the decision by the Bank of Japan that it will have
to lower rates of interest aggressively will be the final straw. Thereupon,
Italy will realise that being chained to the Bundesbank's cross makes no
sense for a country that will not be allowed into economic and monetary
union anyway; and the UK will realise that the only escape from debt
deflation will be a nice dose of inflation. By the end of the year the path
to Emu will look even more difficult and the destination even more doubtful
than it does today.
WILL THERE BE CIVIL WAR IN WHAT USED TO BE THE SOVIET UNION?
John Lloyd writes: The best answer is: no, but there are already. This
Russian answer means that there will be no civil war, but there are civil
wars, there will probably be more and there will probably be civil
disorders. The relative confidence with which civil war - usually thought of
in a grand sense of ignorant armies clashing by night across vast
territories - is dismissed is because the dispossessed lack the stomach for
such a full-scale fight.
The dispossessed are of course the communists, and history has far too
comprehensively passed them by to allow them to revive and to lead a
revolution, or rather a reaction, in its name. Most of the active ones are
making co-operatives, commodity exchanges and joint ventures as fast as
their address books can carry them. The only flag they will now follow is
green, and has Washington's head on it.
In the Caucasus, struggles over the control of territory are intensifying:
so far, these have not been reproduced (except in Moldova), but 1992 will be
a lucky year if they are not. There are border issues everywhere, around and
within Russia, waiting for a stupid demagogue to make it a dispute. More
worryingly, there are minorities everywhere, which had been used to moving
about freely in a Soviet state, who now or will soon face citizenship laws,
visa restrictions and rising nationalism, and are frightened and defensive.
There have been few food riots (reported) yet: but if they start happening
in a large way then they will spread quickly. In the fragilely-governed
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the political choice
will often be seen to be between a promise-everything populism and a
stop-everything crackdown. Neither can be more than palliatives.
But the war of one side against the other - whites against reds, or blacks
against whites - is unlikely this coming year. No one has the time, or can
afford to lose that place in the queue.
AND IN YUGOSLAVIA, WILL THE SERBS AND CROATS SHAKE HANDS AND MAKE UP?
Judy Dempsey writes: No. If the Croats regain full control of their
territory, this will not end the fighting. Although the Serb-dominated
federal army might eventually leave Croatia, a new kind of war - guerrilla
warfare - will develop, thanks to the depths of hatred between the two
communities.
Spare a thought for what will happen in the other republics.
The ethnic Albanians in the Serbian-controlled province of Kosovo are likely
to discard their passivity and rise up against Serbia. In the
ethnnically-mixed central republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, the Moslems will
take up arms against any attempt by Serbia and the federal army to divide
the republic, while Bosnia's Croats, who are concentrated mostly in western
Hercegovina, will try to unite with Croatia. In Macedonia, the 56,000 Serbs,
urged on by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, will resist
moves by the republic to seek independence, while Macedonia's 400,000 ethnic
Albanians will demand more ethnic rights, and possibly unite with their
confreres in Kosovo.
WILL ARABS AND ISRAELIS SIGN A PEACE TREATY?
Roger Matthews writes: No. But world events in 1991 have made it much more
likely that eventually they will be forced to do so. The writing is already
on the wall. Peace talks will resume in Washington on January 7, despite the
failure of the last round in December. The willingness to continue is tied
to the disappearance of the Soviet Union, to the crushing of Iraq, and to
consequent US military and political dominance in the Middle East.
Israel's Arab opponents have been stripped of their most important military
supplier and international ally. The military superiority of Israel, backed
by nuclear weapons, has never been greater. The last chance the Arab
countries have of regaining land captured in 1967, and the Palestinians of
embarking on the path to self-rule, is through diplomacy.
The present government of Israel prefers the status quo to any alternative
suggested by the Arabs, or by the US and the EC. For so long as Mr Yitzhak
Shamir is prime minister, it will use every delaying tactic it can devise,
while emphasising its commitment to the peace process.
What seems obvious to others is rarely so clear in the Middle East. Patience
is crucial. Long-entrenched prejudices, blind bigotry, religious extremism,
economic deprivation and individual political ambition are powerful forces
working against any appreciation of strategic change. Saddam Hussein lives.
WILL CHINESE COMMUNISM SURVIVE?
Alexander Nicoll writes: Yes. Communism will not collapse. The world awaits
the death of the Chinese party's octogenerian leadership, and especially
that of Deng Xiaoping, its 87-year-old patriarch. But even if qigong, their
exercise, breathing and meditation routine, fails to keep them going for
another year, the party is most unlikely to prove a house of cards like
those in the former Soviet bloc.
Rapid economic growth, fostered by market-oriented reforms of a distinctly
non-communist nature, serves paradoxically to preserve the party's power.
The party has not solved the fundamental problem of how to deal with
dinosaur loss-making state industries. They provide massive employment as
well as building blocks for the party's own structure. But the party is
happy to see the tremendous growth of non-state enterprise - particularly in
the area surrounding its future dominion, Hong Kong - always provided that
its political dominance is not thrown into question.
In the longer term, the growth of ideas inevitably associated with the
growth of the market economy seems bound to pose that question, and to
create north-south tensions. But for the time being, the octogenarians and
their successors seem set to hang on.
WILL THE URUGUAY ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS SUCCEED?
Martin Wolf writes: Yes. But agreement will make things little better. Even
in the pivotal area, agriculture, the gulf between the positions of the two
main players, the EC and the US, is too small for continued disagreement to
be sustainable.
What is more, the final agreement will be ratified, even by the US Congress.
That body of politically craven opportunists will huff and will puff, but it
will not blow the Gatt house down.
What Congress will do, instead, is charge a high price. That price - more
regionalism and, above all, more unilateralism - will help to ensure that
the Uruguay Round makes only a limited difference. It will be seen, in
retrospect, as a brilliant and largely successful holding operation rather
than as a decisive move towards what the world most needs: a more liberal
trading environment.
WILL THERE BE A MAJOR INITIATIVE TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT?
David Lascelles writes: The auguries for the first Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro in June, are not encouraging. This huge UN-sponsored jamboree is
intended to be the biggest green initiative ever. If it succeeds, it should
establish policies to secure the world's environment well into the next
century: an Earth Charter, and an Agenda 21.
But so far, only a handful of leaders from more than 100 countries have said
they will go. The arrangements for this enormous affair are also straining
Rio's resources to the limit.
But even if the summit risks producing more hot air than action, it should
still focus the world's minds on the big environmental issues. High on the
agenda will be protection of the atmosphere, safeguards for the world's
biological diversity, transfer of technology to polluting countries, and
stronger financial commitments to supporting these worthy goals.
WHAT ABOUT ME? WILL THE PRICE OF MY HOUSE GO UP?
John Plender writes: An acceptable question in the roaring '80s, but wholly
unsuitable in the non-permissive, debt-laden world of the '90s. The correct
question today is whether the price of your house will go down; and the
answer, with regional variations, is that it almost certainly will.
The thing that has not changed between the decades is the capacity of the
housing market to deliver sharp swings in house prices in relation to
earnings. What is new is the way that the market brings about the adjustment
to equilibrium after a period of monetary excess. In the early 1980s
inflation diminished the pain.
In the 1990s the government's commitment to disinflation and to maintaining
sterling within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) means that this
inflationary escape route is barred. A personal sector that has seen its
debt-to-income ratio double over the past decade thanks to financial
deregulation now faces the highest real rates of interest since the 1930s.
The return to equilibrium is thus being achieved through a combination of
increased earnings and falling nominal house prices.
Do not rule out an increase in mortgage rates. Even in an election year a
sterling crisis would make this inescapable. And do not blame Norman Lamont
 -it was John Major who pinned his colours to disinflation and the ERM while
at the Treasury.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Next steps for the EC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO VISIONS vie for supremacy in the 'construction' of the new Europe. One
vision is of a new superpower, its economy sharply defined by its frontiers
and its policies a mixture of warily liberal and aggressively
interventionist. This Europe views outsiders as adversaries and power as its
proper pursuit. The contrasting vision is of a Europe open to the world.
This Europe sees its economy enriched and its welfare enhanced by a
combination of economic competition and policy co-operation with outsiders.
Both internally and externally, the European Community should choose the
second vision. This is of particular importance in executing the programme
that is now, after the Maastricht summit, again the centre-piece of internal
development: that to complete the internal market. This has far to go if
such important barriers to an open and competitive market as nationalistic
public procurement, public monopolies and unduly restrictive regulation of
financial services are to disappear.
Equally important is whether the internal market is to be fiercely
competitive or whether cartelisation, encouragement to mergers and joint
ventures, and generous state aids are to repeat the failures of policies
pursued by individual member states. Only a competitive European market will
create companies that can compete, without protection, on the global stage.
If European companies are unable to compete, because they have been too long
protected from the need to do so, then the EC itself will turn
protectionist. From electronics to cars, European business must realise that
it can only hold its markets by supplying goods to customers, not pleas to
politicians.
Stagnating economy
Completion of a competitive internal market is made vastly more difficult by
the stagnation now befalling the European economy. That stagnation is
equally threatening to the EC's other main economic goal: monetary union.
For the European economy is being strangled by interest rates suitable to
the unique circumstances of Germany.
The question of realignment arises. As Bundesbank vice-president Hans
Tietmeyer has rightly said, a decision to upvalue or devalue a currency in
the ERM has to be made by the national government in question. But he also
stressed that 'we don't live in a fixed exchange rate system yet'.
A general realignment would be undesirable within the current ERM, for three
reasons.
Only if there is a chance that the D-Mark might be subsequently devalued,
could interest rates in other currencies fall much below those in Germany.
This would amount to the Bundesbank's abandoning the position that the
D-Mark should always be the safest currency in the system.
Only large devaluations would make much of a difference either to
competitiveness or to relative interest rates (by making subsequent
revaluations more likely).
But the possibility of large realignments in an ERM without exchange
controls would make it highly unstable. Counter-inflationary credibility
would be impaired as well.
General policy
A few countries may decide that they are so far from equilibrium that they
might as well start again at different exchange rates, provided only that
they give some hope of growth. But, as a general policy for the EC,
realignment would be a disaster.
For the most part, countries should soldier on with their parities in the
knowledge that German rates will turn down again, perhaps in the not too
distant future. In the meantime, those countries that hope to stay the
course should move swiftly to greater independence for their central banks
and, at the same time, push for more influence over the management of the
ERM.
Completion of the internal market and maintenance of monetary stability are
the twin challenges of 1992 in the EC's internal development. Neither is as
important as what awaits the EC externally. But they are the condition for
all the rest. The EC matters to the world, because of the success of its
economy. That success remains the foundation of its future.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: When marketing triumphed over musical endeavour -
Andrew Clements bewails the state of London concerts during 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession bit harder into London's concert life in 1991 than anyone
could have predicted. The closure of the Wigmore Hall in July for a year's
refurbishment should have created extra dates to be slotted in elsewhere,
yet promoters seemed only too eager to scale down their activities. Dark
nights peppered the schedules of all the major halls, and though the major
London orchestras dutifully offered their standard numbers of dates and
roster of conductors, as often as not they were interspersed with concerts
brazenly labelled 'classics for pleasure', 'classical pops', or 'arias from
the great operas'.
It was as if the only reliable way to ensure decent-sized audiences lay in
eliminating anything unfamiliar or demanding from the programmes, and giving
the punters exactly what they knew they liked. Never had the denominator of
the musical fare put before London's concert-goers sunk so low, or been so
obviously driven by marketing rather than artistic forces.
To a musical culture ruled more and more by the banalities of the major
record companies and their packaging ethic the bicentenary of Mozart's death
must truly have seemed like a divine gift; for one year at least concert
promoters could be spared the chore of devising a new thematic slant or
concocting enterprising single programmes. When in doubt play Mozart:
anything would do, and did. After 1991 no one will be able to leaf through
the pages of Kochel's catalogue and wonder whether pieces such as Il sogno
di Scipione K126 or La Betulia liberate K116 were worth reviving; there were
more chances to hear such works this year than in all of the previous half
century.
The South Bank's own Mozart celebration during August was an honourable
exception to the indiscriminate chronologies of so many of its counterparts.
By concentrating on period-instrument performances, and inviting the world's
best specialists to give them, it offered a serious chance to assess the
state of authenticity, and to measure the distance travelled in what is
certainly the most important shift in our perceptions of Mozart and how his
work should be interpreted, since the bicentenary of his birth 35 years ago.
Apart from the Mozart binge, the South Bank scaled down its thematic
planning in 1991 for reasons one suspects were as much financial as
artistic; small-scale celebrations devoted to Elliott Carter early in the
year and to post-war Italian music during the autumn were the most
significant offerings. The Barbican celebrated Prokofiev's centenary with a
festival presided over by Rostropovich, and used the capacious umbrella of
the Japan Festival (generally more worthwhile for dance and the theatre, one
feels, than for its music) to provide a weekend of Takemitsu. The BBC turned
its annual week at the Barbican into a showcase of Henze in the year of his
65th birthday; for 1992, though, the corporation will forsake living
composers for a three-day festival of the 56-years-dead Alban Berg.
In what has been with few reservations the dullest year in two decades for
music in London, there were times when it was all too tempting to switch
attention to Birmingham, where Simon Rattle and the CBSO had already won the
trust and respect of their audience in a way that the London orchestras
could only dimly imagine, and which for several seasons now has enabled them
consistently to offer imaginative, varied and wonderfully realised
programmes.
This year too, Rattle and his orchestra at last got their new concert hall,
leaving the treacherous acoustic of the Town Hall for Symphony Hall's
wonderfully rounded ambience; within the first few concerts it was clear
that this was by a long way the finest auditorium in the British Isles.
Return visits have failed to reveal any blemishes and suggest that the hall
measures up to the best in Europe, evoking comparisons with the
Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Musikverein in Vienna, and also that the
CBSO itself is rapidly moving into the class of the orchestras that are
based in those venues.
Birmingham also has its own new-music ensemble, the Birmingham Contemporary
Music Group, which continues to make modest yet steady progress. In general,
though, it was not a good year to be selling new music. The falling-away of
audiences could not have come at a worst time for the London Sinfonietta,
still trying to rediscover its direction and identity after the death in
1989 of its artistic director Michael Vyner; there were occasions during the
year when it seemed only a shadow of its former self, though the three
concerts with which it celebrated Henze's birthday in December gradually
brought a return to something like its old ebullience.
The greatest loss to London's new music, though, was the demise of the
Almeida Festival, allowed to wither away without any great attempts to
resuscitate it by the artistic management of the Almeida Theatre itself or
the arts-funding bodies that had previously supported it. Nothing really
could fill the gap, and the range of living composers heard in the capital
was correspondingly narrowed. The Huddersfield Festival, though, offered its
usual varied menu and the Royal Opera brought forth the year's most
significant new work with the premiere at Covent Garden of Birtwistle's
Gawain. Most pieces would pale beside that, and with the exception of John
Casken's rhapsodically lyrical Cello Concerto, unveiled at the Lichfield
Festival, and Tippett's Byzantium, given its British premiere at the Proms,
it's hard to settle upon anything of enduring worth introduced by a British
composer during 1991. Certainly none of the Proms commissions passed muster
in a season at the Albert Hall of generally high performing standards and
decent audiences, as impervious as ever to the chill financial winds biting
elsewhere.
Perhaps it is appropriate that at the end of 1991 one should be left with
two utterly contrasted memories of concert life in London during the year,
each in its own way deeply disquieting. The first is of a BBCSO concert at
the Festival Hall early in the autumn, for which the audience gathered
together would have been hard pressed to fill the front stalls; the
programme of Haydn, Xenakis and de Falla was neither good nor bad, just
average, but certainly not, in marketing terms, sexy.
The second image is one of the Barbican foyer on the eve of Mozart's death
day. The concert was to be a sold-out performance of the Mozart Requiem. It
was one of several in London that night, and decently rather than
spectacularly cast. Yet the queue for returns stretched across the foyer and
into the road outside. It was as if everyone wanted to be in on the act, to
join in some sacremental rite. The graven image just happened to be Mozart;
the real idol was hype and the triumph that of marketing over artistic
endeavour.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Deja vu over role in Europe: Paul Abrahams and Emma Tucker
report on the cabinet papers of 1961
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS over Britain's role in Europe are revealed by cabinet papers
released yesterday under the 30-year rule, demonstrating the triumph of
continuity over historical change.
While the cabinet of prime minister Mr Harold Macmillan was agreed in 1961
that Britain should join what was then called the European Economic
Community, it was concerned about the subsequent implications on its own
agricultural industry, the remaining European Free Trade Association
countries and the Commonwealth.
The main obstacle to Macmillan's 'grand design', as the prime minister
called his plan to join the EEC, was France and its president, General de
Gaulle, who, according to Macmillan, was demanding 'unconditional surrender'
for entry.
The stakes, thought Mr Harold Watkinson, defence minister, were high: 'If we
succeed, I imagine we should lead Europe. But if this happens can de Gaulle
still be Charlemagne?'
Macmillan's attempts to win over de Gaulle included schemes to supply France
with nuclear weapons and send British troops to Algeria after an army revolt
in the French colony.
President John Kennedy of the US was asked by Macmillan if the UK could
supply the French, who had only just conducted a fourth small nuclear test,
with nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
The British ambassador in Washington told Kennedy there was little chance of
the UK entering the EEC 'if there was no change over the question of nuclear
know-how'.
But Kennedy turned down the proposal, arguing that it might weaken France's
commitment to Nato.
Macmillan, like Mr John Major, prime minister 30 years later, also had to
deal with those within his party who were opposed to the EEC.
Mr Edward Heath, then Lord Privy Seal, warned that the 'surrenders of
sovereignty are serious' and might form the basis of attacks by opponents.
One group that the harried Mr Major did not have to contend with last year
in the approach to Maastricht was Britain's former Commonwealth trading
partners.
In the summer of 1961, prior to Britain's application to join the EEC,
Macmillan dispatched a number of senior and reluctant ministers on a tour of
former colonies to persuade them that Britain's enthusiasm for Europe did
not mean they would be abandoned by their former coloniser.
Nearly all countries had expressed 'serious anxieties' over possible changes
in trading relations and, for some, the political implications.
Canada told Mr Peter Thorneycroft, aviation minister, that it would resist
linking up economically with the US which might lead to it 'being swallowed
up politically'.
Mr Jawajarlal Nehru, India's prime minister, was worried that Britain was
joining forces with other rich industrialised countries, leaving the
developing countries to their fate.
Mr Duncan Sandys, secretary of state for Commonwealth relations, described
Mr Keith Holyoake's New Zealand government in a telegram to Macmillan as
'jumpy and defensive'.
From Jamaica Lord Perth of the Colonial Office sent a tetchy telegram
describing three long sessions with the federal and so-called unit
governments made up of '40 delegates weak, ignorant of the subject and
hostile to each other'.
The delegates wanted their interests fully protected.
'The list of their interests (vital?]) range from arrowroot to tonka beans,'
wrote Lord Perth. 'Perhaps for the first time they are beginning to realise
how much we do for them.'
For all their fears, the trading status of the former colonies was to remain
'favoured' for at least a little longer.
A memo to Macmillan from the home affairs committee which had been looking
for cuts in the National Health Service said one would be to remove the
subsidy from welfare foods such as orange juice.
But the committee was cautious. 'Can we be satisfied that this will not
result in reduced consumption of orange juice to an extent sufficient to
worry the West Indies and the Colonial Office?' it asked.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Harrods' tills ring up Pounds 1m an hour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRODS, the London store, yesterday claimed to have bucked the recession -
at least for a day.
The store claimed that its much-trumpeted January sale took Pounds 1m an
hour on the first day - or Pounds 16,666 a minute - outstripping last year's
first-day performance by more than 20 per cent.
It was the first time Harrods opened on New Year's Day in its 143-year
history.
A queue of about 4,000 people had gathered outside the Knightsbridge store
before the opening ceremony performed by Ms Diana Ross, the pop singer, who
arrived in a horse-drawn carriage.
Harrods is donating Pounds 50,000 to the Great Ormond Street Hospital
scanner appeal in Ms Ross's name.
Mr Michael Cole, for House of Fraser, which owns Harrods, said that since
December 27 the 65 UK stores in the group had all recorded takings at least
10 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Porcelain was among the best-sellers at the store, with one customer
spending Pounds 20,000 on three dinner services.
Also selling well yesterday at Harrods were 75 television and radio systems
at Pounds 1,895 each and Christmas puddings, 1,000 of which had been sold by
noon yesterday.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Adoption of EC rules set to boost tyre sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TYREMAKERS, distributors and retailers expect extra sales of at least
500,000 car tyres this year as a result of the UK's belated adoption
yesterday of tougher European Community minimum tread-depth standards.
The British Rubber Manufacturers' Association expects extra sales generated
by the stricter standards - which have been in force for up to two years in
other EC states - to lift stagnant demand for replacement car tyres by 2.3
per cent to 17.9m this year. Replacement car tyres are much the largest
sector of the market.
This will provide relief to an industry in which profit margins, if not unit
sales, have been badly affected by the fall in new-car sales and strong
price competition in the replacement market.
In recent months UK-based tyremakers, almost all of which were operating at
a loss early last year, were able to convince carmakers that price increases
were needed on tyres supplied as original equipment. Without increases, they
argued, the tyre industry would have difficulty funding research and
development and other investments essential to its long-term health.
It was an important victory for the tyremakers, who last year provided 7.4m
tyres for fitting to new UK-produced cars.
Then, in November, for the first time since the recession began, leading
companies such as Michelin and Pirelli imposed increases in the price of
replacement tyres.
So far these have not only failed to spark an escalation of the price war,
but have led to a general upward shift in prices of between 10 per cent and
12 per cent.
Mr Peter Tyson, marketing manager of Pirelli in the UK, said both moves
meant UK operations 'are once again on a profitable trend'.
The tougher tread-depth standards will provide a further boost. EC safety
legislators as well as the industry insist they are necessary.
The legislation requires a tread depth of at least 1.6mm 'throughout a
continuous band comprising the central three-quarters of the breadth of
tread and round the entire outer circumference of the tyre'.
The standard about to expire - which applies to all vehicles including
trucks, buses and motorcycles - requires a minimum of only 1mm of tread
across three-quarters of the tread pattern, with 'visible tread' on the
remaining quarter.
The industry's belief that the legislation will trigger a surge for the tyre
market is based on more than optimism.
When the first legislation requiring a minimum tread depth was introduced in
the UK in 1968, the replacement market for car tyres rose 31 per cent to
13.9m, from 10.7m in 1967. Mr Tyson said there was even a temporary shortage
of tyres.
When the minimum-tread law was modified in 1983 sales rose 10 per cent to
14.9m, from 13.5m in the previous year.
Industry research shows that the differences in braking distances between
tyres of varying tread depth can be substantial. Even a tyre with 1.6mm
tread depth requires a 50 per cent greater stopping distance than a new
tyre, while one to the existing UK standard requires a 90 per cent greater
distance. This translates to 139 feet to stop with a new tyre, 207 feet at
1.6mm and 266 feet at 1mm.
In spite of such statistics, the new standards are to be applied only to
cars and light commercial vehicles up to 3,500 kilogrammes. The maximum fine
for non-compliance is Pounds 1,000.
The British Tyre Distributors' Association and individual tyremakers and
distributors are critical of the government's unwillingness to allocate
funds to promote awareness of the new legislation, in spite of survey
indications that about 7 per cent of cars currently in use have illegal
tyres.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Most economists expect recession to end this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAD economic news for 1992 is that unemployment hits 2.7m, public
borrowing stretches to Pounds 20bn, and consumer spending manages to rise
only 1.5 per cent above last year's levels.
The good news is that the majority of economists expect the recession to
drag to a close this year and not to linger on into 1993.
These are some headline results of today's Financial Times survey of new
year forecasts of the UK economy, which compares 1992 not with 1993 but with
1991, to give a fuller anatomy of the recession.
Contributors sang a different tune as recently as last summer, when the last
FT forecast table was compiled. Then the consensus among the economists from
23 universities, intergovernmental institutions, independent think tanks and
City investment houses was that the recession would end in 1991.
This survey reveals how the optimism vanished again after the summer into
fears of a double-dip recession and the near-certainty that the general
election would be fought against a tattered economic backcloth at best.
The survey suggests that the occasional monthly expansion of output and
retail sales volumes over the summer, combined with rosy surveys of business
and consumer confidence, were not green shoots of economic spring as Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hoped, but straws in the wind.
In 1991 City economists and the Treasury alike were caught out by the extent
and length of the recession just as they were overtaken by its speed and
depth in 1990.
The prospects for recovery this year remain hedged with the big
uncertainties of unemployment growth, the depression in the housing market
and growth recessions in the US, Germany and Japan.
Economists have been slashing their growth forecasts for 1992 right up until
the last moment. On New Year's Eve, for example, Professor Douglas
McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's chief economic adviser,
predicted GDP growth of just 1 per cent for this year compared with 1.7 per
cent in the CBI's forecast of a few weeks earlier.
Professor Wynne Godley, of Cambridge University, is the only economist who
expects output to contract over the coming year, by 0.8 per cent after a 2.4
per cent fall in 1991.
The average forecast for GDP growth of all contributors is 1.7 per cent in
1992, much less than the Treasury's Autumn Statement 2.3 per cent growth
forecast.
Forecasters expect the contraction in 1991 to be 2.2 per cent, in excess of
the Treasury's November estimate of 2 per cent.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of GDP, and forecasters are
relying on income growth, lower interest rates and lower inflation to tempt
people back into the shops. The forecasters expect the year-on-year rate of
retail price inflation to be 3.7 per cent by the fourth quarter.
Underlying inflation should also show a decisive fall, as the recession
further squeezes domestic prices and a firm exchange rate keeps the price of
tradeable goods steady.
With average earnings growth due to outstrip price rises - not to speak of
the high-street bargains perennially available - consumer spending is due
for a slight rebound of 1.5 per cent this year after dropping almost 1 per
cent in 1991. Spending will remain subdued as consumers adjust their
debt-income ratios to more sustainable levels.
The housing market remains a concern, although economists do not see it as
preventing a recovery so much as inhibiting its vigour.
Unemployment will continue to mount to 2.7m (an average over the year) but
at a slower rate than in 1991. This, combined with the squeeze on profits,
and the constraint from membership of the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM), will make for a cautious consumer-led, rather than export-led,
recovery.
According to Mr Padhraic Garvey of Cambridge Econometrics: 'There are
indications now that consumer confidence is improving, but rising
unemployment is likely to discourage a sharp increase in borrowing.'
Destocking is considered an important spur to growth. Mr Nigel Pain, of the
National Institute, attributes much of its 2.1 per cent GDP forecast for
this year to a stockbuilding turnaround.
That sterling will not be devalued in the ERM, in spite of recent talk of a
realignment among backbench MPs, must be regarded as a certainty in the
light the chancellor's pledges. For this reason forecasters expect interest
rates to remain high, although the government should be able to afford a cut
of 1 percentage point by the end of the year.
Most forecasts were made in December, however, before the Bundesbank raised
Germany's Lombard rate by 0.5 per cent to 9.75 per cent, higher than during
either of the oil shocks.
The view of economists that there was room for cutting interest rates was
also formed before sterling slipped to within a whisker of its permitted
lower limit in the ERM, prompting fears that the next interest rate move
would be up, not down.
The government, it is thought, will do its best to take 0.5 per cent off the
base rate before the election.
One lasting hangover from the recession will be the sharp deterioration in
the public sector finances. While the main thrust to demand will come from
private-sector consumption, public-sector consumption will come a close
second.
The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is to bulge to Pounds 19.6bn
in 1992-93, after Pounds 11.2bn in 1991-92, largely reflecting cyclical
factors but also the continual cost of mitigating poll tax bills and
improving the public services. Mr Roger Bootle, of Greenwell Montagu, said:
'The size of the PSBR is not a problem.'
Nor will the PSBR, apparently, preclude some 'cheap and cheerful' giveaways
in the Budget.
Most economists expect the Budget stance to be neutral - not lowering or
raising the tax burden. But given the likelihood of a weak economy in March,
many feel there is some scope for an income tax cut, or even an pre-election
handout of up to Pounds 2bn, perhaps for the housing market.

MORTGAGE INTEREST rates should fall in 1992 according to some banks and
building societies, but others think there may be little overall change
during the year.
Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, expects rates will drop by a full
percentage point during the year to stand at 10.5 per cent by December.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the eighth-largest building society, also forecasts a
10.5 per cent mortgage rate by December.
Others are more cautious. Abbey National, the second-largest lender, is
forecasting a slightly higher mortgage interest rate than Halifax. It
expects a rate around 11.15 per cent at the end of this year.
Woolwich Building Society and Household Mortgage Corporation both say
mortgage interest rates at the end of the year will be back where they are
today: 11.5 per cent.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Aviation insurers face crash claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO AIR crashes over Christmas have left London aviation insurers with
multi-million dollar claims, aggravating losses in the market and adding to
pressure for increases in aviation insurance rates, Richard Lapper writes.
Premiums have been rising steadily over the past three months after reaching
their lowest level since the early 1980s earlier this year.
Mr Jonathan Palmer-Brown, an aviation insurance broker at Nicholson
Chamberlain Colls, said the claims 'will increase the pressure for rate
rises'. He added: 'A lot of cash will come out of the market.'
The crash on Sunday of a Boeing 747-200F jet freighter, operated by China
Airlines, followed hard on the heels of the loss of a Swedish airliner on
Boxing Day.
The Chinese aircraft, en route to Anchorage, Alaska, plunged into a mountain
soon after taking off from the Taiwanese capital, Taipei.
Nicholson Chamberlain Colls expects claims for the aircraft's hull to be at
least Dollars 60m (Pounds 32m).
On Friday a McDonnell Douglas MD81 jet airliner, operated by Scandinavian
Airlines Systems, broke up when it crash landed after both its engines
failed on take off from Stockholm's Arlanda airport. It was insured for
Dollars 35m.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Anarchic bargaining distorts Israel's budget: The haggling,
handouts and histrionics that go into fixing government spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANY of the international creditors from whom Israel is planning soon to
borrow Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.9bn) took time off from the season's
festivities to study the anarchic, 11th-hour bargaining over the
government's 1992 budget, they are unlikely to have been encouraged to
loosen their purse strings.
Government officials must be especially anxious about what the US embassy in
Tel Aviv is reporting back to Washington on the unedifying spectacle of
haggling, handouts and histrionics that increasingly characterises the
process of fixing government spending in Israel.
The issue is pertinent because of the huge five-year borrowing programme the
government has drawn up to help finance mass Jewish immigration from the
former Soviet Union. A vital component of this is a request that the US
government, which already gives Israel Dollars 3bn in annual aid, guarantee
credits worth Dollars 10bn - half the total external requirement.
Aside from linking this assistance - due to come before Congress late this
month - to the Middle East peace talks, the Bush administration has made it
plain that a key consideration will be evidence that the Israeli government
is conducting a stable economic policy that will ensure it can honour its
debt obligations. International lenders will undoubtedly take their lead
from Washington.
So the failure of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, to get his 1992
budget enacted before the year began, and the frantic horse-trading with
small coalition parties that held up the process, may have an impact far
beyond the immediate domestic economic consequences.
The source of the problem, almost everyone agrees, is the highly
factionalised political system which allows small parties to use their hold
over the balance of power to make outrageous financial demands for their own
vested interests. Mr Shamir, it appeared yesterday, preferred to give in
rather than let his government fall on the budget issue. So it was this week
that:
A single member of Mr Shamir's Likud party was able to force through changes
in the system of state-subsidised mortgages against the will of the treasury
and Bank of Israel at a cost of Shk1.1bn (Pounds 258m) - more than 1 per
cent of the original total budgeted spending.
Extreme right-wing parties forced Mr Yitzhak Moda'i to commit about an extra
Shk170m to Jewish settlements in the occupied territories - also in
political defiance of the US - and some Shk300m in increased subsidies to
new immigrants.
Ultra-orthodox religious parties won commitments to spend tens of millions
of shekels on educational and other institutions which they control.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, repeatedly warned of
the inflationary dangers of such deals, especially as the economy is showing
signs of stalling. 'During the last few days,' he said on Monday, 'there
have been all sorts of dramatic changes going on in the budget so that I
can't even tell you, just one day before the budget is approved, how large
the deficit will be.'
Mr Moda'i himself expressed his exasperation: 'Every year it is more and
more wild. This year the Knesset will pencil in money that simply isn't
there. The finance minister will then have to go door-to-door, to try to
raise the money from the US and from diaspora Jewry. Then you will say, and
rightly so, that the government is inconsistent in its economic policy.'
Not that the original budget as formulated by the government itself was a
model of fiscal firmness. Mr Moda'i's proposal to limit the deficit this
year to 5.5 per cent of GDP was thrown out by ministers, who boosted it to
6.3 per cent. And to make even that figure possible, they simply knocked
50,000 off the number of immigrants forecast to arrive, without altering any
related projections such as the rate of growth, or revenues.
By coincidence, an electoral reform bill was due to be voted on in the
Knesset yesterday aimed at ending the influence of the small parties. The
proposal to have direct elections for the prime minister, thus creating a
virtual executive premier with greater authority, might well prove not to be
a solution. But Mr Shamir's entrenched opposition to it means that even this
attempt to shake up the system is likely to fail.
A recent decline in the rate of arrival of immigrants may mean that this
year's last-minute round of budget handouts will not badly inflate the
deficit. But the job Mr Moda'i faces in persuading the US and other lenders
to invest in the Israeli economy will not have been made any easier by the
events of the past few days.
A vote was finally scheduled to take place today in Israel's parliament on
the 1992 budget, incorporating a large deficit to cope with mass Jewish
immigration from the former Soviet Union. The move followed negotiations
late last night between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government and
religious parties in his coalition amid indications that disputes over
allocation of funds to their rival institutions had been settled.
A final parliamentary vote was repeatedly postponed yesterday as Mr Shamir
tried to find a way to avoid threats by some of the religious groups to vote
against the budget, which could block its passage and possibly threaten the
government itself. The bill should have been passed by midnight on December
31.

FIGHTING erupted again in Tbilisi yesterday after a lull the previous night.
As Georgians tried to celebrate New Year's day the capital echoed with the
sound of sporadic gunfire and explosions.
The clashes coincided with a warning from Mr Tenghiz Kitovani, commander of
the rebel national guard in the city, that the storming of the parliament
building by opposition troops was inevitable.
'We will all celebrate the old New Year (this was marked on January 13 prior
to the 1917 revolution) at home,' he said.
'Many people will die if there is an attack on the parliament, but we cannot
afford to wait a long time for Gamsakhurdia (the Georgian president) to
surrender.'
A prolonged siege would mean more deaths, Mr Kitovani added. He claimed 100
people had died, with 400 wounded, in the conflict so far. However, the
Health Ministry says at least 53 people have been killed and about 300
wounded.
An extended siege could also give time for provincial prefects, appointed by
Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, to organise support and reinforcements for the
president, the commander said.
As he spoke, opposition leaders met to try to form a temporary government.
This would take the shape of a unity coalition of all parties excluding only
President Gamsakhurdia, said Mr Dzhaba Ioseliani, leader of the Mhedrioni
parliamentary group.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, accused by his opponents of setting up a dictatorship, has
been trapped in the basement of the government building in central Tbilisi
for 11 days. With him, the opposition claims, are up to 1,500 people,
although other reports suggest a figure of only 500.
Among those in the parliament are women and children as young as 12 who had
been demonstrating in front of the building when violence began. The
opposition accuses Mr Gamsakhurdia of using them as hostages.
The roof of the parliament building has been badly damaged by opposition
shelling. Nearby buildings - including the former state art gallery, the
hotel Tbilisi, initially the opposition's headquarters, and Interior
Ministry buildings - were burnt-out shells.
Many, however, doubt the ability of the opposition to mount a full-scale
assault; it appeared yesterday to lack purpose and organisation. Earlier it
had surrounded the government building at one end of Rustaveli Avenue,
Tbilisi's main street, but was driven back, leaving behind a howitzer.
The opposition was forced to use another Soviet-made 122mm howitzer to
destroy the gun and prevent it falling into enemy hands.
The avenue has become a battlefield, blocked at intervals by barricades of
buses and lorries, together with opposition armoured personnel carriers and
Soviet T55 tanks. The two sides continue to shoot at each other along the
length of the street, with snipers stalking rooftops.
Residents of surrounding streets, fearing a bomb attack on the parliament,
streamed out on foot yesterday, many bowed under huge bundles of
possessions.
Elsewhere, small knots of Georgians stood debating the fighting. The streets
were, however, largely deserted.
There have been reports of looting and armed robbery, with criminals taking
advantage of the availability of weapons and a lack of a police force.
The conflict in Tbilisi has added to the misery of a republic already beset
by spiralling prices and chronic fuel shortages.

FT  02 JAN 92 / French pate de foie gras loses some class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARISIAN shoppers have thronged the narrow streets of the Eglise St Eustache
in the Les Halles area of Paris in the seasonal rush to buy pate de foie
gras.
Sales of the delicacy - a creamy pate made from the livers of specially
plumpened ducks and geese - are strong despite the economic slowdown. Yet
producers in the Landes region of south-west France are in trouble.
Prices in France have fallen sharply in the past two years. Imports are
rising, while the recession in other countries, notably the US, is making
exports more difficult. To add insult to injury, there are allegations of
dubious practices in the Landes foie gras trade.
Foie gras, often accompanied by muscat wine or champagne, has been part of
the French diet for decades. It is the customary hors d'oeuvre over the
Christmas and New Year holiday, when two thirds of the 8,820 tonnes of foie
gras sold in France every year are consumed.
The French appetite for foie gras is still strong. But the market is more
competitive today than it was a few years ago. Prices have fallen 15 per
cent to around FFr420 (Pounds 42.76) a kilo for standard goose foie gras in
the past two years.
This is partly because of a shift in distribution towards keenly priced
supermarkets. It also reflects the continuing increase in imports of eastern
European foie gras, which sells for a fifth less.
Exports too are slowing, notably in the US and Japan, which showed
particularly strong growth in the 1980s. A fifth of the 4,450 tonnes of foie
gras made in France last year was sold to other countries.
Mr Emmanuel Jung, secretary general of Rougie, a family company based at
Farlat in the Dordogne, points to 'serious difficulties' in the industry.
'Profitability is low. Stocks are too high. Some producers are in a
precarious state.' Finally, the government has announced an official inquiry
into the industry following allegations that some producers are importing
foie gras from Hungary and Bulgaria, repackaging it with Made in France
labels, and selling it at French prices.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Tough Hungarian budget to cut spending by state
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY is cutting state spending and the public-sector deficit, in a tough
new budget which came into force yesterday.
The conservative government forced its draft through parliament this week;
the basic shape was unchanged despite pressure to introduce measures to
temper the recession.
MPs accepted a budget deficit of Ft70bn (Pounds 491m), pushing down the
forecast public-sector deficit for 1992 to 1.9 per cent of GDP from last
year's 3.5 per cent. That should reinforce the downward trend of inflation,
which is forecast to halve to 15 per cent over the next 12 months.
Hungary's bloated state spending is also set to fall as a share of economic
output, from 66 to 62 per cent. That will be achieved despite a fall in
officially recorded GDP of 6-8 per cent in 1991 and forecast stagnation in
1992.
The budget appears to meet conditions set by the International Monetary Fund
for continuing a three-year programme of financial assistance. It thus
clears the way for Hungary to draw Dollars 435m (Pounds 239m) of IMF credits
this year in addition to the Dollars 970m disbursed in 1991. Moreover, IMF
approval for Hungarian economic policy releases other official credits and
reassures commercial lenders.
Doubts remain among economic analysts over whether the government will be
able to keep to its deficit target. Last year the government failed to do
this and now it is cutting back dangerously on contingency reserves.
Nevertheless the budget marks the effective end of the consumer subsidies
which were a hallmark of the country's former communist regime. Only
transport is excepted from the cuts.
Taxation has also been reformed to reduce exemptions and allow companies to
write off more easily investments and bad debts against taxable profits.
But the opposition and some bankers have criticised the government for
watering down earlier plans for fundamental reform of taxation and spending.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Brazil's economy awaits 'flight to modernity'
</HEADLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL finished 1991 with an inflation rate of 460 per cent and an economy
growing at only 0.5 per cent, with zero growth forecast for 1992, according
to government figures, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
The growth rate for Venezuela, Chile, Mexico and Argentina last year
averaged 5 per cent.
Brazil is lagging behind the rest of the continent in many areas.
Its privatisation programme started only in October; it has still to reach
an accord with the International Monetary Fund and creditor banks; and its
import tariffs continue to be the highest. The country's minimum salary, at
less than Dollars 40 (Pounds 21.90) a month, is lower than that of Bolivia.
But this year is seen as a turning point in which the economic shock plans
that characterised the last five years will be abandoned in favour of
attacking the fiscal deficit, now accepted as the root cause of inflation.
Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, told businessmen in Rio
this week: 'We are like passengers awaiting flight 2000 to modernity. This
is our last call.'
However, his team is still relying on tight monetary policy as its main
anti-inflation weapon. Since September this has plunged the country into
deep recession.
A Gallup poll published this week found that 1991 was seen as the worst year
in the last 10 and that 1992 was expected to be even tougher.
Forty-one per cent thought last year was bad or terrible while only 17 per
cent had a good year. Seventy-one per cent expect unemployment to increase
this year.
President Fernando Collor, whose popularity has shrunk to as little as 8 per
cent according to some polls, hit out at the news media for their
pessimistic prognoses for 1992. He claimed the opinion polls reflected the
sacrifices of 1991: 'The measures we have adopted are not exactly the kind
which reap applause.'
But it is not all bad news. In December, for the second consecutive month,
inflation fell slightly to around 24 per cent a month.
This month the IMF is expected to approve a Dollars 2bn standby facility
after an 11th-hour congressional approval of the tax reform, which is seen
as the first step towards fiscal adjustment.
Yesterday import tariffs were reduced by an average of 6 per cent, with
those for cars coming down from 60 to 50 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE will eventually become the richest market in the world with enough
clout to demand changes in the American legal and regulatory system,
according to a US Chamber of Commerce report.
'A single EC banking market provides Europeans with the leverage to seek
changes in the more restrictive US financial services market,' the report
says. 'Similar activity has already occurred in other areas, including
public procurement and product standards.'
Although the single market will be 'a good deal' for US business overall,
the future is fraught with dangers of trade and economic conflict.
The report, released last month, says the looming failure of the EC to meet
its December 31 1992 deadlines, particularly with regard to technical
product standards, means US business will be unable to benefit from 'one of
the most touted benefits of the internal market programme'.
Implementation and compliance with EC legislation by the individual
governments 'remains the Achilles' heel' of the exercise. Only 36 of the 134
measures requiring national implementation by the end of next August have
been approved by national legislatures.
'The EC countries have been particularly negligent in implementing
environmental and agricultural legislation,' the report says. Furthermore
the social action programme could force US companies in Europe 'to conform
to onerous labour legislation, increase the cost of doing business in the EC
and reduce a company's flexibility in management decision-making.'
In future the US and EC will compete as 'super economic blocs' without the
Cold War to unite them. The Chamber fears for increased bilateral tension if
the EC pours subsidies into 'national champions' and 'sensitive sectors'
like autos, electronics and steel, and 'America First' attitudes give rise
to restrictive US legislation'.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia told his countrymen yesterday they
had no choice but to persevere with reforms, although the economy had yet to
hit bottom, Reuter reports from Prague.
He said in a traditional new year address to the nation that it would be
foolish to blame the parliament, government and president for economic,
legislative and ethnic problems as well as a soaring crime rate and
increasing intolerance.
'It is a task for us all and we have no right to protest, for we have chosen
it ourselves,' the president said, referring to the overthrow of the
communist system in late 1989.
He praised the results of economic reform which started with the
liberalisation of prices a year ago.
'A market economy environment is now becoming established. We have managed
to sustain a balanced budget, there is no runaway inflation and the foreign
debt is manageable.'
But he said hopes that the economic slump could be reversed as early as
mid-1992 might be premature.
'It seems that we are yet to reach the bottom.
'But at the same time, preconditions for a change should begin to arise.'

FT  02 JAN 92 / Bonn toughens stance on civil service pay: Mollemann seeks
to keep wage increases to less than 5 per cent

THE German government should use its legislative powers to limit civil
service pay rises this year to less than 5 per cent, according to Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, economics minister. This would send a clear signal to the private
sector, he said yesterday.
It was not the time to iron out pay inequalities, he said. Economic
stability and full employment were greater priorities.
The economy stood at the crossroads. 'The next weeks and months will decide
if we are to resume growth or to suffer deep and painful cuts,' Mr Mollemann
said.
Representatives of the 1.8m civil servants in west Germany, traditionally
the first public sector workers to settle their wage deals, said yesterday
they would not to be singled out for 'a special sacrifice'. 'We shall be
seeking a two-figure increase,' said Mr Werner Hagedorn, chairman of the
Deutsche Beamtenbund civil servants' association.
The OTV union, which represents public sector workers, said the minister's
proposal would only hinder negotiations. It was surprising that a
'self-styled free-market, liberal minister should suddenly become a
proponent of a statutory incomes policy', the union said.
Mr Mollemann's renewed intervention, following calls from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl for moderate settlements, is likely to aggravate already bitter
negotiations over 10 per cent claims from unions representing steel, banking
and public service workers.
Further bad news from the steel and engineering industries over the holiday
highlighted pressures on the economy. Voest Alpine, the Austrian group,
announced it was to close its only German special steel works by the end of
the year.
The 400 employees at Edelstahlwerks Bohler in Dusseldorf would be deployed
elsewhere, the group said.
Engineering and plant makers, second only in industrial rankings to the car
industry, said yesterday they expected real falls in production and sales
this year.
'All the threads have been cut virtually simultaneously,' said Mr Alexander
Batschari, of the VDMA manufacturers' association, referring to the effects
on orders of recession in the west and political and economic turmoil in
east Europe.
The only markets showing signs of life were those in south east Asia, where
Japanese engineering had a share of more than 50 per cent, the US 21 per
cent and Germany only 12 per cent. German exports to the region had
increased 20 per cent to DM1.2bn (Pounds 410m) last year, the association
said.
Total overseas deliveries, which account for 60 per cent of the industry's
sales, had fallen 20 per cent in the first 10 months of 1991; inland
deliveries were up only 1 per cent over the same period, while orders were
down 10 per cent.
More than 70,000 engineers were working short-time in November, compared
with 3,000 a year earlier, the VDMA said. Companies in the worst-hit
sectors, textile machinery, machine tools, motors and agricultural
equipment, were all planning to reduce their payrolls.

FT  02 JAN 92 / El Salvador adversaries agree to peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE El Salvador government and leftist rebels who have fought a 12-year
civil war agreed yesterday to a peace plan which begins with a ceasefire on
February 1, Reuter reports from the United Nations, New York. A complete
peace treaty has still to be finalised.
President Alfredo Cristiani said: 'This agreement initiates a new period for
Salvadoreans.' He said his nation, which had suffered 75,000 deaths through
the war, could begin spiritual and material reconstruction.
Mr Bernard Aronson, US assistant secretary of state, said: 'Both sides know
that the war is over.' Mr Aronson, who led a delegation of US officials at
the margins of the peace talks, added: 'For the Salvadorean people, it is
the best new year's present they could have.'
For Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, who spent the last day of his 10 years as UN
secretary-general on December 31 pursuing the peace accord, the agreement
was particularly gratifying. 'I am a free man, I feel as light as a
feather,' the 71-year-old Peruvian said.
The accord draws on a 75-page document which will form the basis of a formal
peace settlement in the tiny Central American country of 5m people.
Negotiations resume on January 5, either in New York or Mexico. A communique
said that if no final agreement was reached the new UN secretary-general, Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt, would take decisions for the two groups
before January 16, when the talks are scheduled to be concluded formally.
President Cristiani said remaining issues were 'technical', involving a
timetable for implementing the accord, dissolving the rebels' military
structure and integrating them into civil life.
The Salvadorean president, credited with flexibility in the talks despite
criticism from right-wing supporters, said he knew it was not easy for the
rebels to agree to the accord. But he said 'the step they have taken will
benefit the whole country'.
Mr Schafik Handal, one of five rebel commanders, said all accords should
begin to be implemented during the official ceasefire period that ends on
October 31.
If all goes according to schedule, he said, the rebel forces would be
demobilised by then.
Not all details of the peace settlement were disclosed but both sides
involved in the past 20 months of negotiations had already agreed on a
reform of the country's judiciary, human rights safeguards, electoral
reform, a reduction of the 55,000-member armed forces and an overhaul of
security services.
The government was said to have presented plans on how to reduce the army
over a two-year period to half its size and abolish some paramilitary
counter-insurgency battalions.
The rebels also wanted the government to allow peasant squatters in areas
they control to continue living there.
The government instead offered to settle the peasants but not necessarily on
private property they now occupied. The agreements apparently call for a
special commission to hear individual cases.
The existing army-controlled security forces, numbering about 17,000, will
be phased out and a new civilian police force is to be created.
If the peace accord is implemented, the US has volunteered to be a guarantor
of the settlement. It has also offered to initiate a generous reconstruction
programme that includes aid from Europe, Canada and Japan.
Washington has supported several Salvadorean governments with more than
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.1bn) in financial aid since 1979.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXTRA police are being deployed in Moscow to guard against a possible
explosion of popular anger against price rises introduced today by President
Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Arkady Murashov, the capital's police chief, said 1,000 more police would
be on the streets in case of disturbances or attacks on shops or traders.
There are usually 6,000 police on duty at any one time in this city of 9m
people. He said: 'We are preparing for the worst although I do not believe
there will be attacks as rumours have it.'
The long-feared liberalisation will end decades of artificially-low fixed
prices. Six basic commodities are exempt. The amount paid for bread, milk,
matches, salt, vodka and energy will remain fixed but at three to five times
higher than the present level.
Russia was to have gone it alone today, but reports from Ukraine yesterday
suggested that the second largest state in the new commonwealth would
emulate Russia on the same day. Other newly-independent states plan a
mixture of price reforms and trade barriers in coming days to limit the
flight of goods from their territory.
A telling sign of changes ahead are new producer-prices published in St
Petersburg which show meat rising from Rbs7 a kilo more than twelve-fold to
Rbs90. Beer, which is virtually unobtainable in state shops, will be sold to
retailers for Rbs20-30, up from the present official price of Rbs3-5. The
minimum wage only recently went up to Rbs200 a month.
Price liberalisation is being presented by the Russian government as the
keystone to market reform. But a senior Western financial official said
today's rises were primarily a political measure since there was no real
monetary, budgetary or privatisation policy in place. The main merit would
be to start irreversible change, paving the way for a comprehensive economic
reform programme to be agreed with the International Monetary Fund and other
experts.
The reform was also an attempt to break the power of local mafias, which had
thrived on seven decades of fixed low prices, and to 'show other republics
who is the boss'.
Like many shops, the doors of Gastronom No 45 were closed yesterday, with
New Year's Day still the country's most cherished public holiday. Inside, Mr
Alexander Sokolov, the supermarket's director, was beavering away with his
book-keepers to prepare for the new prices. He said after 74 years of
communist rule, it would take a few weeks for supplies to begin to improve.
While he was sure of receiving his supplies of bread in time for today, he
was still hoping some milk would arrive overnight after a week of having
none at all on his shelves.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Recession worse than expected, admits Major: PM defends
Lamont's performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR admitted yesterday that the UK recession was proving 'deeper
and longer' than he had expected and warned that harsh international trading
conditions were holding back the recovery he believed was under way.
However, the prime minister firmly backed Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
against recent attacks on the Treasury's handling of the economy -
signalling a determination to ride out the political storm over the
recession.
He dismissed a sterling devaluation as a 'silly way to proceed' and said
interest rates would rise if necessary to defend the pound. He ruled out
taking 'short-term risks' with the economy to boost Tory support ahead of
the general election.
Despite his relative gloom about UK prospects and his fears of a developing
international recession, he insisted that a 'jagged and irregular' recovery
had started in the UK.
'If for example one looks back at the 1981 recession, we can now see, in
retrospect, that recovery was starting at exactly the moment most people
were gloomy and believed they would never see it,' he said.
He hinted, however, that downward revisions to official growth forecasts
could result from the gloomy world economic climate.
Speaking on BBC Radio he implicitly accepted that Mr Lamont was facing
fierce pressure from within Tory ranks and outside.
But he said: 'This criticism focusing upon the chancellor is not fair and I
myself do not share it.' Mr Lamont was doing a 'difficult job extremely
well'.
Mr Major said the US, Germany and Japan were 'all moving towards recession.
Growth is falling away in all those countries.' Many other countries were
either in recession or are moving towards it. 'That international
environment is holding back recovery in this country.'
His wariness at painting too optimistic a picture for the economy at this
stage will add to speculation that he plans to call the general election for
May or later, rather than early spring.
He spoke of Britain 'moving out of recession in the months ahead towards an
acceptable level of growth' - a view partially endorsed by most economists
who believe the recession will drag to a close in 1992.
The prime minister faces mounting pressure at Westminster as Labour seeks to
intensify political activity in the run-up to the election and pin blame for
the recession on the prime minister.
Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, said it was 'preposterous' for the
government to blame other countries for Britain's problems.
'In the past they have blamed Labour governments and the trade unions, now
it appears it is foreigners once again,' he said.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, said: 'Britain has
great opportunities but it will never seize those opportunities if it
pretends that recession will simply go away.'
On the precariousness of Treasury economic forecast, the prime minister went
further than Mr Lamont's comments in an interview with the FT earlier this
week. Forecasts depended on the assumptions on which they were based -
including the economic performance of international trading partners, Mr
Major said.
'If the assumptions change. . . then clearly it blows back on what happens
in this country - and that is happening.'
In November's Autumn Statement, the Treasury was more upbeat than most
independent forecasting groups, predicting gross domestic product would grow
by 2.3 per cent in 1992 after a fall of 2 per cent last year (1991).
Mr Major used the interview to distance himself further on the broader
political stage from the ideology of his predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
setting out a vision of 'one nation' Toryism.
Asked if he believed greed and materialism had gone to far in the 1980s boom
years, he replied: 'I think that is probably true, often perhaps for
understandable reasons.'
He said he did not object to people getting very rich, 'if they do so by
their own efforts'.
But earlier he had hinted in a new year message to Conservative party
activists that the government planned to cut inheritance tax allowing the
affluent to pass on a greater proportion of their wealth.
In the BBC interview, he saw no scope for private medical insurance
replacing the NHS. 'This is one of the few countries in the world where you
can be guaranteed good and prompt health treatment if you are seriously ill.
Nothing I would do now or in the future would damage that,' he pledged.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Business leaders predict gloom for election year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FAZEY, RICHARD DONKIN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S election campaign over the next six months will be fought against
a background of deep economic gloom, according to leading economists, chief
executives and trade union leaders, write FT reporters.
In a Financial Times survey of new year forecasts published today, most of
the 23 groups of economists from the City, universities and independent
think-tanks say the Treasury's November prediction of a 2.3 per cent rise in
gross domestic product this year is too optimistic.
Instead, the average forecast for output growth is about 1.7 per cent
between 1991 and 1992, with unemployment likely to climb to 2.7m. With the
pound continuing to struggle as the weakest currency in the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the government may face having to take the
politically unpopular step of raising interest rates from their current 10.5
per cent. This follows the increases made by other ERM members just before
Christmas.
In the FT survey, economists generally take a bullish view of prospects for
interest-rate cuts in the longer term. They expect rates to have fallen to
9.5 per cent by the end of 1992, with retail price inflation at a
year-on-year rate of 3.7 per cent. However, these potentially positive
points appear elusive to many industry leaders. Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman
and chief executive of ICL, the UK computer group owned by Fujitsu of Japan,
said the next 12 months would be 'extremely tough'.
While Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries,
believes 1992 will usher in 'modest' growth, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman
of glassmaker Pilkington, said: 'For planning purposes, we are assuming that
1992 will be much the same as 1991.'
From the banking world, Mr Peter Burt, chief general manager of the Bank of
Scotland, said: 'There is is not yet any sign of an improvement in economic
conditions.' Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank concurred. He said
1991 saw the 'worst collapse' of business confidence since the 1930s.
Prospects were little better for the new year. Mr Brian Pearse, chief
executive of Midland Bank, said ministers could take an important step to
revive the economy by calling an early election. Consumer spending was
unlikely to increase before people knew whether they would have to pay
higher taxes under Labour, he said.
Small businesses will continue to have a tough time, said Mr John Townend
MP, chairman of the smaller business committee of Conservative backbenchers.
The long period of high real interest rates was still exerting a
'debilitating' effect on many small companies, he said.
Mr Roger Bootle, of Greenwell Montagu, said: 'The man in the street may not
see any economic improvement at all because all the things he knows and
cares about - unemployment, house prices and business failures - will still
be getting worse.'
Some are arguing that the government should change tack. Mr Michael
Saunders, an economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, the US
investment bank, says Mr Lamont should refrain from referring to a recovery
in the not-too-distant future, and instead 'start to prepare people
psychologically for the difficult period over the next two years during
which growth will be extremely muted'.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'People are
still struggling with the large hangover of debt from the economic boom of
the 1980s. This hasn't been a normal recession, and we won't see a normal
recovery.'
The picture is little different seen from the perspective of trade unions.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said business
confidence had yet to return and more large-scale redundancies were in
prospect. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU general union, said:
'Everybody I speak to is immersed in gloom.'

FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE records its best gain of 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD year closed with the FT-SE Index achieving its best daily gain for
1991 as the London stock market responded enthusiastically to Wall Street's
overnight jump to fresh record levels. Also helping equities was the firm
rejection by the UK chancellor of the exchequer of sterling devaluation
suggestions.
The Footsie advanced 73.1 to 2,493.1, bringing the gain on the year to
around 16.3 per cent. Wall Street's renewed surge caught London unawares on
Tuesday and, with the institutions mostly out of the market ahead of the
year-end, share prices were left to the marketmakers. They, in turn,
struggled with technical pressures imposed by the expiry of the FT-SE
December futures and options contracts.
The futures expiry, between 10.10 and 10.30am, dominated the half-day
trading session. Of total Seaq-reported trading volume of 318.1m shares,
around 80m changed hands in the two hours before the futures expiry. In
Monday's full-day session 294.8m were traded.
At Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mr Richard Kersley commented that the London
market was still regarded as 'good value', if only the domestic economy
would show some signs of improvement. Unfortunately, on Tuesday, while the
equity market was racing ahead, the Confederation of British Industry
sharply reduced its 1992 growth forecast for the UK.
A steadier performance by sterling following the Financial Times interview
with Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, helped soothe some immediate
worries. But the possibility that UK base rates will be forced to follow the
ERM trend upwards, rather than the US and Japanese trend downwards,
continued to unsettle financial markets.
Tuesday's strongest gains came from the US-orientated stocks, which also
benefited from last-minute window dressing by fund managers putting the best
gloss on portfolios ahead of meetings with their trustees.
Glaxo, Wellcome, Rothmans International, Reuters and Reckitt &amp; Colman all
recorded substantial rises, but with ICI standing out with a gain of 6.7 per
cent. There were very few exceptions to the general advance, although some
insurance issues remained unsettled by worries over their mortgage indemnity
problems.
More surprisingly, many interest rate-related and consumer stocks moved
ahead in spite of the continued concern over sterling and the outlook for
base rates. Muted optimism regarding the Christmas sales season helped Marks
and Spencer, Kingfisher and Great Universal Stores, while the leading
brewers also gained ground.
After the futures expiry, equities settled down for a while. However, the
excitement soon resumed as such few traders as were in the City took the
view that Wall Street had further to run and that it would be fatal to be
left out of the Christmas rally in London. Since the beginning of Christmas
week the Footsie has risen by 135 points or 5.7 per cent, largely in
response to Wall Street's bullish reaction to the cut in the Federal
Reserve's discount rate.
Traders must now wait to see whether the investment fund managers, who have
been on the sidelines for the past fortnight, will drive prices higher in
the new year or take the opportunity to realise profits once the annual
portfolio valuation is completed.

FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BICC lags the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY FAR the worst individual performance of the Footsie constituents on New
Year's Eve came from BICC, the heavy electricals-to-construction group.
An initial rise to 314p for the stock was quickly eroded as a single trade
of 958,000 shares at 312p triggered a widespread mark-down by marketmakers.
The trade, however, was said by dealers to have represented the completion
of a bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal, one of many that were carried
out first thing on Tuesday morning.
The deal accounted for much of the total turnover in BICC stock which was
finally 1.2m shares. Another reason for the stock's weakness was its
impending departure from the FT-SE 100 index as from today. The shares
closed 9 off on balance at 303p.
A number of analysts, however, take a bullish view of BICC's prospects. In a
recent review of the electricals sector, Mr Jim Ross of Hoare Govett said
the shares are 'oversold' after falling 29 per cent in the past three
months. The Hoare analyst added that BICC 'is well placed to benefit from an
expected improvement in the cables market, and worries about the financial
position have been overplayed'.
Drug issues responded to a euphoria of buying interest triggered mostly by
the steep gains on Wall Street. Wellcome, still buoyed by hopes that its new
treatment for Aids will prove successful, were driven up 35 more to 1101p on
keen turnover of 1.5m shares.
Fisons, responding to the company's defiance in the face of US regulatory
criticism, forged ahead 15 to 326p for a two-day gain of 33.
Glaxo, one of the equity market's best performers over the past year, shot
up 40 to 853p amid a flurry of Continental and US buying interest.
SmithKline Beecham, heavily favoured by international pharmaceutical
analysts over the past few months, jumped 43 to 896p.
US funds were said to have been big buyers of ICI shares, which leapt 76 to
1210p on good turnover of 1.8m. Laporte, included in the Footsie index as
from today, moved ahead 35 to 620p.
The market delivered its own verdict on the outcome of the Christmas selling
period in pushing most of the top quality food retailers higher, along with
many of the general high street retailers. But it reserved judgment on
Ratners, the troubled jewellery chain, whose shares came under more selling
pressure and finished 3 lower at 27p.
Of the leading retailers, Marks and Spencer drew strong support, closing 10
1/2 ahead at 278 1/2 p, while Kingfisher added 15 at 482p and Dixons 8 at
205p.
J. Sainsbury raced up 12 to 377p and Tesco 10 to 227p, while Asda put on 2
1/2 to 34 1/2 p.
Tottenham Hotspur returned to the market and touched 105p before closing at
100p, ex-rights, with the new nil-paid shares quoted at  1/4 p premium.
The sharp rises in the market dragged up an oil sector still fretting about
its recent decline and the poor outlook for crude oil prices. On Tuesday,
Brent crude for February delivery came under renewed downward pressure,
losing a further 20 cents to around Dollars 17.60 a barrel.
However, stock shortages and the prospect of US investors pushing Wall
Street even higher when it opened for Tuesday trading led London dealers to
hoist share prices of the leading oils.
Shell Transport rallied 17 to 498p on relatively good turnover of 3.5m
shares, while BP put on 14 to 293p on 6m traded.
British Gas, buffeted in recent weeks by worries about the regulatory
regime, moved up 6 to 265p with 6.8m shares changing hands.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, ran up 13 to 470p, shrugging off the
effect of yet another profits downgrade. The latest reduction in earnings
projections was reported to have come from SG Warburg Securities. Turnover
in RTZ was a low 800,000 shares.
The power generators, upset recently by regulatory concerns, attracted a
flurry of institutional demand which left National Power 5 higher at 145p
and PowerGen 4 1/2 better at 155 1/2 p.
Bank shares shrugged aside recent worries concerning the possibility of
exceptionally heavy provisons against bad debts, with dealers taking the
view that most of the bad news is already in the share prices.
Abbey National, virtually bad-debt free compared with the high street banks,
rose 12 to 295p, but TSB, still burdened by bad debt worries, could only
manage a gain of 2 at 119p.
Composite insurers were pushed sharply higher but for the notable exception
of Guardian Royal Exchange, which just managed to hold steady at 111p.

David Cavers, business manager of NORWICH UNION HEALTHCARE since it was
formed last year, will become managing director next April. He succeeds
Patrick Smith, who moves to assistant general manager responsible for
personal insurances at Norwich Union.
The arrival of Norwich Union and other commercial insurers in a market
currently dominated by provident associations is among factors making
private health insurance increasingly competitive.
Others include rising healthcare costs and the effects of the recession on
the growth of the market. Cavers was chief commercial executive at Private
Patients Plan - one of the providents - before joining Norwich Union.

FT  02 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON NEW YEAR'S Eve the December stock index future and the Footsie traded
options expired with the predictable hectic activity, as traders moved
between derivatives and the underlying stock market.
The operation, however, was turned up to full heat by London's response to
the unexpected fresh surge on Wall Street to a new peak on the Dow, as well
as by the calmer tone of sterling following Mr Norman Lamont's Christmas
interview in the Financial Times. Futures traders said Wall Street had
provided the chief impetus, while sterling, and the consequent outlook for
UK base rates, remained potentially unsettling factors.
The futures sector quietened down after the December expiry was concluded,
but the March contract later provided a strong lead for underlying equities
by moving to a premium of around 60 points, against an estimated 30-point
fair value premium - the premium which takes account of financing and
dividend flows.
In traded options, the FT-SE contract was similarly active and later trading
was featured by significant buying of calls on January option series. A
large buyer for the January 2,450 and 2,350 was identified in the market.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Appointments: B-M's international reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Larry Snoddon, president of BURSON-MARSTELLER's European operations, is
returning to New York to become chief executive of the world's second
biggest public relations firm.
Snoddon's promotion is part of a top management reshuffle in which the
agency is also creating two new positions; Thomas Bell and Thomas Mosser
both become chief operating officers. Bell, a relatively recent recruit to
B-M, remains in Washington, but Mosser, president of B-M Americas, will be
based in London. James Lindheim will take over as chairman of B-M's European
operations overseeing 23 offices in 15 countries and a staff of 750.
B-M seems to have fared better than Shandwick and Hill &amp; Knowlton, its two
biggest rivals, in the current economic downturn. Under Snoddon, B-M Europe
has tripled its income in four years and the group's worldwide revenues are
expected to rise by about 5 per cent, to Dollars 220m this year, with a
similar sort of growth budgeted for next year.
B-M, which employs around 2,000 staff worldwide, provides around a third of
the profits of the privately-owned Young &amp; Rubicam group. The 46-year-old
Snoddon believes that its recent success may partly reflect the fact that it
does not face the same sort of short-term financial pressures as a public
company.

FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Latin America rewards believers - But a
few clouds have appeared on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA'S stock markets put on a strik-ing performance in the 499th
year after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. And most
followers of emerging markets believe that they have a good chance of faring
well in the 500th.
The most important markets - Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico - together
gave investors total returns in dollar terms of 106.4 per cent in the first
11 1/2 months of 1991, according to the International Finance Corporation.
The Argentine market more than quadrupled investors' money, with a total
return of 323 per cent; Brazil, in spite of its economic travails and
galloping inflation, more than doubled it; returns on Mexico were 92.7 per
cent, Colombia 141 per cent, Chile 87 per cent and Venezuela more than 30
per cent. Against this, the rest of the world looked pedestrian.
The optimism fuelling these gains was built on a number of premises.
Economic reform continues apace in many countries, and there is a fair
chance of debt restructuring agreements for two of the region's bigger
economies, Argentina and Brazil. Both factors offer the prospect of a
renewal of economic growth.
Evidence continues that residents are bringing their so-called flight
capital home, some of it into equities. 'Latin American markets still have
quite a lot of room to grow,' says Mr Marc Wenhammer, fund manager at the
London-based Latin American Securities, which manages about Dollars 500m in
equity investments.
The horizon is not cloudless, however. The strength of the markets,
particularly Mexico, since early 1990 has encouraged significant new issues
of equity, especially into the international markets. Together with the
privatisation issues, many see a danger of markets being overwhelmed.
Market watchers are aware of the risk that the big build-up of foreign
capital in some markets could be sharply reversed. Ms Caroline Tillott of
John Govett in London points out that foreign investment in the Mexican
market quadrupled this year to almost Dollars 17bn, a fifth of market
capitalisation. According to Mr Lincoln Rathnam of Scudder, Stevens &amp;
Clark's emerging markets group in New York, foreigners hold half of Telmex,
the state telephone group privatised last year which accounts for a third of
the Mexican market.
Troubles in the negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
being discussed between the US, Canada and Mexico, could hit sentiment in
Mexico. As it stands, the market drops on every hint from Washington that
agreement might not be possible in a US election year. Mexico and others
also suffer directly from US economic weakness.
A loss of confidence in Mexico could quickly rebound on to the other
markets. But investors have had to become accustomed to volatility.
As in other emerging markets, they have also grown used to practices frowned
on in more developed markets. Asked about insider trading, for example, Mr
Rathnam says: 'There are few violations because in most places it is not
illegal.' Many companies are still family held and the float of readily
traded stock tends to be small: management dealings in the stock thus often
have an undue influence on prices.
Reading balance sheets also has its perils. Inflation of the levels
prevailing in Brazil of more than 20 per cent a month distorts company
results, as it biases their trading in favour of financial, over productive,
activities.
In spite of this, fund managers say that, in terms of access, Latin America
is better than many other emerging markets. There are rules that limit the
speed with which an investor can sell shares bought in Chile, but exchange
restrictions are no longer widespread. Most of the important exchanges have
been modernised: fund managers claim that clearing and settlement is
generally good. One notorious exception is Venezuela, but even here
modernisation is expected in 1992.
Most of the markets, however, remain illiquid, meaning that it can be
difficult to sell stock when sentiment turns. On the other hand, the ratios
of market capitalisation to gross national product are such that further
market growth seems inevitable.
According to Mr Wenhammer, the ratios of share price to earnings (on a
historical basis) are 12 in Mexico, 14 in Chile, 24 in Venezuela and less
than 6 in Brazil. With the exception of Mexico, these figures are based on
small samples of stocks and should be treated with caution. However, they
suggest that Venezuela is generously valued and that Brazil would have
enormous potential if its economy were to be put back on track.
Mr Alexander Zagoreos of Lazard Freres Asset Management in New York is an
investor in mutual funds. As such, he avoids some of the liquidity problems
associated with direct investment.
He has for some time been overweight in Latin America: not difficult, as the
world stock market indices used by many fund managers do not include a Latin
American market. He points out that a weighting of 0.5 per cent in Korea at
the beginning of the 1980s would have been enough to ensure that a fund
manager was rated in the top 25 per cent through much of the decade, even if
he just matched the indices in the rest of the portfolio.
That shapes his view about Latin America: if the markets perform as
expected, returns will be high; if they collapse, then the effect on his
portfolio will be limited, because such a small sum is invested.

FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends the year at record
high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES paused for breath on New Year's Eve after six days of strong
gains, yet in spite of some profit-taking and computerised program selling,
Wall Street managed to end the day and year firmer at a new record high.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.92 at 3,168.83,
making an advance of 535 points or 20.3 per cent for the whole of 1991. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.95 at 417.09, also a new
all-time high, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks joined
in the record-making, climbing 6.59 to 586.34.
Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 248.5m shares,
exceptionally heavy for the last day of the year, while advancing issues
outnumbered declines by 1,244 to 600.
Although the market opened in confident mood, the Dow climbing more than 20
points in the first hour of trading, there were plenty of investors willing
to take profits on some of their recent gains, and by midday the main
indices were showing modest losses.
A round of program selling also contributed to the downturn, but by the end
of the session the losses had been clawed back and the market finished
slightly firmer on balance. This enabled the Dow to register its fourth
record in as many days and brought the curtain down on the best-ever
December for US equities.
Among individual stocks, SmithKline Beecham moved ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 79 5/8 after the group won approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration to market Relafen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
used in the treatment of ulcers.
On the way down were two big banking issues. Chemical Bank relinquished
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 7/8 and Manufacturers Hanover receded Dollars 1
5/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 after the two groups formally completed their merger
and revealed that the new combined holding company would be taking a bigger
than envisioned fourth-quarter charge of Dollars 625m to cover the costs of
the link-up.
Carolco slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 1 7/8 as investors sold the stock
after news that the troubled film-making group had offered to buy back all
of its 14 per cent senior notes at a discount.
Profit-taking took its toll of some of the leading stocks which have enjoyed
big gains in the year-end rally, with Philip Morris surrendering Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 79 3/4 in a volume of 2.6m shares, IBM losing Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 89 and Coca-Cola shedding Dollars 1 to Dollars 80 1/4 .
On the over-the-counter market, very heavy demand lifted Amgen Dollars 6 3/8
to Dollars 75 3/4 in turnover of almost 6m shares.
Canada
TORONTO mirrored the Wall Street movements in thin trading, with the market
fluctuating as participants worked to square positions ahead of the end of
the session and the year.
The composite index was finally a net 6.5 firmer at 3,512.4, leaving a rise
for 1991 of 255.7 points or 7.8 per cent. Advances led falls by 386 to 224
after a volume of 19.5m shares.
The gold sub-group index stood out with a gain of 4.59 per cent. Gold
bullion was quoted at USDollars 354.25 an ounce in New York, up Dollars 1.25
from Monday's close.

FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: New York's strength again inspires rest
of the world
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET'S strength inspired those markets open on Tuesday. All leading
markets were shut yesterday.
PARIS gained further ground, but the CAC 40 index closed below the day's
high of 1,787.70 at 1,765.11, up 23.80 on the day and 16 per cent on the
year. Turnover was about FFr3bn, swelled by end-of-year window dressing and
arbitrage as index futures expired.
MADRID also firmed. The general index added 4.13 at 246.24, for a gain of 10
per cent during 1991. Turnover was moderate at about Pta15bn, down from
Pta27bn.
MILAN encountered some profit-taking, but the Comit index still closed 3.21
higher at 507.76 - a fall on the year of 2 per cent. Generali dampened
enthusiasm by falling L80 to an official close of L28,220, but it recovered
later to L28,350.
HONG KONG closed the year at a record. The Hang Seng index gained 22.13 to
4,297.33, up 42 per cent during 1991.
Other Asia Pacific markets also rose, with AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index
and SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial both ending the year up 29 per
cent, NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 up 25 per cent, and KUALA LUMPUR's composite up
10 per cent, as KARACHI's index hit a record high of 1,672, up 33 on the

FT  02 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Quiet end to 1991
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONEY markets ended 1991 on a quiet note with little change in interest
rates in the main market centres before the new year holiday.
In London the key three months inter-bank rate was unchanged at 11-10 15/16
per cent, with dealers still anticipating a  1/2 point rise in base rates
early this year.
Six months money was also unchanged at 11-10 15/16 per cent and one year
money was steady at 10 15/16 - 13/16 per cent.
Money dealers said the pressures from the rise in German interest rates
before Christmas continue to be felt in the London market.
Sterling's weakness inside the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System raises the possibility that the UK will be forced to follow
other European governments and raise British interest rates.
The differential between market rates and base rates could also put pressure
on the banking system and eventually force the government to concede higher
rates.
On Tuesday, however, sterling was slightly firmer against the D-Mark and
this took some of the immediate pressure off market rates.
This was reflected in the futures market, where the March short sterling
contract rose slightly as the pound gained in strength.
The March contract finished 2 basis points higher at 89.21, having traded
between 89.16 and 89.23. The March contract currently implies an interest
rate of 10.79 per cent.
In the cash market, overnight money rates fell as the Bank of England once
again initially provided the market with more than enough liquidity for its
daily credit needs.
The Bank began by forecasting a large money market shortage of Pounds 1.4bn.
Maturing treasury bills and assistance drained Pounds 696m, while bills
repurchased by the market absorbed a further Pounds 821m.
Exchequer transactions drained Pounds 150m and bankers balances below target
a further Pounds 70m. This was partly offset by a fall in the note
circulation which added Pounds 325m of liquidity.
Across the rest of Europe, French rates continued to firm despite an
injection of liquidity by the Bank of France. Call money rose to 10- 13/16
per cent from 10 5/8 - 3/4 per cent. Dealers said the failure of the franc
to respond to the rise in French interest rates was behind the rise in
market rates.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressures on sterling ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURES on sterling eased slightly on Tuesday after Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor of the exchequer, warned that there would be no devaluation
of the pound in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
With little business being transacted in the currency markets ahead of the
new year holiday, dealers said it had taken only a small amount of buying
interest to boost the pound.
In particular, traders welcomed Mr Lamont's strong rejection of calls from
within his own party for a realignment of the ERM currencies.
Further support for sterling came from the Confederation of British
Industry. Mr Brian Corby, the CBI president, said it would be 'absolutely
foolish' to contemplate a devaluation. He added that a devaluation could
lead to higher interest rates.
As trading in the London market drew to a close, sterling was quoted at
DM2.8375, unchanged from Monday's close; it was higher at Dollars 1.8710
from Dollars 1.8670.
In spite of sterling's modest recovery, it still remained firmly at the
bottom of the ERM. The Spanish peseta - the strongest currency in the ERM
grid - was 6.2 per cent above the pound, just below the level at which the
Bank of England would be forced to defend the UK currency.
Many analysts still believe the pressure on sterling will eventually force
the government to raise interest rates. With money market rates at 11 per
cent, signalling a  1/2 point rise in base rates, those pressures are likely
to grow as the new year begins.
The impact of the Bundesbank's decision to lift interest rates before
Christmas is likely to be felt throughout the ERM this month unless German
rates ease back. But with German inflation not yet under control, dealers
said there was unlikely to be any relief from the Frankfurt money markets.
The dollar was steady to slightly firmer against the D-Mark. Analysts noted
that since the reduction in Japanese interest rates, the dollar had
stabilised and was beginning to edge modestly higher against European
currencies.
However, it continued to weaken against the yen. Dealers believed the yen's
strength against the dollar had been encouraged by Japanese monetary
authorities and was a response to the visit to Japan of Mr George Bush, the
US president.
The yen's rise against the dollar would allow US exports to become more
competitive in Asian markets and would help deflect attention away from the
politically sensitive issue of Japan's trade surplus with the US.
Trading is likely to remain thin for the rest of this week and the market is
not expected to be back to full strength until Monday. The release of the
December US purchasing managers survey today will be closely examined for
signs of recovery.
The dollar closed at DM1.5170 from DM1.5200 and at Y124.95 from Y125.70.

FT  02 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian private sector hit
by high interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian private sector has been through its most difficult 12 months
in the past decade as recession and high interest rates have eaten into
profitability.
The evaluation comes from the research group Tecnica Assessoria de Mercado
de Capitais e Empresarial after a study of results for the first nine months
of the year filed with Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios, Brazil's stock
market watchdog.
Of the 10 sectors analysed by the group, seven showed a decline in profits
with airlines among those under most pressure.
Although the airline industry boasted higher sales than the previous year,
profits were hit by high interest rates as the sector staggered under the
weight of heavy indebtedness. Losses for the sector in the first nine months
of the year were Dollars 239m.
The capital goods sector ran up a Dollars 60m loss over the period, while
the car parts sector ended the period Dollars 81m in the red.
Paper and cellulose companies were hit by a fall in domestic consumption and
an overvalued cruzeiro, which cut into exports. Aracruz, the sector leader,
suffered a loss of Dollars 47m for the period.
The car sector also had a bad year. Price controls devastated profits for
the first nine months of 1991. Since price ceilings were lifted a few months
ago, huge price rises have allowed companies to recuperate some of their
losses.
Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications group, was the star of the
Brazilian stock market this year thanks to keen interest on the part of
foreign investors. The group, which has the highest market capitalisation in
the country, forecast net profits of Dollars 1bn a few weeks ago. Later, the
group changed the estimate to about Dollars 700m, after Dollars 300m was set
aside for possible losses in an employee law suit against the group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE new banking group created by the merger of Chemical Banking and
Manufacturers Hanover announced on Tuesday it will have to take a
bigger-than-expected fourth quarter charge against earnings to cover the
expenses related to the link-up.
The merger to form the new group, Chemical Banking Corporation, was formally
completed this week.
Original estimates were that a charge of Dollars 550m would be required to
finance the deal, but the cost of the merger proved greater than expected
and the charge has increased to Dollars 625m.
The new Chemical, however, said it expected annual savings to be realised
from the merger would be Dollars 750m by 1995. If this target was met, it
would be Dollars 100m greater than first estimated.
Chemical also announced plans to raise Dollars 1.25bn in a January stock
offering, the proceeds of which will be used to boost the group's capital
base.
The new bank has assets of about Dollars 140bn and shareholders' equity of
more than Dollars 7bn, making it the second largest bank in the US behind
Citicorp.

FT  02 JAN 92 / International Company News: Harsh winter for Canada's
forestry industry - FCC's shift in strategy as it adjusts to the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discomfort has turned to agony in Canada's embattled forestry industry.
Instead of the gradual recovery which pulp, paper and timber producers were
hoping for in late 1991, many companies are girding themselves for the
heaviest losses of the year in the fourth quarter.
The sombre reality is sinking in that this pillar of the Canadian economy
not only faces the rigours of an unexpectedly deep recession, but must also
move more quickly to adjust to some severe structural handicaps. Canada's
declining competitiveness in commodity pulp and newsprint grades, its
distance from supplies of paper for recycling, high labour costs and strict
environmental laws are among the factors forcing changes well beyond a
simple tightening of corporate belts.
Among the companies taking the most drastic action is Fletcher Challenge
Canada (FCC), 72 per cent owned by New Zealand's biggest company.
Vancouver-based FCC is cutting its product range, moving away from
low-margin commodity grades and wood products, to more specialised,
value-added businesses. It is selling some assets and seeking foreign
partners - preferably customers - for others. Last, but not least, it is
putting the squeeze on costs.
The shift in strategy will cut FCC's virgin newsprint capacity to 446,000
tonnes in 1992, less than half its 1989 output. Similarly, its equity share
of market pulp will slide from 931,000 tonnes to 585,000 tonnes.
On the other hand, it expects to add almost 300,000 tonnes of capacity in
recycled and special-grade newsprint, as well as expand a pioneering  - and
profitable - venture at its Elk Falls mill on Vancouver Island which makes
pulp from sawdust.
A common thread running through the shake-up is a profound disquiet with the
business environment in Canada. While FCC will remain one of western
Canada's biggest forestry companies, its centre of gravity is moving
unmistakably southward.
Mr Doug Whitehead, FCC's chief operating officer, notes that the government
of British Columbia, which owns the province's forests, has made no fewer
than 23 changes in tree-cutting rules in the past five years. On the other
side of the country, Quebec's eagerness to increase local ownership helped
persuade FCC to sell its 45 per cent stake in Donohue St Felicien, which
runs a softwood pulp mill and four sawmills.
By contrast, FCC is broadening its business south of the border. It is
already the biggest newsprint supplier to California, and is negotiating a
partnership to build a recycled newsprint plant in the US. FCC has also
bought a 50 per cent stake in a corrugated packaging company in Washington
state.
The forestry business was Fletcher Challenge's first big investment in North
America. The New Zealand company bought Crown Forest Industries and 72 per
cent of British Columbia Forest Products in quick succession in the
mid-1980s. The two companies are managed as one, but, as a legal entity, FCC
consists only of the former BCFP. Crown Forest is held through the New
Zealand parent.
The combined operations contribute almost two thirds of Fletcher Challenge's
pulp and paper revenues, which in turn made up 28 per cent of its total 1990
turnover. The presence in the US and Canada has had another important
benefit in helping to broaden its access to capital.
Last year alone, Fletcher Challenge raised over USDollars 600m in debt from
US and Canadian financial institutions. About 18 per cent of its voting
equity is now held in North America.
But the operating performance of the North American forestry interests has
become a serious concern. FCC - the former BCFP alone - lost CDollars 43.5m
in the first nine months of the year. The loss for the year as a whole is
likely to be well over CDollars 60m. The company declines to disclose losses
inclusive of operations of the former Crown Forest.
Singling out Canadian pulp, paper and wood products as the biggest drain on
the parent's earnings, Mr Hugh Fletcher, the New Zealand group's chief
executive, said last summer 'the decline in competitiveness and in product
prices has been much more severe than we envisaged. We need fundamental
change of both the macro settings and our overall involvement'.
FCC is moving on several fronts. It has sold or closed several sawmills as
well as plywood and panel factories in British Columbia. The sale of its
interest in Quebec's Donohue St Felicien in late December raised CDollars
85m (USDollars 73.9m)in cash plus a CDollars 35m promissory note.
It is seeking a buyer for up to half the flagship Crofton complex on
Vancouver Island, which is one of North America's biggest newsprint and
kraft pulp mills. Similarly, FCC is talking to a Japanese customer about
taking a stake in - or buying outright - two wood-products plants in the
British Columbia interior.
A CDollars 300m modernisation at Crofton, now in its final stages, paves the
way for production of a wider variety of special pulps blended from hemlock,
fir and cedar chips. FCC claims the mill will be among the cleanest in the
world.
One consolation for FCC is that it is not alone in its plight. Mr Ross
Hay-Roe, analyst at Research Capital in Vancouver, expects almost all
Canada's leading forestry companies to report higher fourth quarter losses.
Newsprint prices have continued to slide.
North American pulp producers raised their prices on December 1, but this
will not compensate for lower returns in October and November. One of the
few bright spots in recent weeks has been a sudden drop in the Canadian
dollar, which has helped push up the share prices of most Canadian forestry
companies.
Mr Whitehead's predictions include a spate of mergers and takeovers, the
closure of several more newsprint machines and mounting pressure on trade
unions and governments to ease the industry's weighty cost and regulatory
burden.
FCC has lagged behind its rivals in persuading customers to become equity
partners in newsprint and pulp mills. But in other respects, Mr Whitehead is
confident the company is 'at least a year ahead of everyone else' in
adjusting to a climate which is turning out to be as harsh as a Canadian
winter.
DSF owns a low-cost bleached softwood kraft pulp mill, with an annual
capacity of 300,000 tonnes, north of Quebec City. It also operates four
sawmills in Quebec.
Fletcher Challenge's sale of its interest in DSF is part of a wider disposal
of assets aimed a shifting the main focus of the company's North American
forestry operations from Canada to the US and reducing its exposure to low
margin lumber. Fletcher considered buying Donohue's interest in DSF, whose
pulp mill is one of the most efficient in Canada. But Mr Whitehead said the
Quebec government was keen to keep control of the company in Quebec hands.

SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, has increased its
investment in Czechoslovakia by agreeing to take control of the transport
division of Skoda, Pilsen, the country's largest engineering company.
The deal, under which Siemens will acquire 51 per cent of Skoda's transport
business, is valued at Dollars 105m, according to the International Finance
Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, which advises the Czech company.
The transport divisions of Krauss-Maffei and Krupp of Germany - Siemens has
a 25 per cent stake in both companies - will also take an undisclosed
portion of Siemens' holding.
Four weeks ago, Siemens won the race for control of Skoda, Pilsen's energy
division, valued at Dollars 170m, beating Westinghouse of the US and Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish concern. For both ventures, Siemens
has offered its Czech partners guarantees to maintain employment and retain
research and marketing facilities.
Siemens said it would start operating with the 3,500 employees in Skoda's
transport division, some 90 per cent of whom are working on contracts to
supply the former Soviet Union with electric locomotives. Siemens said its
first priority would be to retain this market.
The joint venture also plans to make suburban trains and underground railway
carriages, said Mr Ladislav Novotny, general manager of Skoda, Pilsen.
Siemens will use Skoda to help it fulfil its growing order book. In the
financial year to end-September 1991, orders for the German group's
transport division, expanded by the acquisition of the Duewag rail wagon
manufacturer, rose by 70 per cent to DM3bn (Dollars 1.8bn).

FT  02 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian market has best
returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian market posted the best returns of any government bond market
in 1991, providing total returns of 24.5 per cent for local currency
investors, 23 per cent for dollar-based investors and 25.3 per cent for
sterling-based investors, according to Kemper Investment Management.
Dollar-based currencies generally performed well over the year, with New
Zealand, Canada and the US also among the best, but their performance waned
towards the end of the year.
The strong appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar pushed bunds into
the top position for dollar-based investors in November and December.
Not surprisingly, Finland proved the weakest market in the fourth quarter,
due to the devaluation of the Finnish markka in November.
The four dollar markets also slid towards the bottom of the rankings in the
fourth quarter.
The gilts market ranked around the middle in all categories taken over the
year, but achieved the best returns for both dollar and sterling-based
investors in the third quarter.
All the 21 markets monitored by Kemper offered returns higher than coupons
in local currency, providing capital gains.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: French credit card processor buys 51% stake
in Nexus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLIGOS, the French electronic payments and credit card processing company,
has bought a 51 per cent stake in Nexus Payment Systems.
The deal means that Sligos enters the UK for the first time. Last year the
French concern, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 320m, bid
unsuccessfully against First Data Resources, a subsidiary of American
Express, for the Southend and Basildon card processing operations of Signet,
the Access credit card processing company.
Sligos is believed to have lost that deal because its bid was delayed
because the then Trade Secretary, Mr Peter Lilley, referred it to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The referral was based on the fact that
Sligos's parent, Credit Lyonnais is a state-owned bank.
Nexus was set up in 1989 to provide third party services for automated
teller machines and point of sale terminals to banks, building societies and
other financial services institutions, as well as telephone banking and
computer disaster recovery services.
Three non-executive directors will join the board of Nexus from Sligos.
Mr Rob Fairbrother, managing director of Nexus, said the link with Sligos
would help the company provide specialist cost-effective payment services to
large financial institutions.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: US bid activity down by almost a third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BID activity slumped by almost one-third last year in the US. Many of the
remaining deals which did take place, occurred in a small number of
consolidating sectors - such as commercial banking and cellular
communications.
According Securities Data, the US financial information group, only 4,464
deals were struck last year in the US, with a total value of Dollars 145.6bn
(Pounds 80bn) This compared with 5,150 transactions, with a value of Dollars
211.9bn in 1990.
However, activity in the US held up better than that worldwide. Global
statistics showed a 38 per cent decline, from 9,273 deals valued at Dollars
498.4bn in 1990 to 8,340 deals worth Dollars 311.5bn last year. European
merger volume fell sharply.
In the US, merger news was dominated by activity in the communications
sector - where GTE acquired Contel for Dollars 6.2bn, PacTel merged cellular
operations with those of Cellular Communications in a Dollars 2.98bn deal,
and Bell Atlantic bought Metro Mobile for Dollars 2.3bn - and in banking.
The latter included a Dollars 4.3bn merger between NCNB and C&amp;S Sovran, and
a Dollars 4.2bn deal between BankAmerica and Security Pacific.
The global league table of investment bank advisers was headed by Goldman
Sachs, advising on 126 deals with a combined value of Dollars 61.5bn. It was
followed, in descending order, by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman
Brothers and First Boston. SG Warburg of the UK was in sixth place; Salomon
Brothers held on to seventh position; and Schroders and Dillon Read, the
Lazard houses, completed the top 10.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Black in bid for Maxwell Israeli interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black's Canadian-based Hollinger group of newspapers is among
about 15 preliminary bidders seeking to acquire the late Robert Maxwell's
main newspaper interests in Israel, a company official said yesterday.
Mr Yehuda Levy, President of the Jerusalem Post, which Mr Black acquired
ahead of Mr Maxwell in 1979, said he had submitted a bid on Hollinger's
behalf to the administrators appointed to dispose of the British publisher's
Israeli holdings for the 84 per cent stake Maxwell held in Modi'in
publishing.
Modi'in owns Ma'ariv, the country's second biggest selling daily newspaper,
a Russian-language newspaper, a record company and other interests.
Other bids, which are understood to be priced around Dollars 15m, have been
made by a range of Israeli and diaspora Jewish investors ahead of the
December 31 1991 deadline for preliminary offers.
Mr Black, who last month headed a group which acquired the Fairfax group of
newspapers in Australia, owns the British Daily and Sunday Telegraph.
Hollinger came to Israel when it paid Dollars 20m for the Jerusalem Post,
easily outbidding Mr Maxwell, among others.
Management of the Daily News, the New York tabloid which is part of the late
Robert Maxwell's empire and which is currently under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, has told creditors that the end-December cash position stood at
Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.3m), writes Nikki Tait in New York.
In discussions with the creditors' committee - the body formed to represent
creditors in the bankruptcy process - management added that it was looking
for debtor-in-possession financing. This is a type of temporary loan
provided in bankruptcy situations, and the lender usually goes towards the
front of the creditors' queue.
Daily News management said that projections of the paper's finances through
to March 1 had been made and that further projections beyond that date would
be made this month. It suggested that projections to date showed 'adequate'
cash flow, adding that 'advertising and circulation remain strong'.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Grenfell ends year on top - A
year-end round-up of the UK's top merchant bank advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN GRENFELL finished 1991 as the UK's top merchant bank adviser,
according to the most recent survey by the FT Mergers &amp; Acquisitions
International magazine.
Preliminary figures show that Morgan Grenfell, which had been leading the
field for most of 1991, finished the year at the top of the table for the
first time since 1987. The bank now looks to have recovered fully from the
loss of command it suffered in the wake of the Guinness affair.
Optimists searching for signs of recovery in the debt and recession-hit UK
mergers and acquisitions market might take heart from the fact that Morgan
Grenfell's final total was almost 50 per cent higher than that with which
Baring Brothers filled the top slot a year ago.
In terms of deal volume and value the final quarter was the busiest of the
year. The top 10 banks in the table acted in 21 new qualifying bids, worth
Pounds 6.4bn. This compares with 19 bids worth Pounds 1.13bn in the third
quarter, 17 worth Pounds 1.3bn in the second quarter and 10 worth Pounds
2.1bn between January and March. Only bids for UK quoted companies which
have been declared unconditional, lapsed or referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, qualify for inclusion.
Morgan Grenfell clinched top spot in spite of not being involved in the
year's biggest new deals. These were BTR's Pounds 1.55bn bid for Hawker
Siddeley and Hanson's recommended offer for Beazer, which was worth about
Pounds 1.5bn when the value of debt assumed is included.
Baring Brothers, last year's number one UK adviser, dropped to sixth place.
Its only major credit was for advising Northern Telecom of Canada in its
purchase of STC. Lazard Brothers, which has had a poor year in this respect
at least, dropped to 14th place at the year end, from third place in the
1990 rankings. Lazards had no new qualifying UK deals in the final quarter.
Second-placed Goldman Sachs continues to be the strongest performing US
investment bank in the UK and is breathing down Morgan Grenfell's neck.
Goldman featured in only four bids for UK quoted companies in 1991, but the
three in which it acted for the target - BTR/Hawker, NorTel/STC and
Williams/Racal - totalled Pounds 3.65bn.
Goldman is still the only US bank in the top 10 in this table, but there are
a further three lurking just outside. SG Warburg leads the table which
includes overseas acquisitions and disposals by UK companies.
Goldman Sachs leads the international rankings for the fourth year in
succession, although its total is a third down on 1988, when the
international table first appeared. SG Warburg also performed strongly
internationally, shooting up to second place, from ninth a year ago.
US banks continue to dominate the table which covers cross-border activity
with a European leg, a market which many bankers argue is where the future
lies. Six of the top 10 are US banks, with Goldman Sachs almost inevitably
in pole position.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Regina's dead, long live Regina - The royal
jelly seller's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF REGINA Health and Beauty Products, the one-time USM star which sells
royal jelly, has any disgruntled shareholders, they were not to be found at
the group's annual meeting.
Regina's shares have fallen over the years from a high of 48.96p in August
1988, to 1.5p on Tuesday, and have been locked between 3p and a low of 1p
throughout this year. However, the first AGM with the group's new directors
in place and with just a handful of shareholders in attendance, passed all
the resolutions - including one to shorten the company's name to Regina -
without a murmur from the floor.
Shareholders are presumably placing their faith in the new management team,
led by Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, chairman and chief executive, who is supported
by Mr Paul Geoghegan, director, and Mr Anthony Shakesby, finance director.
Mrs Irene Stein, Regina's founder and former chairman who unexpectedly
resigned two years ago - though still remaining one of its largest
shareholders - was not present at Tuesday's meeting.
The new team, in place since early last year, has, it seems, done much to
bring the company back from its dire financial straits of a year ago.
At its previous financial year-end on June 30 1990, Regina reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.7m, owed the banks Pounds 150,000 and a further
Pounds 250,000 to Mrs Stein, and had negative net worth of Pounds 1.33m.
Since Mr Malik-Noor took over in March this year, all the group's borrowings
have been repaid with the exception of a small loan in Ireland. Mr
Malik-Noor was even able to convince Mrs Stein to reduce her claims to
Pounds 125,000, thereby saving the company a significant sum.
Employee numbers have been cut further from 85 to 31 and administrative
costs have fallen by almost a third to Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 3.41m). The
group's net worth is now positive, at Pounds 509,000, and the pre-tax loss
has been reduced to Pounds 505,000.
All of this in a year that has seen the group's core business of selling
royal jelly products slump in the face of the Gulf war and recession, with
sales plunging to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 5.7m). The extent of the downturn is
more pronounced than the figures indicate as this year covers 14 months
after the change of year-end to August 31.
Mr Malik-Noor is optimistic about the future, but shareholders in the group,
which faces a prolonged recession in major world markets, will need to place
considerable trust in the chairman himself.
Regina's return to better health this time was only possible due to Mr
Malik-Noor's generous Pounds 660,000 cash injection, via the exercising of
options granted to him. He also arranged a placing with investors, including
the Antonian Trust, to raise Pounds 180,000, bringing the total cash
injection to Pounds 840,000 by the year-end.
Since then Mr Malik-Noor has again arranged a further placing, raising
another Pounds 125,000 with 'two friendly shareholders', an unnamed overseas
investor and the Antonian Trust, the beneficiaries of which are unknown to
Mr Malik-Noor.
As a result, Regina's major shareholders are now Croxley Holdings, a
discretionary trust established by Mr Malik-Noor and whose beneficiaries
include members of his family, Mrs Irene Stein, Mr Malik-Noor himself and
the mysterious Antonian Trust.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Celebrations for Tottenham Hotspur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tottenham Hotspur, owner of the north London football club, has room to
celebrate. Mr Gary Lineker, Spurs' star striker, was awarded an OBE in the
New Year's honours list and yesterday the club clinched a 2-1 victory over
Coventry. After a 14 1/2 month suspension, Spurs' shares resumed trading on
Tuesday, rising 9p, to 100p. Nevertheless the celebratory mood in the stock
market is likely to be tinged with concern over what might happen to the
club's performance on the field, if it loses Mr Paul Gascoigne to Italy and
Mr Lineker to Japan.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK Company News: SE still favoured channel for announcements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST LISTED companies plan to continue releasing formal announcements
exclusively through the London Stock Exchange, despite being given the
freedom from today to make announcements to the stock market through other
channels.
This is the preliminary finding from a Stock Exchange survey of companies'
intentions, timed to coincide with the relaxation in publication rules.
News that few companies intend to use the new freedom to issue announcements
through channels other than the exchange will come as a disappointment to Mr
John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, who forced the exchange to give up
its monopoly on price-sensitive company announcements this autumn.
Companies must still lodge a copy of any announcement with the exchange, but
from today can also give it simultaneously to any other news vendors. This
will give rivals to Topic, the exchange's commercial information system,
greater opportunity to compete to publish news first.
However, many listed companies, while welcoming the increased competition,
fear the effect of a free-for-all in company news on the market for their
shares. The exchange has itself mounted a strong campaign in recent weeks to
persuade companies not to use rival information services.
In a letter to all listed companies last month, Ms Christine Dann, the
exchange's chief operating officer, warned of 'a high likelihood of
incomplete information reaching the market', prompting the exchange to
declare 'a period of indicative trading' - when market-makers do not have to
quote firm prices.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Failed French TV station seeks rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ADMINISTRATOR is expected to be appointed within the next few days to
take charge of La Cinq, the French television station which earlier this
week filed for bankruptcy, and to try to hammer out a rescue package for the
channel.
La Cinq, which has for some months been struggling against mounting losses,
filed for court protection against its creditors on Tuesday thereby becoming
the first significant casualty of the French government's television
deregulation drive. The administrator will analyse the state of affairs at
the station and try to devise a way of enabling it to stay on air.
The collapse of La Cinq, which was launched in 1986, marks a serious setback
for Hachette, the heavily-indebted French media group that has been running
the channel for the past 18 months. Hachette is, together with Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the controversial Italian media mogul, the biggest shareholder
in La Cinq with each owning 25 per cent of the equity.
Hachette first invested in La Cinq in May 1990 as part of the strategy
devised by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, its president, to turn the group into a
major player in television. The decision to file for bankruptcy followed
Hachette's failure to implement a drastic cost cutting package  - which
would have shed 292 of the station's 537 permanent staff and 292 out of 372
temporary employees leaving it to broadcast with a team of just 27
journalists.
Hachette, which has extensive interests in French book and newspaper
publishing as well as owning the rights to Elle magazine, incurred hefty
borrowings after a series of US acquisitions. Last week it told the Conseil
Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates the French TV system,
that it would not provide any additional capital for La Cinq, which lost an
estimated FFr1.12bn (Pounds 115.6m) - slightly more than its overall
turnover - in 1991 contributing to accumulated losses of around FFr3bn.
Other existing shareholders also refused to pour more money into La Cinq.
The other investors include Mr Robert Hersant, the right-wing French
newspaper baron, with 7.5 per cent and the French banks - Credit Lyonnais,
Societe Generale and Credit Commercial de France - together with GAN, one of
France's largest insurance groups, and Kleinwort Benson, the London-based
bank.
La Cinq has had a chequered history in its six years on the air. Its
introduction, combined with the privatisation of TF1 and the launches of
Canal Plus and M6 formed part of a TV deregulation programme intended to
offer new channels to French viewers by bringing private capital into the
system. However, La Cinq, which styled itself as 'family station' in spite
of being best known in France for its late night soft pornography, never
really succeeded in attracting enough viewers or advertising revenue.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Strong showing for UK pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK PENSION funds scored an average return of over 16 per cent in 1991, more
than recovering all their investment losses from the year before. However,
the strong performance means that net new cash flowing into pension funds is
running well below average and this is restricting fund mangers' investment
flexibility.
Returns on equities alone were a record 20 per cent, the best year for those
securities since the WM Company, which measures pension fund performance,
began keeping records in 1976. Returns on overseas equities totalled 21 per
cent.
The stellar performance of domestic and foreign equities has been
particularly significant for pension funds in the past year with average
weighting in those securities rising to a record 80 per cent. In 1990, the
average weighting was 70 per cent, while 10 years ago the average pension
fund had 56 per cent of its assets in equities.
WM Company's Stephen Gosztony says that there has been a switch out of UK
bonds and cash, but the performance of UK bonds in 1991, at 18.8 per cent,
nearly matched that of equities. Cash investments showed a 12.9 per cent
return. The worst performing sector was property, which recorded a 0.2 per
cent decline, and index-linked securities, which returned 5.6 per cent.
WM Company analyses the returns of 2,500 UK pension portfolios representing
more than three-quarters of the total UK pension fund market.
Over the past five years, in spite of two stock market crashes, UK pension
funds have comfortably out-run inflation, returning on average 9.5 per cent
per year. This compares with average annual rises in retail prices over that
period of 6.4 per cent, while average earnings rose 8.8 per cent per year.
As a result UK employers are no longer providing enough new cash to their
pension funds to meet current obligations.
Net cash flow in 1991 was 2 per cent of initial value, down from 3 per cent
in 1990 and from 15 per cent in 1981. Thus, pension fund managers must use
investment income to pay for a portion of benefits due to current retirees.
Fund managers prefer strong cash flows, Mr Gosztony said, because it gives
them the option of directing funds to sectors they think will out-perform.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Evaluating the worth of oil: The falling share prices of UK
independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUCCESS of Lasmo's strongly-contested bid for fellow oil group Ultramar
has piled gloom on the UK independent oil sector where shares have followed
the declining oil price on its downwards spiral.
Lasmo's bid valued Ultramar well below the City's estimate of the company's
worth. Now with many share prices in the sector at their lowest since the
last oil price plunge of 1986, some analysts are reassessing the basis on
which they value the independents. Many of these companies are still valued
on paper at almost double their current share price.
'The market is valuing us on the basis of Dollars 18-a-barrel oil production
with nothing in there for our exploration potential at all,' said Mr Paul
Zatts, finance director at Clyde Petroleum. Clyde's share price has dropped
from more than 150p last year to 77 1/2 p against an net asset value by
County NatWest of almost 100p a share.
Some of the smaller companies in the sector could feel the pinch enough to
look for mergers and are vulnerable to takeover. 'I think we will see a lot
more forced mergers amongst the smaller companies in the next six to nine
months,' said Ms Angela Burns, oil analyst at County NatWest. AmBrit
International, the small oil explorer quoted on the unlisted securities
market, is currently facing a hostile offer of 6p a share from Pittencrief,
the Scottish oil investment group.
The absence of cash-rich predators in the North Sea over the past year has
contributed to the share price malaise. Many foreign-owned national oil
companies have in the past been hungry for acreage in the North Sea and have
buoyed the value of the UK independents by paying generously for packages of
assets and companies.
But, in spite of Lasmo's low, initially all-paper offer for Ultramar, no
white knight stepped in, which meant the company acquired Ultramar at 285p a
share - well below some of the lowest City valuations which had put the
diversified oil and gas group at 400p a share.
The UK oil exploration and production sector underperformed the FT All-Share
index by 20 per cent during the two-month bid and continues to drop.
Lasmo itself now looks vulnerable in spite of its increased size. The
company's share price has plummeted since the takeover and, at 223p a share,
against the City's valuation of almost 100p a share more, Lasmo is one of
the cheaper companies in the sector.
The asset valuation belies the company's potential which has now been
enhanced by Ultramar's assets. But some of the points made by Ultramar in
its defence - such as Lasmo's expensive costs of finding oil - have needled
shareholders who could be susceptible to a cash bid.
Lasmo is moving swiftly to unlock shareholder value by selling Ultramar's
North American refineries which could be worth as much as Pounds 1bn. The
company has been talking to interested purchasers, but most interest has
been shown in the Wilmington plant in California which could be sold by
February when Lasmo announces its annual results. The Quebec refinery and
Canadian petrol stations are expected to be floated off locally.
Lasmo is also looking to rationalise its North Sea portfolio and is expected
to put up a package of assets for sale in a few months. These will probably
consist of small stakes in fields - less than 10 per cent of the whole.
Other companies in the sector are also coming under pressure from
shareholders to release value by selling acreage as soon as large
discoveries are made. Hardy Oil and Gas has recently participated in a large
discovery on the Elgin block of which it owns 20 per cent. The field is
believed to contain about 150m barrels of oil and up to 1,000bn cu ft of gas
and will be one of the biggest of the new generation of North Sea fields
when it is developed in conjunction with the neighbouring Franklin field
later in the decade.
'There is a view put forward in the City that we could sell it,' said Mr
Peter Elwes, deputy chairman and chief executive, who has seen the company's
share price drop to 144p compared with an asset value of 250p. 'But that is
a very short-term approach and in trying to build this business we have to
look five to seven years ahead.'
Mr Roger Aylard, analyst at Warburg Securities, believes Lasmo's takeover of
Ultramar will divide the UK exploration and production sector into a
two-tier group, headed by Enterprise Oil and Lasmo which can be rated on
earnings as well as asset values.
Suggestions by some analysts that all companies in the sector should be
judged on earnings rather than asset values are quickly shot down by many of
the smaller companies which devote all of their resources to exploration. In
any case, as Mr Roland Shaw, chairman of Premier Oil, stresses: 'Our
earnings have increased this year (1991), but our share price has still
dropped by 60 per cent.'
The fall in share prices has cut off one of the traditional ways for small
companies to raise finance for their exploration programmes as it is
impractical to launch a rights issue when prices are so low.
Pict Petroleum raised almost Pounds 12m from a recent rights issue, but Mr
John Lander, managing director, said the company was not happy about having
to offer the rights at a 15 per cent discount to the share price. Since
then, the share price has dropped further and take-up of the rights was just
over 50 per cent. 'We have to work twice as hard to get the price back up
again with good exploration news,' he said.
There is little joy on the horizon for the UK independents until the oil
price and the strength of the dollar show some recovery. Oil prices, which
are usually fairly buoyant in winter, have dropped Dollars 5 since October
to below Dollars 18 a barrel.
In addition, the weakness of the dollar against the pound has translated
into a sterling oil price of Pounds 9.50 a barrel when many North Sea
operations require a price above Pounds 10 a barrel to be profitable.
'We're at the end of a cycle and share prices are at ridiculous levels, but
that doesn't mean we're finished,' said Mr Shaw.

<TEXT>
Sir, Professor John Saunders (Letters, December 21/22) presents an argument
for Sunday trading, which makes me - one of the few remaining small
retailers - seriously consider opening on Sunday.
Perhaps Prof Saunders could also advise on how a trader such as myself, with
one part-time member of staff, can manage to provide a seven-day service -
not to mention make a living out of my business?
The very fact that businesses such as mine still survive through this severe
recession surely shows that our high streets need the speciality service and
goods we provide. It is said that England is a nation of shopkeepers, but
the big boys have advantages which this government should ensure are not
exploited at our expense.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Time to face pensions reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Busk's argument (Letters, December 18) that the 'future service
equality' (FSE) amendment to Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome may be
invalid is, on his own admission, based on the assumption that the judgment
in Barber v GRE 'does have some degree of retrospective effect'.
In Barber, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was asked to interpret the
meaning of Article 119 and went out of its way to state that the judgment
was not intended to have retrospective effect. Claims have subsequently been
made that in the context of pension rights 'no retrospection' does not mean
quite what it says. Any doubts should have been resolved in one or more test
cases in the pipeline.
As the ECJ has not yet conclusively determined that Barber does have
retrospective effect, Mr Busk's assumption begs the very question which is
now answered by the FSE amendment to Article 119. True, the ECJ may be
called upon to deliberate on the status of the amendment during the brief
interregnum before its formal ratification by all member states. But there
is no reason why it should not take a pragmatic view and have regard to the
amendment when making its determination.
The Barber industry has kept pension lawyers busy for 18 months. Subject
only to the ECJ's formal acceptance, of the realities, surely the Maastricht
settlement provides the opportunity to call it a day, rather than seek
excuses to keep the Barber bandwagon rolling.

The US recession that began in mid-1990 has never really ended. Although
real gross domestic product grew at an average annual rate of 1 1/2 per cent
in the second and third quarters of 1991, this represented no more than a
temporary rebound from the depressed levels at the time of the Gulf war. The
end of the war triggered purchases, particularly of houses and cars, that
had been postponed because of low confidence and soaring oil prices. But
there was no follow-through from the initial rebound, and the economy has
deteriorated steadily since the summer.
Most importantly, the end of the war failed to bring large and steady
increases in employment. Modest hiring by factories and home-builders
occurred for a time, but was soon swamped by continued lay-offs in sectors
less affected by the end of the war. State and local governments made
further payroll cuts in response to poor tax collections that created large
budget gaps. Employment in defence-related industries continued to drop
following last year's budget accord, which called for a 25 per cent
reduction in real defence outlays by the mid-1990s. Lay-offs also continued
in the finance, insurance and real estate sectors, partly reflecting
fall-out from sustained declines in commercial property values and
construction activity.
The postwar euphoria thus inevitably gave way to a sober recognition on the
part of households of the continuing deterioration in employment prospects.
Consumer confidence plummeted, back to the levels seen during the Gulf war
crisis and even the 1981-82 recession. Accordingly, household spending on a
variety of goods declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 1991, with the
volume of car sales dipping to the lowest level since the early 1980s.
The combination of sharply weaker demand and rising inventories is now
bringing the inevitable cuts in output. Industrial production began
declining in November and will probably continue to fall into the second
quarter of 1992.
It is too early to pinpoint the bottom of the business cycle with a high
degree of confidence. But there are a number of factors that suggest that
the renewed contraction is not likely to be particularly severe or
protracted. Inventories are not overly excessive, and cyclical sectors such
as cars and housing already have reached recession or near-recession levels
of activity. In due course recent and prospective declines in interest rates
and the dollar exchange rate, and even possibly some spur from fiscal
policy, will boost demand. A reasonable forecast is that a recovery in the
overall economy will start by the middle of this year.
Last month's easing in monetary policy, in which the discount rate was
lowered by a full percentage point and the target Federal funds rate by half
a percentage point in a single day, marked a recognition by the monetary
authorities of the need for more aggressive action. These moves were
followed by a reduction in the prime rate charged by banks to 6 1/2 per
cent, nearly two full percentage points below the level last August.
Economic activity will also be boosted in time by the lower heels of a
Bundesbank tightening, has brought the Dollars /DM exchange rate about 15
per cent lower than the levels that prevailed last summer, and the Dollars
/yen exchange rate has come down nearly 10 per cent. The lower dollar should
allow US producers to continue to pick up share in world markets.
Finally, of course, Congress may well enact some quick-acting fiscal package
after it reconvenes this month. Policy in this area, too, could make some
contribution to pulling the US out of recession.
The current downturn is unusual in that, if it does last until the middle of
1992, it will become the longest contraction since the 1930s. But it will
also likely prove to be a mild one in terms of the peak-to-trough decline in
real output.
This long but gradual downturn reflects the effects of two sets of forces,
both of which will tend to ensure that inflation remains well controlled
even after the recovery begins. First, the economy is still recovering from
a 'hangover' of sorts from excesses that were accumulated during the 1980s.
In particular, the economy is still being restrained by the long-term drags
of debt retrenchment, service-sector cost-cutting, defence spending cuts,
and the after-effects of construction overbuilding. These forces will
continue to act as a drag on growth for some time to come.
Equally important, current economic weakness reflects the persistently
restrictive bias of economic policy. Federal fiscal policy has been tight
since 1986, reflecting efforts to reduce the huge federal budget deficit.
And monetary policy has not yet been as accommodative as in past recessions,
as measured by real interest rates or by money growth.
The overall disinflationary thrust of policy over the past half-decade has
pushed down nominal GDP growth to its slowest pace in 30 years. The slowdown
in total spending has had its main impact on real growth rather than on
inflation over the last three years. That mix will change as weak real
output growth gradually erodes inflation.
The extra capacity in markets for labour and capital created by the weak
economic performance of the past three years virtually guarantees that
inflation will move significantly lower in the early 1990s. The unemployment
rate is likely to hover above 7 1/2 per cent through most of 1992, well
above the 5-6 per cent rate considered full employment. In the mid-1980s
this level of joblessness pushed growth in labour compensation costs down to
3-3 1/2 per cent annually.
From a peak of 5 1/2 per cent briefly attained in early 1991, 'core'
consumer price inflation (excluding food and energy) has already dropped to
4 1/2 per cent year-on-year. Over the past six months the annualised
increase has been only 3 1/2 per cent, despite a temporary boost from higher
excise and sales taxes. Over the coming months, further improvement in
inflation should be visible, to 2 1/2 -3 per cent by the end of 1992. This
low rate may overstate the extent of decline in price pressures, inasmuch as
it would reflect conditions at the recession trough. Even so, a longer-term
trend of roughly 3 per cent seems likely.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK 1992 Forecast: Signs not encouraging - David Currie says
any British upturn will be anaemic and hesitant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CURRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a grim Christmas for business and the prospect is for a bleak
new year.
This time last year, Mr Lamont's best hope was that the recession would be
short and sharp, leaving time for the sense of recovery to be firmly
established ahead of the election. As it is, weakness overseas in the US and
Europe, coupled with lack of confidence at home, has led to a prolonged
slowdown.
In a technical sense, recession is probably over, with the economy bumping
along the bottom and a slow, hesitant rise in output in prospect. But it is
only technical and may not help Mr Lamont and his government's electoral
position: it will be some time before perceptions shift and confidence
recovers.
The UK position is not helped by the absence of any good news about the
world economy since the summer. In the US consumer and business confidence
is fading away, and it remains to be seen whether the action of the Federal
Reserve in cutting the discount rate to its lowest level for more than 25
years will head off a 'double-dip' recession.
Germany, which acted as a locomotive for Europe through much of 1990-91,
slowed markedly towards the end of last year as a result of tax increases
and high interest rates. The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates
further in the week before Christmas to head off inflationary pressures will
add to the slowdown in Germany. In consequence, recovery in the other
European economies is being held back by high real interest rates and slow
export demand.
At home, the striking policy success has been the rapid fall in inflation
from its peak of more than 10 per cent in the later part of 1990 to about 3
1/2 per cent now. In large part this reflects the impact of recession,
though it probably also owes something to Britain's membership of the
exchange rate mechanism.
But there remains an important question-mark over the UK economy's ability
to combine low inflation with growth. Nineteen ninety-one has demonstrated
that a German inflation performance is possible in the UK. In 1992, we will
learn whether the UK can sustain low inflation only at the cost of slow
output growth and unemployment close to 3m. The signs are not encouraging:
the prospect is for a hesitant and anaemic recovery this year and next.
The recovery of demand at home is restrained, as elsewhere, by high real
interest rates and slow world growth, but also by very high debt levels,
both personal and corporate, and a weak housing market. Last year, pressures
on the corporate sector and in the housing market led to an overall fall in
investment of more than 11 per cent, while destocking exceeded 1 1/2 per
cent of gross domestic product. At the same time, consumer spending fell by
0.8 per cent as the personal sector savings ratio rose to more than 10 per
cent. This year, investment is likely to fall a little further, by about 2
per cent, while destocking will continue, though at about half the level.
The reduction in destocking provides an important boost to domestic demand,
adding about 0.8 per cent this year. Even with fairly sluggish external
demand and a flat savings ratio, this gives positive growth this year of
about 1 1/4 per cent, measured year on year. This represents a 1 percentage
point slower recovery than the chancellor forecast in the Autumn Statement,
and a much more anaemic recovery than he would like as the election looms.
Output will take until 1993 to regain its previous peak of 1990: the UK
economy will then have been in a no-growth trough for three years.
Unemployment is set to rise towards 3m in 1993, before turning down.
With a sluggish economy ahead of the election, Mr Lamont will be examining
all available policy options. Unfortunately these are strictly
circumscribed. The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates has all but
eliminated the scope for a cut in UK rates ahead of the election if
sterling's position within the ERM is not to be jeopardised, and it is quite
possible that we will have to match the rise in interest rates of other
European countries. The size of the prospective Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement, set to rise to more than Pounds 20bn, in excess of 3 per cent
of GDP (see accompanying chart), means that there is little economic case
for a giveaway Budget, which would in any case have no impact on the economy
in time for the election.
The effects of an expansionary budget would come through just as the economy
was recovering spontaneously, and might excessively stoke up domestic
demand. Despite this, Mr Lamont and his advisers will be seeking to maximise
the effects of their budget measures on immediate electoral prospects and on
confidence, so the likelihood of a giveaway Budget must be high.
Beyond the election, the policy options widen. There will be the early
opportunity to correct the impression left by Maastricht that the UK is
lukewarm on Europe by renouncing the opt-out clause on monetary union. It
may well prove more politically advantageous to do this early on in a new
parliament, rather than leave it as a divisive mid-term issue, and a Labour
government may choose to combine this with adoption of the Social Charter.
With the uncertainty associated with the election out of the way, the time
may be right to move to a narrow band in the exchange rate mechanism.
The newly elected government will also face a continuation of the problem
that has plagued the Conservatives for the period of this parliament: the
fact that the electoral and economic cycles are out of kilter.
There is the danger that the economy will boom in the first half of the next
parliament, and then slow for the second half, just as it has in this
parliament. One possibility is to bring the parliamentary cycle into line
with the economic cycle, by having an election within two years (a possible
necessity in the event of a slim majority or a hung parliament).
Alternatively, a newly elected government may prefer to take the hard
measures early, and adopt restrictive fiscal measures, bringing down the
widening budget deficit. In that case, it will take longer for output to
regain its 1990 peak, and unemployment will peak at more than 3m before
starting to fall again.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Electricity generators are manipulating the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ANDREW COOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers may have had difficulty understanding Mr John Baker's
letter justifying peaks in the pool electricity prices (Letters, December
2). I suggest this is because he is trying to defend the indefensible.
The facts are these. There is 58,000 MW of generating capacity in the UK.
Normally in the order of 54,000 MW is available for use.
As the peak afternoon period approaches, the generators are inexplicably
withdrawing capacity, reducing available capacity to nearer 52,000 MW.
Obviously, as in any market, if you reduce supplies when demand is rising,
the price shoots up.
This is precisely what the generators are doing - reducing available
capacity at a time when demand goes up.
There is firm evidence to support these allegations. On Tuesday December 3
the late afternoon pool price reached 19.15p per unit, the highest ever
recorded. The regional electricity companies confirm that there were no
unseasonably high demands and temperatures were generally above the seasonal
norm.
However, available capacity was reduced to 1,200 MW below the November
maximum when it should have been increased in line with the normal onset of
winter. More importantly, however, maximum available capacity was 52,733 MW
compared with 57,060 MW for the equivalent day in 1990 (Tuesday December 4).
It is quite clear from these figures that the generators are manipulating
the market in a way that cannot have been anticipated when the pricing
formulae that accompanied privatisation were drawn up. This is manifestly
against the consumers' interests and cannot be condoned.
It is also quite unrealistic to introduce such spurious arguments as a need
to attract new generators into the industry. In effect, this amounts to
depreciating generating plant on a replacement cost basis. There are few
manufacturers who do not wish they were able to adopt this practice and pass
on the cost to their customers. In the real world, the market simply does
not allow such accounting techniques to be passed on in the selling prices.
These real-world market-place rules should apply equally to the electricity
generators.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Letter: Japan rewards persistence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY CHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the article by Christopher Lorenz ('Japan should
give the locals a chance', November 15) and Mr Mike Parr's letter (November
22). As a British expatriate manager working in a large Japanese company, I
agree with many of Mr Lorenz's comments and sympathise with much of Mr
Parr's experience.
However, neither of these views provides a complete picture. In my role as
manager, planning and industrial relations team, I have struggled, with my
Japanese colleagues, to foster greater understanding between worldwide
cultures and the Japanese corporate culture. Our successes have not so far
been spectacular, but the learning process most certainly has been.
Any solution lies somewhere between the Lorenz/Parr extremes. It is a myth
that Japanese people live only to work. It is a fact that Japanese people
have the same hopes, fears, and aspirations as the average 'westerner', and
quite openly speak out in their frustration at corporate policies.
It is more than possible to build trust and confidence, and varying degrees
of power, albeit usually manifested in influence rather than authority,
through normal and honest labour. I was recruited in the UK in 1986 and
during the next five years worked hard, but no harder than I did in the
British company where I was previously employed. My office time averaged
between 9 and 10 hours each day, and after-hours 'networking' in bars was
necessary only once a week on average. I saw my family far more frequently
than my Japanese colleagues; and I did not need to learn Japanese until last
year.
Finally, success within Japanese Kaisha depends very much on expatriates'
willingness to 'pioneer' from within to encourage change; determination to
succeed; sensitivity towards others; communication skills; and an ability to
balance persistence with patience.
Given these, I am certain the next decade will see greater penetration of
locals into the Japanese corporate hierarchy. Barry Chester,

FT  02 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Europe's role in the world
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME of adolescent introspection is past. Free of the benevolent
tutelage of the US, the EC must now make its own destiny as an adult. It
must do so as mindful of the ruin that succeeded Europe's last period of
autonomy, as of the opportunities and dangers that confront it today.
Though Europe's child, the US has played a parental role towards it over the
past 50 years. Success has crowned that effort, but the US is now weary and
disillusioned. Europe must share the burden of leadership, but should beware
substituting a destructive rivalry for the co-operation that is in its
higher interest.
Co-operation between Europe, the US, and Japan is the sine qua non of global
stability and progress. Little of global significance can be done if they
fail to co-operate; should they do so, little is beyond them.
At the top of the agenda in the post-cold war era is economic co-operation,
the first item of all being the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Nothing could justify the damage to international trade that
would follow failure of these negotiations. Still less could the Gatt's
collapse be justified by defence of a policy as wasteful and corrupting as
the common agricultural policy. The EC will argue that it should not yield
to US bullying. But it should remember what it owes the US, and repay a part
of that debt.
In the world, Europe must be an equal partner; vis-a-vis its neighbours it
should be the leading one. The implosion of the old adversary has created a
unique opportunity and a mortal danger. Stable market-oriented democracies
need to be established in some 20 enfeebled and fractious states, polluted
remnants of the last European empire.
Russia's case
The Russian colossus must be the starting point. Once again, there could be
but a brief interlude of democracy between tyrannies. The Russian
government, under Boris Yeltsin, is determined on economic reform in
conditions that are nigh on hopeless. The west cannot afford to let him fail
and, given the scale of the resources that had to be invested in defence
against the Soviet Union, can afford what he needs to succeed. A huge effort
of technical and financial assistance is needed, not next year, but now.
Stability cannot be achieved in Eurasia if Russia remains in chaos. But
other countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe should not be
forgotten. Europe must try to do for them what the US once did for it. The
first thing to give to all, to Europe's own great benefit, is free access to
its markets. Also important, however, will be technical and financial
support.
Economically hopeful
Inevitably the focus will be on the larger countries, such as Ukraine, and
the more economically hopeful, such as the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic, Hungary and Poland. The smaller countries can then be lifted by
the buoyancy of their larger neighbours and those in the rear by the
successes of those in the van.
Finally, there is the challenge of enlargement. But this should come after
the Gatt and after the problems of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union. None of these countries will be ready for membership in the next few
years, but their problems are far more urgent than those of such prosperous
democracies as Austria or Sweden. However desirable early expansion of the
EC may be, it must not divert attention from the threats and opportunities
on the EC's eastern borders.
Among those threats is that to security. The EC's failure to halt
Yugoslavia's agonies offers a warning of what could follow in the erstwhile
Soviet Union. The European Union has neither the military means, nor the
will, to deal with such threats on its own. All the more important,
therefore, that it develop the means and show the will to deal with the
economic challenge before it boils over in civil war.
Co-operation with its partners; generosity towards its erstwhile foes. These
must be the guiding lights of a European Union, which was not born great, is
yet to achieve greatness, but has had the opportunity for greatness thrust
upon it.

It is one of those rare nights when I am glad to be a television critic and
consequently in receipt of preview cassettes. At 8.00 Channel 4 begins a 3
hour 20 minute repeat of David Freeman's much-discussed Opera Factory
production of Cos fan tutte, transferred from an 18th century Neapolitan
cafe to a 20th century Mediterranean beach. Then at 8.30 ITV begins a
two-hour Sherlock Holmes special: 'The Master Blackmailer'. This series has
been consistently outstanding, shot on good locations, with excellent casts.
Today, in addition to Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke playing Holmes and
Watson as usual, the cast includes Robert Hardy, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, and
Nickolas Grace. Then, just to make life impossible, BBC2 begins a promising
series at 8.30 called Perpetual Motion. It will be considering six forms of
transport which 'refused to die', starting with the Morris Minor. It is also
Jodie Foster's night. At 6.00 she features in the odd and not entirely
satisfactory 'gangster movie' Bugsy Malone (BBC2) in which all parts are
taken by children. Then at 10.00, in The Accused (BBC1), she has the key
role of a girl who is gang-raped after behaving 'provocatively' in a bar.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second year running, a pair of principal dancers from the Dance
Theatre of Harlem are appearing in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker. The Royal
Ballet has no black dancers, though it has a few Oriental ones, and few
people in its Covent Garden audience are black. This gesture is welcome
inasmuch as it lifts a colour bar that other British ballet companies have
already been removing.
This has just been a beginning. In January the Harlem prima ballerina,
Virginia Johnson, dances Giselle with the Royal at Covent Garden. More
important yet, the Royal and Harlem companies are working offstage in
teaching ballet to London's black children.
A black star is one thing - but one day we may see a black girl amid the
corps de ballet of Snowflakes. I hope so, though I hope that when blacks
dance in the Royal ranks they are chosen not for tokenism but for
excellence.
Judy Tyrus and Donald Williams, the current Sugar Plum couple, are very
welcome. Both handsome, they have unusual glamour in Julia Trevelyan Oman's
fussy-pretty costumes (the Prince's costume made even Anthony Dowell look
like a Christmas cracker).
Their dance style is not brilliant but is beautifully pure. I love their
basic carriage, relaxed and radiant. Their waists glow, whereas this central
area today is usually dead or strained with most Royal (and most European)
ballet dancers. A few tiny smudges were surely attributable to nerves and
did nothing to spoil their success. Their line is clear, their phrasing
sure.
I saw two Covent Garden Nutcrackers in a day. Mark Ermler conducted both
performances. His account was more theatrical and conventional than his 1989
recording and less sonically artificial. But he is not a great dance
accompanist, and he does not relish the score's warmth and lavish detail.
The matinee Sugar Plum was Viviana Durante. The whole of her dancing is less
the sum of its parts, but I certainly marvel at its many exquisite features.
I hail, however, Bruce Sansom's performance as her cavalier. This dancer,
returning to his native Royal amid a year with the San Francisco Ballet, has
always shown more niceties of style than most men at the Royal, but it is
only of late that he has begun to show the kind of firm purposefulness that
makes real sense of ballet's princely roles.
On this occasion he danced with a new calm and authority, and his partnering
was glorious. San Francisco, where the great dancer Helgi Tomasson directs,
is probably a good place for Sansom to grow further. Still, I hope he
rejoins the Royal soon.
The Sugar Plum pas de deux is the great event of Act Two, but in this
staging the overwhelming moments are the scene-changes in Act One. The
growth of the Christmas tree and toys to giant proportions - just what
Tchaikovsky wanted here - is one of the marvels of Covent Garden, and a high
point of Julia Trevelyan Oman's art. Almost as thrilling is the moment when
a silk dropcurtain suddenly falls into the floor.
I can't bear, however, the extent to which that Peter Wright (the producer)
makes Drosselmayer the manipulator of the whole show from first to last.
Little of this is in the music and, in the obsessive way Stephen Wicks plays
the role, it is creepy. Jonathan Burrows, mercifully, gives the role more
tenderness and fantasy. Among the many supporting dances, I single out
Stuart Cassidy (always outstanding) and Fiona Brockway (reaching a new
brightness as a soloist).
The party includes some nicely Dickensian vignettes of character playing,
and Anthony Bourne is especially fine in the title role - touching, droll,
mini-heroic.
But the freshest dancing and the most adorable performing are given by the
children (Royal Ballet School). I am a sucker for good child performances,
and little Hayley Discoll, as Clara, went straight to my heart. Her
sincerity, vulnerability and joy are the best rebuke to everything this
production gets wrong, the best sign of all its gets right, and the true
heart of what The Nutcracker is all about.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: Same old message, but Politically Correct - Cinema in
1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time for the round-up of the year. This is the occasion on which a critic
breaks open his memory bank only to discover that he has been robbed,
probably sometime during the festive, low-security hours of Christmas Day.
'What films really stood out during 1991?,' someone asked me this Christmas
over the dangerous third Martini. I was flummoxed. I scratched my coloured
paper hat and caught a fleeting mental glimpse of all the movies I had seen
during the year. Then it was gone. I had to return to my notes on sober
Boxing Day to remember it all.
Now they leap forth. All those multiple murderer films like The Silence Of
The Lambs and Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. All those new black films
like Boyz N The Hood and Young Soul Rebels. All those feminist-agenda
thrillers like Thelma and Louise and Misery, where women adopt the
hunter-harrier roles usually played by men.
But as one would expect from a palindromic year - '1991' reads the same
backwards or forwards - a cinema trying to reverse itself ideologically kept
finding that it was saying the same old things. Dances With Wolves essayed a
reconstruction of the Western for the age of Indian Rights and ended by
sending much the same sexist, racist messages as before under a 'politically
correct' banner. (The gone-native hero is allowed to fall in love, but only
with the tribe's one adopted white woman). And Thelma and Louise, Ridley
Scott's brilliant trans-American action thriller, put two females at the
wheel of the plot and was then accused of making them do the same
thick-eared, screechy things that men would have done.
That, of course, was part of Scott and writer Calli Khouri's point. Plus ca
change in the age of political correctness, plus c'est la meme chose with a
new dash of colour or cross-dressing.
If Thelma and Louise was saved by self-awareness, that commodity was in
short supply elsewhere. Nowhere did the radical resemble the dressed-up
reactionary, with no irony in sight, than in the new black cinema. In New
Jack City and Boyz N The Hood sexual and racial stereotyping stomped across
our screens; and only Spike Lee's Jungle Fever wittily acknowledged that the
same bigotries that flourish in the white community are alive in America's
black community.
Amid so much New Age tub-thumping accompanied by Old Age prejudices, many
filmgoers warmed to the serial killers on view. Few of these even pretended
to be 'brothers' or 'sisters' or paragons of political correctness. All they
wanted to do was to kill you: or in the case of Anthony Hopkins's
mesmerising Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, to eat you.
How refreshing to have a group of characters who laid it on the line. So
refreshing that Hollywood cannily attempted, on at least two occasions, to
cross serial killing with political correctness. There was a box-office
jackpot for Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves, whose hero knocked off more
Normans in his time than Hannibal Lecter had non-vegetarian dinners. And in
Terminator 2 Arnold Schwarzenegger walked about America serially clobbering
every baddie in sight and earning Dollars 200m at the US turnstiles.
But to these comic-strip hero-killers I preferred the higher complexities of
the psychopath films: especially the terrifying human riddles posed by a
movie like John McNaughton's Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. This is the
story of a plain affectless chap who goes around murdering people for -
well, for what? Hardly, to judge by his joyless expression, even for the
hell of it.
If 'causeless' actions are the modern world's greatest moral challenge, then
the most bracing feature of the cinema in 1991 was the demolition work done
on the very idea of cause-and-effect: not just in the moral presentation of
character but in screen storytelling as a whole. Which of us is the same
after Twin Peaks? Even if we never saw David Lynch's TV serial, we read
about its cult status and cuckoo stylistics. And we see its influence, or
that of the aesthetic climate that produced it, in American films like Todd
Haynes's Poison (bizarre interweaving of three movie-pastiche thriller
tales) and Hal Hartley's Trust (young love, family strife and non-stop
non-sequiturs); and also in European films like Patrice Leconte's The
Hairdresser's Husband, a tale of l'amour fou with the stress on fou, and
Jaco Van Dormael's gleaming Toto The Hero, a sort of revenge opera done as a
comic strip.
Today's audiences are learning how to meet multiple-choice aesthetic
challenges that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. The success of a
multi-style fantasy like The Fisher King - not so much a shaggy dog, more
like several mongrels fighting in a sack - proves that. Meanwhile films of
single-track moral momentum, even when done on an epic scale, begin to seem
like yesterday's steam engines. Huffing and puffing towards their climactic
messages, movies like The Bonfire Of The Vanities and Havana try to carry
audiences to a destination they have been to a hundred times before and do
not want to re-visit, thank you, even in a luxury dining car with all-star
passengers.
This suits Britain perfectly. We have no stars: they have all retired or
gone into Labour politics. And we have no money with which to make British
epics: it has gone into making other people's epics like The Last Emperor
and Dances With Wolves. Instead we have a cottage industry that makes
picturesque fixer-uppers: films like Anthony Minghella's Truly Madly Deeply,
Derek Jarman's Edward II, Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes, Peter
Greenaway's Prospero's Books and Ken Loach's European Film Award winner Riff
Raff.
Much talent and variety. Should we mind that the results belong more on the
small screen than the large? Or that the most beautiful and arresting film
of the year, Derek Jarman's The Garden, was not even shot on conventional
film: rather on a mish-mash of video and Super-8 and anything else Jarman
could find in his odds-and-ends bin? The rules of film-making as we prepare
to leave the second millennium AD are as follows: There are no rules. There
are only brave artists trying, with any means at their disposal, to wean
audiences from the old orthodoxies and the old expectations.
My Top Ten for 1991. The Garden, Toto The Hero, Avalon, Riff Raff, The
Fisher King, Thelma And Louise, Miller's Crossing, Jungle Fever, Mr And Mrs
Bridge, Proof.
*****
The first film of the New Year, as so often, seems like a summation of the
previous year. Delicatessen (15, Metro, Gate, Screen on the Hill), a first
feature by two French animators Jeunet and Caro, boasts a serial killer, a
pixillated plot and a blithe disregard for anyone who likes to deal with one
genre at a time. Old-dark-house horror jostles with sight-gag slapstick and
with a gentle love story involving the evil butcher's pining daughter
(Marie-Laure Dougnac) and the new male tenant (Dominique Pinon) who might or
might not end up feeling the sharp edge of Papa's cleaver.
Set in a fog-girt tenement house that could have been designed by Roland
Emmett with help from Gustave Dore, the film's black humour has a manic
charm. A virtuoso opening sequence - tracking shot through streets, close-up
of cleaver being sharpened, tunnelling shot through house's intestines to
face of a terrified man - renders us supple for the gymnastics of style and
story that follow.
We meet an old codger who lives in a waterlogged room teeming with snails
and frogs. We see a boomerang clasp-knife bring horrible justice to its
user. We watch two underwater lovers kiss in a flooded bathroom. And we
experience a cacophony that turns to filmic poetry as the house's percussive
sounds - a metronome, a creaking bed, a carpet being beaten - are swept up
into a musical montage.
If Delicatessen blueprints a new European surrealism, Bill And Ted's Bogus
Journey (PG, Odeon West End) dusts off yesterday's American version. Last
time around, our bubble-headed heroes (Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter)
time-tripped through the universe meeting Socrates, Napoleon and Genghis
Khan and wowing them with the wonders of Valleyspeak. This time they are
just as appealing: visiting Heaven and Hell, defeating a cosmic conspiracy
and meeting Death, who wields a Swedish accent and plays a mean game of
Cluedo. As I was saying, simple down-the-line plots are beginning to look
like yesterday's cinema . . .

FT  02 JAN 92 / Management: Playboy magazine promotes Old Milwaukee beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD MILWAUKEE beer, made by the Stroh Brewery of Detroit, has been receiving
an extra boost of brand recognition with a Playboy magazine cover feature of
its 'Swedish Bikini Team'.
The 'team,' composed of five buxom American women in blond wigs, is an ad
agency's invention for the beer maker's television commercials. The Playboy
spread might seem the target marketer's dream come true. But the problem is
that Stroh's 'Swedish Bikini Team' is at the centre of a novel controversy
in the marketing world.
Stroh is being sued by five female workers at its brewery in St Paul,
Minnesota, who allege that the commercials foster a climate tolerant of
sexual harassment in the workplace. They charge that they have been
subjected to a pattern of physical and verbal sexual abuse, and link the
commercials to it. Lawyers for the women say the Bikini Team TV commercials
are demeaning to women and other advertising posters of scantily clad women
have been 'directly used as tools of harassment'.
The company describes the allegations as 'preposterous' and says it has a
policy against sexual harassment. It has not halted the 'Swedish Bikini
Team' marketing campaign, which began last spring and, if similar to others,
will run for about a year. George Kuehn, senior vice-president of Stroh and
its general counsel, said that the company 'had nothing to do with the
appearance of the team in Playboy'. But it did nothing to stop them.
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages and an end to the marketing
campaign, could pose an entirely new business risk to advertising. If
successful, it could for the first time link adverts to sexual misconduct in
the work place.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Management: Some food for second thoughts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fancy some 'No salt added, thin ribbon candy', 'Light and Lean' sausages, or
perhaps a '33 1/3 per cent less sodium' shank of ham?
All were sitting on a Manhattan supermarket's shelves this week - but not,
perhaps, for much longer. Given the voluminous regulations on food labelling
which have gushed from America's Food and Drug Administration over the past
few months, such winning descriptions may be soon be a thing of the past.
The impact of the new rules promises to be substantial. When fully
implemented in mid-1993, for example, every packaged food item in the US
must give full details of its nutritional and calorific content. The
manufacturer must also list such information in terms of a standardised
portion size, permitting comparison with rival lines.
Should it wish to make broader 'health' claims - asserting, for instance,
that a product is 'low-fat' or 'sodium-free' - the boast must meet strict
definitions. Meanwhile, supermarkets will have to display nutritional
background on the 20 most popular raw fruits, vegetables and types of fish.
The only products to be spared this labelling inquisition will be spices,
restaurant food and small packages - no bigger than a packet of
'Lifesavers'. Food produced by very small businesses, where food sales are
under Dollars 50,000 a year and total sales less than Dollars 500,000, will
also be exempt.
The driving force behind this radical overhaul is largely political. Years
of lax regulatory supervision, a growing public obsession with health and
healthcare costs, and the wave of exaggerated claims by manufacturers, have
all combined to make food-labelling a hot topic.
The marketing upheaval has already begun. It is debatable whether the impact
is more onerous for large companies, with sizeable product lines but ample
corporate resources, or smaller manufacturers which lack in-house lawyers
and the like. But it is indisputable that both are significantly affected.
Take Kraft General Foods, part of the giant Philip Morris group. Here, a
bevy of lawyers are pouring through the new rules and trying to assess the
implications for some 7,000 products. Essentially, Kraft says it expects to
divide products into three categories - those which are basically
unaffected, those which it will need to reformulate, and those where
considerable relabelling needs to take place.
Once the 'master-list' is drawn up, R&amp;D staff will become involved in the
reformulations - something which is difficult when proposals only exist in
draft form and there is still scope for industry-wide bargaining over the
FDA's definitions. Kraft says it is too early to quantify the cost of the
exercise, but expects it will run to 'millions of dollars'.
At a different end of the spectrum, Ben &amp; Jerry's, the much-loved
Vermont-based ice cream maker, is publicly stoical. It was the late-1970s
when the two hippie-style founders - Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield -
started producing home-made ice-cream in a small New England town. Today,
the product sells across the US, although the company still wears its social
concerns on its sleeve. No one would deny that the ice-cream is rich,
sinful, and utterly delicious - but won't consumers think twice when they
see the calories spelt out on the label ?
'People who eat our ice-cream aren't doing it for dietary reasons,' says Ben
&amp; Jerry's, hopefully. 'Basically, it's a reward thing.'
Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the Ben &amp; Jerry's 'Light' line is
being phased out, to be replaced by a series of low-fat frozen yoghurt
products. The manufacturer insisted that this would have happened anyway,
but its rationale for the decision is telling. The light ice-cream, it says,
was 'just not low enough', providing upwards of 200 calories per 4fl oz
portion.
In the FDA's brave new world, that is a matter which will be beyond dispute.
'Light', says the FDA, must refer to a food that contains one-third fewer
calories than a comparable product.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Management: Fashion beers, Pulling ahead before the bubble
bursts - Philip Rawstorne looks at the popularity of imported brews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LIGHT Mexican lager served with a slice of lime in the neck of the bottle
has become the latest trend in British clubs, pubs and restaurants.
Sol, brewed at Veracruz on Mexico's Gulf coast, has become the fashionable
drink to be seen with.
Introduced at a Mexican restaurant in London's Covent Garden in 1985, UK
sales of Sol were 22,000 bottles by 1987.
This year they are expected to reach 48m bottles, worth a total of about
Pounds 50m.
Now widely distributed through pubs, bar-restaurants and off-licences, Sol
is positioned to turn its trendy image into a more established feature of
the UK beer market.
But in spite of its current marketing success, the odds against it doing so
are great.
Most so-called fashion beers turn out to be no more than froth on the
market. They bubble briefly, then go flat.
Very few settle into a permanent market niche; even fewer expand into
mainstream brands.
Imported premium lagers - as distinct from those brands such as Belgium's
'reassuringly expensive' Stella Artois which are foreign-owned but brewed in
the UK - amounted to about 1.1m barrels last year.
That is little more than Britain's beer drinkers consume in 10 days; but its
retail value is about Pounds 350m.
Even so, more than 200 brands from 20 countries continue to strive hopefully
to capture the sort of attention now being accorded to Sol.
There are a further three from Mexico - Corona, which enjoyed a short but
spectacular boom in the US, Dos Equis, a dark lager, and Tecate, which is
best sipped, some say, from a glass with a salt-encrusted rim.
Rolling Rock, which comes from Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in distinctive
long-necked green bottles, is sponsoring jazz concerts to acquire the sort
of trendiness in the UK that it enjoys in Manhattan.
From Canada comes Moosehead and Molson, which was launched in 1988 with a
Pounds 2m advertising campaign by Jim Dunk, an overweight, balding actor who
perversely advised beer-drinkers to avoid the brand.
Budweiser Budvar and Pilsner Urquell have come with exemplary quality
credentials from Czechoslovakia.
There is San Miguel from Spain, Sapporo Dry from Japan, Steinlager from New
Zealand and Furstenberg from Germany.
Fresh from his marketing triumph with Sol, Harry Drnec, chief executive of
Maison Caurette, the independent UK drinks distributor, has launched Genuine
Miller Draft, the sixth best-selling US beer, into the market.
Cold-filtered to preserve flavour, and free of additives, the beer will sell
for Pounds 1.60 to Pounds 2.50p a bottle in pubs and clubs.
Prospects for imported lagers have never been better, according to Drnec.
The UK's premium lager market is growing at 12 per cent a year.
Consumers are trading up, prepared to pay higher prices for what they
perceive as better products; and drinks retailers, meanwhile, are competing
to offer a greater choice.
'It was the development of wine-bars in the late 1970s and early 1980s that
first opened the market for imported bottled beers.
'That continued with the trend to bar-restaurants,' said Drnec.
'Now that the major brewers have been forced by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to separate their pub retailing operations from their breweries,
pubs are moving in the same direction. They are now being run by
professional retailers, concerned more with catering for consumer choice
than with pushing through volume sales of one or two beers.'
The growing take-home beer market has also been encouraging supermarkets and
off-licences to extend their range of brands.
But the 200 brands are competing for a narrow slice of a sector which is
dominated by Holsten Pils and Beck's from Germany, and Grolsch from the
Netherlands.
These three brands last year accounted for more than 80 per cent of imported
lager.
Holsten - long advertised as the 'odd lager' - is brewed in Hamburg to
Germany's strict purity rules and is by far the largest brand in the sector
with annual retail sales of Pounds 200m.
It was launched in the UK in the post-war gloom of 1949, long before the
British pub-goer had acquired a taste for any lager.
Courage, which distributes the beer, keeps the brand trendily up-to-date
with Pounds 6m-worth of advertising humorously focused on anagrams of the
brand name, such as Stops In Hell.
Beck's was introduced into the UK at Joe Allen's restaurant in London in
1978.
Within a few years, its distribution was taken over by Scottish &amp; Newcastle,
the UK brewer which is strongly represented in the take-home trade.
Last year, Beck's sales totalled 170,000 barrels; this year they are
expected to be about 30 per cent higher.
Grolsch entered the UK market in 1979, setting up its own marketing and
sales organisation to develop the brand.
With the slogan 'You can't top a Grolsch', its advertising first focused on
the beer's swing-top bottle as a distinctive and stylish brand emblem, then
gradually widened the message to convey the quality of the product.
The measured pace of its promotion over more than a decade lifted sales to
140,000 barrels last year. Growth of more than 20 per cent seems likely this
year.
The development of Holsten, Beck's and Grolsch, suggests that success in the
market depends on two factors - a fashionable or stylish image to
distinguish a brand from its competitors; and a record of product quality
that will sustain its appeal after the novelty has worn off.
'Both are essential,' said Keith Lay, UK marketing manager for Grolsch.
Warsteiner and Hacker Pschorr, two German brands with an impeccable
heritage, have made little impact in the UK because of their lack of fashion
appeal.
Sol, with a stylishness carefully nurtured in London's chic bars, has got
ahead of the pack.
It has yet to prove it has the stamina to stay there.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Calor Gas workers agree lump-sum deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVERS AND production workers employed by Calor Gas have agreed an unusual
pay deal under which they will receive lump-sum payments instead of an
annual increase in basic salary.
The deal is part of a small but growing trend among companies which want to
keep down fixed costs but are anxious to avoid the harmful effects a pay
freeze can have on employee relations.
Increasing numbers of companies have implemented pay freezes as the
recession has continued, some without the agreement of workers and unions.
The attraction to employers of one-off payments is that any percentage rise
in the following year will be based on salaries agreed two years previously
and so will cost less than if the payments had been consolidated into
salaries. Lump-sum payments are more expensive than freezes but are less
likely to alienate workforces.
In the Calor deal - details of which are reported in a forthcoming bulletin
by Incomes Data Services, the pay research organisation - the company has
agreed two separate payments.
The first sum, paid immediately after the conclusion of the deal, which had
a review date of September 29 last year, provided Pounds 851 for drivers and
Pounds 836 for plant operators.
These were the amounts the average employee could expect to earn over the
coming year if a 4.2 per cent rise had been applied. A second lump sum,
worth Pounds 135 for drivers and Pounds 133 for operators, will be paid
after March providing sales targets in a 13-week period from December 29
last year are reached. The settlement, covering 1,000 of Calor's 2,500
employees, also includes substantial improvements to pensions and other
changes to fringe benefits.
Under the previous agreement, effective from September 1990, basic rates
were increased by 9 per cent with a further 1 per cent, again subject to
achievement of sales targets, available from April last year.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Managers urge education boost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, should plan for more spending on
education, training and transport in his March Budget rather than cut taxes,
the British Institute of Management says.
In its pre-Budget submission to the Treasury the institute has asked Mr
Lamont to delay tax cuts until Britain's investment in these areas equals
that of its European competitors. In particular, it urged the chancellor to
extend tax relief to more people attending training courses on their own
initiative.
The institute also urged more spending on the railways and public transport.
It called for simplification of the tax system with measures including the
amalgamation of national insurance and income tax contributions.
The suggestions were based on the responses of 730 managers to a
questionnaire.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Written questions cost Pounds 900,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 30 MPs who ask the most parliamentary 'written questions' to extract
information from ministers are costing the taxpayer nearly Pounds 1m a year,
official figures show.
More than 10,000 questions for written answer were laid by the top 30 MPs
from all parties during the 1990-91 parliamentary year, according to figures
from Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons. The most prolific, Mr Paul
Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, asked 928.
Written questions are a means by which backbench MPs can exercise some power
over the executive to get access to official information.
Latest Treasury estimates put the average cost incurred by the Civil Service
in answering a written question at Pounds 87. The cost of the 10,326
questions asked by the top 30 therefore works out at about Pounds 900,000.

FT  02 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Glaxo scientists sign personal
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, the pharmaceuticals company, said that 60 per cent of a group of
scientists at its Barnard Castle, Durham, site have signed personal
contracts in spite of opposition by a union fighting to preserve its
recognition agreement there.
Signing the contracts will result in the scientists depending for pay rises
on their individual performance.
The Association of Management and Professional Staffs said that in a recent
ballot among the 80-strong group, members voted by 11 to one against
continuing a performance-related pay system introduced two years ago.
It accused the company of reneging on an agreement, made at the time of the
introduction of performance pay, that the scientists could revert to
traditional pay bargaining systems if they wished.
Mr Tony Casey, executive secretary of AMPS, said that only about 30 per cent
of members had signed the contracts. Although there was no mood for
industrial action, the scientists were extremely angry about the company's
attitude.
Glaxo said it was encouraging people to take time to make up their minds on
the personal contracts.
Scientists at two other plants in Glaxo Manufacturing Services are also
being offered personal contracts. The company said it wanted to standardise
an individual relationship between staff and itself throughout the graduate
and professional groups in GMS. It denied that it had reneged on any
previous agreement, saying the contracts issue was totally separate.

FT  02 JAN 92 / TSB launches code for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, BRITAIN'S sixth-largest bank, is to announce details of its banking
code for small-business customers on Monday.
Included in the code of practice are commitments to notify customers in
advance of changes to quarterly banking charges, and to publish its basic
framework of tariffs for the larger of its small-business customers.
TSB is the fifth bank to unveil a business-banking code after strong
criticism of lenders last summer for their alleged poor treatment of
small-business customers. The code also applies to its Hill Samuel merchant
bank subsidiary.
The bank was not one of those called in to see Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, to explain their actions last summer. However, it has decided to
follow the big four high street banks - Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and
Midland - in publishing a code to emphasise its role as a provider of
finance to business.
A brochure outlining the code of practice will be available from TSB
branches from January 6.
The code promises fair terms and conditions in contracts with customers.
Contracts will be written in plain language. The bank will give reasonable
notice of any changes in contract terms. Advance notification of charges
will be introduced later in the year after computer modifications.
TSB will also ask customers who negotiate an overdraft or loan to sign and
return a letter acknowledging acceptance of the terms and conditions. It
believes this will bring home to customers the obligations they are entering
into.
As well as providing customers with details of its fixed business tariffs,
which currently apply to companies with a turnover of up to Pounds 250,000,
the bank will publicise its tariffs applying to larger businesses. These
tariffs remain negotiable, but TSB said the publishing of basic rates would

FT  02 JAN 92 / Establishment takes fright at Algeria election results:
Francis Ghiles looks at the fall-out from last week's first round wins for
Islamic extremists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is mounting on President Chadli Bendjedid to cancel the second
round of the country's first multi-party elections which last week confirmed
the opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) as the main political force in
Algeria.
Some political leaders such as Dr Said Saadi, the secretary general of the
Rassemblement pour la Culture et la Democratie, one of the lay opposition
parties, are quite clear. A second round, he says, will 'bury Algeria. It
will condemn us to chaos.'
He has called for a general strike. Such a strategy is backed by the
Committee for the Safeguard of Algeria, which includes leading trade unions
and employers federations and appears to have the tacit support of senior
figures in the establishment.
Earlier this week it issued a proclamation arguing that 'it could not allow
those who benefit from the rules of democracy to abrogate, tomorrow, the
very same constitution which guarantees those rules'. It pointed out that
the FIS ruling council still meets in secret and that nobody knows the names
nor the exact number of its members.
For his part, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, whose Front des Forces Socialistes (FFS)
won 25 seats in Kabylia, the Berber stronghold in the north, and whose
candidates are strong runners-up to the FIS in a number of constituencies in
the heart of Algiers, refuses for the present to go that far, arguing such a
move would make Algeria look like a 'banana republic'.
He has called for Algerians to march through the heart of the capital today
in a show of strength against totalitarian forces. But as he pointed out in
an interview yesterday he still cannot get the authorities to lay on special
trains for those of his supporters who wish to come into the capital.
This much respected veteran of the war of liberation against France and
long-time political exile expresses serious misgivings about the fairness of
the elections, saying that state-controlled television gave no time for his
meetings, concentrating all its news and reporting on the Islamic
fundamentalists and the ruling National Liberation Front.
He argues - and independent evidence increasingly supports him - that fraud
was practised on a much wider scale than observers had thought until a few
days ago. They assert that 10 per cent of the ballot papers cast were not
valid; 900,000 electoral cards never reached those they were destined for;
and that a good half of the elections of successful candidates in the first
round would be contested in the Constitutional Court.
The vast majority of town halls have been under FIS control since the
party's victory in the municipal elections of June 1990 and the names of
many people who then abstained appears to have been struck off the electoral
register.
Since December 20, in the run-up to the polls, a string of violent incidents
across the country are adding to a climate of growing uncertainty. Some of
these incidents are only now being made public, and several resulted in the
deaths of members of the security forces.
Externally, the Moroccan authorities have announced they will close their
frontier with Algeria from January 15, the day before the planned second
round. Already Tunisia appears to have sealed its border with Algeria.
Anxiety in Paris has been all the greater because French leaders appear, as
in June 1990 when the Islamic party swept the polls in local elections, to
have misread the way the vote would go.
They are in good company, however, as their optimism about the capacity of
the FLN to resist the FIS onslaught appears to have been shared by Mr Sid
Ahmed Ghozali, the prime minister, and his minister of the interior, General
Larbi Belkheir.
Other senior members of the government fear the worst. They believe that if
the FIS wins a majority, it will be forced into radical measures in order to
keep their promises it has repeatedly made to its followers.
They are apprehensive that the FIS will turn first against the rich, then
against the educated middle classes - it has already publicly promised to
replace a certain number of technicians with 'Islamic' technicians it will
import from the Middle East.
Then will come the turn of the Berber heartland of Kabylia - with the added
twist that many key FIS leaders such as Mr Mohammed Said and Mr Ahmed Merani
are themselves Kabyle Berbers. The scene would then be set for what has
historically often been feared - a fight to the finish among a group of
Berbers.
The worst may yet not come to pass but Tuesday's New Year's eve celebrations
in packed restaurants and hotels in Algiers had a slightly desperate touch.

<TEXT>
China has signed a contract to sell a nuclear power plant to Pakistan, the
official Xinhua News Agency said in a rare report about Beijing's usually
secretive nuclear technology transfers, Yvonne Preston reports from Beijing.
At the signing ceremony in Beijing this week, Li Peng, China's prime
minister, said the 300MW nuclear plant was 'totally for peaceful purposes'.
According to Li both sides agree the project will be open to International
Atomic Energy Agency inspection.
He said the nuclear co-operation agreement would promote Pakistan's economic
growth and benefit its people.
Beijing has come under fierce international criticism, especially from the
US, for exporting nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology. The US has
accused it of supplying Chinese M-9 and M-11 missiles to Pakistan and Syria,
and helping Algeria develop a nuclear reactor which could be used for
building nuclear weapons. China denies all these charges.
During Li's official visit to India last month the Indian government
demanded that China cease exporting M-9 missiles to Pakistan. The missile
has a range of 600km, twice that of the M-11.
China maintains its official line that it does not advocate, encourage or go
in for nuclear proliferation, nor does it help other countries develop
nuclear weapons.
The standing committee of China's parliament last week affirmed China's
decision to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Indian premier charges Pakistan with 'state terrorism'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR P V Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, has accused Pakistan of using
'state terrorism' in the northern Indian states of Punjab and Kashmir.
Speaking at a meeting of the National Integration Council attended by all
the main political parties, Mr Rao said 'sponsored terrorism (was) being
carried on from across the border'. The 'whole government, the whole state'
was taking part in the terrorism, he said.
Officials have long blamed Pakistan for insurgencies in Kashmir and Punjab,
but this is first time the prime minister has pointed a finger at India's
neighbour, accusing it of 'waging a proxy war' in the two states.
Relations between India and Pakistan, never good at the best of times, are
bound to deteriorate following Mr Rao's charge but it is thought unlikely
that military action will follow. Both countries are preoccupied with
economic problems and would not willingly bear the cost of another conflict.
The meeting of the National Integration Council was held at the demand of
the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). The president of the BJP
is now on a nationwide 'unity tour' whipping up emotions on the Kashmir and
Punjab issues. He plans to end it on January 26 - Republic Day - by
unfurling the national flag in Srinagar, capital of Kashmir.
All parties, including the ruling Congress, have condemned the BJP tour on
the ground that it would stir up communal tensions. Mr MM Joshi, the BJP
president, has drawn large crowds during his tour, which is expected to gain
momentum when he reaches the northern states next week. The council welcomed
the government's plans to hold general elections in Punjab next month but
could not adopt a common resolution on Kashmir because of the BJP's demand
that the state should not be given preferential treatment under the Indian
constitution.
Pakistan said it had swapped lists of nuclear installations with India
yesterday under an agreement aimed at easing suspicion about each other's
nuclear capabilities, Reuter writes from Islamabad.
The Foreign Ministry said that the lists had been handed over by the two
countries' missions in New Delhi and Islamabad under an accord ratified in
January 1991 and aimed at banning attacks on each other's nuclear plants.
India and Pakistan, who have fought three wars since independence from
Britain in 1947, both say their nuclear programmes are for peaceful
purposes. But they accuse each other of having at least the potential to
make nuclear arms. Neither has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, each
citing the other's failure to do so.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Nigeria seeks debt relief to ease reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Ibrahim Babangida yesterday appealed for concessional treatment of
Nigeria's Dollars 33.4bn (Pounds 18.3bn) external debt, warning that heavy
service payments were jeopardising the country's economic reform programme.
His request is likely to receive a cool response from creditors until
Nigeria meets performance targets set under an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, which was signed a year ago and runs out in
April.
Although discussions are continuing, Nigeria failed to pass a mid-term
review of the SDR319m (Pounds 242.5m) stand-by facility. A recent Fund
report was highly critical of several aspects of government management,
notably an over-expansionary fiscal policy and heavy reliance on domestic
bank borrowing. Without IMF endorsement, Nigeria will be unable to extend
debt rescheduling deals reached with government and commercial bank
creditors.
President Babangida, speaking in the new capital of Abuja, was outlining the
country's 1992 budget in the course of a new year address calling for
'financial discipline' and announcing plans to cut the number of ministries
from 25 to 16.
The president, who said debt service payments due this year totalled Dollars
5.6bn, forecast export earnings of Dollars 9bn, of which Dollars 7.4bn would
come from oil exports averaging 1.38m barrels per day at Dollars 21 per
barrel. Government expenditure this year was put at 27.6bn naira, a 30 per
cent cut on 1991 spending.
The president warned that Nigeria's structural adjustment programme, under
way since 1986, could not succeed if the country remained a net exporter of
capital: 'It is therefore obvious that Nigeria requires substantial debt
relief through outright debt reduction.'
Presenting what will be his last budget if the handover to civilian rule in
October this year takes place as scheduled, the country's military leader
called for 'far more concessional debt relief, with the Toronto or the
Trinidad terms as minimum.'
Nigeria's external debt had grown from Dollars 20.06bn in 1985 to Dollars
33.36bn at the end of October 1991. The government would continue to peg
debt service payments at 30 per cent of export earnings, although this level
would be difficult to sustain, the president continued.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has indicated that he would
support Nigeria's claim for debt relief under Trinidad terms, but the IMF
hurdle will have to be cleared.
The terms apply to the world's poorest countries and provide for the
write-off of two-thirds of export credit debt. Nigeria claims eligibility,
pointing out that per capita income has fallen from about Dollars 1,000 in
1980 to under Dollars 300 in 1990, the result of substantial devaluations
and falling oil exports.
But British officials stress that terms require an economic reform programme
which has IMF endorsement.
The proposals were launched by Mr Major, then chancellor of the exchequer,
in Trinidad in September 1990. At last October's Commonwealth conference in
Harare, Mr Major announced that Britain was prepared to implement the terms
unilaterally.

trade tensions

<TEXT>
THE Japanese car industry was yesterday urged by Prime Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to help Americans sell cars in Japan and to mend trade tensions
during President George Bush's visit next week, AP reports from Tokyo.
Speaking in a televised new year's news conference, Mr Miyazawa said: 'I am
asking industry leaders to take more seriously and compassionately the US
situation, symbolised by General Motors' shutdowns.'
GM announced last month it would eliminate 74,000 jobs and close 21 plants
in North America over the next four years. Mr Miyazawa, attempting to
emphasise to the Japanese the need to help the US auto industry, said: 'GM
is like the Stars and Stripes for the American people.'
He said it came as a great psychological blow for many Americans to witness
their car industry losing out to Japanese competition.
President Bush, accompanied by the chairmen of the three leading US-owned
car makers and 18 other business leaders, is due in Tokyo on January 7 to
discuss ways of narrowing Japan's Dollars 41bn (Pounds 22.5bn) trade surplus
with the US. Vehicles and car parts account for three-quarters of that gap.
Senator Carl Levin, whose state, Michigan, is home to the big three car
companies, said last week that the US Congress might enact legislation
punishing Japan for its restrictions on importing US goods if the
president's visit did not yield results.
Last month, big Japanese car makers said they planned nearly to double
purchases of US car parts by 1994 as part of a government-inspired effort to
reduce the trade surplus. made parts.
On another key issue between Tokyo and Washington, Mr Miyazawa hinted Japan
eventually would ease its ban on rice imports.

GENERAL Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese military leader said yesterday
the authorities would appoint a transitional parliament in the next few
days, Reuter reports from Khartoum.
The general, who dissolved Sudan's elected parliament when he seized power
in July 1989, said the appointed assembly should set a good example for a
proposed elected assembly.
The Sudanese military junta has previously resisted calls for a return to
government under a civilian constitution and Gen Bashir has said he will
never allow political parties.
The military leaders were thought to favour 'popular congresses' along the
Libyan model, where local councils send delegates to a national congress
similar to a conventional parliament.
Gen Bashir, in an Independence Day speech in the town of Abu Hamad, 280
miles north of Khartoum, said the appointed assembly would be able to
propose and pass legislation, vet decrees by the ruling Revolution Command
Council and ratify treates and agreements with other countries.
He implicitly welcomed the success of the Islamic movement in Algerian
elections last week, saying the Algerian government had been wise to let
Algerians choose freely.

FT  02 JAN 92 / Portugal's premier turns his talents to the EC: Anibal
Cavaco Silva talks to Patrick Blum as his country takes over the Community's
presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's professor-turned-prime minister, is
undaunted by the tasks facing his country's presidency of the EC.
A technocrat and stickler for detail, he will be very much in charge of
Portugal's efforts during the six-month rotating presidency - the country's
first since it joined the Community in 1986.
His cabinet has been restructured with two working groups set up
specifically to deal with the presidency. Another group, consisting of
himself and a small team of key ministers, will handle political
developments, while a special group will deal with technical matters.
'I will follow everything closely throughout the duration of the
presidency,' says Mr Cavaco Silva, who has a reputation among colleagues for
briefing himself thoroughly on the issues.
Critics have accused him of being authoritarian and arrogant, but he brushes
aside the suggestion that his plans for the presidency may involve an
excessive concentration of responsibilities.
His critics confuse authoritarianism with resolution, he says. 'I don't run
away from responsibilities, and I am firm in my determination to do what
must be done.'
After six years as prime minister - the first two in 1985-87 as head of a
minority government - and four more to come following his victory in last
October's general election, he is more relaxed than previously.
'I wasn't educated to be a politician, but to be a university professor. I
had to learn a lot about the way to lead on political issues and among
politicians. When I arrived here (in the prime minister's residence), my
adversaries said I wouldn't last six months.'
He had to adapt and there were mistakes. He faced a general strike over
reform of labour laws, and considerable resistance over fiscal reform, both
of which have been implemented and have since died down as political issues.
'I underestimated the difficulties. Fiscal reform, for example, was promised
to the Portuguese people in 1974 at the time of the revolution, and by all
the subsequent 16 governments, but they never did it.'
We realised it, but I underestimated the attacks, I never thought they would
reach such a pitch. Had I anticipated this maybe I would have changed the
way I presented the reform, but the reform itself was basically correct.'
His policies remain a social democratic mix of market-oriented economic
reform with a safety net sufficiently large to avoid conflict and excessive
social hardships.
He says redistributing wealth on its own will not achieve lasting
prosperity. 'I want to build a more just society. Poverty still exists in
Portugal and it is shocking, but as an economist I know the solution isn't
to distribute a social security cheque.' He says it is more important to
encourage individual responsibilities and rewards, greater efficiency and
social cohesion through dialogue.
While at York University in Britain studying for a doctoral thesis in
1971-74, he was struck by the 'endless labour conflicts' in the UK and the
power cuts that eventually led to the fall of Edward Heath.
Naturally cautious, he is anxious to avoid the type of shock therapy that
sent unemployment rocketing under Mrs Margaret Thatcher, though he admired
her decisiveness.
The worst thing, he says, is not to be decisive through fear of making a
mistake. 'I received a country in a state of backwardness, of many speeches
about all the things that needed to be done but were never done. I
introduced a new style in Portuguese politics. I resolved to move to
practical action, not just to make speeches but to act, to confront vested
interests, to analyse problems and take the correct decision.'
He liked President John Kennedy and admired General De Gaulle. But he says
he has no model, and he remains suspicious of politicians.
'People used to say I was anti-politician because I didn't like verbalism
(and) flowery speeches. I still don't like that. I don't see politics as a
game. For me politics has only one meaning: practical action, the
possibility of doing things which serve the country.'

PRESIDENT Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia told his countrymen yesterday they
had no choice but to persevere with reforms, although the economy had yet to
hit bottom. Reuter reports from Prague.
He said in a traditional new year address to the nation that it would be
foolish to blame the parliament, government and president for economic,
legislative and ethnic problems as well as a soaring crime rate and
increasing intolerance.
'It is a task for us all and we have no right to protest, for we have chosen
it for ourselves,' the president said, referring to the overthrow of the
communist system in late 1989.
He praised the results of economic reform which started with the
liberalisation of prices a year ago.
'A market economy environment is now becoming established. We have managed
to sustain a balanced budget, there is no runaway inflation and the foreign
debt is manageable.'
But he said hopes that the economic slump could be reversed as early as
mid-1992 might be premature.
'It seems that we are yet to reach the bottom. But at the same time,
preconditions for a change should begin to arise.'
Mr Havel said he was 'agitated' by the senseless war in Yugoslavia and the
danger of conflicts in the explosive transformation of the post-communist
world'. But he stressed he was most concerned by the continuing inability of
the Czechs and Slovaks to settle the future set-up of the ferderation,
composed of two republics.
'There is not much I can promise you. For myself, it is but one thing: as
long as I will be in office, I will use all my prerogatives and influence to
support what I deem right and what will help us rediscover ourselves.'
