FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine launches London manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday summoned the genie of the defunct Greater London
Council (GLC) in an attempt to link Labour's proposed strategic London
authority with 'loony left' extremism.
The Tories attacked Labour-controlled borough councils and what they termed
Labour's 'vicious targeting of London' through its tax proposals.
Labour's tax and national insurance plans meant that 'people on top taxes
would be paying those taxes at lower levels than even under (former Labour
chancellor) Denis Healey,' said Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary,
who was heading a six-strong phalanx of ministers.
The six ministers assembled at Central Office to launch the Tories' London
manifesto, which promises a Cabinet subcommittee for the capital, a minister
for London transport and a private-sector forum to advise on the city's
promotion as a cultural and business centre.
The ministerial cast - Mr Heseltine, Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Timothy Renton,
Mr Stephen Dorrell, Mr Roger Freeman and Mrs Angela Rumbold - seemed
designed partly to compensate for the lack of anything new: the proposals
had appeared in summary form in Wednesday's manifesto.
Mr Heseltine attacked Labour's proposed authority as 'a GLC which we will
remember very clearly is . . . a body to undermine the elected government of
the day.'
The aggressive tenor appeared to confirm the view of many observers that
Labour's proposed London government might prove attractive to the capital's
voters.
Polls suggest that seven in 10 Londoners want an elected authority for their
city. The Liberal Democrats have also proposed such a body, to be elected by
proportional representation and partly funded by local taxes.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Sixth delay for tram project in Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REINTRODUCTION of the tram into Britain was yesterday postponed for the
sixth time because drivers and staff want more training.
Manchester's supertram - a Pounds 135m light-rail transit system designed to
run on railway lines as well as through city centre streets  - was supposed
to start operating on Monday, but yesterday the launch was postponed until
April 6.
The supertram will provide a through service from Bury, in the north of
greater Manchester, to Altrincham in the south, and will connect
Manchester's rail termini.
Monday was supposed to see the opening of the section over normal rails from
Bury to Victoria Station, followed a month later by street-running through
the city centre to Deansgate Station. The extension to Altrincham was due a
month later, followed by a spur from the main shopping area to Piccadilly
Station, the main railway terminus.
Tracks, trams and signals are ready, but staff have asked for more training.
The system was scheduled to open last October but problems with British Rail
lines, extra work on bridges and modifications to the Italian-built trams
have caused five postponements.
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive said a derailment two weeks
ago, followed shortly by the first suicide under the wheels of one of the
trams, had not affected the schedule.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Panama in debt swap

<TEXT>
THE government of Panama has agreed with a US environmental group to what
may be the largest swap of commercial bank debt to finance an environmental
project, reports Stephen Fidler.
Nature Conservancy, a non-profit body based in Arlington, Virginia, will aim
to buy at least Dollars 30m face value of Panamanian debt at a discount. The
debt will then be swapped for Dollars 30m of 'ecology' bonds.
The bonds will earn up to Dollars 2.5m a year, part of which will support
government activities and the rest community projects to stop encroachment
of the rain forest by poor farmers.
The funds will be spent mainly in two big designated national parks, in one
of which is located the source waters for the Panama Canal. Some
environmentalists say that the forest degradation there has contributed to a
worrying drop of water levels in the canal.
Nature Conservancy will have up to Dollars 10m available to purchase debt,
Dollars 8m of which has been pledged by the US government, and will also
solicit donations from banks and other holders. At the current secondary
market price of 27 cents for every dollar face value of debt, some Dollars
37m of debt could be purchased.
Some 22 commercial debt-for-nature swaps have been completed, the largest
involving Dollars 33m of Costa Rican debt.

MALAWIAN exiles and critics of President Kamuzu Banda's government hold a
conference in Lusaka today to discuss prospects for democratic change in
their country, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
The three-day meeting in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, which follows calls
within Malawi for democratic reform, will bring together exiles from a
number of countries, including Europe and North America.
'The economic, social and political order in Malawi is. . . in a state of
paralysis,' one of the Lusaka conference organisers, Mr Mapopa Chipeta of
the Southern Africa Institute for Research and Policy Studies in Harare,
said yesterday. 'The atmosphere is pregnant with expectations of major
changes.'
Malawi, a small state with a population of 8.5m, has been tightly ruled by
Mr Banda, 93, since independence from Britain in 1964. He outlawed all
opposition parties shortly after taking power.
Roman Catholic bishops in Malawi issued a pastoral letter on March 8
criticising the government's human rights record and calling for democratic
reform. Mr Banda on Tuesday said Malawi guaranteed freedom of religion but
warned that churches should stay out of politics.
Mr Chafukwa Chihana, general secretary of the Southern African Trade Union
Co-ordinating Council and one of the Lusaka meeting delegates, called on all
churches in Malawi to join the Catholic bishops in criticising the
government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUDHIANA, the industrial capital of the Punjab, has become the focus of a
new wave of terrorism by Sikh militants seemingingly aimed at deterring
investment in the state and undermining the legitimacy of the new state
government.
Militants on Wednesday night sprayed crowded streets with machine gun fire,
killing 20 people and seriously wounding 20 more. This is the third such
incident in a week in which militants have indiscriminately opened fire,
causing large casualties.
Three days ago 18 people were mowed down in Ludhiana - a town that even a
year ago counted itself free from violence. A week ago 15 executives of
Indian Acrylics were killed at Sangrur while on the site of a new plant
being established in collaboration with Dupont, the US chemicals company.
Ludhiana yesterday was placed under indefinite curfew as angry crowds blamed
police and the government for failing to provide adequate security.
Elsewhere in the state 16 people were reported killed in further violence.
The wave of killings coincides with moderate Sikh organisations reversing
their long held position of accepting that the Punjab should remain a part
of the Indian union.
On Wednesday,the moderate Sikh organisations which boycotted the recent
state assembly and parliamentary elections in the Punjab made common cause
on a public platform for the first time to call for secession from India and
a separate Sikh state of Khalistan. The Sikh organisations declared that
they were no longer interested in remaining part of India 'after 45 years of
state repression and denial of justice'. The new stance of the Sikh
moderates means a further polarisation in the state with moderates and
terrorists now joining forces against the Congress state government elected
last month. The newly elected members of the 117-seat state assembly were
sworn in on Monday as it met for the first time in 57 months. During this
period Punjab has been under direct rule from Delhi.
Both Sikh militants and moderates are denying legitimacy to the assembly
which they describe as a puppet body. Congress won virtually all the seats
after the Sikh parties boycotted the election.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Flood dilemma for Bangladesh: Action to avert disasters may
do more harm than good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNETTE BINGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THIRD of Bangladesh will slip under water in the next three months as
monsoon rains swell the rivers of the Ganges delta. If rainfall is
exceptional, many will lose their lives or their livelihood. Communications
will be cut, schools closed and infrastructure destroyed before the rivers
recede.
There are few years when Bangladesh is not affected by floods. But the
extent to which rivers and floods should be controlled is disputed.
Mr William Smith of the World Bank, which is co-ordinating the efforts of
donor countries to improve flood protection in Bangladesh, said solutions
had to be tailored to regions and types of floods. 'It is not a choice
between non-structural or structural solutions: or between the embankment
approach or the no-embankment approach. It just isn't that simple,' he told
a recent meeting in Dhaka between donor countries and the Bangladesh
government.
Environmentalists are worried that structures such as embankments will alter
the ecology of the delta, disrupt fisheries, drain wetlands and possibly
cause more harm than good. The counter argument is that disastrous floods
are an environmental hazard for 110m people: and the persistent risk of
floods is hampering the country's development.
After the 1988 floods, which killed 2,000 and flooded almost 100,000 square
kilometres of farmland, donor countries clubbed together under the World
Bank to institute a Flood Action Plan to determine what scale of protection
was possible.
The dilemma is how to curtail the adverse effects of flood without undue
disruption to the floodplain ecology upon which many people depend. This
central problem emerges from detailed studies, costing Dollars 150m, which
have just started. The Dhaka meeting was the first opportunity for open
dialogue between the government, the international teams working on studies,
and the critics.
The country consists of the delta of three major river systems, the Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghna. Bangladesh has no control over the vast majority of
the river water which pours into its territory because only 8 per cent of
the catchment area falls within its borders.
In some parts of the country, embankments are needed to protect the
dry-season rice crop from early floods: in other areas, for example the
Sylhet Depression in the north-east, deep floods occur every year and the
situation cannot be changed.
In the centre of the country one of the greatest flood risks comes from the
Brahmaputra river which is up to 15km wide and has a peak flow of 100,000
cubic metres per second, exceeded only by the Amazon. Breaches in its banks
are already causing water to flow from the Brahmaputra into a smaller river,
the Bangali, which is two kilometres away.
Engineers say one exceptional flood could cause the Brahmaputra to change
course completely and pour into the Bangali. If this were to happen, 5m
people would be cut off. The river's course is being studied as an urgent
priority by German and French, British and Chinese teams.
Complex issues of population growth and the economies of the national drive
for grain production underlie the technical problems of dealing with the
flood plains.
Food grain policy requires land to be protected from floods to make it
suitable for use of high yielding varieties of rice which have to be fed
with nitrogen fertiliser and protected with pesticides. According to Dr
Haroun er Rashid, who chaired the environment session of the meeting this
month, much of the damage to the environment comes from this pursuit of rice
self-sufficiency. He questioned whether if was the right policy for
Bangladesh in the long-term.
Last year, for the first time in 20 years, rice production (20m tonnes) met
the needs of the population. However, with population predicted to rise from
around 107m to 130m by the end of the decade it will be difficult to
maintain this.
Flood control increases land for high yield rice: but it reduces
opportunities for catching fish in lakes and flooded depressions.
If the grain self-sufficiency policy continues, it could weigh the rice/fish
balance in favour of rice. Methods of economic analysis used at present do
not show the importance of fish caught and consumed by poor families and not
sold on the open market.
A fisheries study, funded by Britain's Overseas Development Administration,
is just starting under the FAP and should eventually provide the data needed
to balance the rice/fish equation more accurately.
All donor-country representatives at the meeting emphasised that the new
democratic government in Bangladesh should try to establish wider public
participation in decision making. They also stressed that every stage of the
plan must be assessed for its environmental impact.
Dr Shamsul Huda, at the ministry of water and flood control, said social and
environmental effects of flood control schemes had been largely ignored in
the past and that lack of consultation at the planning stage had caused many
problems. 'We should not evaluate projects carried out 20 years ago by the
standards of today,' he said. 'The challenge now it to keep detrimental
side-effects of flood control projects to the minimum.'

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN yesterday welcomed an offer by Afghanistan's President Najibullah
to step down in favour of an interim government proposed by the United
Nations, but the offer was dismissed by the guerrilla groups in exile in
Pakistan, agencies report from Islamabad.
Mr Mohammed Siddique Khan Kanju, Pakistan's minister of state for foreign
affairs, said Mr Najibullah's announcement would ease plans for an Afghan
assembly representing all sides. The UN plans to convene the assembly in
late April in Vienna or Geneva as a prelude to the interim government.
'We view this development positively and believe that it will greatly
facilitate the UN process aimed at the transfer of power to an Islamic
interim government,' Mr Kanju said.
Mr Najibullah, after talks with Mr Benon Sevan, a UN special envoy, offered
to step down as soon as the interim government was formed as part of a UN
peace plan to end 13 years of civil war.
The UN plan is backed by moderate guerrilla groups as well as Pakistan and
Iran, which between them play host to more than 5m Afghan refugees and the
guerrilla groups. It envisages a ceasefire and elections.
Pakistan has served as the main conduit for western arms previously supplied
to guerrillas. It is now keen to use the Afghan land route to establish
commercial links with the Moslem-dominated former Soviet republics in
Central Asia.
Radical mujahideen guerrilla groups, who reject the UN plan as a conspiracy
to deprive them of power, said Mr Najibullah should resign at once. Mr
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hardline guerrilla leader, said: 'Najibullah has no
option but to resign because he is quickly losing control over the
situation.'
Mr Hekmatyar said power must be transferred to an interim government 'which
comprises good Moslems and is acceptable to all sides'. That should be
followed by a ceasefire and elections within one year of the power transfer,
he said.
Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla party leader, who has
refrained from outrightly rejecting the UN plan like other radicals, called
Mr Najibullah's offer a move forward but said it was not enough. He proposed
that the mujahideen create an interim administration of their own to provide
security in 'liberated areas'.

ZIMBABWE'S parliament yesterday passed a controversial land bill which will
allow the state to seize land from white commercial farmers for
redistribution to black peasants. Reuter reports from Harare.
But the 150-member parliament dropped some elements of the Land Acquisition
Bill which a parliamentary legal committee said violated the constitution.
One deleted clause, denying farmers the right to challenge compensation
payments in court, was hotly contested by Zimbabwe's 4,500 commercial
farmers.
A clause that empowers the agriculture minister to designate land for
redistribution was retained despite farmers' protests.
The government says it plans to reallocate 5.5m hectares, just over half the
white farming community's land, to hundreds of thousands of peasants living
in overcrowded conditions.

NINE international consortia have submitted bids to set up two mobile phone
networks in Greece to serve Athens and the surrounding Attica district.
The bidders include groups led by Bell South and Telefonica International of
Spain; Vodafone of the UK and Intracom, a Greek telecoms company; and
Motorola with Bell Canada and France Telecom.
The Greek government said that contracts will be awarded later this year,
with the two systems expected to start up before the end of 1993.
Investment in the project will reach Dollars 200m (Pounds 113.6m) in the
first five years, with initial studies indicating about 80,000 subscribers
by 1996. Both networks will use GSM, the new cellular radio system now being
set up across Europe.
The mobile networks are intended to relieve pressure on the conventional
system. Applicants for telephones have to wait an average of seven years for
a connection. However, the project is already several months behind schedule
because of delays in setting up a regulatory framework for Greek
telecommunications. In addition, the government has not yet decided whether
OTE, the Greek state telecoms company, can take a minority stake in both
mobile networks without violating EC rules.

The Bush administration yesterday sent a direct plea to Japanese businesses

The US ambassador, Mr Michael Armacost, warned a gathering of senior

by negative commentary on both sides could grow worse if more is not done to
counter Japan's surging trade surplus.
'It is the persistent imbalance in our economic and trade relationship
mainly that fuels discord - and provokes misleading stereotypes on both
sides,' Mr Armacost said. 'There's got to be some kind of rough equality in
business opportunities.'
Mr Armacost urged Japan to relax its ban on rice imports, further deregulate

guidelines.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Spain's regional dilemma: OECD warning on high cost of
decentralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decentralisation of power to the Spanish regions is costing the country
dear and hampering Madrid's efforts to cut the central budget deficit,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
In its report on the Spanish economy, the OECD also warns that the slowdown
in economic activity will make it difficult to lower the deficit to a
targeted 1.9 per cent of GDP this year as revenues fall and social spending
rises. Spain recorded a deficit of 2.5 per cent of GDP last year after
budgeting for less than 1 per cent.
Spain's 17 autonomous regions were guaranteed new powers under the 1979
Constitution. But in the last four years, says the OECD, the transfer of
powers has increased public sector employment in the regions by 31 per cent,
or 100,000 people. Despite this, central government employment, which should
have been falling, has risen.
Rapidly increasing spending by the regions is easily outstripping the rate
at which the central government deficit is shrinking. Regional government
deficits, which accounted for 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985, now account for
1.5 per cent.
While much of this could be justified, the OECD says, 'there has also been
considerable overspending on prestige projects, high salaries (often higher
than central government packages), immoderate recruitment and spending to
placate local lobbies' - the last referring to heavy spending on loss-making
regional public television networks.
The report says that growing social welfare commitments from the central
budget, especially disability payment (temporary disability expenditure has
risen 41 per cent in two years) are probably impossible to reverse in the
short term but urges Madrid to make the system more cost-effective. It says
there is widespread fraud in the system of invalid pensions and that tax
evasion remains high. The declared average income of self-employed business
people in 1990 was about 40 per cent lower than that of wage earners.
The OECD report will prove useful to the finance minister, Mr Carlos
Solchaga, who this year is preparing to attack a wide range of structural
rigidities - in the labour markets, the civil service and public sector
industries. He is attempting to make the economy more responsive to policy
decisions in the run-up to European Monetary Union.

VOTERS in Tatarstan, a small autonomous republic east of Moscow, will
tomorrow determine the fate of President Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation
with a referendum on whether to break away from it.
More than four centuries after Ivan the Terrible set fire to Kazan and
destroyed the last independent Tatar state, an expected 'yes' vote could
trigger the collapse of Russia by setting a precedent for the other 19
semi-independent enclaves within the Federation. Russia's constitutional
court ruled earlier this week that the Tatar referendum was illegal and Mr
Yeltsin yesterday appealed to Tatar officials to halt the vote.
Supporters of President Yeltsin also fear that if seen to allow the
disintegration of Russia, the man who once invited autonomous republics to
'take as much sovereignty as you can' could be overthrown and the whole
course of Russian reform reversed.
Conversely, any attempt to use force will only provoke a violent reaction
from Tatars, and jeopardise the fragile stability needed to pursue economic
change in Russia.
Tatarstan's once staunchly communist leadership, which embraced last
August's coup but then turned nationalist to stay in power, denies that the
poll amounts to a vote on independence. The referendum asks whether
Tatarstan should be 'a sovereign state, a subject of international law,
which builds its relations with the Russian Federation . . . on an equal
basis'.
Both the Russian government and the local opposition say the question is
deliberately ambiguous to fool inhabitants who want more rights but who
would never vote for outright secession. It is hard to see what the point of
the referendum is if not independence - as Tatar officials obliquely admit
after some questioning. 'We don't want national independence, but state
independence,' says the Mayor of Kazan, Mr Kamil Iskhakov, who promises
equal rights for Russians and other non-Tatars who make up 51 per cent of
Tatarstan's 4m inhabitants.
While some Tatars see independence as a chance to redress the injustice of
centuries of Russian domination, most of the nationalism is spawned by
economic conditions. With most of the former Soviet Union's natural wealth,
including Tatarstan's oil, under state control, independence becomes a means
of keeping wealth for the local population rather than giving it to Moscow.
Mr Insaf Rakhimov, deputy director of Tatneft, the republic's state oil
company, complained bitterly that at present he can only sell 5m tonnes of
oil for the benefit of Tatarstan. The rest of his annual output of 30m
tonnes is handed over to Russian authorities for export or for distribution
within the rest of the country. To add insult to injury, 50 per cent of the
hard currency he makes from his 5m tonnes has to be sold to the Russian
central bank for roubles.
'What is this if not theft by Russians?' he asked. Decades of centralised
management from Moscow have also meant a wasteful exploitation of deposits
and the running down of equipment, now badly in need of replacement. 'If I
could sell all the oil myself, Tatarstan could be a new Kuwait,' he argued,
claiming that the profits would be enough not only to finance independence
but to buy equipment without having to give oil to foreign investors.
Russia's dilemma is that it is too late to reverse nationalism, even if it
deals with economic grievances.
Tatar leaders say that even if they get economic independence now, as Russia
is offering, it will not be enough to soothe radical Tatar opinion.
The relative calm in Chechnya, the other autonomous republic which is
refusing to sign the federal treaty, shows it may be more sensible, however
painful to Russian pride, to let the republics go their own way.
As Mr Zinnur Latipov, an opposition deputy, told workers at a Kazan factory
this week, the only hope is that the outside world will also ignore
Tatarstan. 'Not one civilised country in the world will recognise us -
perhaps just Libya and Saddam Hussein.'

<TEXT>
HUGE amounts of aid have still not delivered a self-sustaining economic
recovery in east Germany, a government report said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Berlin.
'The economy has still not come out of its depression,' said a study by the
DIW and Kiel research institutes, a quarterly review commissioned by the
government.
The study follows a critical report issued on Wednesday by the Bundesbank
which said Germany may have to raise taxes to pay for the spiralling costs
of unification. The latest report said it was wrong to rely purely on west
German aid and western investment to rescue the east, but noted east German
companies could not build up their own investments because of high wage
rises.
Estimated investments this year of DM12,000 (Pounds 4,195) per job in east
Germany were only one third of the amount pledged in west Germany. Nearly 3
1/2 m jobs have been lost in the east since unification in 1990. But the
report said that east German industry, suffering from high wages, outmoded
products, overmanning and decrepit machinery, was still a long way from
becoming competitive.

FT  20 MAR 92 / A death in Sicily changes the election landscape in Italy: A
cynical public, writes Robert Graham, wants credible explanations, not vague
warnings from the Christian Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unflappable and long-used to parrying the most direct questions with
sybilline ambiguity, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing Italian prime
minister, rarely loses his cool in public. But the killing last Thursday in
Palermo of Mr Salvatore Lima, who was Mr Andreotti's friend and the most
powerful Christian Democrat politician in Sicily, has provoked his sustained
ire.
What has pained him most has been renewed talk of his late friend's
involvement with the Mafia. Nevertheless, the killing, which magistrates and
much of the public assume was on Mafia orders, has not only unsettled Mr
Andreotti. It has again brought to the fore, at a most sensitive moment in
the country's general election campaign, an assertion in which almost every
Italian believes: 'The Mafia never acts without good cause.'
The Christian Democrats, and particularly Mr Andreotti, whose faction within
the party Mr Lima supported, have to explain why the Mafia might choose to
eliminate the man who delivered the party's large Sicilian vote. But, rather
than provide a credible explanation, the government has begun to mutter
darkly about a plan to destabilise Italy. On Wednesday, the Ministry of
Interior issued a circular to the nation's 92 civil governors specifically
warning of a campaign to destabilise the elections.
Something like this occurred in the 1970s, when Italy faced the prospect of
'an historic compromise' between the Christian Democrats and the Communists.
The mainstream opposition, the security services and elements within the
Christian Democrats then orchestrated a strategy of tension to confuse the
electorate.
But the idea that similar forces are now at work has been greeted with
widespread cynicism. President Francesco Cossiga, who these days seems to do
much of the opposition's work by rejecting his Christian Democrat
credentials on the grounds that the party is incapable of instituting urgent
institutional reforms, summed up public reaction: 'If anyone thinks a coup
is being planned, the plotters should be denounced. Otherwise it's just
trouble-making and giving ideas to fiction-writers.'
That these issues should be given a public airing has transformed the
election campaign and cast a cloud over the political future of Mr
Andreotti, who as seven times prime minister has his sights on the
presidency after the April 5 poll. It also makes the Christian Democrats
ever more awkward allies in what is bound to be a fresh coalition government
after the elections.
Christian Democrat election strategy until Mr Lima's death was based on the
assumption that votes would be lost in the North to the populist Lombard
League and the small Republican Party (PRI) but would be offset by gains in
the South, especially in Sicily, where old-style political patronage still
holds sway. Lombardy and Sicily are the two regions with the largest number
of voters. Thus, while in the North the Christian Democrat vote could fall
below 30 per cent, it could be above 40 per cent in the South. This would
give the party its traditional third of the national vote.
It is possible that the Christian Democrats can successfully play on a vote
of fear, especially if further prominent killings occur. But the 'fear vote'
has always been based on apprehensions in a Catholic country of a
Communist-dominated government. As Prof Paul Ginsborg wrote in his study of
contemporary Italian politics: 'To hold power in the face of the (Communist)
enemy became almost an end in itself, to which essential reforms were to be
subordinated.' However, the threat no longer exists, and the electorate
knows, as the government has also been saying in its saner moments, that the
challenge is to create the conditions for convergence with Europe.
The killing has also exposed another uncomfortable reality: the dependence
of the Christian Democrats and, to a lesser extent, their Socialist partners
on organised crime for part of their vote in the South.
As much as 10 per cent of the vote in the South is reckoned to be controlled
directly by organised crime with a further 25 per cent 'tainted,' according
to a recent article by the weekly newspaper Il Mundo. In other words, while
the state is formally at war with the Mafia, at the level of local politics,
a complicity exists.
This state of affairs led Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former Christian Democrat
mayor of Palermo, to break with his party in Sicily (controlled by Mr Lima)
and form a rival grouping campaigning for clean government, La Rete (The
Network). The latter picked up 8 per cent of the vote in last year's
regional elections in Sicily and could be a significant beneficiary of the
Lima affair.
The impact of the Lima affair also has to be seen in the context of a ruling
party riven by internal factions and run by a diminishing number of
political heavyweights. An ageing and tarnished Andreotti leaves only Mr
Arnoldo Forlani, the party secretary, and Mr Ciriaco de Mita, the president,
as experienced players with significant support bases.
The sole new blood is Mr Mario Segni, the son of a former president, who is
pledged to carry out a series of referendums on institutional reform on a
cross-party basis. And it is not clear how long Mr Segni will choose to
remain inside the party.
Although the Christian Democrats continue to control the levers of power,
from 4,163 of the 8,100 mayors, to the security services and the major state
corporations, the present circumstances do not afford a comfortable base on
which to fight an election and defend a record of 46 years' uninterrupted
government.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Germany's companies register their unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in west Germany have a worse opinion of their country's qualities
as an industrial base than they did three years ago and more than a quarter
of them have reacted by cutting domestic employment, a study by the Ifo
economic research institute showed.
Surprisingly, they are also less happy about the quality of German labour.
But Ifo said this view - mainly expressed by smaller companies - seemed to
reflect improvements in countries competing for German industrial
investment, like Spain, France, and Ireland, rather than any deterioration
of the German workforce's qualifications.
The findings of Munich-based Ifo will add fuel to the debate about the
future of Standort Deutschland (Germany as an industrial base) at a time
when employers are faced with high wage demands and intensifying foreign
competition.
As negative factors, companies cited high wage and social security costs,
short working weeks, high corporate taxes and tough environmental rules. The
main positive factors were the lack of industrial strife and fairly
consistent government policies.
Ifo said 27 per cent of companies had reduced employment at their German
plants, with 8 per cent more planning to do so. In the capital goods
industry, where Germany is strong in world markets, 34 per cent had laid off
workers and 13 per cent had plans to do so.
The study, carried out in December, was based on the views of 500 companies.
Ifo said they had a less positive view about Standort Deutschland than
during the last enquiry at the end of 1988.
It cautioned about dramatising the results but they are in line with the
actions of many German companies which have recently announced poorer
profits, job cuts and the shift of production abroad.
Ifo said 20 per cent of companies had moved some output from Germany, with 8
per cent having such plans. Again, the capital goods industry was to the
fore, with figures of 35 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. At the
biggest companies, with more than 500 employees, 29 per cent had cut jobs
and 36 per cent shifted production.

FT  20 MAR 92 / France, Italy and Spain leadrevival in sales of new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in western Europe in February rose by 1.3 per cent to an
estimated 1.104m helped by higher demand in France, Italy and Spain.
In the first two months of the year sales were 2.2 per cent higher than a
year ago at 2.36m according to industry estimates.
Sales for the full year are still expected to show a small decline, but
several car makers have revised upwards their forecasts for west European
new car sales in recent weeks, due to stronger than expected demand in
Germany, France, Italy and Spain in the first two months of the year.
New car sales in February were higher than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets
across west Europe and lower in five.
The long-lived recession in the UK deepened further, with sales plunging by
12 per cent in February to 109,414, while sales in Germany fell by around
5.5 per cent from last year's record level to an estimated 324,000.
These declines were compensated, however, by a 4.1 per cent jump in Italian
new car sales in February to 224,291, while new car registrations rose by
4.7 per cent in France to 161,100 and by 26 per cent in Spain to 85,479.
Among the smaller European markets the strongest growth this year has been
achieved in Belgium and Luxembourg, Portugal and Denmark, while sales remain
weakest in Finland.
Among the volume car makers the Fiat group of Italy, which includes Lancia
and Alfa Romeo, narrowly regained second place in the west European sales
league, but it continues to lose ground to the Volkswagen group of Germany.
The Fiat group's car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 5.1 per cent
in the first two months of the year, while its market share shrank to only
12.9 per cent compared with the commanding 16.9 per cent held by the VW
group, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda.
Fiat's grip on the domestic Italian market is still slipping alarmingly this
year with a fall in its market share in the first two months to 43.5 per
cent from 47.4 per cent a year ago.
Ford, which is suffering heavily from its exposure to the depressed UK
market, has also slipped back in the first two months with an estimated 4
per cent decline in sales volume across Europe. By contrast Renault is
emerging as the fastest growing of the big six volume car makers this year,
helped by the success of its Clio small car range. It increased its sales by
an estimated 7.6 per cent in the first two months of the year allowing it to
raise its share to 10.7 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year ago. BMW has also
been boosted significantly by the successful launch of its new generation
3-series.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Ukrainian confusion on nuclear options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN leaders yesterday angrily denied reports that they had reversed
their decision to halt the shipment of tactical nuclear missiles to Russia.
They said they were ready to have the weapons dismantled in Russia as
originally planned, but only on condition this took place under
international supervision, for which no provision has been made.
The denial of both Russian and Nato reports underscores the tense relations
between Ukraine and Russia and the confusion surrounding the control of
nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union on the eve of a crucial meeting
of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Kiev.
Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said that 'no-one has
revoked the decision of the president.' President Leonid Kravchuk last week
announced that Ukraine was halting the transfer of the weapons to Russia
because it had no guarantees that they were being dismantled.
On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, was quoted as
saying Ukraine had reversed its decision, and this was backed up by a Nato
spokesman.
Yesterday western diplomats in Moscow were treating the Ukrainian insistence
on international monitoring as a face-saving gesture. They believe Ukraine
has indeed submitted to the necessity of returning the missiles to Russia by
July because of pressure from western states, particularly the US and
Canada.
One western defence attache said: 'I think we can say that this was a false
alarm. Once the US and Canada, which have been the most sympathetic to the
Ukrainian position, had made it clear they wouldn't wear it, then they are
bound to carry out what they had promised.' Ukrainian officials admit it was
a mistake for Mr Kravchuk not to consult western powers before making his
announcement.
Western states, including the US, Britain, and France, have promised
technical assistance in the dismantling of the nuclear missiles on Russian
territory, although there is no provision for international supervision of
the process.

FT  20 MAR 92 / De Klerk to quicken pace of constitutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk indicated yesterday that he would quicken the pace of
constitutional reform in South Africa.
Mr de Klerk, buoyed by the white electorate's overwhelming endorsement of
negotiations with black political leaders, said 'a sense of urgency' and
'dynamic negotiation' was needed to end any uncertainty about the country's
political future.
Echoing the need for rapid progress, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National
Congress president, urged Mr de Klerk to act quickly. Mr Mandela told a
press conference in Cape Town: 'Our demand is that the interim government
must be introduced this year, and we think that is possible.'
'We sincerely hope, now that Mr de Klerk has got an overwhelming endorsement
for his role in the negotiations, that he will now be able to move with
speed.'
Mr de Klerk, who was speaking in Cape Town after a meeting with Mr Pierre
Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, declined to put a timetable on
the reform process.
'The basis of negotiation is consensus so no one can say how long it will
take,' said Mr de Klerk. But he made clear that Tuesday's referendum, in
which 69 per cent of the white electorate voted for constitutional talks,
had given impetus to the negotiations.
Officials from the government and the ANC believe that an interim government
could be in place by the end of the year.
The combination of the size of the 'yes' vote in the referendum and the
success of the national side in the World Cup cricket tournament in
Australia, has left most of white South Africa feeling in better heart than
it has for years.
The response from the business community, fearful that sanctions would be
reimposed in the event on a 'no' vote, has bordered on the euphoric. 'Thank
you for saying 'yes',' read one company-sponsored full-page advertisement in
the country's leading daily newspaper.
A sizeable exception to the rejoicing is represented by the parliamentary
caucus of the rightwing Conservative party, for whom the referendum was a
disaster.
The caucus met yesterday to consider its strategy in the face of Tuesday's
rebuff.
Many observers expect a split in the party, which persuaded 31 per cent of
whites to oppose reform - well below their expectations.
Some Conservative MPs believe the party should now participate in
constitutional talks, which so far it has boycotted. Mr Andries Treurnicht,
the party leader, gave no clue yesterday of his plans, but warned that Mr de
Klerk 'will be the victim of his own reform.'
'Mr de Klerk is negotiating his own government out of power,' said Mr
Treurnicht.

Dollars 340m methanol facility in Venezuela.
The new plant will be designed to produce 735,000m tonnes per year of
methanol, a compound made from natural gas that is used as an octane booster
in petrol.
Partners in the new venture are Pequiven a subsidiary of Venezuela's
national oil company, PDVSA, (with 35.5 per cent); Mitsubishi Corporation
and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical (22.75 per cent each); the Polar group, a
Venezuelan beer producer (10 per cent) and the World Bank's International
Finance Corporation (5 per cent). Pequiven said that finance would be
arranged by Banque Indosuez and IFC.

</HEADLINE>

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S Sanfu Motors Industrial Company plans to set up a Dollars 20m
vehicle assembly plant in China with France's Renault, a senior Sanfu
official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The project, which has yet to be finalised, would be the first known
investment in China by a Taiwanese carmaker. It would also appear to
challenge a Taiwan government ban on such investment.
The official said Sanfu would avoid violating the ban by making its
investment in the name of Canadian citizen Lee Yung-yao, the son of Sanfu
chairman Lee Shui-tu.
Economics Minister Vincent Siew said last month that Taiwan's car industry
was among a number of strategic sectors not permitted to invest in China.
The ban was imposed to stop Taiwan transferring important technologies to
Chinese competitors and exposing itself to political pressure from Beijing,
which claims sovereignty over the island.
The Sanfu official said the government could not block its investment if it
was made by a foreign citizen.
A senior official at the government's Investment Commission also conceded
that it would be very difficult to stop Sanfu.
Sanfu would have a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture while Renault,
which has a technical co-operation pact with the Taiwanese firm, would
invest 40 per cent, the official said.
The plant in the central province of Hunan would have an annual production
capacity of between 10,000 and 20,000 vans or pick-up trucks, which will be
sold both in China and abroad.

FT  20 MAR 92 / Rival poll claims amid Albania's dire poverty
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TIRANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALBANIA'S former communists and their opponents both predicted victory
yesterday in the last days of a bitter election campaign in a country so
poor it can barely afford election posters, AP reports from Tirana.
'The opposition will win,' Mr Aleksander Meksi, deputy chairman of the
anti-communist Democratic Party said flatly. 'The fear has gone and there
are few possibilities to manipulate results.'
But the leader of the Socialist Party, the former communists, predicted his
party would win Sunday's vote, the second in the year since Europe's poorest
country ended more than four decades of Stalinist rule.
'I am confident we will emerge as the largest single party in the country,'
said socialist Mr Fatos Nano, 'because we are offering a radical
transformation of society specifically adjusted to Albanian conditions.'
Last March, the Democratic Party had been in existence for only three
months, but provided a strong challenge, winning 75 of 250 seats.
This year, 11 parties are running a total of 521 candidates under a new
election law that will reduce the number of parliamentary seats by two
fifths.
Under a mixed system of direct and proportionally allotted seats, the new
parliament will have between 140 and 155 seats depending on how many parties
receive at least 4 per cent of the vote.
Besides the Democrats and the Socialists, the two strongest parties are the
Social Democrats and the conservative Republicans.
Tirana is virtually without election posters because of a shortage of paper.
Those few printed are often torn down by political rivals.
Many Albanians lack even the basic necessities. Small children, dirty and in
rags, approach foreigners begging for money in Tirana. More than half the
workforce is jobless and is supported by the government printing money.
Electricity and water are sporadic. Foreign food aid feeds most of the
population, and several people have been killed in food riots at government
warehouses. Much aid is not easily distributed because of a lack of
transportation.
Mr Meksi said his anti-communist party, which has had US diplomats and other
westerners speaking at its rallies, stands the best chance to obtain enough
foreign aid to end despair. 'I know for sure that the Socialist party will
be unable to do anything,' should it win the elections.
He said if the socialists win, strikes and other protests will deepen
Albania's chaos.
On the hustings, Democratic Party leaders have drawn surprisingly large
audiences in rural areas, many of which voted communist a year ago.
Mr Nano, while predicting victory for his socialists, warned that Albania is
so polarised that one party cannot govern alone. He said he preferred a
coalition government of experts.
President Ramiz Alia, the former Communist party chief who permitted
political reforms under intense public pressure in late 1990, wants
political parties to co-operate.

FT  20 MAR 92 / East German sports hothouse runs out of steam: The former
communist state's athletics prowess will soon die along with its sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATHLETES from the former East Germany won nine out of the 10 gold medals for
the victorious German team at the Winter Olympics. This lent weight to
predictions that united Germany will be a world-beating sports superpower.
But trainers and sport club managers in east Germany are pessimistic. 'By
1996 Germany will be lucky to win five gold medals in the winter games,'
says Mr Klaus Schonberger, manager of the TSC sport club in east Berlin.
He said the foundation of the east German sport system, the selection and
training of athletes at an early age, was being rapidly dismantled.
Unlike communist East Germany, which used politicised sport to make its mark
internationally, the Bonn government did not appear to want to use sport for
prestige purposes.
'Democratically elected governments exist for four years and not until the
year 2000 (when Berlin is vying to hold the summer Olympic games),' Mr
Schonberger said.
Several east German trainers have given up on the prospects of competitive
sport in Germany and have gone to coach athletes in the US, Britain and
Austria. Those who remain are mostly unemployed. The sport training centres
which blanketed east Germany were closed down last year when the east German
sport federation DTSB was dissolved.
Mr Schonberger managed to retain a hard core of trainers for his club by
registering them with the Labour Office for a job creation programme. Now
they work for other city agencies but still find time to train athletes.
Disclosures that east Germany's champion sprinter, Katrin Krabbe, and two of
her teammates from the Neubrandenburg sport club falsified their urine
samples in a doping inquiry have led to charges that east German sport was
riddled with malpractices. Mr Schonberger, a former GDR record-holding
hurdler, admitted that trainers worked with researchers in the Institute for
Physical Culture and Sport in Leipzig - ironically, taken over by west
Germany - to develop techniques using drugs for track and field athletes,
swimmers and weightlifters.
Mr Manfred Ewald, the supremo of east German sport, was fully aware of this,
he said. Drug use, however, was no more prevalent in east Germany than in
the west. The essential difference was that while athletes in the west were
individually responsible for taking anabolic drugs, eastern athletes had
little choice if their trainers told them to do so.
The three suspended Neubrandenburg sprinters as well as their club and its
sponsor are under a heavy cloud of suspicion. But club athletes and
residents of Neubrandenburg demonstratively support the young women. Several
of them suggested there was a western 'plot' against east German athletes.
While east German athletes quickly adapted to commercialised sport in the
west, many of them believe it is short-sighted even from the standpoint of
sponsors. Jacqueline Borner, who trains at TSC and won the gold medal at the
Winter Olympics in the 1,500 metre speed skating event, complained that
sponsors were only interested in promoting top-performing athletes but not
in backing promising young talent. Thus a leading German car manufacturer
handed out cars 'left and right' to top athletes but did little to support
the essential training of juniors.
One of the reasons the east German sport machine worked so well is that it
provided incentives for athletes. An Olympic gold medal was worth 20,000
Marks, silver 15,000 Marks and bronze 10,000 Marks, although not much could
be bought for the money. Much more important was the opportunity to buy a
car without waiting ten years or to get a new flat.
The opportunity to travel was also an important inducement. The only others
allowed to travel to the west were pensioners.
Mr Ewald, whose east Berlin flat is filled with souvenirs of his travels as
president of the DTSB, proudly recalled that he convinced Mr Erich Honecker,
the East German leader, that top athletes, their wives and husbands,
trainers and masseurs should be rewarded with cruises to Cuba and the
Mediterranean.
As the principal architect of the East German sport machine, Mr Ewald, a
member of the party's central committee, was convinced it was one of the
best investments the leadership made.
Although he is relentlessly attacked by the German media over drugs use as
well as for allegedly allowing the Stasi security police to harass athletes,
he denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ewald insists that ordinary east Germans, who
were sport-mad under the communist system, still believed in him although
they had lost their faith in socialism.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, yesterday announced
proposals to introduce a FFr600,000 (Dollars 30,447) personal equity plan as
the linchpin of his initiative to create a 'shareholder's democracy' in
France.
The new personal equity plan, which will have a tax-free element and a
six-year lifespan, is a short-term savings vehicle to be launched as part of
a longer-term programme to reform the French pension system. Details will be
announced during the spring session of the National Assembly.
Pension reform has important implications for France's financial markets as
it should provide an influx of investment to resolve the long-term problem
of poor liquidity. However, the financial community was disappointed by the
announcement earlier this week that Mr Beregovoy had abandoned plans to
launch corporate pension funds in France.
The initiative comes at a time of sweeping change within the French
financial system. The government is currently reviewing the legislation on
takeovers. This week the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the stock market
regulator, voiced its support for proposals to abolish the rule whereby
predators can mount 'partial bids' for two-thirds of a company's equity in
favour of forcing them to make full offers for 100 per cent.

ECONOMIC and Monetary Union (Emu) in the European Community will cause no
significant problems for Denmark, according to the annual report from
Denmark's Nationalbank (central bank), writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The Danish economy currently meets all economic convergence criteria laid
down by the Maastricht treaty, the bank said. Loss of sovereignty when Emu
is completed will be more formal than real, said the bank, as Denmark's
monetary policy is already tied to developments in the leading member
countries of the European Monetary System.
It will mean that the country has to devolve sovereignty in this area of
policy, but in exchange the Nationalbank will gain influence over future EC
policy instead of having to follow the decisions taken by others, as at
present, said the bank. Denmark has already achieved the benefits which will
arise from the establishment of Emu, it added.

ARMENIA began rationing electricity yesterday under a state of economic
emergency stemming from its conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Despite a flurry of international peace missions - including a fact-finding
trip by United Nations envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance - a solution to the crisis over
the disputed enclave seemed no closer.
In the Armenian capital Yerevan, the government said power supplies would be
switched off for 12 hours each day because a blockade by neighbouring
Azerbaijan had shut off supply lines. Factories, until now spared the worst
of the austerity measures, would face the same power cuts as households, it
said.

Australian wool prices have continued to show an easier tendency this week.
Declines have been sharpest among finer Merinos, but throughout the range of
categories there have been varied and erratic changes from day to day. Much
depends on the quality of the offering, and overall there is a tendency for
this to fall off towards the end of the selling season, especially when
drought has been a factor in many areas. The AWC market indicator declined

FT  19 MAR 92 / Japanese brokers cut earnings forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese securities houses have sharply cut their earnings forecasts
for the year, with three of the Big Four houses reporting net losses for the
first time since the mid-1960s and 10 of the top 14 brokers expected to
report pre-tax losses.
The revisions showed that the weakness of the Tokyo market and the spate of
scandals over the past year have inflicted greater-than-expected damage on
the Japanese brokers.
Nomura Securities revised its pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March
down from Y75bn (Pounds 330m) to Y45bn, well below the Y233.5bn earned in
the previous year. Yamaichi Securities said pre-tax loss would be Y34bn and
net loss would be Y52bn.
Nikko Securities, another leading house, cut its forecast pre-tax profit
from Y45bn to Y2.5bn, down from Y72.9bn last year, while the net loss is
expected to be Y26bn. Daiwa Securities last week forecast a net loss of
Y43bn, and said pre-tax profits would be only Y13bn, against Y119bn a year
earlier and Y313bn two years ago.
Each of the companies said the poor results reflected the decline in
commission income caused by the market's slumping turnover and the mounting
appraisal losses on the companies' own stock holdings.
The longer-term effects of the stock market's weakness were particularly
evident among the 10 second-tier brokers, nine of which expect pre-tax
losses ranging from Y3.9bn to Y47.5bn. The only exception is Kokusai
Securities, which is strong in bond dealing, and forecast a small pre-tax
profit of Y130m.
Several brokers reported large losses related to disputes with clients over
tobashi, in which brokers transferred loss-making securities from one client
account to another to take advantage of different book-closing dates and
avoid the reporting of losses.
Yamatane Securities revealed yesterday that it had agreed to pay
compensation totalling Y19.4bn to two clients and that its chairman and
president would resign to take responsibility for the tobashi disputes.
Daiwa has already announced a Y72bn loss for similar reasons, and Cosmo
Securities reported a Y36bn settlement with a restaurant chain.
Trading volumes in Tokyo have been particularly low in recent months,
contributing to the expected 37 per cent fall in Nomura's commission revenue
over the year.
Nikko said its commissions would fall 36 per cent and Yamaichi forecast a 40
per cent decline.
Firms have already cut capital spending, reduced staff intakes and are
reviewing the future of unprofitable branches.

FT  19 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury eases on placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, TERRY BYLAND, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLACING of Cadbury Schweppes shares drove the price down 10 to 433p. New
shares totalling 34.4m were placed with institutions by company broker Hoare
Govett at 425p apiece to help pay for the acquisition of Femsa Aguas
Minerales, a Mexican producer of carbonated mineral water.
Cadbury Schweppes is paying Dollars 325m (Pounds 188m) for the company,
raising Pounds 145.1m through the share placing and taking the remaining
Pounds 42.9m from existing cash resources.
The share placing had not shown up on the Seaq reporting system at the close
of business, when the day's total volume in Cadbury stock was 3.2m shares.
Outside of the share placing, trading in Cadbury was average and the share
price followed the sector.
Unitech warning
A warning on trading progress from the Japanese subsidiary of Unitech sent
ripples across the stock market yesterday. The electronic components group
lost 18 to 170p after Nerric-Lambda, a power supply manufacturer, issued a
profits warning.
The Unitech announcement prompted alarm over Rank Organisation's Japanese
joint-venture, Fuji Xerox, which manufactures and markets office stationery
equipment. It contributes around one-third of profits to Rank Xerox, which
itself accounts for some 55 per cent of Rank Organisation's profits.
Analysts reported Rank as saying Fuji was 'toughing it out' in difficult
trading conditions. In New York, US broker Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette was
said to have moved from a buy to a hold on Rank Organisation. In London, the
shares tumbled 23 to 643p.
Nerric-Lambda now expects to contribute only around Pounds 8m pre-tax to
Unitech for the year to May 1992. Mr Robert Millington at BZW had previously
predicted Pounds 13m profits at Unitech this year but, in view of the Nerric
announcement, has downgraded to Pounds 11m.
Utilities hit
The latest opinion poll showings hit the utilities sectors of the market,
with dealers chopping prices in a largely successful move to head off any
big selling pressure.
Fears that a Labour government might affect the water, electricity, power
generation and gas and telecommunications stocks have hung over the sectors
for a long time.
Water shares were the worst hit as they are seen as most vulnerable to a
Labour victory. Labour has repeatedly stated its intention of returning the
water companies to public ownership.
Of the Footsie stocks, Anglian fell 14 to 332p, Thames 13 to 341p, and
Severn Trent and North West 10 apiece to 321p and 342p respectively. The
Electricity Package dropped 70 to Pounds 2548.
Scottish Power closed below 100p, the level at which the shares were sold
last year, settling 2 1/2 off at 98 1/2 p. British Gas lost 6 to 248p and BT
slipped a penny to 318p.
Midland Bank shares closed a further 11 higher at 340p, after 344p, on
turnover of almost 14m, making the stock the day's most heavily traded on
the London market.
Dealers said the market was expecting Hongkong and Shanghai Banking to
reveal its merger terms in around two weeks, the consensus being that the
minimum price it will offer will be around 375p with the potential for up to
400p.
Specialists maintained that Hongkong Bank will have to pitch its terms at a
level to win the Midland board over before a possible counter-offer might
emerge.
News of the departure of Mr Peter Van Cuylenburg, a director of Cable and
Wireless and widely regarded as responsible for the build-up of the
comp-any's Mercury telecoms division, caused a flurry of selling of C and W
shares. They registered a fall of 13 at 583p.
Last month C and W appointed the former head of BP America, Mr James Ross,
as chief executive, apparently completing a management shake-up instigated
by Lord Young, C and W's executive chairman. A telecoms specialist
commented: 'The fall in the share price is a demonstration of the City's
high regard for Mr Van Cuylenburg.'
International stocks were mostly affected by domestic political influences,
including opinion poll developments, but Reuters stood out as a sufferer
from transatlantic factors. Overnight selling from Wall Street set the
downward trend of the global business communications group in a London
market already disinclined to buy Reuters shares. At 1105p, the stock ended
36 down although turnover, at 441,000 shares, was insignificant.
SmithKline Beecham stood out against a generally dull background, moving up
8 to 880p on the back of fairly modest buying. Fewer than 2m shares were
traded but the units were upgraded by a New York brokerage house.
ICI, down 13 at 1224p, featured in the market's overall setback without
attracting much attention from the dealing desks. The fall in Fisons was
held to only 2  - to 364p  - by underlying, albeit unconvincing, bid
speculation. Glaxo, down 6 at 766p, dipped through a support level as US
sources turned sellers.
Among the media stocks, WPP Group remained friendless, drifting 2 to 66p.
Chain manufacturer Renold continued to respond to suggestions that TT, a
mini-conglomerate run by ex-Hanson dealmaker Mr John Newman, may be
considering a bid for the group. Renold finished 5 ahead at 63p. TT revealed
last week that it had increased its stake in the company to 4.6 per cent.
Building products group Marley provided one of the market's better
performances, responding to higher than expected preliminary profits. Up
some 75 per cent at Pounds 25m, these compared with estimates around the
Pounds 22m mark.
The shares settled 3 ahead at 122p, having touched 125p. Mr David Taylor,
building sector specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described Marley as 'the
only building materials group that has reported increased profits for 1991
and the only one that will do so'. Mr Taylor said Marley had 'come from
being a stale takeover stock to a company that has sorted itself out and is
a buy in its own right'.
Building materials retailers took a pasting from broker downgrades. Meyer
dipped 14 to 353p and Wolseley 5 to 142p.
Theme park group Euro Disney rose ahead of today's inclusion in the CAC 40
index in Paris, adding 18 at 1678p, after touching 1690p.
The defensive attractions of Tate &amp; Lyle helped the shares firm a penny to
421p against the general trend.
Political worries, following the latest opinion polls, weighed on the stores
sector, in spite of better than expected retail sales data. Boots lost 7 to
435p, Dixons 4 to 219p, Marks and Spencer 4 to 315p and WH Smith 'A' 10 to
444p.
Rothmans International fell 26 to 1013p in a delayed reaction to Tuesday's
warning of a 15 per cent profits fall by Rothmans Holdings, of Australia.
Guinness was a bright spot in a drinks sector depressed by the nervous
political situation. Shares in the brewing and whisky giant put on 2 to 570p
ahead of today's results.
Bass fell 19 to 530p, Grand Metropolitan 6 to 886p and Whitbread 'A' 9 to
418p.
Gloom surrounded Automated Security Holdings shares, as the security alarms
group revealed preliminary profits down some 30 per cent to Pounds 23.2m,
well below most analysts' forecasts. The stock plummeted 31 to 102p on above
average turnover of 1.7m.
After Tuesday's successful presentation to institutions by Dowty Group, at
which executives are said to have eased worries over the dividend on the
back of the imminent part-sale of its IT business, the shares steadied in a
weak market, losing a penny to 114p. The good showing reflected poorly on
Smiths Industries, which is often talked of as a predator to Dowty, the
shares losing 9 to 275p.
BM Group failed to find support after a large seller moved into the market,
the shares falling 20 to 367p. Johnson Matthey climbed 11 to 365p on
optimism over the South African election.

FT  19 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares fall as election concern grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER may be the oppo-site of election fever, the London stock market
suffered a severe bout yesterday.
Opinion polls favouring the opposition Labour party set the tone for the
day, and the FT-SE 100 Index was left to languish by disinterested
investors.
Not even a firm overnight close on Wall Street, encouraging UK retail sales
figures for February, well-received company results or new appointments to
the FT-SE 100 Index could revive jaded spirits.
Marketmakers noted at the opening that two opinion polls had shown Labour
five points ahead of the governing Conservatives and, perhaps predictably,
marked down their prices. Shortly after business commenced, the index showed
a drop of more than 20 points.
This depressed mood was made worse by the lack of enthusiasm in the
Financial Futures market, where the FT-SE contract for March delivery traded
at a discount to its estimated fair value premium, and even at a discount to
the cash market, for most of the day.
Dealers in the derivatives markets said that few houses were prepared to
take advantage of the relatively cheap March contract and buy it. Buying of
the futures contract would normally prompt selling of underlying stocks and
the lack of it yesterday meant that, if the futures were not dragging the
index down, they were preventing a rally.
Activity in the futures was prompted mainly by spasmodic buying in the
traded options market of FT-SE puts, giving the right, but not the
obligation, to sell at a fixed price; this was seen as a hedge against a
Labour victory.
Wall Street failed to provide impetus in the new session and turnover in
London remained poor in spite of a placing by securities house Hoare Govett
of 34.4m Cadbury Schweppes shares, sold to raise cash for investment in
Mexico.
Sterling and long-dated gilts also drifted down in reaction to the opinion
polls. In the last half-hour of trading, the Footsie fell to its low of the
day. Shares were depressed by gloomy expectations for two significant
opinion polls due today.
UK stocks were also influenced by a rumour that German workers might be
about to receive a higher than expected pay settlement.
Stock features included Rank Organisation and Unitech, both of which fell
sharply on worries over the profits for their Japanese subsidiaries, and
Glaxo and Reuters, which suffered from selling in New York. Cable and
Wireless was easier on management changes.
Midland Bank remained the most heavily traded stock following the
announcement on Tuesday that it is to merge with Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation. BAT Industries and Marley rose on well-received results
and Courtaulds was strong around presentations to institutions.
The FT-SE Index closed at 2,464.7, down 26.5 and just above its intraday
low. Turnover of 446.5m shares was slightly lower than on the previous day,
when retail business was worth Pounds 932m.
After the market closed, the FT-SE 100 Steering Committee announced
quarterly changes to the FT-SE 100 Index. Lonrho, Trafalgar House, Royal
Insurance and Tarmac have been removed from the index and have been replaced
by ECC Group, Bowater, Siebe and Coats Viyella.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves narrowly in program
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
WALL STREET dithered yesterday, with equities trading in a narrowly mixed
range throughout the day, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 1.79 off at 3,254.25 in
unexceptional New York SE volume of 191m shares. The slim movement in US
equity markets was also registered by the broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500, which ended 0.46 easier at 409.12. On Tuesday the Dow gained about 20
points.
In the absence of any significant economic news, computer-driven program
trading dominated activity.
NBD shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 after the Detroit-based banking
group said it would acquire INB Financial, a large Indiana-based bank, in a
Dollars 876m stock swap. Each INB share will be exchanged for 1.6 shares of
NBD. Shares in INB soared Dollars 7 to Dollars 43 in active over-the-counter
trading.
Also in the secondary market, Chambers Development 'A' plunged Dollars 20
1/8 to Dollars 10 3/8 after revising its 1991 earnings to 3 cents a share
from a previously reported 83 cents to reflect a change in accounting.
Chambers predicted 1992 earnings of about 48 cents a share, sharply below
analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1.05.
Although analysts said that other waste management companies had already
addressed the problems which are starting to affect Chambers, shares in a
number of waste management companies fell. Waste Management was very active
on the NYSE and tumbled Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 .
Trading was also heavy in Blockbuster Entertainment, the video-rental chain,
which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 13 1/2 after Kemper Securities started
coverage of the stock with an aggressive 'buy' rating.
Federal Express dropped Dollars 6 to Dollars 49 1/4 after Moody's, the US
rating agency, said it was reviewing the company for a possible downgrade.
The stock had added Dollars 2 on Tuesday after the US express package
delivery company revealed details of a big retrenchment of its loss-making
European operations.
A &amp; P, the West Coast supermarket chain, climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars
33. Although A &amp; P yesterday unveiled a sharp decline in fourth-quarter
earnings to 42 cents a share from 83 cents a year earlier, it said that
pressure on its profit margins had eased from the third quarter.
A number of blue chip issues saw heavy trading, including AT&amp;T, up Dollars
3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 , Chrysler, off Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 3/4 , and
Citicorp, unchanged at Dollars 17 1/8 .
Secondary stocks were firmer than big board issues through the day, with the
Nasdaq composite ending 1.67 up at 624.94.
High-tech stocks continued to dominate Nasdaq trading, with Sun Microsystems
down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/8 , Microsoft off Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 126 3/8 and Dell Computer Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 38 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks broke a five-session losing streak to end moderately higher
after solid turnover. The composite index gained 12 points to 3,451.9, while
advances narrowly exceeded declines by 276 to 255. Volume came to 31m
shares.
The consumer products sub-group led the sectors with a 1.97 per cent gain.
Seagram jumped CDollars 6 1/4 to CDollars 139 3/4 . The company reported
decreased earnings in its latest fiscal year, and said it will seek to split
its shares on a four-for-one basis at its next annual meeting. If the split
is approved Seagram will seek to raise its dividend 12 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Attention switches to the yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR ended little changed against the D-Mark, and appeared to be
entering a consolidating phase, as dealers switched their attention to the
yen, writes Neil Buckley.
Demand for the Japanese currency dominated trading. Dealers said this could
be no more than a desire to realise profits on short yen positions.
It may also have been a response to plans announced by the Japanese economic
planning agency for an emergency economic recovery package, which might
remove the need for further interest rate cuts beyond the one the market is
already expecting.
A Japanese news agency said the Bank of Japan was expected to hold an
extraordinary meeting shortly to decide on a discount rate cut, which could
be as large as 75 basis points. Such a cut has been discounted by the
market, and the report had little effect.
The lack of dollar buying after encouraging US housing starts figures on
Tuesday made some dealers believe it has entered a corrective stage.
The US currency closed at Y132.05/15, down from a Y133.15/25 start and a
Y133.38/43 Asian close. Against the D-Mark, it was down to DM1.6500/05, from
DM1.6535/45 and DM1.6529/34. In New York the dollar picked up to finish at
DM1.6532 and Y132.32.
Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said: 'The US economy
has now turned, production is picking up, housing activity is up, but the
market has already priced in the recovery. That means we may see no new
highs for a while.' He added that he expected to see the dollar
consolidating for a week or two, before rising towards DM1.70.
President FW de Klerk's resounding victory in the South African referendum
on political reform gave a very strong boost to the financial rand, which
closed against the dollar at R3.7280, from a previous close of R3.9610.
Dealers said the result would increase foreign investors' confidence in
South Africa, and predicted further near-term gains for the rand.
The D-Mark was mixed against the EMS currencies, as the markets shrugged off
faint rumours that the Bundesbank might raise interest rates today, arising
partly from the news that Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, was to attend its
council meeting.
In spite of one rumour that the reason for this was that Mr Kohl wanted to
dissuade the bank from a rate increase, most dealers felt such a rise was
extremely unlikely.
The D-Mark was stronger against sterling, which ended at DM2.8550/57, down
from Tuesday's DM2.8610/15. The pound fell at the opening after two opinion
polls gave the opposition Labour party a five-point lead over the
Conservatives in the UK general election race, but remained around its
effective ERM floor, with some buying interest at that level keeping it
underpinned.
Sterling weakened to Dollars 1.7290 from a previous Dollars 1.7340. In New
York it ended at Dollars 1.7280.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Polls cause jitters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OPINION polls showing the opposition Labour party with a five-point lead
over the Conservatives made the UK money market nervous once more, with
rates firming across the spectrum.
The market did draw a little consolation from a 0.4 per cent rise in UK
February retail sales, fuelling hopes that consumer spending may be starting
to recover. But this did not stop rates firming again to levels more
appropriate to a 10 3/4 per cent base rate than 10 1/2 per cent.
All interbank rates climbed, with the three-month up  1/16 to
10 13/16 -10 per cent, the six-month up  1/8 to 10 15/16 -10 13/16 , and the
one-year up  3/16 to 11-10 7/8 .
The June sterling contract opened 16 basis points down at 89.13 and slid
away to 89.08.
The Bank of England did its best to sustain confidence and keep trading
rates within a realistic distance of 10 1/2 per cent by relieving the market
of a large slice of longer-dated bills in early assistance.
It forecast a shortage of around Pounds 950m, but a large part of this was
covered in early operations as the market seized the opportunity to unload
Pounds 572m of bank and treasury bills in bands 3 and 4.
The latest opinion polls had underlined the risk of carrying longer paper,
and the Bank's price of 10 3/16 per cent for band 3 and 10 5/32 per cent for
band 4 was better than anything that could be obtained in the market.
Overnight rates fell from 10-10 9/16 per cent to 10 1/2 -10 1/4 , and eased
again after midday, when the Bank purchased Pounds 350m band 1 bank bills at
10 3/8 per cent, taking out most of the remaining shortage.
This was later revised upwards to Pounds 1bn, while the Bank purchased a
further Pounds 100m band 1 bank bills to take the day's assistance to Pounds
1.022bn. Overnight rates fell to 7-5 per cent, reflecting the apparent
excess on operations.
In Germany, the Bundesbank's injection of DM1.2bn via its weekly securities
repurchase was seen as a technical move offsetting quarterly tax payments,
and gave no signal about the likely outcome of today's Bundesbank council
meeting.
In spite of some speculation in the currency markets that the council might
tighten monetary policy, dealers said they could see no reason for such a
move. German call money was steady at 9.60 per cent, with demand and supply
in balance.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum down on S African vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM'S PRICES fell sharply in London and New York yesterday as it became
clear that South Africa's white voters had approved political reform by a
wide margin in their referendum.
The referendum result ended concerns that a 'no' vote might be followed by
disruption at the South African platinum mines which between them last year
contributed nearly three-quarters of world supply outside the former eastern
bloc countries  - 2.9m out of 4m troy ounces.
At one stage in London yesterday the price was quoted at Dollars
348.50-Dollars 349.50 an ounce, nearly Dollars 7 below Tuesday's close.
Yesterday's London closing price was Dollars 352.25, down Dollars 3.50 an
ounce for the second successive day. Since Tuesday morning platinum had lost
about 2 per cent of its value.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange at midday platinum's most-active April
contract had fallen below the psychologically-important Dollars 350 an ounce
level to Dollars 349. 'Platinum needs to get back to about Dollars
353-Dollars 354 an ounce, otherwise more waves of selling could push it down
into the low Dollars 340s,' one London dealer said.
Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the S G Warburg Securities financial services
group, pointed out that, when there were no other influences, precious
metals tended to feed off one another and platinum would follow gold's
performance.
Gold, which lost 2 per cent of its value on Monday and Tuesday, recovered
slightly yesterday and closed in London up Dollars 1.20 at Dollars 340.60 an
ounce.
Mr Spriggs said platinum was now virtually an industrial metal and would do
better in the second half-year as economic recovery began to be felt in the
US. Warburg had forecast an average price of Dollars 385 an ounce for 1992
but this was in the process of being revised downwards to about Dollars 370
or Dollars 375.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pay deal ends jute mills strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 54 jute mills which have been strike bound since January 28 are
reopenning today following the signing of an agreement on Tuesday by the
Indian Jute Mills Association and 18 trade unions. The mills will need at
least a fortnight to get back to normal production, according to Mr Bharat
Jalan, chairman of IJMA.
The agreement providing for a basic wage increase of Rs90 (Pounds 1.95) a
week and a higher cost of living allowance will raise the industry's wage
bill by about Rs450m a year. This falls far short of what the unions had
been agitating for, and the industry, said Mr Jalan, would be able to bear
the additional wage burden provided there was a matching improvement in
productivity.
The Marxist government in West Bengal, which intervened to bring about the
settlement, has agreed to appoint a committee to determine the basis of
productivity-linked wages in the industry. Yet another committee will be
looking at the 'labour complement and manning pattern' in jute mills where
wages constitute as much as 40 per cent of the total cost of production.
Mr Jalan admitted that during the 50-day strike, the overseas buyers had
cancelled orders worth more than Rs600m. Moreover, routine orders worth
about Rs500m were lost as the buyers did not know when the strike would end,
he added. The industry is reconciled to the fact that it will not be able to
achieve the export target of 250,000 tonnes during the financial year ending
March 1992.
While the jute mills lost production of approximately 180,000 tonnes worth
Rs2.4bn, the synthetic substitute products have made further inroads into
the fertiliser and cement packaging market. With the federal government no
longer keen to provide protection to the traditional jute industry, it will
be difficult for jute to regain the lost ground.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe faces equity options
row on eve of merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE EVE of the official merger of the London International Financial
Futures Exchange (Liffe) and the London Traded Options Market (LTOM),
another row over the future of equity options trading at the new exchange
has blown up.
Firms which came forward to act as market-makers in individual stock options
are urging Liffe to appoint a managing director in charge of stock options
trading under the new exchange.
The options traders charge that a business plan designed to jump-start the
market  - and someone to put it into action  - is urgently needed.
Liffe, so far, appears to be resisting such pressure, but officials at the
exchange were unavailable for comment.
The disagreement is the latest in a long series of disputes which dogged the
merger's history for several years. With the legal merger about to go ahead
this weekend, and trading under the new London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange  - still to be known as Liffe  - set to start
on Monday, the latest row is not serious enough to jeopardise the merger at
this late stage.
However, the deadline for signing the official market-making agreement by
the end of trading yesterday was not met by some of the six market-making
firms as they increased pressure on Liffe.
The merger was postponed in January because an insufficient number of firms
came forward to make markets in the 67 equity options traded on LTOM. While
hopes are running high for the FT-SE index option, there seems little sign
that the low volume currently recorded in individual options will be
substantially boosted by the merger, at least initially.
The argument over the future of open-outcry trading, which the large banks
argue should be replaced by a screen-based system, could also resurface.
'The equity product is sufficiently different (from Liffe's mainly interest
rate and currency products) for someone with specialist equity derivatives
knowledge to offer important benefits to the Liffe staff,' said Mr David
Wenman, head of European equity derivatives at Swiss Bank Corporation, one
of the six market-making firms.
Mr Tony de Guingand, who ran the LTOM, will become finance director of the
merged exchange, which will be headed by Mr Michael Jenkins.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Germans draw line at two sets
of accounts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MARK TWAIN once observed that it ought to take an intelligent person about
30 hours to master the English language, 30 days to get on top of French  -
and about 30 years to master German.
In broad terms, the same holds true for accounting, the business language.
English, even French accounting is relatively easy to get to grips with  -
but it takes many years to make any sense of German accounting.
Indeed, the more sceptical analysts say that it can never be done  - that
the very term German accounting is a contradiction in terms.
UK accounts at least pay lip-service to the notion that accounts should
provide a 'true and fair' representation of what is happening at the
company, but German accounting does not aim to give outsiders such as
analysts or investors a 'true' or merely 'fair' picture of a companies'
financial condition.
If this makes it difficult for international fund managers to make informed
investment decisions about German companies, it also denies German companies
access to the world's largest capital market.
The fact that not a single German company has a full listing in the US is
directly due to German accounting. Last year, a number of Germany's largest
companies  - including Daimler-Benz, Bayer, Hoechst and BASF, and a number
of large banks  - approached the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission in the US
with a view to obtaining a listing in the US. The talks came to nothing.
The main obstacle was the SEC's requirement that the German companies - like
all companies listed in the US  - should comply with the generally accepted
accounting principles (US GAAP) in the US. The German companies refused to
give way, and the SEC would not compromise: hence an impasse.
The issue has rumbled on since then. Last month the Federation of German
Stock Exchanges said it was likely the European Commission would enter into
direct negotiations with the SEC on behalf of all European countries.
The EC may well take up the 'reciprocity' argument used by the German
companies last year  - that a company which had complied with German listing
requirements ought to qualify automatically for a listing in the US, without
having to comply with US GAAP. Since German listing requirements are much
less strenuous, US companies have no difficulty gaining a quote there.
Apart from the general principle that German companies give away very little
financial information, the main practical difference between Teutonic
accounting and the Anglo-American variety is that German accounting
invariably understates both assets and profits, as compared to figures
presented under UK rules or US GAAP.
An exercise conducted last year by Mr Gary Schieneman, an analyst for Smith
New Court in New York, showed that shareholders' equity at Mannesmann  - a
large German engineering company  - at the end of 1989 would have been at
least 40 per cent higher if presented under US GAAP, while net profits would
have been 50 per cent and 36 per cent higher in 1988 and 1989 respectively.
In another study, Mr Schieneman showed how the Volkswagen car company's 1989
profits would grow from DM1.04bn under German rules, to DM1.5bn under UK
rules and DM1.9bn under US rules.
In the answer to the question 'what did Volkswagen really earn in 1989?',
Schieneman was forced to conclude that it depended entirely on your
accounting perspective. What was true for the 1989 figures, applies equally
to those produced by large German companies in 1990 and 1991, says
Schieneman.
The differences between the German and the UK and the US versions of the
figures are in part due to German conservatism on specific issues such as
accounting for goodwill and depreciation, but there are also more
fundamental factors at work. Mrs Heidrun Haase of Deutsche Bank Research in
Frankfurt identifies some of the underlying causes of the differences
between German and Anglo-American accounting:
German law insists that the interests of creditors take precedence over
those of shareholders. The so-called Glaubigerschutzprinzip, in which this
principle is enshrined, means that companies are under legal pressure to
understate reported profits and assets.
There is no distinction between tax accounts and published accounts, as
there is in the UK or the US: the Massgeblichkeitprinzip ordains that in
order to get a deduction for tax purposes it must be booked in the published
accounts. Thus there is a cash incentive for German companies to keep
reported profits as low as possible, because lower profits mean lower tax
bills.
The structure of the German capital market does not bring pressure on
companies to ramp up their reported profits. Only about 650 German companies
are listed on the stock market, and of these the vast majority are
controlled by banks or families with long-term investment horizons.
These shareholders have access to the management accounts, which tell the
full story denied to those who must rely on published figures. Despite
recent developments such as the Continental-Pirelli saga and Krupp's
takeover of Hoesch, there is no vigorous 'market for corporate control' in
Germany and managers do not have to present spectacular profits growth to
fend off takeover.
A further, unspoken reason why German companies do not want to present
US-style figures is that it would weaken their hand in negotiations with
unions: Germany's labour costs are already higher than anywhere else in
Europe and the fear is that they could get higher if the unions saw the
profits restated upwards under US or UK GAAP.
Moreover, German managers worry that if they adopted US GAAP, they would be
taking the first steps down the slippery slope to short-termism, that is,
that industrial strategy would have to be sacrificed to the need to boost
reported profits.
There are signs that despite these forces for conservatism, German
accounting is changing: big companies are obliged to compete in
international capital markets for funds and get better rates the more they
disclose. But they still draw the line at presenting two completely
different sets of accounts, as they would have to if they listed in New
York.
Mrs Haase of Deutsche Bank says that the best German companies will in
future strike a balance between 'being prudent and making their figures
understandable for the foreign capital markets'.

THE South Korean Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) has relaxed stock market
registration requirements which had barred investments by overseas unit
trusts, investment trusts, pension funds and non-limited companies, Reuter
reports from Seoul.
'This is to actively solicit foreign investment and promote the opening of
the stock market,' the SSB said.
South Korean rules initially excluded all but individual foreign investors
and foreign corporations from investing in the market, which was opened to
limited direct foreign investment on January 3.
But South Korea has gradually relaxed the rules, permitting foreign
governments and pension funds to invest.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB chief in warning over
risks of OTC derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL institutions should pay more attention to the risks they are
running in the over-the-counter derivatives markets, Sir David Walker,
chairman of the UK's Securities and Investments Board, warned yesterday.
In a speech in London, Sir David also welcomed news that the Group of 30,
the US-based 'think tank', was to review the risks to financial markets
posed by the growing use of derivatives.
'Often participants are committing themselves to contracts which stretch out
way into the future in a market which is untested, extremely volatile and
highly illiquid,' Sir David said. Substantial credit risk and falling profit
margins also gave cause for concern. 'This is a market for management to
watch with particular care,' he said.
His comments add to the growing weight of public concern expressed by
financial regulators in recent weeks about trading in derivatives markets.
Speaking in a personal capacity to the annual conference of the
International Swap Dealers Association last week, Mr Richard Farrant, deputy
head of banking supervision at the Bank of England, warned that complex new
financial products 'stretch the ability of general management to understand
and control them.'
Earlier this month, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, the central bankers' club, warned of growing
financial instability due to the contingent claims that have built up
through banks' off-balance sheet activities. 'We simply do not know the size
of the indirect risks for the individual institution generated by this
interdependence,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Measures to revive banks in
Finland introduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S central bank announced plans to revive the country's ailing
banking sector and avert a credit crunch yesterday, saying it would raise
interest rates, set up a FM20bn government deposit guarantee fund, and scrap
stamp duty on share transactions.
Finnish banks have been plagued by heavy credit losses in the past year as
the economy plunged into recession and the number of bankruptcies soared.
The Bank of Finland said its proposed measures would strengthen banks'
capital structure and to improve interest margins, helping to avoid a credit
crunch.
The Bank of Finland will raise the base rate from 8.5 per cent to 9.5 per
cent with effect from the beginning of May, a measure intended to improve
the banks' interest margins. A substantial proportion of the banks' lending
 - particularly to households  - is tied to the base rate, which has been
held at 8.5 per cent since 1989.
The banks fund their lending in the money market, where they have had to pay
considerably higher interest rates  - of close to 15 per cent  - in recent
months.
The parliamentary supervisory board of the Bank of Finland yesterday said it
had decided to raise the interest rates on the banks' low-interest loans  -
which are tied to the base rate  - by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 12
per cent.
The central bank proposed that the central government provide capital to
support the banks, should their capital adequacy ratios  - which are
currently above the 8 per cent requirement  - fall significantly.
Following the rescue last year of Skopbank, the central bank for the Finnish
savings banks, the Bank of Finland has proposed a new government deposit
guarantee fund which would grant support loans and guarantees to the banking
sector. The fund would provide back-up for the deposit guarantee funds
already in existence for the savings, co-operative and commercial banks.
The abolition of stamp duty on shares is intended to help boost liquidity on
the stock exchange and make it easier for the banks to trade their equity
holdings.
While bankers have been pressing for many of the changes in recent months,
one analyst responded gloomily to the package of reforms, saying 'the
message is that the situation here is really bad . . . if the Bank of
Finland thought there was going to be a recovery these measures wouldn't be
necessary.'

THE Chicago Board of Trade will begin trading options on its two-year
Treasury note futures on April 24. Options trading on the CBOT's interest
rate futures has mushroomed in recent months, making the likelihood of
success for the new product considerably greater.
While the CBOT, the world's largest futures market, is home to the 30-year
Treasury bond contract, the most widely-traded in the world, investors are
finding shorter-term futures and futures options increasingly attractive.
Trading in options on the CBOT's five-year Treasury note futures, for
example, nearly tripled for January to February 1992 compared with the same
period last year.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: UK bond prices retreat on opinion poll
rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices fell back yesterday with the publication of
opinion polls showing the opposition Labour party five percentage points
ahead of the Conservatives.
Long-dated gilts dropped nearly half a percentage point as rumours
circulated that a BBC Newsnight poll would show the Labour party as much as
eight points ahead of the ruling Conservatives. In the event, the poll put
Labour four points ahead.
Traders said the release of better-than-expected retail sales figures
yesterday did little to comfort the gilt market. Retail sales rose by 0.4
per cent in February, or 1.5 per cent year-on-year. The benchmark 11 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 113 7/32 to 112 23/32 by late afternoon to
yield 9.81 per cent.
US TREASURY prices drifted lower yesterday in fairly subdued trading.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down  3/16 at 99
23/32 , yielding 8.05 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities were also modestly
lower.
There was some selling following the midday release of the Federal Reserve's
Tan book on business conditions in the Fed's 12 districts.
Inflationary pressures were downplayed in the report. The Fed said: 'Wage
and price pressures appear generally quite moderate.'
With no US economic data scheduled for imminent release, the market is
expected to turn its attention to next week's two and five-year note
auctions. The Treasury has increased the size of the two-year note by
Dollars 500m, to Dollars 14.75bn, and similarly increased the five-year
auction to Dollars 10.25bn.
THE GERMAN government bond market fell on news of a higher-than-expected
wage settlement for some of the engineering workers, and speculation that
the Bundesbank may raise interest rates at today's Council meeting.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.26 and fell to a low of 87.91
on a volume of 47,000 contracts.
News that about 7,000 workers within the IG Metall union had agreed a 7.2
per cent pay rise pushed bund prices down. Traders expressed fears that the
agreement could herald further high wage settlements and therefore delay an
easing in interest rates.
In addition, dealers said the market was unsettled by an announcement that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is due to attend the Bundesbank Council meeting
today, with some market participants worried that this could signal an
interest rate rise.
Elsewhere in the European bond markets, French government debt fell back on
worries about the outcome of Sunday's regional elections in France.
Foreign investors are concerned that the expected heavy defeat for the
ruling Socialists could encourage them to raise state spending ahead of the
1993 general election.
JAPANESE government bonds opened on a strong note, helped by the US Treasury
bond market's strength overnight and hopes of a cut in interest rates, but
drifted back during the day to close slightly lower.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue moved from its opening level of
5.355 per cent to close at 5.385 per cent in Tokyo. However, the
strengthening of the yen against the US dollar to 132.25 in London trading
helped to lift JGB prices slightly and the yield on the No 129 moved to 5.37
per cent.
The June futures contract fell from its opening of 102.73 to close at 102.66
in Tokyo. Traders continue to speculate that the Bank of Japan will cut the
Official Discount Rate in the next few days.
However, short-term interest rates edged up yesterday, with three-month
certificates of deposit trading at 4.93 per cent.

THE average debt to equity ratios of listed South Korean companies rose by
23.1 percentage points to 241.7 per cent in 1991 due to tight liquidity,
according to a survey conducted by the Daewoo Research Institute (DRI),
Reuter reports from Seoul.
The survey covered about 400 of the 528 listed companies with fiscal years
ending on December 31.
DRI said Hanyang topped the list, recording a debt to equity ratio of
3,294.5 per cent. Aggregate turnover of the 400 companies in 1991 increased
to Won131,260bn (Dollars 171.35bn) from Won108,950bn a year earlier.
Daewoo Corporation, the trading arm of the Daewoo group, had recorded the
largest sales of Won6,400bn in 1991 from Won5,250bn in 1990, the survey
showed.
Samsung, which led the turnover charts in 1990, was not included in the
survey as it has yet to hold a shareholders meeting. Samsung recorded a
turnover of Won7,950bn in 1990 from Won7,610bn a year earlier.

MR DONALD TRUMP, the heavily-indebted New York property developer, is aiming
to exchange a 49 per cent equity interest in Manhattan's Plaza Hotel for
more favourable terms from bankers who have loans outstanding on landmark
property.
Mr Richard Wilhelm, president of the Plaza, confirmed the tentative deal
yesterday. The debt-for-equity swap is understood to involve forgiving
almost half the Dollars 600m debt outstanding on the Plaza, and setting a
fixed rate on the remaining loan financing.
Mr Wilhelm added that 'at this time, there no intention to do anything about
the condominium plan' at the Plaza. Last year, stories that Mr Trump was
considering converting much of the Plaza into condominiums, which would then
be sold to individual buyers, gained wide publicity.
However, the current climate in the US, and difficulties in the real estate
market in particular, would present problems for such a scheme at this time.
The Plaza deal is the latest in the long series of restructurings involving
different parts of Mr Trump's casinos and property empire.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: A slice of faith in the Chinese
bureaucracy - The first state enterprise in which Beijing has allowed
foreigners to own shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past decade, China has had its door open to foreign investors. Last
month, that door opened a little wider when, for the first time since the
communists took power in 1949, the authorities allowed foreigners to own and
trade shares in a Chinese company.
That company, Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company, makes television
tubes for the domestic television industry.
Shanghai Vacuum is not a company in the way a westerner might use or
understand the term. Its origins date back to 1917, but the company today is
the result of a six-way merger in 1987, which brought together much of
Shanghai's TV tube-making capacity.
The closest analogy might be with British Coal in the heyday of
nationalisation, but that, too, fails to capture the company/state
relationship that still exists in China today.
Although foreign investors have bought a slice of a 'company' called
Shanghai Vacuum, what they have really acquired is a slice of faith in
China's bureaucrats.
The management of TV production in Shanghai is split between those who
operate the company's factories and the Shanghai Instrumentation and
Electronic Industry Bureau. It is responsible for determining production
capacities, output and marketing strategies of the companies it supervises,
one of which is Shanghai Vacuum.
Administratively, the bureau is a division of the Shanghai Economic
Commission, which in turn reports to the city's municipal government. The
bureau also has a direct report ing relationship with the Ministry of
Electronics Industry in Beijing on technical matters and receives market
information from the ministry.
China is the country which invented and refined bureaucratic government. It
should come as no surprise, therefore, that a by-product of this today is
intense competition between bureaucrats. Selling TVs in China is a curious
mixture of co-operation and competition between regional governments, which
Beijing presides over with either apparent detachment or just plain
impotence.
Mr Rolf Gerber, managing director of SBCI Finance Asia, who wrote the
company's prospectus, found out about the bureau's existence through a
conversation with executives of Shanghai Vacuum. At a five- hour dinner at
the end of last year he met the bureau's director who told him how the
system worked.
The bureau consists of 10 industry sectors and supervises 176 state
enterprises and eight research institutes. It competes with other regional
bureaux in China and the companies under their supervision in terms of
products, turnover, market share and quality.
The Shanghai bureau ranks first in China in terms of sales and production.
Last year, its companies turned over Yn7bn (Dollars 1.27bn) and produced
output with a value of Yn8.5bn.
The bureau keeps in close touch with the products its companies make. It has
an in-house research capacity, meets regularly with whole-salers and
retailers, and has access to its companies' market research departments.
The bureau not only knows a great deal about the TV market but it also knows
how to sell TVs, which it does throughout China. Its sales force is
supported by a computer-linked system with wholesalers and significant
retailers. It also operates a nation-wide service network.
While the bureau practices free trade in China it is decidedly mercantilist
in Shanghai. It claims 100 per cent of the Shanghai market for itself by
virtue of a municipal regulation which requires all TVs in Shanghai to
contain Shanghai Vacuum's tubes and be built by Shanghai-based assemblers.
This makes Shanghai Vacuum the closest thing to a one-way bet on just about
any stock exchange in the world. It has guaranteed customers for its output
at prices over which it has a fair degree of control.
But what does Shanghai Vacuum look like to a western accountant? Arthur
Andersen, the US firm of accountants, had to wade through acres of Chinese
financial statements and attempt to reconcile their data with accepted
western accounting standards.
For example, mainland Chinese companies do not consolidate their accounts;
they do not make provisions for bad or doubtful debts; they do not account
for exchange rate fluctuations; and use depreciation schedules ranging from
30 to 50 years for plant and machinery.
The accountants were unable to provide a source and application of funds
statement because, as the Shanghai government accountant said: 'Normal
banking practices in China are that many of the company's borrowings do not
have fixed maturities or repayment schedules.'
Mainland companies' business practices would send most western companies
into receivership. Shanghai Vacuum's standard terms of sale provide for
payment within three to nine months after delivery. Even then, retailer are
loathe to pay their bills.
At the end of September, the company's accounts receivable stood at Yn137m.
As the prospectus observes: 'This has been caused by state-owned retailers,
which are under the direct control of the Bureau of Commerce, are delaying
payment to the TV set manufacturers, using the cash-flow to expand their own
businesses.'
By taking foreign capital Shanghai Vacuum is able to redefine itself as a
'joint venture' company for Chinese tax purposes. It is also relocating its
corporate headquarters to the Pudong district of the city which has been
designated for special treatment.
The upshot of these developments is that the company's tax rate will fall
from 55 per cent to 15 per cent.
The change in status will also allow the company to pay its employees more
and change the basis upon which it employs them from the current
cradle-to-grave terms and conditions to fixed-term contracts. Theoretically,
the move should allow it to shed surplus labour and improve productivity.
There is a need for rationalisation. With a workforce of more than 15,000,
Shanghai Vacuum made an estimated loss of Yn89m last year. But the jewel in
its crown, a joint venture company known as Novel, which produces colour
television tubes, made an estimated profit of Yn168.8m with a workforce of
1,900.
The new joint venture status just might give the managers of Shanghai
Vacuum's factories the justification they need to make the hard, and so far
avoided, decision about shedding labour.
It can now fairly claim that its ability to raise capital from in the future
will depend not on its novelty of being the first Chinese company in the
international equity market, but on its results.

<TEXT>
HEWLETT-PACKARD has signed an extensive technology-sharing pact with Convex
Computer, a leading manufacturer of mini super-computers. To cement the new
relationship, Hewlett-Packard will take a 5 per cent equity stake in Convex
for Dollars 18m.
Convex will also adopt Hewlett-Packard's Reduced Instruction Set Computing
(RISC) microprocessor technology for use in a new range of massively
parallel processing super-computers. Convex will purchase the microprocessor
chips from HP.
HP and Convex will also exchange software technologies, including HP's RISC
compiler technology and Convex's supercomputer compiler technology.
Massively parallel supercomputers combine the power of hundreds, or even
thousands, of microprocessors to reach very high processing speed.
HP and Convex also plan to reach an agreement to offer each others products
for sale on a bilateral original equipment manufacturer basis.
The agreement represents a win for HP, which is competing with Sun
Microsystems, Digital Equipment, International Business Machines and others
to establish its RISC technology as a broadly-used industry standard.
Hewlett-Packard is the third largest US computer manufacturer with 1991
revenues of Dollars 14.5bn. The company was an early leader in RISC, which
is emerging as a key technology in all types of computers.
Convex is a 10-year-old company, based in Dallas. Microsoft said yesterday
it would launch a new version of its widely-used Windows personal computer
program next month and expects to sell 1m copies within 30 days.
The announcement appears designed to pre-empt International Business
Machines' expected introduction, later this month, of a competing operating
system for personal computers.
The former partners are gearing up for a marketing battle. Microsoft will
for the first time use television advertising to promote Windows. IBM is
also planning a publicity blitz.
Price competition is also expected to be fierce, with Microsoft offering a
Windows upgrade package to current users for Dollars 50. At issue is control
over the direction of personal computer software.
Windows provides personal computer users with a graphical interface, similar
to the Apple Macintosh.

HENDERSON Land Develop-ment, one of Hong Kong's leading residential property
developers, announced a 12.4 per cent drop in net profit for the six months
to December to HKDollars 1.38bn (Dollars 178.3m), compared with HKDollars
1.58bn in the year-earlier period.
The decline came from a reduction in the number of developments completed in
the first half of the year. However, the company forecast a 'satisfactory'
increase in profit for the full year.
Henderson completed five developments in the first half of its financial
year, but it has already commenced pre-sales of a further 15 projects.
Turnover declined by 23 per cent to HKDollars 2.5bn at the interim stage,
due to the reduction in property sales, but there was an increase in
investment income, particularly from its portfolio of shopping centres.
Its two associate utility companies  - Hong Kong and China Gas and Hong Kong
Ferry  - also reported strong profit growth.
The company said that 'with local interest rates presently staying at a
level below inflation rate, the public is generally keen to acquire
residential properties as a hedge against inflation and the property market
is likely to remain active.'
The company recommended an interim dividend of 19 cents, compared with 16
cents in 1990.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: NBD in Dollars 876m banking
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<TEXT>
NBD Bancorp, the Detroit-based banking group with 457 branches in the
midwest, has agreed to acquire the Indianapolis-based INB Financial
Corporation, an Indiana bank, in a stock deal worth Dollars 876m.
The acquisition is the latest example of how the shake-out in US banking is
leading to a series of mergers and takeovers throughout the industry.
The deal also underscores the way some US banks are managing to extend their
branch networks across state boundaries, even though the legislative reform
that would pave the way for more of these transactions remains stymied in
Congress.
The prime example of this trend is the string of recent acquisitions by the
Ohio-based Banc One, a successful regional banking group.
NBD, the parent of 20 Chicago area banks with assets of Dollars 5bn, is
already the 24th ranked US bank, with total assets of Dollars 31bn.
INB Financial is a bank with Dollars 6.6bn of assets that operates 124
offices through six banks in key Indiana markets, including dominant market
positions in the central and southern parts of the state.
NBD has another Indiana bank deal pending, this one with Summcorp, a banking
group with Dollars 2.5bn of assets. NBD said yesterday its total assets
following both the INB and Summcorp transactions would be Dollars 40bn.
The INB takeover calls for NBD to exchange 1.6 shares of its common stock
for each INB share.
Wall Street reacted to the midwestern merger by marking NBD shares Dollars
7/8 lower, to Dollars 28 7/8 . INB's shares leapt by Dollars 7 to Dollars
43.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Lawson Mardon to axe 600 in
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWSON MARDON, the international packaging group, is cutting 600 from its
total payroll of 7,600 over the next 18 months and has taken a CDollars 31m
(USDollars 26.2m) special restructuring charge.
Mr Lawrence Tapp, president, said Lawson's organisational structure has been
outdated by the global recession and intense international competition .
Including the special charge, Lawson posted a 1991 loss of CDollars 10.8m,
or 38 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 25.5m, or 89 cents, in
1990. Revenues were CDollars 1.2bn against CDollars 1.1bn.
The company, 52 per cent held by Cragnotti Financial of Ireland, will
consolidate five divisions into three main operating units  - two in Europe
and one in North America.
The company is a leader in European flexible packaging, especially for food
products.
The European units will be known as LMG Packaging and LMG Folding Cartons
and the North American unit LMG Packaging and Labels. The job losses will be
spread right through the company's operations as support staff are merged.
Lawson expects to trim annual operating costs by about CDollars 4m.
Commercial printing and finishing operations in Toronto and New Jersey are
being sold. A Toronto packaging plant has been moved to New York state.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: US court blocks Parretti over
MGM control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French state bank that has been awarded management
control of MGM, the financially-troubled Hollywood studio, said yesterday it
had won a court injunction preventing Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian
financier, from attempting any legal action to win back control of MGM in
any forum other than Delaware.
A spokesman for the French bank said the Delaware Chancery court had issued
a restraining order that would also prevent Mr Parretti from attempting any
action on behalf of MGM. The court order also confirms that the present
directors of MGM, named by Credit Lyonnais, have full authority.
The Delaware court order was sought by Credit Lyonnais, which last year
disclosed it had loaned Mr Parretti Dollars 1bn to buy MGM, after Mr
Parretti claimed last week that a Rome court had sequestered MGM shares.
Credit Lyonnais claimed yesterday that the Delaware court order effectively
blocked Mr Parretti's effort 'to interfere in the management of MGM' and
would force him to bring any further challenge to Delaware, where MGM is
incorporated.

cents a year earlier, in spite of an 18 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars

Earnings per share have been adjusted for a three-for-two stock split.
The company, hurt by rising costs and falling hospital admissions, said its
operating income for hospitals fell 5 per cent to Dollars 149m in the

<TEXT>
GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the large supermarket group, has
revealed profits more than halved to Dollars 70.6m in the year to February
23.
The after-tax figure compares with Dollars 151m in the previous 12 months,
and is scored on sales marginally higher at Dollars 11.6bn, up from Dollars
11.4bn.
The company, which still holds a stake in the British Isosceles retail
group, saw margins come under acute pressure during 1991 and, against this
background, the final three months of the year actually represent a slight
improvement.
After-tax profits in the fourth quarter totalled Dollars 16.1m, on sales of
Dollars 2.74bn. In the third quarter, the figures were Dollars 3.92m and
Dollars 2.6bn respectively.
A&amp;P's chairman, Mr Jim Wood, acknowledged that 'competitive activity is
still very strong', but said the company had at least been able to reverse
the downward trend of year-to-year earnings comparisons which began in the
fourth quarter of 1990. 'The pressure on margins was less than it was in the
third quarter,' he commented.
Shares in A&amp;P, the fourth largest supermarket operator in the US and 53 per
cent-owned by Germany's Tengelmann group, have suffered badly over recent
months, but yesterday they managed a modest revival, up Dollars 3 1/4 to
Dollars 33 by the close in New York.
Mr Wood said the company's aim in the current 12 months would be to maintain
market share and keep costs down, with over Dollars 1bn scheduled to be
invested in new stores, remodellings and expansions over the next three
years.
The company operates 1,238 stores under a variety of names  - ranging from
Waldbaum's to Farmer Jack's  - and plans to open 30 new stores this year.

<TEXT>
THE LONG North American recession and lower newspaper advertising revenues
dampened Thomson Corporation's performance in 1991.
The information-publishing group, which includes UK regional newspapers and
specialised publishing in North America, recorded lower margins but Thomson
Travel Group unit had an 'outstanding year'.
Overall, Thomson reported 1991 earnings of USDollars 292m, or 53 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 385m, or 70 cents, a year earlier. But before
Dollars 67m amortisation of publishing rights applied in 1991 for the first
time, per-share profit was 65 cents, against 70 cents.
Operating profit was Dollars 692m, down 4.7 per cent from 1990. Profits from
aircraft sales were Dollars 5m, against Dollars 45m last time.
Thomson Newspapers sales dipped 1.4 per cent to Dollars 1.14bn. Improved
circulation revenues, however, did not offset advertising losses, and
operating profits dipped 19 per cent to Dollars 228m. The Ontario newspapers
were worst hit.
Information-publishing sales rose 3.2 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn, while
operating profit dipped 2.4 per cent to Dollars 363m. UK professional and
business publications and UK newspapers were slightly lower, but the
US-based book and reference group improved profit.
The financial services companies gained in sales, but margins remained under
pressure.
Fourth-quarter sales for Thomson overall were little changed at Dollars
1.35bn. Earnings, after amortisation of publishing rights, were Dollars 83m,
or 15 cents a share, also little changed from 1990.

THOMSON Travel Group, Thomson's UK-based travel subsidiary, saw full-year
pre-tax profits rise 38 per cent to Pounds 70.2m (Dollars 123.6m), writes
Michael Skapinker, Leisure Industries Correspondent.
Although the UK travel industry was hit by the Gulf war, Thomson, Britain's
biggest holiday company, benefited from the collapse last year of the
International Leisure Group (ILG), its largest competitor.
Thomson  - whose interests include package tours, Britannia Airways and Lunn
Poly, the UK's biggest chain of travel agents  - announced sales revenue up
10 per cent to Pounds 1.16bn.
Operating profit and interest rose 61 per cent to Pounds 68.8m while profits
from aircraft disposals fell to Pounds 2.9m from Pounds 25m in 1990.
Profits from tour operations more than trebled to Pounds 37.5m. Although the
figure of 3m holidays sold was the same as in 1990. a reduction in price
discounting led to an increase in gross margins.
Profits from Britannia Airways rose 8 per cent to Pounds 28.9m before
aircraft disposals.
Lunn Poly's profits fell 16.7 per cent to Pounds 6m after a Pounds 2.3m
provision to cover losses following the collapse of ILG. Lunn Poly expects
to cover this amount this year from the bond put up as security by ILG.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York to retire
CDollars 400m of CP debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property group that is controlled by the
Reichmann family, last night said it plans to retire all of its remaining
CDollars 400m (USDollars 338.9m) of outstanding commercial paper programmes.
The O&amp;Y statement came just hours after Dominion Bond Rating Service of
Montreal said it was placing the commercial paper ratings of O&amp;Y on rating
alert with negative implications due to 'unprecedented lack of investor
confidence'.
Dominion said this was making it increasingly difficult to roll over
commercial paper on a continuing basis. Less than a fortnight ago, Dominion
acted to reaffirm its ratings on O&amp;Y's publicly-traded securities.
O&amp;Y said last night that over the past several weeks it had already reduced
from CDollars 800m to less than CDollars 400m the amount of commercial paper
held by investors in two programmes  - the O&amp;Y Commercial Paper II
Incorporated programme and another commercial paper programme that is
secured by O&amp;Y Exchange Tower in Toronto.
'O&amp;Y is actively working on several plans to eliminate these two commercial
paper programmes completely.'
The Canadian company did not say how it intends to finance the retiring of
the remaining commercial paper. O&amp;Y's possible fund-raising methods include
asset sales or the seeking of additional bank lines of credit.
As part of its efforts to raise cash, O&amp;Y is believed to be considering the
sale of its controlling interest in Home Oil, a Calgary-based oil and gas
producer. The company may also be seeking buyers for its stakes in
Abitibi-Price, the world's largest newsprint maker, and Gulf Canada
Resources, an energy company.
The Reichmann family has consistently refused to disclose details of the
unquoted parent's financial condition and analysts are uncertain about O&amp;Y's
actual level of debt.
In an unusual comment, Dominion Bond Rating Service said yesterday 'there is
basically nothing fundamentally wrong on a long-term basis with Olympia &amp;
York or these two commercial paper programmes, but a combination of
continuing rumours and negative press is making it increasingly difficult
for the company to roll over commercial paper'.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mobil plans to cut capital
spending programme by Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday announced plans to cut its 1992
capital expenditure appropriations by Dollars 1bn because of the company's
concern about the business environment in the energy sector.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, said the 1992 capital appropriations
budget would be Dollars 4.8bn, instead of the Dollars 5.8bn anticipated. The
cut includes Dollars 800m that would be deferred 'unless business conditions
improve'.
The Mobil chief noted that 'these are difficult times for the oil industry,
with the slow pace of economic growth in much of the world having a
substantial impact on all segment of our business'.
Mr Murray said the company's US business, especially natural gas prices, had
been weak. With the recent volatility in crude oil prices, this made it
prudent to defer some investments for the time being.
He noted, however, that the lag between a reduction in capital
appropriations and actual spending generally takes several years. This meant
that 1992 capital spending would be about the same as last year's, while the
impact of deferred investments would be seen mainly beyond 1992.
Mobil, which last year reported unchanged net earnings of Dollars 1.9bn on
revenues of Dollars 62.7bn, also said its restructuring plan was continuing
and would include further reductions in overhead costs.
Mr Murray said the company would record a Dollars 75m charge for
restructuring costs in the first quarter of 1992.
He added that discussions were under way for the sale of petrochemicals
properties, including the polystyrene business in the US and the fuels
business in Norway.
He said the company would also continue to sell off producing properties in
the US that were 'marginally attractive and have little upside potential.'
Last year, Mobil sold about Dollars 600m of assets and acquired Exxon'
downstream assets in Australia. Between 1986 and 1990, Mobil sold nearly
Dollars 7bn of assets, Mr Murray said.
On Wall Street, Mobil's share price was marked Dollars  1/8 lower yesterday,
to Dollars 60 1/4 .

<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, the international drinks group, has notched up record sales and
operating profits and plans a four-for-one share split and dividend
increase.
The quarterly dividend initially will be 14 US cents per share on the new
split stock, up 12 per cent from the present level. On an annual basis
Seagram will pay 56 cents a share, against the equivalent of 50 cents now.
'Economic conditions in many markets could be improved but we make decisions
for the long term,' said Mr Edgar Bronfman, chairman and chief executive.
'We have enormous confidence in our brands and we will continue to invest
and expand our business.'
Sales for the year ended January 31 rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 6.35bn and
operating income before special items was up 7.3 per cent to Dollars 760m.
After gains on asset disposals, operating income was Dollars 961m against
Dollars 708m a year earlier.
Including dividends from its 25 per cent interest in Dupont of the US, and
including its share of Dupont's unremitted earnings, Seagram's final net
profit was Dollars 727m, or Dollars 7.67 a share, down nearly 4 per cent
from Dollars 756m, or Dollars 8.03, due to lower unremitted earnings from
Dupont, which was severely hit by the recession in 1991.
Seagram's spirits and wines group posted a 9.5 per cent gain in operating
income, with higher margins and lower overheads. A strong performance in
Asia and Latin America was offset by a fall in the US and the effects of a
higher US dollar.
Fourth-quarter final net profit was Dollars 197m, or Dollars 2.07 a share,
against Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.87, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars
2.06bn against Dollars 1.93bn.

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas seeks speedy
stake deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group, is anxious to
conclude an agreement to sell up to 49 per cent of its Douglas commercial
aircraft subsidiary to Taiwan Aerospace and other potential equity investors
by the end of this year. It wants to be able to to launch a new Dollars
4bn-to-Dollars 5bn jumbo aircraft programme.
Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas subsidiary, said it was important
for the company to secure a launch decision for its 400 to 600-seater MD-12
aircraft programme this year to ensure first deliveries in 1997.
The longer-term future of Douglas as a commercial aircraft manufacturer
largely depends on its ability to secure financial backing from new
investors to expand its product range.
Although the company had originally envisaged building a larger three-engine
derivative of its MD-11 tri-jet, Mr Hood confirmed Douglas was studying the
development of a four-engine or possibly a twin-engine jumbo. The initial
model would probably involve a 400-seater aircraft to compete against the
Boeing 747-400 jumbo.
The MD-12 programme is part of Douglas's strategy to develop a broader
family of aircraft to compete against the wider product ranges of its two
rivals, the US Boeing company and the European Airbus consortium. Douglas
manufactures products in only two of the main aircraft markets, whereas
Boeing and Airbus offer products in five different markets.
However, this strategy hinges on finding partners to invest in the Douglas
commercial aircraft subsidiary and to participate in its MD-12 and other
programmes.
China Steel, the Taiwanese state-run company which could acquire a big stake
in Taiwan Aerospace, is heading a Taiwan team studying the Douglas equity
investment deal. The findings of this team will determine Taiwan's
involvement in Douglas.

THE Swedish government yesterday announced that the steel company SSAB would
be the first of 35 state companies to be sold into the private sector.
The state owns 60 per cent of the voting rights and 48 per cent of the
equity in SSAB, which has been listed on the Stockholm bourse since 1986.
The publicly-held shares are largely owned by domestic institutional
investors.
The state sale will be conducted through the issue of convertible debentures
with an option to redeem them for SSAB shares by the beginning of 1994. A
price has not yet been set for the issue, but the government hopes to raise
between SKr1.5bn (Dollars 248m) and SKr2bn through the sale, which will be
handled by Handelsbanken Fondkommission.
A prospectus will be issued in May.
About half the debentures are expected to be reserved for Swedish and
foreign institutional investors to guarantee that SSAB will have a stable
ownership structure. The rest will be offered to SSAB employees and the
general public.
Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said SSAB was too small to be
offered through a share issue to the general public.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Coming clean on spreading waste problem -
The thinking behind Caird's pioneering environmental audit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT MONTH, Waste Management Inc of Chicago, the world's largest refuse
collection and treatment group, is to float off part of its international
operation on the London market.
It is a move eagerly anticipated by UK waste management companies which have
had to weather a bruising recession that last year checked the sector's
rapid advance.
If the US' largest waste company with 20 years' experience, is raising about
Pounds 250m to invest in Europe, the argument goes, then the market must
again be ripe for growth.
At the other end of the scale, a handful of smaller UK groups is preparing
for this growth which is likely to spring from a much tighter regulatory
environment.
The first task of these companies is to clean up the image of an industry
that has long been fragmented and poorly regulated in Europe, especially in
the UK.
One of the stiffest self-imposed tasks has been set by Caird, the waste
management group built at breakneck speed since 1987 by ex-stockbroker, Mr
Peter Linacre.
It has adopted a novel approach to the environmental problems it inherited
on some of its 30 sites. It has opened the gates of its landfill sites in
the UK to independent environmental auditors and allows public scrutiny of
the auditors' unedited reports.
'The environmental audit underwrites our strategy, the way we look forward
and the way we view our potential liabilities on our sites,' says Mr John
Phillips, Caird's senior operations director.
The auditors, Gibbs International, not only monitor gas emissions and
leaching, but also inspect Caird's management systems and its methods of
mapping where the most hazardous waste, like asbestos, is buried.
Now in their third year, the audits have already highlighted some incidents
and practices that Caird might have wanted to gloss over but instead has
made no effort to suppress.
Last June, for example, two hazardous liquids were accidentally mixed at
Caird's Minworth special waste disposal site, creating a gas that exploded,
killing one worker.
Caird was in the process of securing Health &amp; Safety Executive approval for
modified operating practices when what Mr Linacre called 'the tragic rogue
incident' occurred. The accident will be reported in this year's audit.
Last year the audit also highlighted a problem with open trench disposal of
waste liquids at the Rotherham landfill site. Mr Geoff Mills, the Gibbs
auditor, felt this was potentially dangerous, even though it complied with
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution guidelines. Caird now mixes the
liquids with solid waste.
Caird is not the only waste management company to audit its impact on the
environment but it is the only UK company to publish an unedited report.
Cleanaway and Shanks &amp; McEwan, for example, use internal environmental
advisory boards. The Shanks board includes such luminaries as Lord
Cranbrook, chairman of English Nature, and Mr Graham Searle, the founder of
Friends of the Earth who is also a Rechem non-executive director.
Shanks is also the most advanced of the UK waste companies in accrediting
its sites under British Standards Institution 5750, the 'kitemark' which
demonstrates good management practice. Leigh Interests is also developing
this approach, as is Caird, which has so far accredited three of its 15
working sites.
Caird's Minworth plant, however, was not BSI 5750 accredited at the time of
last year's accident, an event which in turn delayed application for a BSI
audit, Mr Linacre says.
By contrast, Biffa  - acquired by Severn Trent last year  - has neither an
external audit nor an environmental advisory board. It says internal teams
constantly monitor the organisation but that Biffa is too big to allow an
external audit.
Within the last month, however, it has appointed a manager to seek BSI 5750
accreditation for its sites.
With the Environmental Protection Act taking a grip and EC legislation
slowly catching up with what has long been in place in the US, the new
skills waste management companies are developing are likely to be assets in
their own right.
Companies will increasingly need to clean up contaminated land and local
authorities are likewise going to need help clearing old rubbish sites.
In spite of the government's recent decision not to form a register of
contaminated land following pressure from the property lobby, waste
companies feel it is only a matter of time before such a register is set up,
creating further demand for waste management companies.
For Caird, this contracting-out of services is likely to have begun to feed
through to the bottom line when it reports for 1991 today.
Pre-tax profits, estimated by brokers to rise 40 per cent to about Pounds
7m, are likely to include a sharp increase from the special waste division.

September 30.
At the same time the company announced that Mr David Maddison, finance
director, had 'resigned from the board and left the company with immediate
effect'. Furthermore it warned that it would incur a loss for the year to
March 31 1992.
Hadleigh said that it had become aware that interim losses of Pounds
283,000, announced in January, were understated and felt that they should be
restated to take account of further losses of Pounds 252,000.
The new figures reduce the January-announced Pounds 227,000 operating
profits to Pounds 49,000, giving pre-tax losses of Pounds 535,000, against
Pounds 283,000 reported earlier. Losses per share rose to 4.9p, against
2.5p.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Steel Burrill Jones
advance 11.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL BURRILL Jones, the insurance broker, yesterday reported an 11.7 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.44m to Pounds 10.55m for the
year ending December 31 1991, writes Richard Lapper.
However, part of the growth reflected the impact of acquisitions made during
1990 and 1991. Earnings per share increased by just 4 per cent to 19.94p
(19.17p).
The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 13.25p (12.25p) with a
recommended final of 9p (8.25p), but the market reacted unenthusiastically
with the shares unchanged at 237p.
Turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 41m (Pounds 33.5m) while expenses
increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 31m). Investment and other
income amounted to Pounds 6.83m (Pounds 6.44m).
The figures included full-year results for WS Moody, the UK retail broker
acquired in 1990, as well as full-year con-tributions from Martin Perry
Associates and SBJ Spec-iality in which controlling interests were acquired
during 1991.
Mr Tony Keys, finance director, said income was up 10 per cent, while
expenses rose by 5 per cent in underlying currency terms and after adjusting
the figures to take account of the increased contribution from Moody.
Reduced capacity in the marine reinsurance market, as well as a weaker
dollar and significantly lower interest rates had made for much tougher
trading conditions and the group had focused its attention on efforts to
reduce operating expenses.
Mr Keys expected those factors to constrain profitability in 1992 and
accepted that the current problems of the Lloyd's insurance market  - into
which SBJ places between 20 and 30 per cent of its business  - cast a shadow
over prospects.

<TEXT>
SHARES OF Mosaic Invest-ments, the engineer and character merchandiser, fell
sharply from 206p to 120p yesterday following a warning about current year
profits, writes John Murrell.
The directors said that 1991-1992 profits were likey to be materially
affected by a significant downturn in the marketing services division.
A trading statement from the directors said the results of the division in
January and February had fallen materially below expectations. As a
consequence, they expected full year operating profits from marketing
services to be 'significantly less' than the Pounds 3.07m reported for
1990-91.
Over the first six months of the current year the division's operating
profits fell from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 839,000. Last full year profit was
Pounds 7.56m

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European Leisure Pounds 45.8m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCO AND snooker hall owner European Leisure, under investigation by the
Serious Fraud Office concerning its acquisition of Midsummer Leisure in
1990, yesterday announced losses after exceptional items of Pounds 45.8m and
said it planned to sell up to 30 units to reduce bank borrowings.
The exceptional charges included provisions of Pounds 34.6m for losses
expected on disposals and a Pounds 12.3m transfer of goodwill from reserves,
in line with new accounting standards.
Mr Ian Rock, who took over as group managing director following the
resignation of Mr Michael Ward last July, said the company aimed to raise
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m from disposals over the next 12 months.
This would be used to reduce bank borrowings of Pounds 76m, equal to gearing
of 217 per cent.
European Leisure ran into trouble following the takeover of Midsummer. The
recession has hit leisure companies hard and combined with high interest
costs almost brought the company to collapse.
Mr Rock said that Barclays, the company's banker, remained 'fully
supportive' and has agreed in principle to provide additional borrowing
facilities through to April 1993.
Trading profits almost halved to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 8.77m) in the six
months to end-December as discos and venue bars were hit by recession.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 3.76m (Pounds 4.35m). Snooker operations were
more resilient and an amusement machine manufacturing division increased
profits sharply to Pounds 1.75m, following the success of its Screenplay
machine.
The retained loss totalled Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 1.76 profit).
COMMENT
The market was not expecting exceptional charges of this magnitude. The hope
must be that after making them public now, there are no more to come. The
planned sell-off covers loss-making and non-core units and, given that
European Leisure is effectively a forced seller, drastic provisions for
losses seem sensible. The question is whether the company can find any
buyers in time. Even if it does, it will be left with debt of more than
Pounds 64m, and the first half performance would have been even more ghastly
without a possible one-off from amusement machines. European Leisure has a
very long way to go before it is safe. Even without the SFO cloud, the
shares cannot be worth the risk.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance ahead 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIC ASSURANCE, the life assurance group, increased total net profits
for 1991 by 37 per cent to Pounds 24.7m.
The figures included an exceptional transfer from its industrial life fund
of Pounds 4.9m. Life business profits excluding this transfer increased 21
per cent to Pounds 19.5m.
The transfer, which was made to bring Britannic's bonus payments for
industrial branch contracts in line with the bonus structure for its
ordinary savings contracts, increased the funds available to shareholders.
Britannic therefore paid a final dividend of 20.3p (17.3p) bringing the
total to 29.5p (25.3p).
This was slightly ahead of some expectations, and the shares rose against
the market trend from 847p to 852p.
However, analysts said that the exceptional transfer was not solely aimed at
maintaining dividends, and that the results pointed to promising underlying
strength.
The total underwriting loss for the general branch was Pounds 6.81m,
compared with Pounds 5.89m in 1990. This included losses on property of
Pounds 4.96m, and on motors of Pounds 1.55m.
He was predicting a surplus next year of Pounds 24.5m, and a dividend rise
to 33.5p.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: GPA price likely to be below Dollars 25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED maximum offering price for shares in the GPA flotation is
Dollars 25 (Pounds 14.20p) according to its filing document with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, the US regulator.
Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was
quick to point out yesterday that it was not tied by a price that was simply
used to calculate its SEC registration fee of Dollars 93,750.
However, when GPA announces its price range in May, advisers to the group
believe it is likely to be below the proposed maximum price of Dollars 25
contained on the front of its document.
That is a view shared by some of GPA's shareholders, which could cause the
group some problems as its advisers negotiate terms to prevent them from
selling immediately after the secondary sale.
GPA's advisers expect all of the group's existing shareholders to agree to a
form of 'lock-up' that would allow them to sell some shares during the offer
but not for six to 12 months after the sale.
The Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, which according to its SEC
Form F-1 statement is its largest shareholder with 12.8m shares, is known to
be keen to reduce its holding. Air Canada, with 10.8m shares, and Aer
Lingus, with 9.9m shares, would also like to sell 'at the right price'.
But the problem is to determine the right price. Some of their shares were
bought for Dollars 32, although the majority were purchased at considerably
less. If shareholders do not come to an agreement with the company they
forfeit their chance to sell in the secondary offer.
One shareholder which has decided it is not worth waiting is Hanson, the
international conglomerate. It yesterday confirmed the sale of its 2 per
cent stake of 1.2m shares for Dollars 20.57 a share.
As Hanson put it: 'Our banks were not exactly about to default on us'. The
conglomerate may have thought that it was not worth negotiating a lock-up
agreement before a sale which would only realise a little more than it
received for all its shares.
Directors and executive officers of GPA have options to purchase 595,000
ordinary shares at prices ranging from Dollars 5.10 to Dollars 32.50, with a
weighted average price of Dollars 19 per share.
The F-1 document also contains new information on GPA's results for the nine
months to the end of December. Revenues from aircraft leasing increased by
46 per cent, from Dollars 416m to Dollars 606m, reflecting an increase in
the number of GPA aircraft on lease from 216 to 281.
Revenues from sales of aircraft and aircraft-related products fell by 20 per
cent from Dollars 1.05bn to Dollars 841m, mainly because the number of
aircraft sold fell from 40 to 22, reflecting the difficult trading
conditions prevailing in the industry.
The document warns: 'The duration and severity of these difficult trading
conditions will depend in part on the duration and severity of the recession
but management believes it is likely that they will continue through at
least fiscal 1993 and lease rates may not recover during that period.'
GPA made provisions of Dollars 11m against lease receivables in case
airlines get into difficulty and are unable to pay their leases. Although
they are required to pay an upfront deposit of three months, GPA expects
some airlines to default on their payments.
The group has also made provisions of millions of dollars against the
falling price of some of its older narrow-body aircraft.
The importance of the flotation is underlined by the fact that GPA's firm
orders to buy aircraft from manufacturers until the year 2000 has risen to
Dollars 12.1bn with options, costing Dollars 9.5bn, to purchase additional
aircraft.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Heavier tax likely for combined bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACQUISITION of Midland Bank by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank may impose
substantial additional tax burdens on the combined group, it emerged
yesterday.
It is believed that the Inland Revenue is likely to gain additional taxes
from the group at the expense of other regimes overseas with lower rates.
Officials at Hongkong Bank were beginning to approach professional advisers
and regulators yesterday to discuss the position.
One suggested that the need to consult more widely on tax implications was
one of the main reasons for making the offer public, to prevent news leaking
out before an announcement was made.
At the heart of the deliberations is the status of HSBC Holdings, a company
established last April which is incorporated in the UK but classified as
non-UK resident for tax purposes. This is possible because central control
and management of the company rests in Hong Kong.
Subsidiaries of HSBC include Marine Midland, James Capel, the British Bank
of the Middle East and Hongkong Bank of Canada and Australia, as well as
Hongkong Bank itself.
Midland, currently resident for UK tax, would remain UK resident under the
acquisition and become a subsidiary of HSBC. But there are questions over
the non-resident status of HSBC as a result of the purchase.
Officials say HSBC was created to give the Hongkong bank a foothold in
Europe in preparation for the single European market. But it also had
significant tax advantages. Its status as non-resident means it is liable
for Hong Kong profit tax, which stood at 16.5 per cent in 1990, compared
with 33 per cent corporation tax currently charged in the UK.
The last published accounts for Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation for
the year to December 31 1990  - before the new arrangement was ratified  -
do not disclose tax liabilities. Those for HSBC Holdings only show
liabilities against a Thai branch of the bank. The figures for 1991 are due
to be published at the end of this month.
A senior adviser to HSBC said it would be 'a naive conclusion' to assume tax
issues had not been thought about in advance of the offer.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hong Kong optimistic about deal - No
comment from China about Hongkong taking over Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH FOUR years of build-up to HSBC Holdings' announcement of proposals to
take over Midland Bank, Hong Kong was prepared for the move if not for the
timing.
A 107 point shock reaction on the Hang Seng Index was almost entirely
reversed on Wednesday and the bulk of the financial community was cautiously
favourable towards the decision, which will create a truly international
rather than Hong Kong bank.
The fact that the Bank will reveal its inner reserves at least 18 months
earlier than had been originally anticipated, was a main factor in the
optimism clinging to banking analysts yesterday.
Most brokers estimated the hidden reserves to amount to between Dollars
HK20bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and Dollars HK30bn and this provided significant
support for HSBC shares against a back-drop of knee-jerk selling following
Tuesday's announcement.
There was an absence of comment from Chinese officials, which was seen as a
further positive.
The only official statement came from Beijing, where Mr Zheng Hua, from Hong
Kong's New China News Agency, said 'we hope that HSBC's activities will not
affect Hong Kong's stability and prosperity'.
However, there were whispers of discontent from mainland Chinese sources,
expressing concern that the resources of the Hong Kong financial sector
would be rechannelled into Europe.
While Mr David Li, the banking community's representative in Legislative
Council, expressed surprise that a Hong Kong bank should wish to focus on
what he described as a 'sunset continent', at a time when so much attention
was centred on the booming economies of south east Asia.
Mr Li, also chief executive of The Bank of East Asia, a local competitor of
Hongkong Bank, said a UK banker had described the move to him as 'just a
colonialist going home'.
He said the move would not damage the credibility of the financial market.
'Hongkong Bank is not that important today', he said.
Mr Chim Pui-chung, a fellow Legislative Councillor, also expressed surprise.
'The English groups in Hong Kong always had the advantage, but right now
they are no longer better off than the other groups. But they will still
find that Hong Kong is the best place to invest', he said.
However, few individuals in the political or financial community took the
argument that Hong Kong's quasi-Central Bank was out to buy a British
passport.
The focus was firmly upon the commercial value of the deal. And once fears
of a significant cash outlay had been calmed by insiders' assertions that it
would be funded through new shares, the chief reaction was relatively
positive.
'This is purely a commercial decision', said Mr Barry Yates, research
director at Asia Equity. 'I am very positive. Midland Bank has got the
greatest recovery potential of all the UK banks'.
Despite the impact of a likely increase in issued share capital of more than
40 per cent, a number of analysts suggested the effect would merely be to
push back the strong earnings growth of HSBC by one year.
And with the announcement of inner reserves, the Bank would have to disclose
full profits for 1992, boosting profit figures for that year.
Baring Securities was forecasting a transfer to inner reserves of Dollars
2.67bn in 1992. Since this would become part of the disclosed profit figure,
earnings per share for the enlarged group could exceed the original
forecasts for HSBC.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell companies and funds file fraud
claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAXWELL companies and pension funds have taken the first steps to file
claims under some Pounds 50m of insurance policies intended to protect them
against fraud, it emerged yesterday.
The policies, held jointly by the companies, were taken out on the
instructions of Mr Robert Maxwell.
The companies contacted Willis Corroon, the policies' insurance broker,
following Mr Maxwell's death in November and the subsequent discovery that
about Pounds 900m of assets and pension money had been diverted to his
collapsing private companies.
The three policies, for fidelity, directors' and officers' liability and
pension trustees' indemnity, include clauses insuring the Maxwell companies
against employee dishonesty, robbery, forgery, counterfeit, and computer
fraud.
American International Underwriters, the US insurance group, confirmed
yesterday that it was the lead underwriter for the fidelity policy, covering
losses from staff dishonesty. Syndicates at Lloyd's of London are among
insurers backing a directors' and officers' insurance policy.
Sun Alliance is among insurers for a policy against losses from negligence
by pension fund trustees. The policy does not cover a shortfall in the
pension funds.
It is understood that in a letter on February 15, Willis Corroon told the
Maxwell risk management department that the initial notification 'lacks
adequate specificity for it to be accepted as valid notification of a claim
on these policies'.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Maxwell support for MGN shares discovered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE late Mr Robert Maxwell secretly purchased shares in Mirror Group
Newspapers as the price of the stock plunged in the weeks after he floated
the company last May.
This newly discovered share support scheme by Mr Maxwell closely parallels
an extensive one he employed on the shares of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, his other public company.
In both cases he was under great pressure to support the share prices
because he had pledged stock in the two companies as collateral for huge
bank loans.
The support schemes formed a large part of the 'black hole' through which
hundreds of millions of pounds worth of Maxwell pension fund assets and Mr
Maxwell's bank borrowings disappeared last year.
The Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into the alleged MCC
share support scheme last December.
The MGN purchases, increasing his stake from 51 per cent to 54.8 per cent,
had been made by a Liechtenstein trust company but they were funded by
Maxwell private companies, administrators to the companies said last night.
The purchases should have been made public.
MGN shares plummeted from 125.5p on May 17, the first day of dealing, to 91p
July 22.
Mr Maxwell bought 10m shares in late May and a further 10m in June, Mr John
Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administrator, said.
He declined to comment on which investment bank had handled the transactions
worth about Pounds 20m but it is believed to be Goldman Sachs, the US firm
which also handled some of the MCC share purchases.
Goldman Sachs has said previously it had been assured by Mr Maxwell that the
MCC purchasers were unrelated to him.
It is believed that a US and a Swiss corporation among the Maxwell private
companies funded the share purchases.
After the MGN flotation Mr Maxwell came under pressure from some of his
lenders to improve the collateral he had offered them.
Much of the banks' collateral was MCC shares which were also under pressure
on the stock market.
In some cases, he offered them MGN shares instead and by early last summer
he had pledged most of his MGN holding to his creditors.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Steve Jobs recruits C&amp;W man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER van Cuylenburg, executive director in charge of Cable and
Wireless's businesses in OECD countries, is leaving the UK-based
telecommunications giant to become president and chief operating officer of
Next Computer in California.
Next was established in 1988 by Mr Steve Jobs, the co-founder and former
chairman of Apple Computer, to revolutionise the personal computer. But so
far it has failed to fulfil his hopes; the first version of its computer
sold only a few thousand units. Revenues last year were Dollars 127m (Pounds
72m).
C&amp;W is expected to announce today a re-organisation of director
responsibilities following his departure. It is expected to underline a
commitment to its niche monopolies instead of competing with big
telecommunication companies.
Mr van Cuylenburg led the recently aborted merger talks with American
Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications giant. His departure was
described as a 'loss' by C&amp;W.
Formerly head of Texas Instruments' worldwide computer business, Mr van
Cuylenburg joined the C&amp;W subsidiary, Mercury Communications, as chief
executive in 1989 and was appointed to his present post last year.
His hopes of becoming chief executive of C&amp;W were dashed last month when Mr
James Ross was appointed to the post but Mr van Cuylenburg, now 44 years
old, insists his decision to change jobs is a consequence of opportunity
rather than disappointment.
He said yesterday: 'I want to make it clear that I am moving because of the
attractiveness of the opportunity at Next Computer. It is something that
happens once in a lifetime; there is no other reason to leave C&amp;W'
Mr van Cuylenburg, British-born and a graduate of Bristol Polytechnic, said
he told Lord Young, C&amp;W executive chairman, last year that his goal was to
work in the US.
Lord Young accepted that his long-term future would not be with C&amp;W but
pressed him to stay on to complete plans for corporate reorganisation in
which they had both been involved.
C&amp;W has been keen to foster a period of management stability. Mr Adam
Quinton, telecommunications analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, said: 'C&amp;W is
a business where the long-term relationship between the customers and
suppliers is important. Stability is needed to enable the group to define
its strategy.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Friends Provident agrees to European insurers' alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIENDS Provident, the mutually owned life and pensions group, yesterday put
the finishing touches to a deal which could ultimately lead to its merger
with three medium-sized north European insurers.
Friends agreed with Wasa, Sweden's third biggest life insurer, Avero
Centraal Beheer, the second largest Dutch general insurer, and Topdanmark,
Denmark's third biggest general insurer, to pool its non-domestic assets
into Eureko, an Amsterdam-based holding company, jointly owned by the four.
Eureko's initial assets of Pounds 450m are modest, but together the groups
will constitute the 25th biggest European insurer.
Mr Carl Hedlund, chairman of the supervisory board, said all the partners
were committed to 'something much more concrete than a marketing alliance or
partnership'.
Warning of possible encroachment by larger predators, Mr Hedlund said: 'We
must have a strategy to safeguard our future at an international level.
'We have structured Eureko to be long lasting,' he said, adding that it
would be difficult for any of the partners to break the alliance.
The deal, which was agreed in outline late last year, follows a similar move
by Royal Insurance, AMB of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy to create a
jointly-owned European holding group.
The partners aim to invite other companies to join them in building a
broader pan-European grouping.
Preliminary contacts have already been made with a number of companies in
France and Germany which, like the existing partners, have a mutual
background.
Eureko will acquire shareholdings in AVCB, Topdanmark and Wasa of at least
10 per cent, while Friends will acquire a 51 per cent share in Topdanmark's
UK subsidiary, Top UK, in a transaction valued at around Pounds 20m. Morgan
Grenfell, the merchant bank, is conducting valuations of the assets to be
injected into Eureko, with the transfers taking place in August.
Top UK is a direct motor insurer, selling insurance via mass media
advertising and telephone. Topdanmark and AVCB support direct sales
techniques, which avoid using brokers.
The Top UK deal signals Friends' re-entry into the general insurance field
in the UK.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Bundesbank warns of tax rises to help east German economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK warned yesterday that further tax increases may be necessary
to support the east German economy.
The central bank gave the warning as it spelt out the full cost to west
Germany of propping up the east, estimating that net transfer payments to
the region would rise to DM180bn (Pounds 62.5bn) this year from DM139bn in
1991.
It also warned that further public borrowing to finance such payments could
put a severe strain on economic policy. State indebtedness had to be reduced
as quickly as possible by curbing spending.
The bank's transfer figures work out at DM3,000 per west German inhabitant.
It said in its monthly report that the figures were equivalent to 5.5 per
cent of west Germany's gross national product last year and 6.5 per cent
this year.
The cost of propping up the east Germany economy, painfully recovering from
45 years of communism, is well beyond estimates made in the heady days of
unification.
In 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an abortive election promise that no
tax rises would be necessary to finance unity. This was to counter
opposition charges that the costs were being underplayed to win votes.
The bank said yesterday more funds were urgently needed for investment,
while accepting that the emphasis so far on consumption was unavoidable.
East Germany, the German population, contributed only 3.5 per cent of tax
revenues last year.
Domestic demand in east Germany, at DM360bn, was twice as high as its GNP.
The Bundesbank again complained that the federal government was having to
contribute too much compared with the Lander (states) and local authorities.
The Bonn government's net share (after tax revenues) was DM53bn, which would
rise this year to DM74bn, or nearly 40 per cent of the total.
By contrast, the states and local authorities would pay only DM12bn (DM8bn
in 1991).
In addition, unemployment, short-time working, retraining, and job creation
costs would account for DM30bn this year, the German Unity Fund for DM24bn,
and aids to industry and investment through grants, cheap loans, and tax
concessions for DM25bn.
Pensions would take DM14bn, with a net DM1bn coming from the EC.
About 25 per cent of federal spending would go to east Germany this year
against 20 per cent in 1991, the bank said.
Some DM85bn of the transfers would flow into east German households (DM60bn
in 1991), such as through social security payments, financing 40 per cent of
private consumption.

FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Mexican mineral water company might seem a risky investment for Cadbury
Schweppes, but the Pounds 188m deal is logical enough. Mexico is one of the
world's largest markets for soft drinks and consumption is growing by 9 per
cent annually. Aguas Minerales is the market leader in bottled water. More
important its bottling capacity should transform the distribution of
Cadbury's Mexican brands and make the group into a much stronger competitor.
The price implies a goodwill write-off of Pounds 100m and will also mean a
small dilution of next year's earnings. But Cadbury must inevitably pay up
for such fast-growing businesses and its highly-rated shares are a sensible
currency. Investors are doubtless more concerned to know it has learnt from
the experience of rivals like PepsiCo. In 1982, Pepsi took a large
exceptional charge after admitting it had been defrauded by local Mexican
management.

FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Rentokil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil has made itself a hostage to fortune by promising annual earnings
growth of 20 per cent. The target was comfortably exceeded in 1991, but it
will become ever more demanding as inflation recedes. So it is natural to
question its long-term prospects, especially since one possible route to
higher profits  - squeezing margins  - is approaching exhaustion. The margin
on environmental services, which make up most of the business, climbed to
over 28 per cent in last year's second half. That is pushing against what
even the company admits is the ceiling.
Happily, Rentokil also managed a healthy level of organic growth, even in
the depressed Anglo-Saxon markets. There should be further scope from that
quarter, while the company has plenty of cash to finance a steady flow of
small acquisitions. But it will become increasingly dependent on such a diet
and much depends on whether enough opportunities emerge. Failure to keep up
the pace would be a clear warning of faltering growth down the road.
A historic multiple of 25 suggests the market is unperturbed about
Rentokil's ability to meet its growth target for the next five years or so.
By 1997, however, it should be growing profits from a base of at least
Pounds 235m. Given that Rentokil shares were the 13th best performer in the
FT-SE over the past year, they will only appear cheap to those who believe
that momentum can be maintained even after 1997. Rentokil must be
approaching the point where there is more risk than sure reward.

FT  19 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the water and electricity utilities may have simply been reacting
badly to the polls yesterday. Or perhaps their marked underperformance was
caused more by investors misreading Labour's manifesto. Labour's choice of
the term 'public control' over the two industries was confusing, perhaps
deliberately so. It confirms a retreat from full ownership, without carrying
an obvious meaning. The broader commitments appear to offer little to
consumers beyond what the regulators should already be providing.
In the case of water, Labour has nothing to lose in making its intentions
clear at once. It is inconceivable it could ever afford to take on the
burden of the industry's huge capital spending. While there will be tighter
regulation in future, that old threat should have been largely in the price.
Judging by yesterday's 4 per cent fall in Anglian and Thames Water shares,
the market has been less than efficient.
As for Labour's view of electricity, it is complicated by an environmental
policy which includes a pledge to stabilise and then speed up reduction of
carbon dioxide emissions. It is hard to square that with smaller coal
imports, the closure of nuclear stations and blocking of gas-fired stations.
Until that contradiction is addressed, investors can only guess at the
industry's eventual shape. That promises an uncertain ride for the shares.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FT-SE Index: 2,464.7 (
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
26.5)
Not too many UK composite insurers boosted their payout by 8 per cent last
year, which raises the question of whether the London stock market needs to
look at BAT Industries in a fresh light. The obsession with Eagle Star,
after all, has twice wrong footed investors, initially in the first part of
last year when the shares raced ahead on misplaced hopes of a turn in the
insurance cycle, latterly as panic set in that Royal's horrendous mortgage
guarantee losses might prise open a new can of worms at the ill fated BAT
subsidiary.
Tobacco and insurance may not be everyone's idea of solid long term
businesses. But with signs that the worst is over for Eagle Star, and
tobacco as defiant as ever in the face of the obituarists, BAT's
simultaneous ambition to increase dividends ahead of inflation and rebuild
cover looks eminently feasible, a 7 per cent prospective yield hardly
demanding. Eagle Star's losses may be enormous  - and even Pounds 300m is an
understatement were the company to report its figures like the composites  -
but at least there is a chance of break even by the end of this year and a
return to profitability in 1993. The recovery in earnings will be all the
greater for stemming the write offs in ACT. BAT may still be hiding its
blushes, but when the insurance shake-out is complete the company will make
much more money than its financially weakened competitors.
BAT's relative balance sheet strength, of course, stems from the tobacco
cash flow, which last year benefited from an improved US market share, the
relaxation of price controls in Brazil, and galloping exports from the UK.
The US Supreme Court's pending ruling on product liability is a genuine puff
of smoke over the shares  - but on the not unreasonable assumption this goes
the industry's way, US investors would again become serious buyers.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Lautro may force refunds on life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 20 life insurance companies could be forced by regulators to make
refunds to policyholders on the industry's most successful product last
year.
Lautro, the life industry's watchdog, has set a deadline of early next month
for insurance companies to submit for scrutiny all advertising material
involving so-called single-premium with-profits bonds.
Advertising deemed to be misleading will have to be changed, and customers
who relied on it will be able to claim compensation.
It is the first time that Lautro has ordered such a sweeping review of a
mainstream life industry product.
In particular, Lautro is concerned that investors have been led by sales
agents to believe that the policies are simply a higher yielding version of
building society deposit accounts and that they may retrieve their funds in
full at any time.
In fact, investors can face some delay in withdrawing funds, and interest
rates are not guaranteed.
Insurance companies whose advertising literature is found to be misleading
will be asked to write to all policyholders explaining the product more
accurately. Those policyholders who then feel they have been misled may be
entitled to refunds.
The companies said yesterday that they did not believe their own literature
ran counter to Lautro rules.
Lautro's order follows a review by its monitoring committee, begun in
November, which had received complaints from investors. There were also
press reports about allegedly misleading advertising.
A Lautro official said that, following the complaints, the monitoring
committee had reviewed the advertising of six companies and decided an
industry review was needed.
The adverts did not all make clear that the products were unsuitable as a
short-term investment, that the insurance company had a right to adjust the
value of the contract or that current bonus rates were not a good guide to
future bonus rates.
According to the Association of British Insurers, with-profits bonds made up
the biggest share of the Pounds 3.06bn in non-linked single premium business
sold by insurers last year. Sales in that category topped all others and
soared by 76 per cent over 1990.
The two largest suppliers of with-profits bonds, Norwich Union and
Prudential Holborn, have sold a total of more than Pounds 1.1bn in the past
year. Other leading suppliers are Sun Life, Eagle Star, Equitable Life and
Friends Provident.
Mr Tony Kempster, managing director of Prudential Holborn, which has sold
Pounds 450m of with-profits bonds since May, said the company was reviewing
its advertising materials for the third time in recent months.

Professor Graef Crystal, the man American chief executives love to hate, is
making still another comeback.
His fame for publicising US corporate chieftains' bulging pay packets once
led Fortune magazine to call him America's 'foremost compensation expert'.
But Fortune itself had the misfortune to show, in its Crystal-compiled
executive pay list for 1990, that the greediest was Steve Ross, chairman of
Fortune's parent, the Time Warner group.
Crystal left the magazine last summer after receiving what he termed an
insulting letter from Time Warner.
He then went to work at Financial World, but was dismissed, apparently
having again incurred the wrath of several top CEOs.
Now Crystal has signed on as a columnist for The New York Observer, an
irreverent weekly newspaper whose editorial mission appears to be the
debunking of myths and heroes of the the 1980s.
Graydon Carter, its editor, pledges that Crystal will have 'complete
freedom'; Crystal says: 'A lot of eyes need to be poked out and the Observer
should allow me to do that.'
From one Observer to another, good luck.

Yet again, the recent exchange of letters in The Times has proved that when
it comes to fielding heavy-
weight teams of sympathetic businessmen, the Tories win hands down. In
big-business experience, Labour peer Lord Hollick's team was no match for
Sir Allen Sheppard's Conservative cheerleaders.
Whereas FT-SE 100 company bigwigs (a Bank of England director among them)
dominated the signatories of Sir Allen's letter, Hollick's list did not
include the chief executive of a single Footsie company.
Apart from the odd entrepreneur such as publisher Paul Hamlyn, seasoned
industrialists seemed sparse by comparison with media and property types.
The City was under-represented  - although Charles Cavanagh is a senior
Kleinwort Benson fund manager as well as a clergyman.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Observer: PVC peels off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever Cable and Wireless may pretend, the loss of Peter van Cuylenburg is
a blow. True, 'PVC' will be easier to replace in his role as group director
of C and W's OECD businesses than if he had still been running Mercury. But
he gave the group style and vision that will be hard to reproduce.
He is off to a smaller job  - albeit probably much better paid  - at Next
Computer in California, and is both philosophical and complimentary about
his new boss, Steve Jobs. The founder of both Apple Computer and Next, and
the enfant terrible of the US computer industry, Jobs has never been easy to
work with.
John Scully, imported to give Apple strategic direction and management
weight, solved the problem by taking control of the company himself. Is a
similar coup likely at Next, an innovative computer company that has never
fulfilled its promise?
Van Cuylenburg says Jobs has matured, and thinks his persistence in a tough
market admirable. But how far is PVC's move a reaction to being passed over
for the top job at Cand W? Not at all, he says, adding that the chance to
work with an imaginative computer software company is an unrepeatable
opportunity.
It will be a meeting of old Texas Instruments minds. Robb Wilmot, ex-head of
TI in Britain and once ICL's managing director, recruited van Cuylenburg.
Next week, the two of them plus Jobs will lunch in California to discuss
Wilmot's possible contribution to Next's strategic planning.

Alan Sugar's spoonful of corrective medicine for Labour's Gordon Brown,
which can be sampled on the opposite page, did not come to us straight from

London Evening Standard, whose interest in presenting all sides of a
political debate is well known.
But, having got Amstrad's founder-chairman to dispense a dose of his
famously pithy and perceptive judgments, the Standard apparently decided to
hold back publication. Whereupon the enterprising Nick Hewer of Amstrad's PR
company, Michael Joyce Associates, quickly  - and perhaps surprisingly  -
secured permission to send Sugar's thoughts to morning newspapers, including
the FT.
Too late, the Standard found it had let itself be scooped.

<TEXT>
'All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy
in its own way.' Whether Tolstoy's famous words are true in all cases, the
present unhappy outlook for Britain's Royals contrasts with the prospects
for royal families elsewhere.
While the marriage troubles of Prince Andrew and Prince Charles are dragging
down public esteem for the UK monarchy, in other countries monarchy is on
the upsurge.
The best example is Spain where King Juan Carlos, since taking the
re-instituted throne in 1975, has won wide admiration, particularly for his
firm stand against the attempted coup 11 years ago.
But in Brazil, too, support for a monarchy is growing with the approach of
next year's plebiscite on constitutional change. While the main argument is
between parliamentarians and presidentialists, two sizeable groups are
urging the return of a king from the Braganca family. The last one, Dom
Pedro II, was deposed in 1889.
Alas, typically, the two factions cannot agree on which of his descendants
to promote.
Moreover, in Belgrade, 50,000 demonstrators lately took to the streets
demanding that Serbia's monarchy be restored in place of President Slobodan
Milosevic. Similar calls have been heard in the republic of Georgia. As for
else-
where . . .who knows: before very much longer even the Romanovs may be
preferred to Boris Yeltsin.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: BBC Symphony Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A favour was inadvertently paid by one orchestra to another at this concert.
While the 'Towards the Millennium' festival has been marking the decade
1911-20 by performing standard musical works that we could expect to hear
anyway, the BBC has really taken the plunge and scheduled a major rarity
from the same years  - a vast and sprawling tone poem as lavish in its
orchestral resources as it is ambitious in scope.
This was Zran ('Ripening') by Josef Suk. Written in 1912-17, the work is in
every way a child of the decade into which it was born. There is an
extravagance in the materials used, a lack of discipline about the musical
logic, that was typical of the dying embers of romanticism, before war and a
new order snuffed out any last flickering desire on the part of composers to
write big orchestral works of this kind more or less for good.
In its layout, and often in sound too, Zran comes across as a less memorable
version of Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra. A poem by Antonn Sova provides
a vague programme; the musical structure is described as fluid (or, to put
it less kindly, diffuse). Out of seductive clouds of texture a distinct
musical idea will from time to time emerge into the foreground; but as soon
as one starts to get a hold on it, it is gone and the listener is left again
with an indeterminate wash of sound.
So as not to seem entirely ungrateful, it should be stated clearly that
those sounds are sometimes beautiful, sometimes formidable, always
imaginative. Suk clearly knew how to write for a vast orchestra on a
Straussian or Mahlerian scale, replete with seven extra trumpets, piano,
celesta and just about as many as possible of everything else.
The BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis is to be commended for taking
up so adventurous a challenge and one imagines that they made a thoroughly
professional job of it.
They certainly had of the earlier items in this all-Czech programme.
Janacek's Sinfonietta was decisively played, bold, rhythmical, assertive.
Dvorak's Cello Concerto went with an unproblematical easy lyricism.
The soloist in the latter was Heinrich Schiff, whose ability to make any
piece of music turn inwards upon itself unlocked in this familiar concerto a
private inner sanctum rarely revealed. There is still much in Czech music to
explore as the millennium approaches.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: Sweet-and-sour gangster epic - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUGSY (18) Odeon Leicester Sq LA BELLE NOISEUSE (15) Metro, Renoir, Chelsea
Cinema SHINING THROUGH (15) Odeon West End
It is the late afternoon of a gangster's life. A gilded haze drifts around
his home; the sun slants into his soul through the holes in his conscience.
Bugsy Siegel is about to meet his maker. But who did make Bugsy Siegel?
According to Bugsy the movie, it was a combination of God, Meyer Lansky and
the West Coast gambling and showbiz industries. This brilliant
sweet-and-sour gangster epic directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man) and
written by James Toback (The Gambler, Fingers) first does the unspeakable  -
glamorising its hero-villain by casting Warren Beatty as the Brooklyn-born
mobster who stole, killed and created that perdition zone called Las Vegas
 -and then transcends it with the irresistible.
Bugsy Siegel was evil. But he did not rise to evil's heights without charm
and self-promotional flair; nor without wearing the best suits and seducing
the best women. Ergo: Toback and Levinson see the successful gangster as a
not-too-distant cousin to the successful movie star. More, they discovered
that Bugsy himself made a screen test soon after being posted to Los Angeles
by his New York crime-partners Lansky and 'Lucky' Luciano. In the event,
Bugsy's experience of stardust was confined to romancing aspiring actress
Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) and to persuading the Hollywood famous to buy
shares in his Flamingo Hotel.
The building costs of this 'folly' in the Nevada desert rose from Dollars 1m
to Dollars 6m, causing Lansky and Luciano to fume and Siegel to seal his own
death warrant. He was gunned down on June 20 1947. The hotel went on to
become Las Vegas and Las Vegas went on to become the El Dorado of the New
West.
The film has a mythical acoustic so potent that we never believe we are
watching merely a Siegel bio-pic nor merely a Beatty ego-trip. (The star
also co-produced.) It is about both men and all men, and it is about human
contradictions. Though Bugsy Siegel is the insect in each of us  - that part
of ourselves tempted by dark scuttling pathways to self-fulfilment  - he was
finally undone by building his dreams in broad daylight in a broad desert.
Toback and Levinson confer on the man a bizarre innocence. He is a
narcissist who checks his hair in a glass while beating up a fellow
gangster; he frets over his screen test while re-running it on a home
projector; and he woos his girlfriend with cornball-wistful lines  - 'I wish
the two of us could be alone on Coney Island eating a couple of hot dogs
together'  - that in another film would be derisory rather than derided.
Photographed in a seductive haze by Allan Daviau, the film is the dream of a
man with an etherised conscience. Morally as well as geographically this
Bugsy is in Lotusland, where the outward vistas are as unreal as the inner
perceptions; from the idyllic painted matte-shot that introduces Hollywood
to Siegel and Virginia's first meeting on a soundstage 'hilltop'.
As in his other nostalgia dramas  - The Natural, Avalon  - director Levinson
sees the past as a kind of human aquarium, where the drama of survival is so
slow-motion that it can be mistaken for lyricism. But Bugsy never loses
sight of the hidden cruelties. Beatty, whose looks, age and a receding brow
have now Nixonised, makes Siegel a charmer who can turn in an instant to
brawler or black magician. And Bening is a marvel. Her acid malevolence of
voice and odd, tense prettiness  - Ida Lupino in a good light, Gloria
Grahame in a bad  - are both a tinder to Bugsy's evil and a precis of this
movie's world. It is a world where that familiar duo the Bad and the
Beautiful have progressed from being just good friends to being fast,
inextricable lovers.
Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse is a 4-hour French film about an ageing
painter (Michel Piccoli). It is directed by a man whose work hitherto has
been noted for a few shipshape vessels  - L'Amour Fou, Celine And Julie Go
Boating  - floating in a Sargasso Sea of interesting wrecks (Out One,
Duelle, Noirot).
Do we tempt you? I thought not. But La Belle Noiseuse  - roughly 'the
beautiful nuisance'  - is a masterpiece. It takes all the exasperating
Rivette traits and makes them riveting. The source is a Balzac story (as in
Out One). The people do a lot of talking. Art, sex and death are favourite
subjects. And a well-tried quartet of Euro-stars, led by Piccoli and Jane
Birkin, take up acting space in a weatherbeaten country home that Rivette
might be time-sharing with Eric Rohmer.
Piccoli is the artist trying to end a ten-year creative block by painting a
new and nubile model (Emmanuelle Beart). The two enact their corrida of
creativity in a cavernous studio, she forcing his emotions to the surface,
he coaxing her body into positions known previously only to the Kama Sutra.
Meanwhile, artist's wife Birkin and model's husband David Bursztein pace the
Piccoli estate, like anxious spouses waiting for the birth of what they hope
(but doubt) is an artistic offspring related to them. The film spends loving
minutes  - nay, tens of minutes  - watching the artist's hand deflower blank
sheets and canvases. (In close-up painter Bernard Dufour's hand substitutes
for Piccoli's). Often the only sound is a steel pen scratching lines on
white paper, interspersed with picador remarks from Piccoli like 'When I was
young I enjoyed pulling my toys to pieces.'
Sado-masochism is clearly part of this artist's game plan. But comical
serendipity is just as important. He finally 'finds' his subject when Beart
makes a stray spontaneous gesture and Piccoli, half drunk with red wine,
falls off his stool. As the painting sessions crawl on through their strange
eternity  - though to us it never feels like one - the girl takes increasing
command and the artist becomes her blustering tool, raving about creative
'maelstroms' and 'hurricanes.'
An entire sex war is depicted here, further enriched by Mlle Birkin's
outrage that the canvas she once modelled for ('La Belle Noiseuse') is now
being effaced and painted over by her faithless spouse. 'You've put buttocks
in place of my face]' she cries. Was ever marital despair so plainly,
pithily imaged forth?
This is a dazzling study in the birth-pains of art and the growing-pains of
art's relationship with life and love. The film presents creativity not as
some ponderous, uncomprehended sacrament a la Hollywood  - Beethoven out in
the storm, Van Gogh mystically eyeballing his sunflowers  - but as a direct,
chaotic extension of daily life, daily need and daily passion.
It would do Melanie Griffith's heroine in Shining Through a power of good to
sit for M. Piccoli. He would have her clothes off in an instant and she
would be writhing on the floor. As it is, the only exercise the overdressed
Miss G gets in this daft wartime thriller is to run from Potsdam to Berlin
one night in high heels and an opera gown.
Have you ever tried this? It is, I assure you, impossible. But then so is
everything else in writer-director David Seltzer's adaptation of a Susan
Isaacs best-seller. Griffith plays a humble secretary working for Allied
Intelligence (Michael Douglas) in pre-Blitz London. When she offers to
smuggle herself into Berlin and pose as a cook for a top Nazi in order to
grab vital doodlebug-bomb secrets, how could Douglas refuse? She speaks
perfect German and her Apple Strudel, she claims, is a knockout. So off she
goes to meet Sir John Gielgud as 'Sunflower', our man in back-projected
Berlin.
The rest is history; or rather thank goodness it is not and never was. There
are hairsbreadth 'scapes, hair-raising scrapes, and herrings and skates.
(The heroine hides her messages in a fish shop.) There is also Miss
Griffith's voice, that high piping gurgle resembling a cat trapped in a
water deposit. With this she delivers the film's voice-over narration which
reaches its finest hour when explaining the plot's time scheme. 'I knew it
was Friday, because the next day was Saturday.' By final reel she is
staggering past German bullets to the finishing post. But the audience has
already left for the bar, totting up its losses.

<TEXT>
It might be wrong to accuse the Birmingham Royal Ballet of corporate
schizophrenia, but the company personality underwent a marked change during
the triple bill which initiated a season at the Wells on Tuesday. The
evening began with David Bintley's Galanteries, lately acquired for the
repertory. It is a classical conversation-piece, set to two early Mozart
scores, in which the dancers exchange academic proprieties in hushed voices.
The set and costumes are fuzzy grey; the tone is muted and somehow remote;
movement looks polite, numbed. Miyako Yoshida and Sandra Madgwick are
advocates for sunnier, larger-scaled things, but mimsiness rules.
Very different the look of the cast after the interval, when MacMillan's The
Burrow took the stage. I reported on this study in claustrophobic anguish
after its revival at the Birmingham Hippodrome last autumn. It projects even
more strongly, seems more ridden by terror, on the confines of the Wells
stage. And its cast  - with memorably good interpretations from Marion Tait
as the Woman, Desmond Kelly as the Outcast, Michael O'Hare as the Joker  -
expose every nerve and every fearful twitch of the psyche in bold movement.
And as the necessary relaxation to end the evening, there is Elite
Syncopations. The company romp, relax, show-off. A couple of the numbers
need to be sharpened but Marion Tait, deliciously mocking, and the extra-sec
Joseph Cipolla, are stylish, ideal. The score, under Jonathan Higgins, is no
less witty. For the two earlier pieces, Anthony Twiner drew sound
performances from the Royal Ballet Sinfonia.
Darcey Bussell is making her debuts in Manon at Covent Garden this season.
In her appearances in other MacMillan ballets  - her creation of Prince of
the Pagodas; as the Woman in Song of the Earth are good examples  - and in
such challenges as Balanchine repertory or traditional 19th century works,
she offers a combination of technical grace and a trusting devotion to the
choreography which is dazzling to watch. The dance is there, unadorned by
anything save the integrity of Miss Bussell's manner and the felicity of her
physical command. There is mystery  - that mystery we sense in the presence
of any prodigally gifted young artist  - but it is bewitchingly mixed with
an innocence that comes from talent that does not know how to dance badly.
Yet as Manon, in her second performance which I saw on Monday night, her
abilities did not seem to reflect the complexities of the character or to
engage fully with the role. Of course her dancing was beautiful. Of course
she looked ravishing in the first two acts, and piteous in the third (though
her wig was a brute). Of course she conveyed the varied lures of true love
in a garret and gilded vice in a house of assignation. But her sincerity of
temperament made Manon too guileless, too unshadowed in sexuality and
feeling. She was not selfish enough. And it must be said that the
choreography is best suited to a smaller physique. The swooping, curving
images through which MacMillan tells of Manon's charms gain their fullest
meaning with a more contained frame  - even one more able to suggest the
intoxicating, kittenish aspects of the girl's irresistible and fatal allure.
This is, one must remember, a first sketch of a reading; experience, and her
own great gifts, will surely show Miss Bussell the way to Manon's
ever-changing, ever-fascinating heart. She had the real advantage of Zoltan
Solymosi as des Grieux. He is an absolutely secure partner  - strong,
sensitive  - and he made something ardently responsive of the young man's
infatuation.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: Moby Dick - Piccadilly Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moby Dick, or Save the Whale as it should be sub-titled, is so extraordinary
that you should go and see it at once just in case it fails to catch on.
Even if you don't like it, you will hardly regret the experience.
Quite the best thing about it is the staging, which has moments of sheer
brilliance and uninhibited fun. The Piccadilly is a largish theatre. The
stage for Moby Dick has been extended to include what must have been the
boxes in the royal and upper circles. Thus the production springs at you
from an enveloping semi-circle and does so at three levels: basic stage and
the two upper tiers. The fun starts even before the show proper begins.
Paper darts are casually launched at the audience from the top reaches of
Paul Farnsworth's set.
That is nothing, however, compared with the start of Act 2, by which time
the audience has been issued with those glasses that used to go with 3D
movies in the 1950s. There is then a spectacular show of small fairies,
paper darts and other less identifiable objects winging their way towards
you, beyond and back again. It may be no more than a brief theatrical
device, but it works like magic.
There are devices galore throughout, including a growing element of
suspense. Is the white whale, which so obsesses Captain Ahab, ever going to
appear, and how? It does, but I shall not tell you in what form, save to say
that it is a most wonderful coup, mounted even better than the storm that
has wracked the stage, and indeed much of the theatre, shortly before.
You may have guessed that this is not quite the Moby Dick of the novel. It
starts in the girls' academy of St Godley's, which is unashamedly drawn from
Ronald Searle's St Trinian's. The school is anarchic to say the least, and
going bust. It decides to put on a show in order to raise funds, a musical
of Herman Melville's book, which gives free ride to the girls' animal
spirits, but also produces the spirit of a team.
On first hearing, I had some doubts about the merits of the music by
Hereward Kaye and Robert Longden. It does not hang together in the sustained
way of the best of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Not all the words of the lyrics are
audible. Yet the style becomes catching as the show goes on: the second half
is much better than the first and 'Save the Whale' at the end had the first
night audience stomping.
The undoubted star in a team performance is Tony Monopoly as the
headmistress of St Godley's and as Captain Ahab. I'm not sure that all the
lines are good enough for him, though 'Obsession isn't just a perfume'
certainly is. Watch him singing, wearing large earrings, bouffant hair, a
dinner jacket, a long pantalon skirt and a huge cricket pad on his right leg
in place of the peg. There is a zest in the production that makes up for any
deficiencies in the script.
The flair for detail continues even after the show is over. A fleet of red
London double-decker buses is waiting outside the theatre to take the girls
back to St Godley's.
Cameron Mackintosh, producer and impresario, deserves credit for picking the
show up. It was performed, in a different version, at the Camden Jazz
Festival in 1983. It has been a long haul to get it right: it is not quite
right yet; but nearly.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Technology: Attracted by a taste of freedom - Why the open
systems movement has so many dedicated followers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVE MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Post Office is jumping on the 'open systems' bandwagon. It has
appointed Hewlett-Packard to supply its equipment, and over the next couple
of years intends to install Pounds 20m worth of Unix-based systems and
software to sit alongside its IBM infrastructure.
The Post Office expects to enjoy big economic benefits from the move  - a
reduction in capital expenditure, better performance from hardware
investments, and great flexibility, not least in delivering new applications
to its operating companies.
Three things are especially striking here:
First, the Post Office has developed an open IT strategy to control the
proliferation of Unix systems across the group. The strategy offers
technical coherence, without inhibiting the evident enthusiasm for, and
deliverability of, Unix-based systems.
Second, the Post Office has put itself through an exhausting formal
procurement process and selected a 'single strategic supplier' of open
systems hardware. In other words, the Post Office feels more secure in a
long-term partnership.
Third, it has joined a growing body of senior IT users  - BT, BP, Boots,
Unilever, DHL  - in a move which promises to deliver at last the
revolutionary potential of IT in business.
The seismic effects on the computer industry itself are well documented, not
least in the balance sheets of IBM and the rest of the proprietary world.
Their attempts to demonstrate credible open products and marketing
strategies prove the strength of the movement.
According to Simon Forge, principal consultant for CSC Index in Paris: 'Even
a year ago you could still argue that proprietary systems would go on
forever. But we are past the hype now. There is no longer a question about
the viability of open systems.'
Nick Earle, HP's computer systems marketing manager, says the shift was even
later. 'Suddenly in the last nine months, just enough has come together to
make open environments a reality  - and businesses are taking advantage of
it,' he argues.
But what exactly defines open systems? At its simplest, open systems implies
freedom of movement  - for software developers and users alike - in three
principal areas: portability, scalability and interoperability. Portability
means that you can run the same piece of software on computers from
different vendors. Scalability is running that software on machines of
different sizes. Interoperability allows diverse hardware software
components to work together, typically across a distributed network.
Progress is evident in each of these areas. Improvements in hardware price
performance, delivered increasingly by highly parallel architectures or
Risc-based processors, give unprecedented scalability. This in turn
encourages widespread 'downsizing'. As Earle points out, applications which
were once supported by a multimillion-pound mainframe investment now run
happily on processors, or across networks, costing just tens of thousands.
Similarly, there is movement on the standards front. The International
Standards process underpins much of this open systems initiative. Public
standards (most notably OSI Communications, and Posix, which defines calls
between an application and operating system) and industry-based standards
(X-Windows, XPG3, and the prospect of only two versions of Unix from the
Open Software Foundation and Unix International respectively) are slowly
maturing.
But this is only part of the story. Forge detects a new and highly pragmatic
attitude to open systems development. It cannot wait for the standards
process, he argues. A new consensus is also emerging which articulates open
systems as much in terms of basic computing trends  - desk-top hardware
performance, client-server architectures, complex distributed networks,
relational databases and sophisticated graphical user interfaces  - as in
any formal standards-making process.
As Norman Schofield, partner at PA Consulting argues, these technologies are
now 'sufficiently capable, cheap and reliable to take the weight of primary
responsibility for corporate information'. It is their convergence, within
the context of open systems, which promises not only to empower end-users,
but to make IT a real competitive force, arguably for the first time.
So this is where the real momentum is coming from. Users such as these have
finally appreciated that IT is not necessarily the expensive frustration of
long experience. Ironically, says John Spires, director of strategic
marketing at Oracle, the software developer, if anything business users have
'bought into' the open systems concept far beyond what can be delivered.
No doubt the true distributed, integrated computing environment remains a
thing of fantasy, but there is enough technology in place, enough
precedents, enough demonstrable benefits, to encourage the Post Office and
its peers.
Glen Peters, head of Price Waterhouse's open systems group, points to
striking economies at his client BP. As the company rolls out its
pan-European open systems infrastructure, savings have been made in
applications development costs and in the proportional cost of hardware to
total IT spend.
Similarly, Paul Livsey, deputy chairman of House of Fraser stores, says the
company's open strategy has given it the flexibility to develop new
applications at a fraction of their traditional cost. The group now has 'a
phenomenal basis for competition between suppliers', he says.
Unilever's experience is perhaps the most telling of all. It embraced open
systems at the end of 1990, and its goal was to 'create an application in
one Unilever company and use it in any of the other 499,' says Mike Johnson,
IT director.
Proprietary computing areas had frustrated the transfer of good ideas. With
those barriers broken, Johnson believes that over time the new regime will
increase Unilever's basic productivity by 'hundreds of millions of pounds'.
There are two stumbling blocks on this course, however. First, IT is getting
more complicated. In particular, multi-vendor environments throw the onus of
technical responsibility back to the users. This is why the Post Office
views its partnership with HP as an 'insurance policy'.
Second, there is the legacy of proprietary investment. Schofield believes
that it is 'criminal' for businesses to add to proprietary systems. But
moving inherited applications from a proprietary, often mainframe-oriented,
environment to a distributed open one represents not just a technical
complication but a business risk.
Migration methodologies are emerging to help manage this process, and their
common denominator is that an enterprise-wide information architecture  - in
essence a blueprint for constructing computing and telecommunications
applications and systems across the business  - is a prerequisite to moving
to open systems successfully. Similarly, as is the case at the Post Office
and Unilever, the view is that open system strategies must be tested in
purely business terms.
Not surprisingly, as Forge notes, the fastest, most determined uptake has
been in global businesses  - McDonald's, DHL, Federal Express  - where there
is an imperative to clone systems quickly. Conversely, where the mainframe
data centre is institutionalised  - in airline reservations systems, for
example  - there is less penetration.
Overall, Earle estimates that perhaps 30 per cent of businesses are
approaching open systems incrementally  - starting with a new application
such as a customer service system to prove the concept. The rest, he
suggests, are just watching and waiting. But, as Schofield argues, they
should not wait too long: 'The choice is to be a leader, an early follower,
or too late.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Smoke signals emerge on
EC tobacco curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The marketing and advertising world has received an unexpected boost from
Jacques Delors, the EC president.
In the past, Delors has been associated with threats to impose tight,
EC-wide restrictions on many areas of advertising and marketing.
But rather a different message came across at a meeting this month between
Delors and the European Publishers' Council (EPC), which groups 19 leading
newspaper and magazine publishers across Europe.
The most sensitive issue is proposed legislation to ban tobacco advertising
throughout the EC.
Health ministers, meeting in May, are expected to reject the plan although
the outcome could be different if Britain has a Labour government by then.
Curbs on tobacco promotion were originally expected to be followed by a ban
on alcohol advertising. Further legislation, threatening the advertising and
marketing of financial services, food labelling, motor vehicles, distance
selling, data protection and children's toys, has been pending.
But in London, Delors told the EPC: 'There is no question of tobacco today,
other areas tomorrow . . . Tobacco is a special case.' Delors added that
'subsidiarity will be used more and more, and the EC will intervene less and
less'.
The British Advertising Association believes that Delors has been persuaded
that self-regulation in line with national and cultural differences within
the EC member states is preferable to a blanket drive to harmonise
legislation throughout the Community.
However, the association remains cautious. Richard Wade, director general,
said: 'It will be interesting to see whether the new approach is applied to
directives at present being formulated.' Among the most important is the
directive on data protection, which as it stands could eliminate many of the
direct marketing activities currently conducted in the UK.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Microcomputer sales
revolution in store - A hard-sell approach to software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you buy a nuclear power plant from a catalogue or a jet airliner by
mail order? No more than you would buy a mainframe computer from a
supermarket, you might think.
Yet in less than a decade, microcomputers have increased in power and fallen
in cost to the point where machines with several times the power of
yesterday's mainframes are being piled high and sold cheap in superstores.
Computers have become commodities and are being marketed like soap powder,
cornflakes, or more accurately, like their simpler electronic cousins  -
audio equipment and video recorders.
The phenomenon began in the US a couple of years ago but the idea has now
spread to Europe. The first UK computer superstore, PC World in Croydon,
south London, opened earlier this year. Next week the Business Superstore,
the first in what is hoped to be a European chain of stores selling office
equipment including computer hardware and software, will open in west
London. A second is already planned for Colindale, north west London.
Martin Nielsen, Business Superstore chief executive, has spent a year
researching ways to give the Business Superstores a European look.
CompUSA's store in Dallas, Texas, the first of its chain of more than 20
throughout the US, is typical. A large, low structure on the outskirts of
the town, its interior is laid out more like a grocery store than a high
technology dealership.
A scattering of red-shirted sales assistants give advice when asked. The
aisles are lined with processors, monitors, disk drives and keyboards.
Microcomputer software is piled up like packets of soup. Cardboard boxes
full of hardware form impromptu islands amid the sea of electronic goodies.
Prices are keen; in some cases up to 80 per cent below manufacturer's
suggested retail prices.
Nielsen, a 40-year-old veteran of international retailing, aims for an
approach which, he says, respects the technology. The Business Superstore
will pay attention to colour, lighting and decor in a way foreign to its US
equivalents.
Computer superstores are part of a revolution in the distribution of
computing products. Ten years ago, the economics of the full-line
manufacturer held sway. The microcomputer business was embryonic; the
computer industry sold mainframes with a price tag of Dollars 1m (Pounds
578,000) upwards and minicomputers costing from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars
1m. The gross profit margins on sales of such systems were large  - at least
70 per cent and sometimes 90 per cent or more.
The computer industry justified such prices by providing customers with a
complete before-and-after sales service. An information technology strategy
might have to be concocted. Special software might have to be written.
Training would have to be organised.
Today's microcomputers are as effective as minicomputers, yet cost only a
fraction of the price  - say, Dollars 5,000 comparedwith Dollars 150,000.
The gross margin is low  - 40 per cent or less. Competition between
manufacturers is forcing prices down sharply  - between 25 and 40 per cent
last year.
Computer manufacturers realised early on that they could not distribute
microcomputers economically using their direct sales forces. From the
beginning they used distributors, dealers and value added resellers  -
dealers with the expertise to develop software for their customers.
Now the rapidly declining prices and margins are hacking away at the
profitability of distributors and the less sophisticated dealerships. There
are two principal options for survival; selling in volume with tiny profit
margins, as exemplified by the superstores, or finding ways to add value to
the basic hardware through software and systems integration.
There is already a broad set of variations on the superstore theme in the
US. An example is the warehouse club which requires customers to be members
but which offers a range of products in their original cardboard cartons at
exceptionally low prices  - profit margins of only a few per cent are
typical. There is no sales support, training or technological expertise
available.
According to Personal Technology Research, a US marketing company, more than
52 per cent of personal computer sales will go through retailers by 1995.
In 1990, sales of computers and related products through computer
superstores reached Dollars 1.15bn compared with Dollars 700m for warehouse
clubs.
CompUSA reckons to be the leading operator of large format computer
superstores in the US. Last year it had sales per store ranging from Dollars
22m to Dollars 80m.
But it is proving a precarious business, with operating income in good years
averaging 1 to 2 per cent of sales. In the three years since the company has
been trading as CompUSA, it has not made an overall profit.
Business Superstore in the UK hopes to avoid CompUSA's tough financial
experience although Nielson accepts that with more than Dollars 5m invested
to date, it will take time for the business to break even.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour seems rosier from the other side of
the globe - View from: Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND Battle of Britain it may look in London, but in Tokyo no one
seems overly concerned about who wins it. Newspaper coverage of Britain's
general election campaign has been scant, with Japanese-language editorial
comment missing altogether. Even well-informed Japanese seem utterly relaxed
about the possibility of a Labour victory.
This is, at first glance, surprising. Japan had something of a love affair
with Mrs Margaret Thatcher and on almost every front Britain is Japan's most
important partner in Europe. Britain is a big recipient of Japanese direct
investment, and under the Tories the two nations have seen eye-to-eye on a
broad range of political and trade issues.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Japan has sought to promote a
tri-polar view of the world  - with Japan, the US and Europe sharing
leadership. 'This view is best understood by the British  - rather than by
France or Germany,' says a Japanese foreign ministry official who was a
student in Britain.
If the relationship is so important to Japan, why is the prospect of a
change in government not more worrying? The short answer is that Labour,
from halfway round the globe, does not look so fearsome.
Mr Taizo Nishimuro, general manager at electronics company Toshiba, says:
'As a company which has large investments in the UK, we feel that the basic
attitude to Japanese investment will not change drastically, notwithstanding
the election result.'
This needs to be put into perspective. Japanese people in Britain under the
Labour government of the late 1970s were appalled by what they saw -
declining living standards, materials shortages, disruptive strikes. Mrs
Thatcher remains something of a folk hero in Japan for having cured the
British disease  - a reputation untarnished by the recession.
Professor Hidekazu Kawai, a specialist on British politics at Gakushuin
University, says: 'Most Japanese believe the British people are still
enthusiastic supporters of Mrs Thatcher.' Yet even informed Japanese, who
know that Mrs Thatcher has lost her political influence, believe much of her
legacy  - the strengthening of market-based institutions, trimmed power of
unions, the privatisations  - will survive intact, regardless of who wins
the election.
While the debates over taxation, economic policy, or social welfare are real
enough, from a long distance they look like much huff and puff over small
disagreements. It is a battle for the moderate middle ground and, to the
Japanese at least, it is not  - as Mr Major tried to portray it  - a choice
between socialism and the market.
'This is not a referendum on the Tories for their past 13 years in
government,' says the foreign ministry official. It is rather a question of
who best can run the government.
This is not to say there are no doubts at all. The Japanese government has
been genuinely impressed by Mr Major's confident performance in foreign
affairs, particularly in regard to Europe. On the other hand, the foreign
ministry official says: 'We do not know very much about Mr Kinnock.'
Mr Taida Hidea, who managed the London operation of Marubeni, the trading
company, from 1977 to 1983, and is now general manager of international
corporate planning, says: 'I am just concerned, if Labour wins, that there
not be a drastic change in economic policy.' This, he says, could
potentially affect Japanese investment in Britain.
Mr Nishimuro says Toshiba is confident it can retain good relations with the
EETPU electricians' union at its factory in Plymouth regardless of any
changes in government policy. His only concern is that the social welfare
costs of operating in Britain do not rise steeply. However, he points out
that this has nothing to do with Toshiba's Japanese ownership and he thinks
it probably won't happen.
If there is residual fear of a Labour government it is a fear of change, of
the unknown, rather than objections to Labour or its policies.
Labour has made successful efforts to win friends. The party has repeatedly
assured Japanese diplomats that it would place a high priority on
maintaining close relations with Japan and that there would be no change in
policy.
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, visited Tokyo in 1990 and made a
broadly positive impression. Mr Taida, who met Mr Smith briefly at the time,
says: 'I think we can believe him.'
Underpinning all these views is a deep respect for, and even envy of, the
British parliamentary system, where a change in governing party is seen as a
healthy sign that democracy survives. In Japan  - where the Liberal
Democratic Party has been in power since 1955 and opposition parties offer
no credible alternative  - this seems inconceivable.
Plainly, many Japanese people have accepted one of Labour's basic messages:
that it is a credible candidate to govern Britain.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Battle will be critical and unpredictable -
London: The race in the capital will be closely watched as several seats may
buck the national trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for votes across London's 84 parliamentary constituencies, which
have the greatest concentration of voters and marginal seats in Britain,
will be critical, colourful and unpredictable.
London's capacity to shock and surprise has added a piquancy to local and
national elections for years, and April 9 is likely to maintain the
tradition. The outcome of a fight stretching from Enfield to Croydon, from
Uxbridge to Upminster, will be crucial in determining the identity of the
next government.
Labour has not won a London seat from the Tories in a general election since
Millie Miller snatched Ilford North nearly 18 years ago. The party needs to
win between 15 and 20 if its hopes of forming the next government are to be
met.
It is a tall order. However, the three elections since 1974, which have
shrunk Labour's representation in the region from 51 to just 23, have left
plenty of marginal seats in Tory hands, and a 7-8 per cent capital-wide
swing should bring Labour the gains it needs. This, together with the
likelihood that several seats will move against national trends, explains
why the race in London will be watched so closely.
Will the Conservatives, who have 58 London seats, hold yuppified but
heavily-mortgaged Battersea, and even snatch Labour Tooting? Will they lose
Croydon North-West, to which many traditional inner-city Labour voters have
migrated?
Can the Liberal Democrats keep their only London seat in Southwark and
Bermondsey, and perhaps double their tally through the addition of Richmond
and Barnes? Will the voters of Greenwich and Woolwich deliver the coup de
grace to the twitching corpse of the Social Democrats?
Is Mr Ken Livingstone, the former Greater London Council leader, safe in
Brent East? Can Ms Glenda Jackson win rave reviews for Labour in Tory
Hampstead and Highgate?
Labour claims that polls and canvass returns put the party on the threshold
of the swing it needs, but in some respects the deck seems to be stacked
against it.
There is real concern that the party's task will be made harder by the fall
in numbers on London's electoral registers. A disproportionate number of
poll tax fugitives are thought to be likely Labour supporters.
The party may again pay the price  - as it did in 1987  - for the 'loony
left' image of some local authorities. Labour officials are confident the
dragon has been slain, through a clampdown on extremism and a big effort to
rebuild the party's reputation in the capital, but the auguries of the 1990
council elections are not altogether positive.
In spite of the widespread unpopularity of the poll tax, Labour only managed
a swing of some 5 per cent across the capital, against 11 per cent
nationally. Heavy defeats in Wandsworth and Westminster, and losses in
Hillingdon, Brent and Ealing, eclipsed more pleasing victories elsewhere.
Council by-election results since have further underlined the scale of the
mountain Labour has to climb.
But the Labour campaign has at least 'hit the ground running', in the words
of Mr Bryan Gould, London campaign supremo. Showing commendable diligence in
the contest's early days, the party claims to have already interviewed up to
40 per cent of voters in many constituencies.
It also has a recession to exploit. Unemployment and house repossessions
have hit the relatively affluent south-east especially hard over the past
year or so.
Unemployment will top the local agenda today when a visit employment
secretary, coincides with the release of monthly jobless figures.
The party's London campaign team will endeavour to keep it there  - along
with health, transport, the economy generally and the party's plans the
capital. With polls suggesting that seven in 10 Londoners want an elected
authority for their city, this is widely seen as a potential trump card.
The Tories today begin their attempts to disarm this and other Labour
weapons in the capital with the launch of a London manifesto. The document
includes plans for a minister for London transport and a cabinet
sub-committee to co-ordinate ministerial efforts for improving life in
London.
Besides outlining its alternative, the party will attack Labour's proposed
authority as an embryonic GLC. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary,
has described Labour's plans as 'expensive and divisive'.
The Tories also plan to hit back at Labour horror stories about the National
Health Service, transport and education, with detailed spending and
performance statistics purporting to show an improvement in the overall
picture.
Officials say the party will continue to supply 'young men in white coats'
to local television programmes to spread the Tory message on health, in the
belief that voters' personal experience of local facilities is at the root
of most concerns on the subject.
The extent of Labour inroads may be further limited by the number of
high-profile Tory candidates defending marginal seats. For example, the
prospects in Lewisham West of Mr John Maples, junior Treasury minister, may
be improved by frequent media appearances as a party spokesman.
The Liberal Democrats will focus a large slice of their comparatively meagre
resources on keeping what they hold: namely Mr Simon Hughes, MP for
Southwark and Bermondsey. They are also optimistic of gaining ground in a
limited number of constituencies where they have strong council
representation.
This includes Tory-held Richmond and Barnes and Labour Bow and Poplar. The
party also has its eye on Conservative seats in Twickenham, held by Mr Toby
Jessel and, more ambitiously, Sutton and Cheam, where Lady Olga Maitland is
standing as the Tory candidate.
Transport and pollution will figure prominently in the Liberal Democrat
campaign. The party will also hammer away at the message that Labour is not
alone in offering a strategic London authority, and that the Liberal
Democrat version will be partly funded by locally-raised taxes.
Mr Hughes said members of the authority would be elected by the single
transferable vote system of proportional representation, using the same
constituency boundaries as in a general election.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Avoiding holes in the doughnut theory -
Essex: Paddy Ashdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER HAS so much been staked on Essex man as when Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, visited Brentwood yesterday.
'Essex is going to lead the way towards the new politics that Britain
wants,' Mr Ashdown told the media scrum outside a local training centre. He
was determined not to be squeezed  - either physically by journalists or by
the Labour and Tory parties.
Mr Ashdown's tactic is to exude Churchillian confidence, of the 'go back to
your constituencies and prepare for government' variety of Sir David Steel,
former Liberal leader. 'Essex people'  - as described by Ms Elizabeth
Bottomley, Liberal Democrat candidate in Brentwood and Ongar  - were
buoyant, but not that buoyant.
Liberal Democrats have no MPs in Essex; the smallest Tory majority on Mr
Ashdown's tour of the county yesterday was almost 14,000.
As the Liberal Democrat roadshow hit Colchester  - photo opportunity No 2,
as set out in a briefing note  - Mr Ashdown pulled enough crowds to block
the High Street.
'Where is the hope?' he asked of the Labour and Tory manifestos in a
prearranged impromptu sound bite for lunchtime TV. 'What does he mean,
'Where is the Pope'?' asked a male shopper at the rear.
Setting off across the road to begin a Royal Marine-style yomp around the
shops, a builder shouted from his van: 'I would have laid down my coat if it
had been Mrs Thatcher.'
Pensioners and shoppers were brushed aside, and television camera crews
struggled to keep up. 'It's an experience,' said one elderly lady innocently
as she was pinned against the wall.
Crowding into a bakery, a local activist shouted: 'Is the election going to
be a piece of cake?'
Mr Ashdown searched, in vain, for the apposite riposte. 'We are the jam at
the centre of the doughnut,' he declared finally. Watch out, the squeeze
could be messy.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sharp rise in jobless may damage Major's
prospects - Unemployment: Whichever party wins the election will have to
face mounting figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT has haunted British governments of both parties since the
1970s. It was one of the issues on which Mrs Margaret Thatcher won power in
1979, though it proved no obstacle to her re-election in 1983 or 1987. Mr
John Major may not be so lucky.
Today, government figures will confirm that unemployment is rising faster
than it was in October when Mr Major flirted with calling an election.
Government figures put the total out of work at 2.6m in January  - 9.2 per
cent of the workforce. City economists expect February's total to rise by at
least 35,000.
More worrying for the government, unemployment is rising fastest in the
south-east and Midlands where many Tory marginals are clustered.
Unemployment was higher in both 1983 and 1987 but it is rising more quickly
now  - twice as fast over the past year as in the 12 months before the 1983
election.
The number of voters worried about losing jobs, homes and security is much
larger than the number of unemployed themselves. In any case, 50 per cent of
people who become unemployed find jobs within three months.
Tory poll readings reached rock-bottom in 1981 when unemployment was rising
fastest, even though the jobless figures carried on rising for another five
years. In 1987, when the Thatcher government's popularity reached its
pre-election peak, unemployment was only marginally below 3m, but it had
been falling for almost a year.
For many voters in marginals in the south, the fear engendered by the
current recession is a new and frightening experience  - unemployment is
rising as never before among service-sector and professional employees in
the south-east who once believed they were immune.
Unemployment is no longer something that happens only to Labour-voting
manual workers in the north. It has risen by 386,000 in the past year in the
south  - where the Tories hold 66 of their 139 most marginal seats.
This is more than three times as fast as in 1983. The north, with a mere 14
marginals, has seen a rise of only 52,000  - albeit from a higher base  - at
half the rate of the south.
The Conservatives appear surprisingly unflustered by rising unemployment  -
Mr Norman Lamont said unemployment was 'a price worth paying' for low
inflation.
The evidence does suggest that Britain's pay-setting system requires the
discipline of unemployment: when unemployment hit its post-war peak of 3.2m
in 1986, inflation was at a 20-year low; over the next 44 months
unemployment halved and inflation rose to a peak of 10.9 per cent.
The government can argue that the 1983 and 1987 general elections proved
voters would support the party they believe to have the broadest competence
in economic management  - the Tories  - and not the party with the greatest
concern for the unemployed  - Labour. Rising unemployment in Tory heartlands
need not change this. Traditional Tory voters may continue to believe that
Majorism is the best hope for the economy, and thus for their unemployed
neighbour.
Yet as the campaign develops, the Tories may suffer from the relatively low
priority they have given to reducing unemployment since it started rising
again in 1989. In real terms, the government is spending a fifth less on
tackling unemployment than it did in 1986-87.
Deregulation has been the basic Tory answer to unemployment and if the party
wins it will offer more of the same. But easing hire and fire regulations
has cut both ways, creating jobs quickly as the economy expands yet losing
the jobs rapidly in recession.
Labour makes no specific pledges on cutting the number of unemployed, unlike
the Liberal Democrats who are promising a 600,000 reduction over two years.
However, it has promised to eliminate long-term unemployment  - people
unemployed for a year or more, currently a third of the total  - within one
parliament, and says guaranteeing unemployed person a job or training place
after six months can soon be self-financing.
Labour's short-term programme to boost training and combat unemployment will
cost Pounds 800m. This will include restoring government cuts to Employment
Training and Youth Training, and establishing a new work-experience
programme which will pay the going 'rate for the job'.
However, independent studies estimate that its proposed minimum wage of half
of median male earnings will reduce employment by upwards of 100,000, mainly
among women and the young.
Whoever wins, unemployment is likely to top 3m later this year and, judging
by French experience in the European exchange rate mechanism, it could
remain close to 2m for a number of years after economic growth resumes.
The new employment secretary will be announcing repeated increases in
unemployment for many months. The Tories have had a decade of practice; for
Labour it could prove a rude awakening to the impotence of political power.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Risky seats win Olympian cash gifts -
North-West: The region's electoral importance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE government could be accused of trying to bribe any group of voters
close to the election, those in north-west England are a likely nomination.
The Pounds 55m for the Manchester-led bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, Pounds
50m to improve areas near Olympic sites and Pounds 27m for the Halle
orchestra's new concert hall emphasised the region's electoral importance.
It contains more than 20 of the Conservatives' 100 most vulnerable seats,
the largest number of any region other than London. Labour has 38 of the
north-west's 79 constituencies, the Conservatives have 37 and the Liberal
Democrats four.
To win an overall majority Labour needs a nationwide swing of about 8 per
cent. In north-west England this would give it 19 Tory seats. Davyhulme,
which is held by Mr Winston Churchill, would fall at 8.1 per cent and
Blackpool North at 8.5 per cent. Mr Kinnock will need such gains to realise
his hopes of a 20-seat working majority.
The region is the UK's second biggest after London and the south-east, and
accounts for a tenth of gross domestic product. Generally, Labour holds the
inner cities and towns, while the Tories are safest in places such as
Crosby, Wirral West and Wirral South on Merseyside, Macclesfield, Eddisbury,
Congleton and Tatton in Cheshire, and Fylde in Lancashire.
Wallasey has the smallest majority of any Tory seat in the region. Mrs Lynda
Chalker, the overseas development minister, won by only 279 votes in 1987.
There is a cluster of nine marginals in Greater Manchester and north-east
Lancashire. In places like Hyndburn and the Rossendale Valley, working-class
owner-occupation is high but the mainly terraced houses formerly enjoyed low
rates. Thousands who voted Conservative in such marginal constituencies in
1987 have been poll-tax losers.
The marginals with the region's worst unemployment are in the Wirral and
Chester travel-to-work area, where nearly 26,000 were jobless at Christmas -
a rate of 12.2 per cent. The Tories are at risk here in both the city of
Chester and in Ellesmere Port and Neston, as well as in Delyn on the Welsh
bank of the River Dee.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Secret players in the campaign - Securit:
Efforts to thwart the IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the most secretive issue of the campaign, but politicians can ill
afford to ignore it.
Just over two weeks ago the IRA served notice that it would try to disrupt
the general election. Within days a bomb on a south London railway track
disrupted commuters on Budget day.
It is thought that at least one terrorist cell could still be at large on
the mainland. Senior police officers say there is no room for complacency,
particularly given the IRA's past record of singling out politicians as
targets.
The plain clothes special branch officers openly shadowing senior
politicians are only the most visible aspect of the security operation.
Foremost behind the scenes is the Metropolitan Police's Anti-Terrorist Squad
(S013), responsible for tracking IRA intentions and movements in
co-ordination with other departments including M15, M16 and the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
One Conservative party official said: 'We are in the hands of the police.
Details of an itinerary are released only the day before and only in terms
of a general area. The specific location is given out only a few hours
before.'
The aim is to keep to a minimum the time an IRA hit squad might have to
organise an attack on a target.
So restricted is knowledge of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's schedule that when
local party officials tacked the red carpet down on what turned out to be
the wrong part of an Isle of Wight wharf last week it was widely interpreted
as an attempt to wrong-foot terrorists.
'There is a fine line to be drawn between our need to protect potential
targets and the party's need not to have a politician's access to the public
too restricted,' says a senior police chief.
According to one security expert the election campaign is putting huge
organisational strain on the police force.
'There is not a hope in hell of protecting everybody,' he says, 'and even
keeping up with the main players in the campaign is going to prove a real
headache.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories look to capitalise on 'new' outlook -
North-East: The region remains a Labour heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN'S Sunderland plant, exporting cars to Japan; the derelict Teesside
land where Mrs Margaret Thatcher took her 1987 'walk in the wilderness',
redeveloped for service industries; these are symbols on which the
Conservatives will seek to capitalise in the fight to keep their four
north-east England seats.
'The NEW North East', proclaimed from government-funded Development
Corporation hoardings, will be a recurrent Tory theme in this Labour
heartland.
'The region's changing; we've moved away from the smokestack industries. It
has new businesses, new industries, it's breaking down socially  - there are
fewer Andy Capps,' says Darlington MP Mr Michael Fallon, the only minister
with a seat in the 30 constituencies between the Scottish border and North
Yorkshire.
Mr Neville Trotter, Tynemouth's Tory MP since 1974, insists: 'As people move
away from the highly unionised old industry, they are becoming much more in
line with the rest of the country.'
The north-east has undergone profound change. The proportion of the
workforce employed in coal, steel and shipbuilding has shrunk from one third
to 2.5 per cent. Its environment has improved as heavy industry has
dwindled. High crime levels aside, the region arguably offers a quality of
life unsurpassed in the UK for those fortunate enough to be in well-paid,
secure jobs.
The Tories need good news in a region where a 2.5 per cent swing to Labour
would cost them not only Stockton South, held by Mr Tim Devlin in 1987 by
just 774 votes, but also Tynemouth (majority 2,583) and Darlington (majority
2,661).
Even Hexham (majority 8,066), the only north-east seat which has been Tory
since 1945, has difficulties  - it entered the campaign without a candidate
after the resignation of MP Mr Alan Amos.
North-east Tories are a dogged bunch; it takes more conviction to be a
Conservative in Easington than Esher. In many respects Labour is the
region's establishment.
Academic observers, such as Professor John Goddard of Newcastle University's
Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies, dispute the Tories'
assertion that industrial change equals political change. 'I don't think
there's a one-to-one relationship between the two,' says Prof Goddard. 'The
history of this region is deep-seated. Traditional values are still there.'
Mr Andrew MacMullen, lecturer in politics at Durham University, says Labour
continues to enjoy strong cross-class support.
This year's 'state of the region' report by the Labour-dominated Northern
Region Councils Association says the area has fewer clerical, managerial and
professional workers than the national average, lower household incomes and
England's lowest proportion of those aged 16 and over in education. The
region still has mainland Britain's highest unemployment rate.
Tories argue that Labour would jeopardise the progress made. Privately they
hope that, having suffered an above-average 7 per cent regional swing
against them in 1987, any swing this time will be far smaller.
In Stockton South, a three-way marginal, Mr Devlin's strongest chance lies
in the decision of ex-Labour and ex-SDP MP Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, narrowly
defeated in 1987, not to stand this time. In Darlington, Mr Fallon's status
as schools minister may help him, though his strident views may cost him
votes. Both he and his Labour opponent, Mr Alan Milburn, have intellectual
bite and a taste for a fight.
In Tynemouth, the Tories will attack the spending of Labour-controlled North
Tyneside Council: Labour candidate Mr Paddy Cosgrove is a member.
The constituency's Meadow Well Estate, scene of riots last year, could be an
electoral liability for Mr Cosgrove or Mr Trotter. Apart from a criminal
element and feckless parenting, Mr Trotter traces the Meadow Well's
difficulties to the loss of jobs in fisheries after the 1970s 'Cod Wars' and
shipbuilding's move to high technology. In the new north-east, the past
keeps breaking through.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Labour Manifesto): Recovery tops the
agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour says it would build the economy, modernise the National Health
Service and raise the standards in schools. It also stresses a commitment to
constitutional reform. But its central theme is partnership between
government, business and the citizen. Manifesto highlights are:
National recovery
TODAY, millions of people fear losing their jobs, their homes or their
business.
The new Labour government's National Recovery Programme will start to remove
that fear, with immediate action on investment, jobs and training. It will
combat recession now and build sustained and sustainable recovery for the
future.
We will provide enhanced capital allowances to encourage companies
immediately to bring forward manufacturing investment in new machinery and
plant, innovation and design. They will last for a limited period.
We will introduce an investment tax incentive tailored to the special needs
of small businesses.
We will immediately begin the phased release of receipts from the sale of
council houses, land and property to allow local authorities to build new
homes and improve old ones.
We will allow British Rail to proceed with a leasing scheme of 188 new
Networker trains on the North Kent line - the first step in securing private
investment to help modernise Britain's railways and protect our environment.
Housing investment will generate jobs. We will also establish a work
programme, combining three days' a week work for the unemployed.
We will restore last year's training cuts which caused so much damage to
training for young people and the unemployed. We will establish a new
cash-limited 'Skills for the 90s' fund, with an initial budget of Pounds
300m to upgrade the training of those in work. Investment will be targeted
particularly at areas of skill shortages.
Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least Pounds 600m will
be available for investment in education. Among other projects, this will
help to tackle equipment shortages and the backlog of school repairs.
Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least Pounds 1bn will be
available for investment in the National Health Service.
We will extend the exemption from tax which applies to workplace nurseries
to all forms of employer assistance with childcare.
The economy
Labour's economic policy rests on one simple, common sense fact. The only
way for Britain to build a strong economy is to make the goods and services
which people at home and abroad want to buy.
Business needs sustained and balanced growth, stable exchange rates, steady
and competitive interest rates and low inflation. We will deliver them.
To curb inflation, Labour will maintain the value of the pound within the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism. We will manage credit sensibly. We will
stop excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones, transport and
NHS prescriptions.
Taxes and benefits
We will introduce fair taxes. The most effective way to reduce poverty
quickly is to increase child benefit and pensions and take low-paid people
out of taxation. To achieve these goals, we will reform the national
insurance and income tax system.
We will increase child benefit to Pounds 9.95 a week for all children, with
the full value going to every family.
We will increase the basic retirement pension by an extra Pounds 5 a week
for a single person and Pounds 8 for a married couple.
We will abolish the 2 per cent national insurance contribution on earnings
under Pounds 54 a week  - effectively a Pounds 56 annual entry fee into the
national insurance system.
We will take 740,000 taxpayers out of taxation altogether, by increasing the
personal allowance and wife's earned income allowance by more than
inflation. Married couples will have the option of splitting the married
couple's allowance between them as they choose.
The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged at 25 per cent, as will the 40
per cent rate. A new top-rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to
individuals with an income of at least Pounds 40,000.
Labour's tax and benefit changes are self-financing. They are fair. And they
will make every individual employee on earnings up to at least Pounds 22,000
a year better off.
State of the nation
Every autumn, we will make a State of the Nation report on the British
economy.
In order to provide honest information about the state of the British
economy, we will make the Central Statistical Office independent.
We are determined to make a swift reduction in unemployment by immediate
action for unemployed people, as well as direct investment, to create
thousands of new jobs.
Investment
An Investment Decade for Britain will start with the immediate introduction
of enhanced investment allowances. We will help Britain's high-technology
industries with a 25 per cent tax credit for additional investment in
research and development. Small firms will be assisted with a new investment
scheme, combining a cash-limited fund for new investments with tax
incentives tailored to their special needs.
Labour will work with industry to establish British Technology Enterprise
and create Technology Trusts throughout Britain, helping firms turn good
ideas into commercial products.
Labour's Minister for Science will develop a national strategy to promote
high-quality science and technology.
Regions
We will strengthen our regional economies. We will establish new Regional
Development Agencies in England, strengthen Scottish Enterprise and the
Welsh Development Agency and modernise regional incentives.
Labour's National Investment Bank, operating on strictly commercial lines,
will bring public and private sector together to invest in long-term
regional and national infrastructure projects.
Small and growing businesses will have a new deal. As well as the lowest
possible interest rates, they need the backing on which their competitors
can rely in France and Germany. Labour will establish a network of one-stop
advice centres. We will give special attention to the establishment of small
businesses by women, and members of the ethnic minority communities.
Transport
We will invest in modern transport. It is absurd that French Railways can
raise funds for new investment in the City of London, when British Rail is
not allowed to do so. We will remove these restrictions. Leasing schemes
will allow large-scale investments to be financed at relatively little cost
to the public sector borrowing requirement. Private finance will also be
mobilised for a high-speed rail network which will eventually link every
region to the Channel tunnel, with proper environmental safeguards.
Energy
We will improve energy supplies. Britain is well placed with reserves of
coal, oil and gas which must be husbanded in a national energy policy. We
will encourage enhanced recovery of oil from the North Sea and avoid
becoming over-dependent on imported fuel. We will meet our international
obligations to reduce harmful chimney emissions.
We will restore public control of the National Grid and give it new duties
and powers to ensure the long-term security of electricity supplies. We will
secure the long-term future of the coal industry by reducing imports,
stopping the 'dash for gas' and reining back on open-casting. We will retain
the Department of Energy and move its petroleum engineering directorate to
Aberdeen.
A critical task is to upgrade the skills of people in work. Training and
Enterprise Councils will be retained.
Employment
There will be a fair framework of law for both employers and unions. There
will be no return to the trade union legislation of the 1970s. Ballots
before strikes and for union elections will stay. There will be no mass or
flying pickets. But our individual employees are entitled to be treated at
least as fairly as their colleagues in Europe.
We will opt in to the Social Chapter of the new European Treaty and
introduce employment standards common in successful economies.
We will give all employees equal rights and status under the law. We aim to
guarantee every woman in employment the right to 14 weeks' maternity leave
on full pay, and to give fathers paternity leave.
Employees will have new rights to be consulted and informed about decisions
which affect them, as well as the right to union membership and
representation. We will restore union rights at GCHQ.
We will end the scandal of poverty pay and bring Britain into line with the
rest of Europe by introducing a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an
hour.
Employees should have the opportunity to own collectively a significant
stake in the company for which they work, through a democratic Employee
Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) or a co-operative. We will strengthen support
for such schemes.
Recent pension fund scandals have shown how right Labour has been to call
for stronger legal protection. We will reform the law so that pension funds
belong to their members, not to employers. Half of the pension trustees will
be employees, with an independent chairman, and pensioners will be
represented.
Health
This election will decide the future of the National Health Service. Indeed,
it will decide whether or not we continue to have an NHS of the kind that
the British people want.
Labour will stop the privatisation of the NHS and return opted-out hospitals
and other services to the local NHS. We will halt the commercial market
which is creating a two-tier health service.
We will make additional resources of at least Pounds 1bn available for
investment in the NHS over the next 22 months. Each year thereafter, we will
continue to tackle underfunding.
Labour will recognise the additional claims on the NHS from the growing
number of very elderly people and the development of medical technology and
knowledge. We will retain the pay review bodies.
We will also launch a new programme to invest Pounds 60m in the
modernisation of Britain's cancer services, using the resources we will save
by scrapping the Conservatives' tax handout on private medical insurance.
Within our overall budget, we will tackle the shortage of intensive care
beds with a special programme providing an additional Pounds 25m to expand
this life-saving service.
We will set new targets to cut the inequalities in health between social
classes and ethnic groups. We will, for instance, strengthen screening by
restoring the free eye test.
GPs
GPs have a vital role to play in health promotion. We will increase the time
they have for each patient by reversing the financial pressures to take on
too many patients.
To achieve this change of direction, we will negotiate performance
agreements with each health authority and back them with an incentive fund
to reward authorities which perform well.
We will restore the right of patients to be treated in the hospital of their
choice. Women will have the right to be seen by a woman GP.
We will invest Pounds 25m from within our overall budget to purchase several
hundred more new, fully equipped ambulances.
Schools
Labour will modernise Britain's schools. Over the next 22 months, additional
resources of at least Pounds 600m will be made available for investment in
education. We will then continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's
national wealth invested in education.
We will offer nursery education to three- and four-year olds. Within six
months, every local education authority will have to set targets for
steadily increasing nursery and childcare services.
Teachers will be guaranteed a proper salary and career structure. A General
Teaching Council for England and Wales will help them achieve the highest
professional standards.
Within 12 months, we will end the scandal of primary school classes of over
40 children.
Nine out of 10 children of secondary school age are in comprehensive
schools. We will end selection at 11 where it still exists. We will
introduce a fairer system for all school reorganisations, with independent
public inquiries.
We will phase out the assisted places scheme (without affecting pupils
currently on a place, or offered one.
Because the national curriculum cannot be properly taught without new
textbooks, we will earmark funds for class and library books. We will start
this year by giving every primary school Pounds 10 per child for investment
in books.
We will start to tackle the backlog of school repairs. For instance, we will
invest Pounds 30m to ensure that within 12 months, no child has to use an
outside lavatory.
Conservative plans to privatise the schools' inspectorate will be scrapped.
Our Education Standards Commission, together with Her Majesty's Inspectors,
will monitor the performance of every school. If a school is
underperforming, the commission, which will be answerable to parliament,
will have the powers to ensure that it is brought up to standard.
Awards
National Awards, similar to the Queen's Award for Industry, will encourage
excellence in schools.
We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local management of
schools. All schools will be free to manage their day-to-day budgets, with
local education authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out schools
will be freed from central government control and, together with City
Technology Colleges, brought into the mainstream of the local school system.
Home-school contracts will tell parents exactly what the school undertakes
to deliver and what their responsibilities are. If they are dissatisfied
with the school or education authority, they will be able to call in the
Education Standards Commission and get action taken.
We wish to see the key role of church and other voluntary-aided schools
secured and available equally and on the same criteria to all religions.
Curriculum
Labour will modernise the national curriculum and apply it in all schools.
From the age of 14, pupils will study five essential subjects: English,
mathematics, science, a modern language and technology. Every pupil will
also be offered a wide range of academic, technical and other options.
We will establish a five-subject A-level and bring it together with
technical qualifications into our new Advanced Certificate. Open to
part-time and full-time students of any age, it will include 'credits' which
can be transferred between different institutions.
Traineeship
Sixteen-year-olds not in full-time education will be entitled to a new
traineeship lasting for up to two years, with an option of a further two
years. Every young person in employment will be guaranteed the right to
Learn While You Earn.
The student loan scheme deters many bright youngsters from poor families. We
will replace it with a fairer system of student grants and targeted help for
housing and vacation hardship. We will take effective steps to safeguard
standards throughout higher education.
We will stop the Conservatives' adult education cuts.
Families
Britain's families deserve the support which families receive in other
European countries.
We will increase child benefit for 7m families. Higher pensions and related
benefits will benefit another 12m people. We will reform the tax and
national insurance system and take 740,000 people out of tax altogether.
After the first year's extra increases, we will restore the link between
increases in the basic pension and prices or earnings, whichever is higher.
Britain's national insurance system is far more efficient than private
insurance. We will explore ways of opening it up to new groups such as
low-paid and part-time workers.
Parents
Labour will end the Conservatives' freeze on benefits for widowed mothers
and other lone parents. We will encourage parents on income support to claim
maintenance by allowing them to keep part of it before benefit is cut.
We will restore nutritional guidelines for school meals and reverse the cuts
in free school meals as soon as possible.
As resources allow, we will improve and extend the invalid care allowance.
Labour will develop a flexible decade of retirement between the ages of 60
and 70, so that men and women can choose to retire on a full pension or
continue in work without discrimination.
Our new National Pensions Plan, building on the State Earnings Related
Pension Scheme, will offer people now in work a pension based on their 20
best years' earnings. Those who are self- employed will also be able to
join. Occupational and personal pension schemes will have to guarantee a
minimum pension before they can contract out, and guarantee equal treatment
for men and women.
We will reform means-tested benefits, replace the Social Fund, and restore
benefit rights to 16 and 17-year-olds as soon as possible. To relieve
anxiety about funeral costs, we will make a funeral payment of Pounds 600
available on request. The costs will in most cases be recovered from the
deceased's estate, although small estates will be disregarded.
Poll tax
Labour will abolish the poll tax immediately. We will replace it with our
Fair Rates system, related to people's ability to pay. We reject the
Conservatives' unfair banding and discount system which would create a
property poll tax. We will modernise the valuation system to ensure that
properties are fairly assessed.
Abolition of the minimum 20 per cent contribution  - which will be of
particular help to young people  - will be followed by an improved rebate
system, with special help to retired people on low incomes living alone.
Business rates will become a local tax again, with rate rebates for small
firms.
Labour will establish mortgage rescue schemes throughout the country.
Housing log books and an end to gazumping will also help homebuyers.
Right-to-buy
Labour will keep the right to buy. We will increase the number of homes for
rent by establishing a Housing Bank to facilitate the balanced use of
councils' capital receipts and offer investment capital at attractive rates
of interest.
Council tenants will be guaranteed real rights over their homes.
Compulsory competitive tendering will be abolished, but the Quality
Commission will have the power, where services have broken down, to insist
they are put out to tender, with contractors required to meet conditions
such as quality thresholds and fair employment.
We shall introduce annual elections in England and Wales, with one third of
councillors elected each year.
We will reform the system for allocating grants to local councils and
introduce less centralised rules on capital spending, enabling councils to
make prudent long-term investment.
Consumers' Charter
Our Consumers' Charter will cover all goods and services. It will include
tougher health and safety standards, compensation for injury from dangerous
products and comprehensive guarantees.
Every utility will be required to provide a customer contract, with
compensation if standards are not met. Gas and electricity disconnections
will be banned completely where young children or elderly people are
concerned.
We will strengthen the regulation of the utilities. We will establish a
Petroleum Products Regulator.
The provision of water is so fundamental that it is a priority for return to
public control.
Labour's independent Food Standards Agency will ensure high food quality
standards. Our Department of Food and Farming will offer British farmers and
consumers a better deal. Subsidies for production will gradually be replaced
with green premium payments to promote environmentally sound management of
the countryside.
We will transform transport policy by ensuring, for the first time, that all
road, railway, aviation, shipping and inland waterway transport projects are
judged on an equal basis, taking account of their environmental, social and
economic impact.
Within six months, we will review the roads programme and mobilise private
capital for large-scale public transport investment.
We reject Conservative plans to privatise British Rail. Instead we will
modernise, setting clear performance targets to improve the quality of
service, expand electrification and shift more freight from road to rail.
We will end the deregulation of buses, introduce bus priority measures
integrated with new rapid transit systems within a 'green light' programme
designed to encourage people to transfer to public transport. Proper
concessionary fare schemes will be developed in every area.
We will reform transport taxation in order to encourage smaller, cleaner
cars and the use of catalytic converters. Company cars will be fairly taxed.
We will seek to reverse the unacceptable decline in Britain's merchant navy
and encourage the greater use of British-owned and crewed vessels.
We will establish a new independent transport safety inspectorate within the
health and safety legislation to improve the safety environment.
We will not invest in new nuclear power stations, continue with those in the
planning process or extend the lives of existing nuclear stations beyond
their safe life span.
Democracy
It is time to modernise Britain's democracy. Central to Labour's purpose in
government is our commitment to radical constitutional reform. Our Charter
of Rights, backed up by a complementary and democratically bill of rights,
will establish in law the specific rights of every citizen.
We will start in our first Parliamentary session with a Freedom of
Information Act.
We will give power to the nations and regions. We will move immediately to
establish an elected Scottish parliament.
In our first year, we will introduce a new Welsh Language Act. We will
establish in the lifetime of a full parliament an elected Welsh Assembly in
Cardiff with powers and functions which reflect the existing administrative
structure.
A regional tier of government in the English regions will take over many
powers now exercised nationally, such as regional economic planning and
transport.
Local government
To simplify local government in England, we will establish 'most purpose'
authorities generally based on district councils. We will consult widely
before finalising proposals.
London is the only European capital without the advantage of its own elected
strategic authority. Labour will give Londoners the right to elect a new
Greater London Authority.
We will safeguard press freedom. We will remove unjustified restrictions on
broadcasting and establish an urgent inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission into the concentration of media ownership. If the press fail to
deal with abuses of individual privacy, we will implement the Calcutt
Report's recommendations for statutory protection.
Ulster
Labour will continue the present talks on Northern Ireland. In the long
term, we want to see a united Ireland achieved by consensus and without
violence.
We will fight terrorism strongly by every lawful means, repealing the
counter-productive Prevention of Terrorism Act and replacing it with a
measure which is more effective in combatting terrorists and genuinely
acceptable in a democratic society.
Further constitutional reforms will include those leading to the replacement
of the House of Lords with a new elected Second Chamber which will have the
power to delay, for the lifetime of a parliament, change to designated
legislation reducing individual or constitutional rights. We will continue
to encourage a wide and well-informed public debate on the electoral system.
International stage
We need a new government to grasp new opportunities. A Labour government
will be ready to exploit Britain's unique, interlinking membership of the
United Nations Security Council, Nato, the Commonwealth, the European
Community and the G7.
It's a new chance to provide genuine security for Britain.
Unlike the Tories, we recognize that disarmament negotiations and
technological change can bring about problems for our defence industries.
Nearly 100,000 jobs have already been lost during the past two years and
123,000 more are in danger.
The Labour government will set up a Defence Diversification Agency to assist
workers, communities and companies affected by change.
The Labour government will promote Britain out of the European second
division into which our country has been relegated by the Tories.
EMU
We shall play a positive role in negotiations on Economic and Monetary
Union. We shall fight for Britain's interests, working for Europe-wide
policies to fight unemployment and to enhance regional and structural
industrial policy. The elected finance ministers of the different countries
must become the effective political counterpart to the central bank whose
headquarters should be in Britain.
As part of the evolving role of the regions of Europe, we will establish a
Scottish office in Brussels and seek repesentation for the Scottish
Parliament in European institutions. We shall seek fundamental changes in
the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.
We shall make the widening of the community a priority.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Conservative Manifesto): Personal choice
a priority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories pledge to move towards an income tax rate of 20p, continue the
privatisation programme and maintain an independent line on monetary union.
They intend to use British presidency of the EC to increase competition. The
keynotes are responsibility and choice. Manifesto highlights are:
Foreign Affairs
WE WILL support an enhanced role for the UN in peace-keeping and combating
state-sponsored terrorism.
We are determined that Iraq should comply with the terms of the gulf War
cease-fire agreement, and in particular that it should co-operate with the
UN in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction.
We support early Russian membership of the IMF and World Bank, as well as a
stabilisation fund for the rouble.
We are co-operating with our partners to provide urgent help to the former
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to upgrade the safety of their nuclear power
stations.
We strongly support the peace process in the Middle East.
We will use overseas aid to promote good government, sensible economic
policies, the rooting out of corruption, and crucially  - respect for human
rights and the rule of law.
We will promote the development of multi-party systems through the new
Westminster Foundation for Democracy.
We will promote the English language by strengthening both the British
Council and the BBC World Service.
Security and defence
We will complete the deployment of the next generation of Britain's minimum
nuclear deterrent. We will order and complete the fourth Trident submarine.
The Reserves will play an even more important role and we will introduce
legislation to allow their more flexible use.
European Community
We will continue to resist changes to the Treaty of Rome that would damage
British business.
We will resist Commission initiatives which run counter to the principle
that issues should be dealt with on a national basis wherever possible.
We will work for a successful outcome to the Gatt negotiations.
We will redouble our efforts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to
reduce costs to taxpayers and consumers.
We will insist on more effective control over Community spending and will
resist pressure to extend Community competence to new areas.
Our priorities for the Presidency will be:
To start negotiations with those Efta countries who want to join the
Community so that they can join by 1995
To build on the EC's Association Agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland so that we can welcome them to full membership by the year 2000.
To conclude EC trade and co-operation agreements with the main republics of
the former Soviet Union.
To complete the single market and extend it to the seven countries of Efta.
We will provide guidance and help to any British company encountering a
trade barrier illegal under European law.
We will press for progress on the environment, including the Fifth
Environment Action Programme.
Inflation and sterling
In the 1990s, the government's task will be to provide an economic
environment which encourages enterprise - the mainspring of prosperity. Our
aims must be:
To achieve price stability.
To keep firm control over public spending.
To continue to reduce taxes as fast as we prudently can.
To make sure the market mechanisms and incentives are allowed to do their
job.
In due course, we will move to the narrow bands of the ERM.
We will play our full part in the design and discussion of monetary
institutions for Europe.
When or if other members of the EC move to a monetary union with a single
currency, we will take our own unfettered decision on whether to join. That
decision will be taken by the UK parliament.
Route to lower taxes
We announced in the Budget an important first step towards a basic income
tax rate of 20p. By applying a 20p rate to the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income, we have cut taxes for all 25 million taxpayers, and taken the 4m on
lowest incomes out of 25p tax altogether.
We will make further progress towards a basic Income Tax rate of 20p. We
will see the Budget return towards balance as the economy recovers.
Homes and inheritance tax
We will aim to bring home ownership, share ownership and personal pensions
within the reach of more families.
We will continue to reform the taxation of savings, building on the success
of Peps and Tessas.
We will raise the tax threshold for inheritance tax so that the homes and
savings of an increasing number of our citizens can pass unemcumbered from
one generation to another.
We will encourage companies to make dealing in their own shares easier,
especially for small shareholders, and encourage wider share ownership,
through, for example, the establishment of 'Share Shops'.
We will abolish stamp duty on share transactions.
Business taxation
We will continue to reduce tax burdens on business, as we have done this
year for the motor industry, whenever it is possible to do so.
We will abolish unnecessary licences and reduce the need for specific
approvals for product design.
We will back British companies encountering any discrimination, trade
barriers or state subsidies that should no longer exist within the single
market.
We will back the regulators of the financial services industry in their
efforts to achieve high standards while keeping the rule books down to
manageable size.
Privatisation
We will continue our privatisation programme. British Coal will be returned
to the private sector. So will local authority bus companies. We will
encourage local authorities to sell their airports. We will end British
Rail's monopoly. We will sell certain rail services and franchise others.
The Ports Act 1991 has paved the way for the privatisation of the Trust
Ports by competitive tender.
We are privatising Northern Ireland Electricity and will privatise the
Northern Ireland water and sewage services.
We will bring private-sector enterprise into the public services by
encouraging contracting out and competitive tendering throughout government.
We will maintain our programme of compulsory competitive tendering of local
authority services.
We will ensure that competitive tendering is extended to white-collar local
authority services, such as those offered by lawyers, accountants,
architects and surveyors.
We will introduce new legislation giving stronger powers to deal with
cartels.
Energy
We will continue to encourage competition in energy markets. We will
progressively reduce British Gas' monopoly of the retail gas market, to give
small users the same rights as big firms.
We will privatise British Coal in a way that enables employees to enjoy a
stake in the industry.
We will increase our support for British Coal Enterprise, which promotes
economic regeneration in areas affected by the closure of mines, and has
successfully assisted 76,000 people in finding new jobs.
We will review the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. We are committed
to safe and economical nuclear power.
Regional policies
We will ensure that regional policy is well targeted.
We will continue to support all parts of the UK in their campaigns to
attract inward investment.
We will give additional emphasis to upgrading skills and technology when
allocating funds.
Small businesses
We will develop a new Enterprise Service to give small and medium-sized
companies help in diagnosing their most important strategic needs.
Tecs and Lecs will be closely involved in developing and implementing this
new initiative.
Consumer affairs
We will introduce legislation designed to give consumers confidence that
what they purchase is properly described  - and that adequate compensation
is offered where these requirements are not met.
We will enable the courts to override unfair terms in contracts and improve
our powers to deal with rogue traders.
We will tighten up the rules on holiday brochures and contracts, and
introduce a 'cooling-off' period into timeshare contracts.
We will introduce legislation to simplify trade mark registration and extend
the rights they confer.
We will enforce science-based controls on the use of chemicals in food
production, and will maintain our policy of open access to information on
pesticide safety.
Citizen's Charter
The Audit Commission will be able to publish league tables of performance
including each local council and health authority so that people can compare
the quality of service.
We will ensure that inspection reports are published and widely available.
We will require British Rail to tighten its targets for reliability and
punctuality on all lines, and report monthly to passengers on how it is
doing. London Underground will publish its own charter.
We will expect Post Offices and Jobcentres to set our standards of service
and levels of achievement.
A new Charter Mark award will give recognition to those parts of the public
sevice that best meet charter standards.
We will act to ensure that private firms bidding to improve local authority
public services are not obstructed by unscrupulous practices in councils or
unfair contracts.
We will encourage the wider use of performance pay inside the Civil Service
and in other parts of the public service.
We are ensuring that the regulators have the powers they need to promote
competition and safeguard the interests of the customer by controlling price
increases. We will increase competition in the gas and water markets.
The Post Office
We are committed to maintaining a nationwide letter service, within a
uniform structure of prices, and with a nationwide network of Post Offices.
We will lower the limit on the Post Office monopoly much closer to the level
of the first-class stamp. We will consider requests to license limited
specialist services to compete with the Post Office monopoly.
Whitehall
We will give a cabinet minister responsibility for the Citi zen's Charter
programme and reforming the Civil Service, taking charge of the Citizen's
Charter Unit, Efficiency Unit, the programme for creating Agencies and the
Public Competition and Purchasing Unit.
We intend to create a new department, under a cabinet minister, with
responsibility for broadcasting, arts, sport, tourism, the national heritage
and the film industry.
We will transfer the core responsiblities of the Department of Energy to the
Department of Trade and Industry, and responsibilities for energy efficiency
to the Department of the Environment, ending the need for a separate
department.
Small businesses are the seedcorn of our future prosperity. We believe the
DTI should take over responsibility for them. We also want to strengthen the
links between the DTI and the highly successful Training and Enterprise
Councils.
Responsibility for overseeing all financial services will be brought
together in the Treasury, in line with the practice adopted in most other
advanced countries.
New programmes for regenerating our inner cities are outlined in this
manifesto. Responsibilities will be brought together in the Department of
the Environment.
We are determined to ensure that women in the workforce realise their full
potential. We will transfer from the Home Office to the Department of
Employment the lead responsibility for co-ordinating government policy on
issues of particular concern to women.
Open government
We will review the 80 or so statutory restrictions which exist on the
disclosure of information  - retaining only those needed to protect privacy
and essential confidentiality.
We will seek to provide greater access to personal records held by
government.
We will be less secretive about the workings of government. For example,
when the Committees of the Cabinet are reconstituted after the election we
will, for the first time, set out their names and membership. We will update
and  - for the first time  - publish the guidance for mInisters on
procedure.
Education
We will complete the introduction of the National Curriculum offering 10
subjects at a nationally defined standard  - English, mathematics, science,
history, geography, technology, art, music, PE and, in secondary schools, a
foreign language.
Regular and straightforward tests will be in place for all 7, 11 and
14-year-olds by 1994.
GCSE at age 16 will be integrated into the National Curriculum, with a new
A+ grade to test the most able. The majority of marks will come from a
written exam.
We will continue to encourage the creation of nursery places.
Full information will be published annually about the performance of all
local schools in each area.
Popular schools which are over-subscribed will be given the resources to
expand.
The Technology Schools Initiative will be expanded across the country.
Existing schools which opt for GM status will be able to emulate City
Technology Colleges and attract private technology sponsorship.
We will maintain the Assisted Places scheme, which gives access to
independent education to many families who could not otherwise afford it.
We will develop an Advanced Diploma which can be earned by students pursuing
either academic or vocational courses, and a new General National Vocational
Qualification.
Training
By the end of the new parliament, the new system of National Vocational
Qualifications should cover virtually every occupation in the economy. The
CBI's training targets envisage 80% of young people reaching NVQ level 2 by
the end of the parliament.
We intend to make training credits available to all 16-year-olds and
17-year-olds within the lifetime of the new parliament. The Tecs will
continue to be responsible for the YT programme for this age group.
We will continue to finance training programmes for the long-term unemployed
and those who face particular difficulties.
We will launch with the Tecs a new initiative, giving people a voucher with
which they can buy a 'skill check', providing assessment and guidance on how
to make the most of their working lives.
Workers and unions
We will require employers to give everyone who works for them for more than
eight hours a week a clear written statement of their terms and conditions
of employment.
We will make automatic deduction of union membership dues without written
authorisation unlawful.
We will take measures to give individuals greater freedom in choosing a
union.
We will legislate to require that all pre-strike ballots are postal and
subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days' notice of a
strike is given after a ballot.
People who use public services will have the right to restrain the
disruption of those services by unlawful industrial action.
Police
We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000 extra
police officers this year.
We will set up a working party to examine what more can be done to protect
the police and members of other emergency services from assault.
'Joyriders' will now face prison sentences of up to five years, unlimited
fines and unlimited driving bans.
We will extend the maximum sentence for causing death through dangerous or
drink driving. We will sustain our massive prison reform and building
programme.
We will introduce a major Criminal Justice Bill in the lifetime of the new
parliament.
We will bring forward proposals for reform of Sunday trading laws once the
legal position has been made clear by the European Court of Justice.
Pornography, privacy, libel
British domestic controls on pornography will remain in place even after the
completion of the single European market.
Community relations
Racial and sexual discrimination have no place in our society. We have given
the police stronger powers to deal with racial hatred. We will continue to
ensure that the full force of the law is used to deal with racial attacks.
Immigration
Asylum Bill to be reintroduced in the new parliament to create a faster and
more effective system of determining who are genuine political refugees.
Health
We will, year by year, increase the level of real resources committed to the
NHS. Savings made through greater efficiency will be ploughed back into the
service.
We will continue to develop the NHS Trust movement which places
responsibility for managing hospitals and other services with local teams
who are closest to patients.
We will ensure that the benefits of fundholding arrangements are available
to any GP who wishes to apply, and we will be ready to extend the scope of
the scheme further as it develops.
Patient's Charter
Binding guarantees will be set locally for in-patient waiting times,
starting with the operations where waiting causes most distress. To ensure
that progress on waiting times continues, we intend that from 31 March 1993,
no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee
replacement, or a cataract operation. We are sure that, as now, many
hospitals will be able to do better than this.
We will move to a system under which a named nurse or midwife will be
responsible for your care while you are in hospital. We will set specific
targets for out-patient waiting times.
Children
We will ensure that the standards implemented through the Children Act are
applied sensibly, and do not discourage private of voluntary arrangments
which are often best suited to the needs of children and parents.
We will carry forward a family support initiative, encouraging the voluntary
sector to work in partnership with families and local authorities.
Child benefit will remain the cornerstone of our policy for all families
with children. Its value will increase each year in line with prices.
Pensions
We will continue to pay from April 1993 a rebate at the level recommended by
the Government Actuary for all those who contract out of the State
Earnings-Related Pension Scheme.
We will legislate to provide a new 1 per cent incentive for holders of
personal pensions aged 30 and over from April 1993, when the existing
incentive ends.
We will consider proposals for a new system of rebates to come into effect
from April 1996 with the aim of ensuring that personal pensions remain
attractive across the age range.
We are firmly committed to equal treatment for men and women in pensions.
Following assessment of the responses to our discussion paper, we will bring
forward legislation to achieve this.
Mortgages and rent
We will maintain mortgage tax relief. We will introduce a nation-wide 'Rents
to Mortgages' scheme, enabling council tenants to take a part-share in their
home, gradually stepping up to full ownership.
We will put more of the Housing Corporation's Pounds 2bn budget into
do-it-yourself shared ownership.
We will introduce 'commonhold' legislation, giving residential leaseholders
in blocks of flats the right to acquire the freehold of their block at the
market rate. Leaseholders of higher-rated houses will also be given the
right to buy the freehold of their property. Leaseholders who live in a
block which does not qualify will have a new right to buy an extended lease.
We will introduce statutory time limits for answers by local authorities to
standard inquiries by house-buyers.
We will extend nationwide the scheme we have piloted to increase private
renting, whereby housing associations manage properties.
As soon as possible in the new parliament, we will introduce a new 'Rent a
Room' scheme under which home-owners will be able to let rooms to lodgers
without having to pay tax on the rent.
Housing needs
We will revolutionise management of council houses and flats. Compulsory
competitive tendering will oblige local authorities to bring in managers.
We will give tenants a new Right to Improve, so they can receive
compensation for certain home improvements.
We will work with the Housing Corporation to establish an Ombudsman for
housing association tenants.
We will set up a task force  - headed by an independent chairman  - to help
bring empty government residential properties back into use.
We will introduce a new pilot scheme to promote homesteading.
Transport
Franchising will be introduced to give the private sector the fullest
opportunity to operate existing passenger railway services.
Required standards of punctuality, reliability and quality of service will
be specified by franchises; subsidy will continue to be provided where
necessary; arrangements to sustain the current national network of services
will be maintained; and through-ticketing will be required.
A new Rail Regulator  - who will ensure that all companies have fair access
to the track  - will award the franchises and make sure franchisees honour
the terms of the contract.
BR's accounting systems and internal structures will be reorganised. One
part of BR will continue to be responsible for all track and infrastructure.
The operating side of BR will continue to provide passenger services until
they are franchised out.
Our aim will be to franchise out services in such a way as to reflect
regional and local identity and make operating sense. We want to recover a
sense of pride in our railways and to recapture the spirit of the old
regional companies. We will sell BR's freight operations outright. We will
also sell its parcels business.
We will be prepared to sell stations  - which we want to be centres of
activity  - to franchisees or independent companies. The Railway
Inspectorate will be given full powers to ensure the highest standards of
safety.
We will improve road transport by:
Investing Pounds 6.3bn in our trunk road and motorway network over the next
three years, concentrating particularly on bypasses.
Privatising the remaining 39 local authority bus companies.
Deregulating buses in London and privatising the London Buses subsidiaries.
A new London Bus Executive will be responsible for bus stops, stands and
stations and for contracting out socially necessary services.
Changing the system under which motorway service areas are provided.
Encouraging action internationally, and within our own motor industry, to
promote more fuel-efficient vehicles.
We will further liberalise transatlantic air services and encourage more
international flights to and from regional airports.
We will encourage local authorities to sell their airports.
We will seek to privatise the Docklands Light Railway during the next
parliament.
Local government
We will set up a commission to examine, area by area, the appropriate local
government arrangements in England. Local communities will be fully
consulted and their loyalties and interests will be central to the
commission's task in deciding whether in any area a single tier of local
government could provide better accountability and greater efficiency.
We will replace the community charge (poll tax) with a new council tax in
April 1993. It will be fair and will rightly reflect both the value of the
property and the number of adults who live in it.
Reviving cities
We will continue to extend City Challenge and allocate a greater proportion
of resources by competitive bidding.
We will bring together resources for targeted inner-city programmes into a
single budget.
New, integrated regional offices of the appropriate Whitehall departments
will be established.
We will establish a new Urban Regeneration Agency.
London
We will convene a new private sector forum to promote London's position
internationally.
We will establish a new cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate policy on
London.
We will give a single transport minister responsibility for services in
London.
Broadcasting
We will publish a discussion paper on the future of the BBC, recognising its
special responsibilities for providing public service broadcasting.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Plan for extensive Whitehall
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSERVATIVE general election victory would result in the largest shake-up
of Whitehall responsibilities since the early 1970s with the Treasury and
Department of the Environment both strengthening their responsibilities.
The changes envisaged in the Conservative manifesto would transfer to the
Treasury the responsibility for overseeing all financial services in what
appears to be an effort to tighten the government's regulatory grip.
Environment would strengthen its authority over urban regeneration.
Among the losers would be the Home Office  - shorn of broadcasting and
womens' issues.
The Department of Employment would lose tourism and small companies,
outweighing the gain from the new responsibility for women.
Mr John Major announced the prospective creation of two new Whitehall power
structures.
A new Cabinet-level post  - based on the existing Cabinet office  - would
oversee the Citizen's Charter, and take broad responsibility for reforms of
the Civil Service, and monitor Whitehall efficiency and public purchasing.
A second new department would merge the responsibilities  - currently split
between several ministries  - for broadcasting, arts, sports, heritage,
tourism and the film industry.
Those changes would run in parallel with the transfer of most of the
existing responsibilities of the energy department to trade and industry
with the remainder  - the energy efficiency unit  - passing to environment.
The Department of Employment would hand to the DTI the responsibility for
small businesses, a move which ministers said could foreshadow its eventual
abolition. At the same time, the DTI would be expected to increase its links
with the Training and Enterprise Councils.
For its part, the environment department would take from DTI its oversight
over urban development corporations and would oversee the Forum for London.
The plans increased speculation that Mr Major has sketched out some of the
elements of a prospective Cabinet reshuffle if the Conservatives win on
April 9.
Ministers said that the employment department would probably be given to one
of the several women bidding for a place at the Cabinet table.
The new arts and heritage department might be offered to Mr John Patten, at
present a middle-ranking home office minister, and Mr Michael Heseltine
could stay on in his present role at environment.
Mr Francis Maude, a Treasury minister, is tipped for the Citizen's Charter
job.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Poll comfort as parties see
there is all to play for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S POLLS  - Gallop's 2 percentage point Conservative lead, even NOP's
four point Labour lead  - must bring relief to the government. Reflecting on
Labour leads of five points in ICM and Mori yesterday, the Tories could take
comfort from three thoughts (in addition to Monday's 3 point lead in
Harris):
Easy come, easy go. If in two days the polls can move from a 1 per cent to a
5 per cent Labour lead, they can move back again.
Never believe a trend until it's been confirmed for several days over
several polls. Even then, keep in mind the volatility of the British
electorate.
Remember 1959. In the Macmillan election the Conservative government started
7 per cent ahead, slumped in the first 10 days of the campaign to a mere 2
per cent lead, and then in the final haul pulled back to a 7 per cent lead.
In fact, with three weeks to go, Labour must be very pleased with the
evidence of the polls.
Everyone has heard of the height of the mountain that Labour has to climb.
The 8 per cent swing needed for a clear majority is almost twice as great as
the largest movement in any post-war election.
To those who were in Walworth Road in 1987 it must seem incredible to be
looking at a winning margin.
Historical precedents are dangerous. The rates of the game change. But for
40 years no government has materially improved its poll position during the
campaign.
In 1951, the Labour government started the election 11 per cent behind in
the Gallup poll and, although they lost the election in terms of seats, they
emerged from the voting booths 1 per cent ahead. Such a movement could
happen again.
There are three special reasons why the survey figures are unlikely to
remain constant.
The electorate's convictions seem especially shallow rooted. Thirty years
ago more than 50 per cent of voters felt 'very strongly' about their party
preference; today only 20 per cent do. Party arguments and campaign events
really can switch votes.
The polls can change votes. The election may not offer much of an
ideological choice but it remains a spectacular event. In a nip and tuck
race, partisanship is excited.
This is the first election in which the party lead has switched in the
opinion polls during the campaign (leaving out one final poll in 1970). The
public may be driven to focus its votes on the choice between the two
leading contenders or, repelled by yah-boo politics and seeing a hung
parliament as likely, they may give extra support to the centre party.
Movements at the local, not national, level may affect party support. In 226
of the 376 seats won by the Conservatives in the last election the Alliance
came second. But, as polls have shown, many electors are unaware that this
applies to their constituency. For the next three weeks, and especially in
Scotland, there will be massive efforts to educate the electorate in
tactical voting.
The Liberal Democrats have acquired great expertise at turning around the
old argument 'a vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote'. Now, in more than a
third of constituencies, they can say 'if you want the Tories out, vote for
us'. It may not win them many seats and it won't take any away from Labour.
But it may cut into the Labour percentages in the opinion polls.
It remains all to play for.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): More of the same or take
Kinnock on trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Conservatives lose the election, it will be because of the recession.
The manifesto held aloft by Mr John Major yesterday is nothing to do with
the case. If Labour wins, it will be because of the recession  - and the
anodyne manifesto published by the party yesterday.
Take the Conservative manifesto first. Some floating voters may back the
friendly team that got us into the fine mess we're in right now, but if they
do it will be for fear of Labour, and therefore in spite of the slump. It
will not be because of any radical or exciting new construct from the
Tories, not even the firm promise to introduce a hedgerow incentive scheme,
'to help preserve hedgerows of particular historic, landscape or wildlife
importance'. I have to tell you, Mr Major, that this will not help my
hedgerow, which is merely of domestic importance.
'What you see is what you get,' said the prime minister yesterday. He was
waving a copy of the Conservative manifesto. 'It's all me,' he added
proudly. It is. The cover is an enormous blue print of the smiling face of
Mr Major. Put him back in No 10 Downing Street and you will get an
intensification of the experience of the past 16 months  - collegiate
cabinets, broad grin, Citizen's Charter, and all.
Others will vote for change. That means rule by the ex-socialist old lags
who promise that they really are reformed this time, honest guv. Such voters
are gamblers. They will have to take the Labour programme on trust. The
entire Labour campaign is designed to convince waverers that there is
nothing to fear from the new model party. If this can be achieved, all the
Opposition has to do is wait for the government to defeat itself. Not even
Mr Neil Kinnock could have dreamed that the Conservatives would be so
diligent in their efforts to auto-destruct.
There is, of course a third choice. Monday's Liberal Democrat manifesto does
not offer an alternative government, but it does suggest a means of
expressing a wish for a more effective political mechanism, such as a
coalition. Alas, after the election, the Liberal Democrats will be lucky to
command a couple of dozen seats. These could, in certain favourable
circumstances, enable Mr Paddy Ashdown to lobby Labour in favour of
constitutional reform. But however often you toss a coin, it falls heads or
tails more often than it stands on edge. For the moment I say no more of the
Lib Dems, whose manifesto is graced by a larger than-life photograph of Mr
Ashdown.
The Conservative manifesto would sound more radical were it not written
under the cold eye of the Treasury. Mr Major has injected a sense of respect
for the public services into the mix left behind by Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
but he has done so from within the corridors of Whitehall. He has not been
mean, but then, unlike Labour, he has no compelling urge to redistribute
incomes and/or wealth from rich to poor. He reiterates past undertakings to
increase child benefit in line with inflation, raise pensions for the
worst-off recipients, and establish a 20 per cent tax band. That is not the
end of his 'caring' paragraphs. The Tories' national health service reforms
are superior to anything Labour has to offer. They constitute an attempt to
bring managerial discipline into a nearly unmanageable undertaking. Labour
wants to save that promising scene for the health unions.
The tone of Mr Major's manifesto is generally defensive, but then the
Conservatives have much to be defensive about. In spite of that, the
document contains numerous small but useful ideas, many of which are to be
commended. The prime minister's penchant for traditional teaching methods
more than compensates for the few lunacies (such as a privatised
inspectorate) in his plans for schools. The 'millenium fund', financed from
a state lottery, is well designed to catch headlines. The proposed changes
in the machinery of government are of intense interest to civil servants.
Let me pause here. The phrase 'civil servants' defines the problem. Most of
these New Conservative proposals bear the mark of close official scrutiny,
earnest debate, submission, withdrawal, drafting and redrafting of papers
and eventual compromise. This is a manifesto made by ministers who have
forgotten the fear of losing office.
That is why I believe that the Tories delude themselves when they say that
the effect of their policies will be, in Mr Major's words, to put 'you, and
not the government . . . in charge of your life'. The health and education
reforms require greater control at the centre, in compensation for the
further emasculation of local responsibilities. All the new (or recycled
old) initiatives, not least the Citizen's Charter, add as much to
ministerial power and patronage as they subtract elsewhere. The proposal to
govern London with a cabinet sub-committee is not worthy of discussion. As
Labour's Mr Gordon Brown remarked at a recent meeting of Charter 88, the
constitutional reform pressure group, 'what the Conservatives offer is 88
charters'.
So does Labour, but Mr Kinnock at least throws in a (truncated) programme of
constitutional reform, including a Scottish assembly. His party's manifesto,
which to his credit has the flags of the four nations of Britain on its
cover, is evidence that Labour's fiscal intent is redistributive, while its
administrative purpose remains regulatory. It would return the monopoly
power over state schools to local authorities. It would destroy the NHS
reforms. Competitive tendering would become a last resort.
One of the sub-titles in Mr Kinnock's document is 'a government which
business can do business with'. It is more likely to be a government which
business has to do business with. It will have to pay the minimum wage,
accept new employee rights, fork out for training, and answer frequent
letters from official bodies. Labour has a better appreciation than do the
Tories of the deficiencies of our present governance, but it has not yet
fully taken in the message from the east, that ministers really do not know
best. None of this is the old socialism. It is the new statism. It is not
public ownership, but public control  - control, that is, by officials and
ministers. Nationalisation is dead. Long live regulation.
Supporters of Mr Kinnock may protest that this is to read more into the
Labour manifesto than is really there. Certainly the drafting shows extreme
care. Some of the language is positively Thatcherite. 'The only way to
defeat inflation . . . is to raise productivity . . . ' The phrases are all
either designed to soothe, or to advertise. There will be a new body called
British Technology Enterprise, a National Health Initiative, a Health
Quality Commission, a Ministry for Women, an Education Standards Commission,
a Food Standards Agency . . . the list exceeds the space available here.
Voters who take a chance on Labour have to believe that (a) all of this
really is harmless tomfoolery while (b) Mr Kinnock and his colleagues will
not, should they become ministers, revert to their aspirations of
yesteryear. The difficulty is that the only way to find out for sure is to
let them demonstrate their innocence while in office. The extent to which
there is now a widespread willingness to take such a risk is evidence of
just how fed up with the recession erstwhile Tory supporters have become.

There were raised eyebrows at Labour's headquarters.
Eagle-eyed researchers had spotted that a UBS Philips and Drew 'shadow
Budget special' tip sheet had named Tesco, Forte, British Steel and Royal
Insurance as companies whose shares might benefit from a Labour victory.
Their distinguished bosses, however, were among the 43 signatories of
Tuesday's letter to The Times warning against the red peril. Although the
letter concluded with a paragraph insisting it represented personal views,
perhaps shareholders should be told.

The Soho-based advertising agency, Reay Keating Hamer, has just published
the results of telephone interviews last month with 100 'don't know' voters
of all ages, both sexes and from the north and south. The main finding is
that 'the current advertising offerings from the political parties are
missing the mark'.
Only 18 per cent could spontaneously recall any political advertising. Only
half of that group attributed their recall to the correct party, while the
research discovered that 'credibility comparisons showed that politicians
are on a par with estate agents and tabloid journalists'. Reay Keating Hamer
currently does not handle any political advertising.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All national newspapers, are entirely electronic and all articles are thus
written and edited on computer terminals  - which ought to make it easy to
print the party manifestos. Not so: it is the glossiness that causes the
strain. The computers don't like it.
This year, unasked, one party supplied us with a floppy computer disk with
the contents of its manifesto. Another gave us a disk, but charged Pounds
50. The third tried to help but failed to provide a disk until after the
first edition had gone.
For the record, it was the Liberals who supplied the disk on time and for
nothing. Labour was also efficient, but made the charge. It was the Tories
who couldn't keep up, but at least they have not demanded a fee. Not perhaps
the usual party images.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): False promise - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour manifesto states firmly: 'We will end the scandal of poverty pay
and bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe by introducing a
statutory minimum wage.'
Would that it were so simple] Most independent estimates suggest that a
minimum wage of half male median earnings will cost at least 100,000 jobs.
Young people and women in service industries will bear the brunt of the job
losses.
As for bringing Britain into line with Europe, a glance at youth
unemployment rates in those European countries with minimum wages is
instructive. UK youth unemployment in 1988, the latest year of complete OECD
figures, was 11.8 per cent compared to 21.7 per cent in France, 34.5 per
cent in Italy and 40 per cent in Spain. Of course, the aim may be
convergence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spare a thought for Francis Maude, the Treasury minister. For a start, he is
defending a majority of less than 3,000 over Labour in his Warwickshire
North constituency, but the Tory manifesto contains what could well be
another blow.
Frequently tipped as one of the MPs most likely to go to the Cabinet if the
Tories win, Maude  - as Citizen's Charter minister  - must be favourite for
the new non-departmental Cabinet post promised in the manifesto for the
Citizen's Charter and Civil Service reform.
Whitehall does not usually make it easy for a small central unit to impose
its will on large departments, and the post may well be a thankless one:
nothing like being chief secretary at the Treasury or running a spending
department.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Tories top the quango count
 -Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even making allowances for the way you count, the Tories easily outstrip
Labour in their list of proposed quangos published in the party manifestos
yesterday.
A quango is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation. Mrs Margaret
Thatcher didn't like them very much. John Major obviously does. For the new
model Labour party they seem a natural way of avoiding overt interventionism
while keeping some questions open. They were prominent in much of the
party's pre-manifesto literature.
Still, the Tories have taken the lead. On a minimum count the Conservatives
are offering 21 and Labour 14. The Tory count would go even higher if
offshoots from the Citizen's Charter were included.
No less than 18 charters have been published since the white paper a year
ago. It is not quite clear how far these should be counted as quangos,
though they will involve some measure of quasi-autonomous bureaucracy.
Among the genuinely new quangos, the Conservatives are offering a task force
to counter school truancy, a new body called Scottish National Heritage to
be supplemented by a new Scottish Environ-mental Protection Agency, and a
Welsh Economic Council.
Labour's proposals include a Food Standards Agency, transport safety
inspectorate, judicial appointments commission and children's commissioner.
Whoever wins, there should be jobs all round for those who like to serve on
committees.

as a distinct option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN yes-terday tried to clear a distinct pitch for his party by
lam-basting the Labour and Tory manifestos equally. Significantly, however,
he gave a cautious welcome to Labour's stance on constitutional reform.
Mr Ashdown acknowledged that Labour's pledge to enhance its Plant committee
report on electoral reform was a positive step.
The Liberal Democrats would take part in a formal inquiry into alternative
systems, he said, as long as legislation was guaranteed.
However, Labour's commitment to proportional representation in its manifesto
was 'gift-wrapped fudge'.
Mr Ashdown continued to insist on PR as the prerequisite for his party's
support in a hung parliament.
He refused to accept that could mean a pact only with Labour.
'As the Tory party faces the reality of defeat, they will be accommodating
these sorts of ideas,' he said. Labour was closer to accepting reality, he
believed.
The Liberal Democrat party supports the single-transferable vote system of
PR but Mr Ashdown hinted that he might accept the German additional-member
system where proportionality is ensured by topping up the parliamentary
strengths of parties from lists. It has ruled out the alternative-vote
system.
The Liberal Democrats are trying to set themselves apart from Labour so that
the party is not seen merely as a soft alternative to Labour. They realise
that a strong Labour showing in opinion polls would send some wavering
Tories back to the fold because of fears of a Labour government. That would
harm Liberal Democrat chances in the party's target seats.
Mr Ashdown said Labour's manifesto was 'particularly disappointing' because
of its timidity. 'If they were writing the New Testament, they would be
saying the meek can inherit the earth as resources allow.'
Speaking on a tour of Essex and the Midlands, he added that the Labour and
Conservative manifestos were virtually interchangeable. Neither passed the
'hope test' or was sufficiently tough on tackling the recession, education
and the environment.
'Only the Liberal Democrats have published a manifesto of fresh ideas, with
hope for the future,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Classic Conservatism in
post-Thatcher era - The substance behind the changes in rhetoric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not Thatcherism. Nor is there a distinctive enough political
philosophy in the Conservative manifesto to warrant the label Majorism. So
Mr John Major chose yesterday to call it classic Conservatism.
A senior Cabinet colleague described it as a prospectus for the
post-socialist era; a few seconds later he offered the afterthought that it
was also one for a post-Thatcherite world.
Over the coming days and weeks there will be many other labels applied to
the manifesto for the first election campaign since 1979 that the
Conservatives have fought without Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Some in the party
will describe it as One-Nation. Some will insist that Mr Major has been true
to the principles of his predecessor. Others will see in the document the
outlines of the Conservatives' version of European Christian Democracy. They
will all be right.
After just 16 months in Downing Street Mr Major did not want to abandon the
core of his party's agenda for the previous 11 years; nor could he have. He
wanted to signal that there was substance behind the changes in style and
rhetoric since November 1990. The result, in the words of one Cabinet
minister, is a manifesto which represents 'much more a shift of 45 degrees
than a U-turn'.
The first objective of the 29,000-word document (6,000 words longer than in
1987) is straightforward. The Conservatives want to demonstrate that 13
years in power has not left them bereft of imagination or energy: that a new
prime minister has brought with him new and exciting ideas.
For all their public scorn at Labour's recycling of the 'time for a change'
theme, senior ministers believe the popular perception that they held power
for too long rivals the economic recession as the greatest threat on April
9.
The second aim is to persuade the electorate that the central economic
truths of the 1980s have been obscured rather than discredited by the
recession. That low taxes, low inflation, deregulation and enterprise, and
curbs on trades union power remain the precondition for prosperity.
So there is much of which Mrs Thatcher would approve. The manifesto
acknowledges the impracticalities of a 'big-bang' sale of British Rail's
passenger services but the plans to lease services on a regional basis is a
statement of future intent. British Coal is to be sold and
'contractorisation' to the private sector of local authority and Whitehall
services is to be accelerated.
The goal of stable prices is firmly restated. Those close to Mr Major say
that he will be more serious about achieving it than his predecessor.
Ownership will be just as central to the Conservative agenda for the 1990s
as it was in the 1980s. The manifesto promises further tax incentives to
encourage savings and another drive to increase home-ownership through
rents-into-mortgages schemes.
Tax cuts are there. Mr Major will not give a date for the achievement of 20p
basic rate of tax. Nor will there be moves to drive down spending and
borrowing: the document talks of a return 'towards' rather than 'to' budget
balance. But the commitment to leaving people with more of their incomes
remains central.
In some areas the approach is evolutionary. For much of the 1980s the
attitude was that public services should either be privatised or left alone.
The substantive proposals in the Citizen's Charter are an attempt to break
down the dividing line  - to inject private-sector skills into the areas
where the state will maintain overall responsibility.
Health and education will remain part of a welfare state but the disciplines
of the market are to be harnessed in a drive for efficiency.
A sheaf of proposals on housing, ranging from rents-into-mortgages to the
break up of local authority estates, represents a similar shift towards
diversity: to offer more than a simple choice between ownership and a
council tenancy.
If part of Mr Major's pitch is that he is incorporating the successes of the
past, there are signposts to a different future. On one level they are a
matter of tone. The sheer detail in the document reveals a prime minister
who prefers the nuts-and-bolts of practical policy to the grand
philosophical sweep of his predecessor.
In other areas the change of tone becomes one of substance. Mr Michael
Heseltine's interventionism is stamped on the plans to regenerate the inner
cities and the acknowledgement that policy for London must be centrally
co-ordinated. Mr Major's own instincts are reflected in the commitment to
child benefit. There is an attentiveness to the underclass of the 1980s not
seen before.
Some of these shifts are hidden between the lines. But the message to the
voters is there: if they want change they do not have to vote Labour. Mr
Major is offering it.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Economic differences centre
on tax policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S three main parties are heading for the election with similar
macro-economic and monetary policies but differ fundamentally over how to
share the nation's wealth and foster its creation.
The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats accept a large public sector
borrowing requirement in 1992-93 and the monetary discipline of the
Bundesbank through the EMS exchange rate mechanism.
However, their manifestos highlight very different priorities on taxation
policy and the role of the state in encouraging investment and growth.
Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats promise immediate action to combat the
recession. Labour believes 'Britain faces a huge task of national
reconstruction' and makes investment, jobs and training priority areas in
its 'National Recovery Programme'. The Liberal Democrats want a 'new
impetus' and emergency investment 'to end the slump' and cut unemployment by
600,000 in two years.
The Conservatives, by contrast, argue that the foundations of recovery have
been laid. 'What is needed to trigger confidence and growth is a
Conservative victory with a decisive majority.'
All three manifestos are carefully designed not to frighten voters. But deep
underlying differences in philosophy are apparent between the Conservatives
on the one hand and the Labour and, to a lesser extent, the Liberal
Democrats on the other.
Taxation is one obvious area. The Conservatives promise to continue cutting
personal taxes, reduce the threat of inheritance tax for home owners and
also 'lighten the burden of capital taxes and reform the taxation of
savings'. Labour is for 'fair taxes', which as this week's shadow Budget
showed, means lower taxes for about 80 per cent of taxpayers and a sharply
rising tax burden for those earning more than Pounds 22,000 a year.
The Liberal Democrats would reverse the government's plans for a 20p tax
band and add 1p to the basic income tax rate to finance education spending.
Looking further ahead, their manifesto aims to shift 'the burden of taxation
from the things the country needs more of  - income, savings and value added
 - and on to the things we want less of, such as pollution and resource
depletion'.
What differentiates the parties is their attitude to market forces. The
Conservatives work from the presumption that market mechanisms and
incentives should be allowed whenever possible to do their job. The Liberal
Democrats 'know that the free market is the best guarantee of responsiveness
to choice and change', but add that 'the market should be our servant, not
our master'. Labour says: 'Modern government has a strategic role, not to
replace the market but to ensure that the market works properly.'
Labour reserves the right to interfere in broad sectors of the economy in
pursuit of this. It plans, for example, to restore the National Grid to
public control and secure the long-term future of the coal industry by
reducing imports and other measures.
As part of its counter-inflation policy, Labour would 'manage credit
sensibly' and 'stop excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones,
transport and NHS prescriptions'. To strengthen the regions, the party would
'establish new regional development agencies in England, strengthen Scottish
Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and modernise regional
incentives'.
By contrast, the Conservatives promise more privatisation, competition and
deregulation. They place a heavy emphasis on private ownership. Council
house tenants will continue to enjoy 'right to buy' discounts and a
nationwide 'rents to mortgages' scheme is planned. 'Sustaining not just a
home-owning but a capital-owning democracy is crucial to our vision for the
1990s', their manifesto says.
The Liberal Democrats plot a middle course, promising support for
infrastructure investment, training and science and action to stimulate
competition, break up monopolies, promote consumer rights and encourage
decentralised wage bargaining. The Liberal Democrats are also unique in
promising to make the Bank of England operationally independent and planning
a 'savings target' for the nation.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Labour maps route for long
march - The party has played it safe with a pragmatic, upbeat manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DETAILED route map for the long march out of recession is the stolid
impression it seeks to convey. But the real message of Labour's manifesto is
in the mood-music.
A world away from 1983's 'longest suicide note in history' or even the
democratic socialism of 1987, the latest manifestation of the party's
evolution eschews even token gestures to the old Labourism.
Socialism is not mentioned once. Instead, the paper addresses the universal
fears of apolitical middle England  - unemployment, illness, poor schools
and crime  - and tries to provide a prescription to eradicate them.
It is hardly surprising. This close to power, Mr Kinnock and his team are
understandably reluctant to risk giving offence to anyone. In consequence,
the 28-page document adds little to the softly, softly revisionism of the
three policy documents it supersedes.
Some traditional Labour melodies haunt the pages. There is an echo of Harold
Wilson's 'white heat of technology' in the stress on science and innovation.
And even, from time to time, something to remind the reader of the
no-nonsense certainties of Attlee's nanny state.
But the watchword is caution. 'We are the good managers now,' is the theme.
The party leader's foreword gives the explanation. In words that could have
been lifted from Mr Roy Hattersley's treatise, Choose Freedom, Mr Kinnock
states that 'individual liberty' is Labour's core conviction. But he adds:
'For liberty to have real meaning the standards of community provision must
be high and access to that provision must be wide.' Upon this premise, the
10,000-word manifesto is built.
In the economic section, Labour stresses that it will be 'a government which
business can do business with'. The European case for limited intervention
follows. 'Modern government has a strategic role, not to replace the market
but to ensure that the market works properly . . . it is the government's
responsibility to create the conditions for enterprise to thrive.'
When it comes to tax  - not least the new 50 per cent band and the removal
of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions  - the manifesto argues
simply that the moves are both self-financing and fair.
The document moves rapidly on to discuss its approach to industry. Enhanced
capital allowances and 25 per cent tax credits for innovation are stressed
as evidence of Labour's conviction that 'Britain's future must be high
skill, high wage and high tech'. The tripartite spirit also comes through in
the section on training and the unions. 'Training,' it insists, 'will be a
real partnership between government and industry, not an excuse to shift all
the burden on to employers.'
On the unions, too, there are reassuring words for the bosses. A fair
framework of law for 'both employers and unions' will not herald a return to
to the legislation of the 1970s, the manifesto insists.
How convincing is this new-found 'One Nation' Labourism? The answer,
perhaps, is in the sheer conservatism of the manifesto's treatment of health
and education. The document borrows heavily from the Tories' moves towards
quality controls and consumer power, while harking back to 'pure' public
service untainted by market forces.
It is in the omissions and adjustments from Labour's 1987 agenda that the
greatest changes have come. But the party's snail-like progress to the
political centre has been so lengthy, and so laboriously reported, that it
is easy to forget how far it has come.
On Europe, for example, Labour has long played more communautaire than thou
to the Tory sceptics. But not a word is said of the single currency. With
the kind of care Mr Major might apply, it merely states: 'We shall play an
active part in negotiations on Economic and Monetary Union.'
Nuclear weapons  - to be unilaterally discarded under the 1987 manifesto  -
are now a passing paragraph. The clear hint that a Labour government would
retain them indefinitely is mitigated only by a commitment not to deploy
more warheads than those already in service.
The burgeoning wing of Labour constitutional reformers will be disappointed
with the wording that they find.
Buried towards the back of the book, the programme for 'A Modern Democracy'
is nonetheless a touchstone of the new radicalism. Mr Kinnock's fingerprints
are all over the manifesto's final draft.
The Scottish parliament and a Freedom of Information Bill within a first
session are still there. But past hints at English regional administrations
within a first parliament have gone. Reform of the House of Lords and
electoral reform for the Commons  - the goals of the fastest-growing lobby
group within the party  - are mentioned only in a timeframe that might
stretch to the millennium and beyond.
If the manifesto hides hostages to fortune, conservative Mr Kinnock has done
his best to avoid them.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Publication may be loss
leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the Tories and Labour may be trying to appeal to business, neither has
shown much business acumen in the production of its manifesto, Andrew Jack
writes. Labour's document, of which 150,000 copies have been printed, is the
cheapest to obtain. It costs Pounds 1.
But it did not know the printing costs, or how many it needed to sell to
break even.
The Conservatives sell The Best Future for Britain  - of which there are
also 150,000 copies  - for Pounds 1.95, and were equally unsure yesterday
about production costs.
Changing Britain for Good, the Liberal Democrats' offering at Pounds 1.50,
has reached 100,000 copies so far. 'It sells at a price equivalent to a
glossy up-market magazine,' said one official, who estimates that it will
break even on sales of 70,000.
But who will buy them? One of the largest customers is the Civil Service.
The Department of Trade and Industry said that it had bought 464 copies of
each document for its staff.

FT  19 MAR 92 / British Gas is ordered to reinstate woman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS was criticised at an industrial tribunal yesterday for
subjecting a senior woman executive to 'institutionalised sexual
discrimination'.
Ms Hilary Williams, one of the company's 700 senior managers and once tipped
to become the first woman director, was awarded Pounds 8,000 damages plus
costs at the west London tribunal.
Mrs Stella Hollis, who chaired the tribunal, ordered British Gas to
reinstate Ms Williams in her Pounds 45,000-a-year post as the south-west
region's marketing sales manager.
British Gas defended critical remarks made by Mr Tony Roddis, a regional
marketing director, saying they were 'foolish' but did not amount to
discrimination. He had told Ms Williams that she had 'taken like a man' her
replacement by a male colleague, the tribunal heard.
Ms Julie Mellor, British Gas equal opportunities director, said: 'This case
highlights the fact that some aspects of the way we select and redeploy
people need to be reviewed.' Ms Williams commented: 'History has been made
today.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Female directors report widespread inequality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE QUARTERS of female company directors believe women are discriminated
against in the workplace, according to the first survey by the Institute of
Directors of the views of its women members.
A third of the directors said they had had direct experience of sex
discrimination, particularly early in their careers.
Male attitudes at work and employers' failure to take into account the
child-care and domestic responsibilities of their employees were blamed as
the chief causes of the discrimination. There was strong support for the
institute's lobbying for tax relief for child-care costs.
Lady Wilcox, a member of the institute's council who chairs the National
Consumer Council, said there was evidence that, because of the pressures on
women at the top, they were leaving it too late to have children. The survey
reported that 43 per cent of the female directors were childless.
Female directors strongly opposed any system of quotas or targets to boost
the numbers of women in top jobs. Respondents feared they could be accused
of not achieving their positions on merit.
The issue of whether targets should be set for the employment and promotion
of women surfaced last year during the preparation of the employer-led
equality campaign, Opportunity 2000. The BBC, for example, believes strongly
that numerical targets are essential, while as J. Sainsbury, the retail
chain, is opposed.
The institute has 2,600 female members in a total membership in the UK of
more than 33,500. The survey was of a random sample of 200 women directors,
more than 90 per cent of whom were executive directors.
The main findings are:
Men and women are not given equal chances at work according to 74 per cent
of the female directors surveyed. Directors in the service sector felt this
most strongly; 80 per cent in business services, for example, thought there
was inequality, compared with 58 per cent in manufacturing.
The most common reasons given for a lack of equal opportunities were male
attitudes towards women (37 per cent); fewer opportunities for women in
senior positions (33 per cent); difficulties with women returning to work,
child care, flexible working (18 per cent); women's domestic commitments (18
per cent); and the difficulty of women proving themselves in the workplace
(14 per cent).
According to 87 per cent of female directors, women face obstacles not
encountered by men. These are responsibilities to children (35 per cent);
the need for career breaks (29 per cent); male prejudice (23 per cent); not
being taken seriously (21 per cent); lack of child care (16 per cent); and
domestic responsibilities (16 per cent).
Thirty-six per cent of female directors thought they had faced obstacles not
presented to men. They were: women having to prove themselves and work
harder; the assumption that senior positions should automatically be filled
by men; and men not taking women seriously.
Eighty-nine cent said they would oppose the introduction of quotas in their
companies and 69 per cent said they would oppose targets. More than half
gave as the main reason that 'selection should be on merit'.
Too little is done to encourage women to join and stay in the labour force,
according to 67 per cent of female directors. Measures favoured were:
retraining after career breaks (82 per cent); flexible working hours (79 per
cent); workplace nurseries (77 per cent); career breaks (60 per cent);
financial support for private child care (58 per cent).
Actual practice is in sharp contrast to what female directors believe should
happen. Of those who did not think their companies were too small to provide
measures to encourage women, 21 per cent reported that no steps at all were
taken. Only 2 per cent of companies provided workplace nurseries and career
breaks were available in just 23 per cent of cases.
There was a widespread feeling that tax relief should be provided on child
care, with 68 per cent agreeing strongly with the idea and 17 per cent
agreeing quite strongly. Of those with children under 16, 81 per cent agreed
very strongly and 10 per cent agreed quite strongly.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Rise in average earnings still higher than 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDERLYING rate of increase in average earnings remained above 7 per
cent in January, the Department of Employment will announce today. This is
in spite of expectations by some analysts that it would fall below 7 per
cent for the first time since the 1960s.
The underlying measure adjusts actual earnings for temporary influences such
as arrears of pay, variations in the timing of settlements and industrial
disputes.
The latest figure is a mixed blessing for the economy and the government.
Long-term competitiveness within the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System requires average earnings to fall to 5 per cent or below. On
the other hand, a consumer-led recovery and the 'feel good' factor desired
by the government require increases in real earnings to remain high.
Earnings remained static last year because of the sharp rise in
unemployment. However, according to Goldman Sachs, the US securities house,
average earnings for employed workers last year rose by 7.6 per cent.
Furthermore, the disposable income of workers with mortgages has increased
in real terms by more than 10 per cent this year as a result of cuts in
interest rates.
The underlying rate of increase in average earnings will fall below 7 per
cent and could even reach 6 per cent by the middle of the year, according to
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the research group. Some
analysts had expected that the rate of increase in average earnings would
fall below 7 per cent in January, in the light of the new trend for pay
settlements to average between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.
But the underlying rate of increase in average earnings is a year-on-year
figure and thus reflects the much higher settlements of between 8 per cent
and 10 per cent awarded early last year. The actual increase to December
last year, announced last month, was only 6.6 per cent.
Two upward pressures on average earnings remain. First, companies tend to
shed their less skilled workers first and 'hoard' their better-paid, more
highly skilled workers. That creates upward pressure on the pay of those in
work.
Second, the relatively generous public-sector pay review body settlements,
which averaged around 6.5 per cent and will come into effect in April, will
keep the overall rate high until then.

FT  19 MAR 92 / More buyers of PCs avoid dealer networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL computers are being sold increasingly through 'direct' channels
rather than distributors, dealers or other third parties.
The trend in the UK mirrors developments in the US where mail order,
catalogue selling and telesales are playing an increasing part in the
distribution of PCs.
According to Romtec, a Berkshire-based marketing consultancy, direct sales
of PCs in the UK have almost doubled from 12 per cent of sales in 1990 to 23
per cent last year. Sales through the indirect route are static.
Romtec expects the direct-sales boom to continue, with direct channels
accounting for 34 per cent of PC sales this year and 42 per cent in 1994.
Direct channels include the traditional sales technique involving
manufacturers' sales forces as well as mail order and telesales methods not
usually associated with high-technology products.
Two thirds of customers contacted by Romtec cited price as the reason for
buying direct. With prices of personal computers falling each year,
manufacturers are seeking more efficient methods of distribution as profit
margins narrow. The leading manufacturers selling directly last year were
Elonex, Opus Technology, ICL and Dell Computer, which pioneered mail-order
sales in the US.
The total UK PC market is expected to grow by 12 per cent in volume this
year, but indirect sales are expected to fall by 4 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Job losses are highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST half the jobs created between 1983 and 1990 were lost in the 15
months of recession up to the third quarter of last year, according to
research at Glasgow University.
The research says that in spite of the faster rise in unemployment in the
south, 750,000 more people in work there now than in 1979 compared with
500,000 fewer in the north. The north has lost fewer jobs in the recession
because it had less new employment created in the boom.

FT  19 MAR 92 / BR offers 4% rise to most of workforce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL yesterday offered most of its workforce a basic pay rise of 4
per cent. The offer to 96,000 workers would add about Pounds 57m to BR's
annual wages bill.
Unions had expected bigger rises, and the Aslef drivers' union is asking for
a starting wage of Pounds 22,000 a year, which is more than double the
present rate.
Mr Paul Watkinson, BR employee relations director, told union officials that
the offer was in line with inflation and settlements elsewhere.
The RMT union said: 'We are disappointed with the response, but we have said
we will take it away and look at it.'
BR said the offer would increase the basic weekly rate for drivers by Pounds
7.94 to Pounds 206.54. Typical station staff would receive an extra Pounds
5.51 a week, taking their basic rate to Pounds 143.16.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Court speeds up processing of Names' cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH Court yesterday moved to accelerate litigation affecting the
Lloyd's insurance market by allocating all cases involving Names  - the
individuals whose assets back the market  - to one judge, Mr Justice
Saville.
The new approach should result in substantial time and cost savings,
according to Mr Justice Evans, who made the announcement yesterday. The move
was welcomed by Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor acting on behalf of Names
who are seeking injunctions to prevent drawdowns on their deposits by
Lloyd's.
The decision means that a single judge will consider the writs seeking
injunctions issued by Mr Freeman so far on behalf of 791 Names when they
reach the courts at the end of this month.
The Oakeley Vaughan case, in which Mr Justice Gatehouse is presiding, is not
affected. A total of 33 Names are suing Lloyd's for negligence in the case,
which came to court last April. Cases involving three other groups of Names
 - on syndicates managed by the Pulbrook and Poland managing agencies  -
would also be heard by Mr Justice Saville if they came to court.
Mr Justice Saville presided in the Outhwaite case, which was settled out of
court last month with Names winning a Pounds 116m deal.
The move resembles arrangements made last year for the treatment of more
than 170 interest swaps cases.
Meanwhile, two brokers seeking stop-loss insurance for Names announced
yesterday that they had won support from underwriters for a scheme that
could reinsure as many as 2,000 of the market's 22,400 Names.
Fraser Group and Fenchurch Group will offer stop-loss policies providing
coverage of Pounds 100,000 to Names in excess of an amount equivalent to 10
per cent of Names' premium income (the amount of premiums Lloyd's Names are
allowed to receive). It is understood that average rates for the policies
are about 25 per cent higher than last year.
It emerged this week that many underwriters were refusing to lend support to
a separate facility being handled by two other brokers, Holman Wade and
Harrison Stuart.
Brokers say that many Names could leave Lloyd's if they were unable to
obtain stop-loss insurance. This could seriously erode the market's capital
base.

FT  19 MAR 92 / OFT probes property valuing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE OF FAIR Trading confirmed yesterday that it has launched an
investigation into the property valuations market.
The move follows a large number of complaints from members of the public to
the OFT and an exchange of letters between the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors and the OFT.
The OFT believes the valuation market may involve enough anti-competitive
practices to justify a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
It warned the institution in a letter last November that it had received
information about the valuation market which was of general concern. It said
there was substantial evidence that many valuers were appointed to lender's
panels in exchange for introducing mortgage customers to lenders.
Mr Bernard Harris of the OFT said in the letter that the issue of reciprocal
mortgage business appeared almost an invitation to give advice in bad faith.
Under rules in force since the 1970s mortgage lenders are supposed to accept
valuations where possible from surveyors nominated by borrowers. If a
lender-nominated surveyor is used, the potential borrower will probably have
to pay separately for a detailed structural survey.
The Building Societies Association told its members in 1979 that reciprocal
business should not be a 'driving condition' when selecting a valuer for a
lender's panel of surveyors. It is clear, however, that this rule has
largely lapsed.
The association said yesterday that it was updating the circular and would
issue it soon to its members and other mortgage lenders through the Council
of Mortgage Lenders.
The RICS has told the OFT it recognises that valuers are sometimes forced to
supply mortgage business to lenders in return for being included in their
panels. But it believes that this is imposed on valuers against their will
by lenders.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Portrait by Rembrandt expected to reach Pounds 3m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Rosebery is disposing of one of the most important paintings in his
collection to raise money to repair his family's stately home in Scotland.
The painting, a portrait of the religious reformer Johannes Uyttenbogaert,
is regarded as one of the finest privately-owned Rembrandts in the UK. It is
expected to fetch Pounds 3m when auctioned at Sotheby's on July 8.
The painting came to the Rosebery family in the 19th century when the 5th
Earl married into the Rothschilds, who had acquired the work a generation
earlier. It originally hung in Mentmore Towers, the Victorian mansion which
Lord Rosebery sold with its contents in 1977. The appearance on the market
of this important Rembrandt, with the strong possibility that it will sell
to a foreign buyer, will intensify fears that the national heritage is
disappearing abroad with increasing frequency.
The possibility of a Conservative government issuing a list of treasures
that cannot be exported, or of a Labour government increasing the tax burden
of the very rich, is believed to be behind the appearance on the market of
several Old Masters in recent weeks. On April 15 Christie's hopes to sell
another work by Rembrandt as well as paintings by Holbein and Canaletto.
A cello made by Stradivari in about 1690 and owned by the British virtuoso
Robert Cohen sold for Pounds 605,000 at Christie's yesterday to a musician
who remained anonymous.
The price was at the low end of the estimate. Known as the 'Bonjour', the
instrument is considered to be one of the most important cellos to reach the
market in recent years. A Stradivari violin known as the Schreiber and once
loaned to Pinchas Zukerman, the violinist, sold at the top of its estimate
for Pounds 352,000. It also went to a musician.

FT  19 MAR 92 / House sales faltering, estate agents report: Election
uncertainty blamed for hindering recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL in the housing market which appeared to have started at the
beginning of this year has not been sustained, according to a survey of
almost 100 estate agents published yesterday.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) shows
sales and prices continuing to lag in many areas. It provides little comfort
for Conservatives, who hoped that increased activity in the housing market
might encourage a greater feeling of well-being among voters  - the
so-called 'feel good' factor.
Estate agents said election uncertainty was smothering confidence among
potential buyers. Many said the revival in interest from potential buyers at
the start of this year had failed to translate into higher sales in spite of
government attempts to stimulate the market by placing a moratorium until
August on stamp duty on purchases below Pounds 250,000.
The findings conflict with the experience of large housebuilders, which have
seen a marked improvement in their sales in January and February. New
houses, however, account for only about 10 per cent of sales.
One reason for the better sales performance of new properties is that
builders badly need to generate cash. They have therefore been more
realistic about prices and have offered sales incentives to encourage
reluctant buyers.
Builders have also reported a slowing in sales this month, as the election
draws near. Wilson Bowden, one of the 10 largest housebuilders, said sales,
which had risen to 140 a week in February, were now running at about 125 a
week.
Almost 40 per cent of estate agents responding to the RICS said prices had
fallen further in the previous three months. Almost no agents said that
prices had risen. Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building
societies, said average prices fell 1 per cent last month after a similar
fall in January.
According to the institution concern about rising unemployment has meant
that housing markets in London and south-east England remain among the worst
affected, with potential buyers staying away until the result of the
election is known and conditions improve.
Elsewhere markets remained subdued, with one or two exceptions such as
Sunderland, where confidence was boosted by Nissan's decision to spend
Pounds 200m and create 600 jobs at its car plant near the city.
The institution said the ingredients for a gentle recovery in the housing
market  - pent-up demand, lower prices and cheaper finance  - were being
prevented from taking effect by uncertainty caused by the election.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Lower recruiting by banks forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG four clearing banks plan to recruit only 5,000 school-leavers this
year, a seventh of their annual intake in the late 1980s, the Bifu financial
services union said yesterday.
Bifu, which is campaigning to make jobs an election issue among its members,
said that at least 27,000 jobs had been lost among financial services
companies last year. It predicted that at least 30,000 would disappear this
year from the 500,000 that remain.
The prediction that the big four would take on 5,000 school-leavers this
year, made after an analysis of recent monthly intakes at two of the big
four clearers, is about 1,000 fewer than last year's total.
In the late 1980s the finance sector was one of the largest recruiters of
school-leavers. Retailing was one of the few sectors which took in more.
Barclays Bank, traditionally the biggest recruiter among the four, confirmed
a significant drop in recruitment, down from 11,000 in 1988 to about 2,000
last year and roughly the same this year.
It was unable to say how many were school-leavers, but said that of the 1988
figure about 90 per cent were under 19.
Midland Bank said its intake of school-leavers last year was minimal and it
expected the same this year. In 1988 it recruited 2,500 school-leavers.
The reduction in the big four's intake has been mirrored at other financial
services companies.
Norwich Union said its recruitment of school-leavers and graduates this year
was likely to be minimal. In 1987 it took on 554 school-leavers and last
year recruited 251, as well as 64 graduates.
Its decision to freeze recruitment this year  - except in unusual
circumstances, for example if a school-leaver has language skills  - will
have a significant impact in Norwich, where it is one of the largest
employers.
Bifu's prediction of 30,000 job losses this year in the financial services
sector has been raised from about 25,000 mentioned a few weeks ago.
Statements accompanying the clearing banks' financial results led to the
upward revisions.
Mr Leif Mills, Bifu general secretary, has written to the leaders of the
main political parties expressing concern about the job losses and bank
branch closures.
It said: 'We are concerned that the depressed state of the economy will make
us less competitive and remove the UK from the central role in the European
and world financial financial market. This again will have an effect upon
employment in the finance sector.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Labour 'no threat' to big power generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LABOUR government would not threaten the future of the two privatised
electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, according to a report
published yesterday by Robert Fleming Securities, the stockbrokers.
Although Labour had an ostensibly tough policy towards utilities, the firm
said, much of it was political rhetoric.
Labour had two central policies for the electricity industry, the firm
continued. They were to renationalise National Grid Company, which owns the
electricity network of England and Wales, and to protect British Coal. The
firm said it believed that neither policy should affect the generators
significantly.
Labour would be most likely to support British Coal through a direct
Treasury subsidy, which would enable the company to maintain competitive
prices for coal sold to the two generators. Meanwhile, renationalising the
national grid should not affect its profits.
Overall, Robert Fleming believed, a Labour government would not diverge
sharply from the present government's policy of regulating the electricity
market only where necessary.
Dividend growth from the two generators would be at least 10 per cent in the
long term, the report said. It foresaw that enough rival generators would
emerge to satisfy the industry regulator, but not enough to threaten the
market shares of National Power and PowerGen.
This was in sharp contrast to a report from stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete
Wedd earlier this month, which forecast that the two companies would not be
able to maintain dividend growth in the mid 1990s.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Clowes and wife told to pay damages to DTI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER CLOWES and his wife Pamela were ordered by the High Court yesterday
to pay damages to the Department of Trade and Industry which took over the
claims of thousands of small investors who lost out in the collapse of the
Barlow Clowes investment group in 1988.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, said it was incontrovertible that
there had been a fundamental breach of the contract entered into by
investors and there was no defence to the damages claim. The amount of
damages will be assessed later.
Mr Clowes is serving a 10-year jail sentence for fraud.
The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, who cheated investors of an
estimated Pounds 113m by falsely promising to invest their funds in
gilt-edged securities. He spent the money on a yacht, executive jet,
expensive cars and business enterprises.
Only Pounds 1.9m of a Pounds 115m investment fund was found to have been
invested in government stock.
The DTI paid out Pounds 150m in compensation to investors after its attempts
to regulate Barlow Clowes were strongly criticised by the parliamentary
ombudsman.
The DTI had asked the court to grant it immediate judgment in the sum of
Pounds 19.8m, representing the losses suffered by investors in Barlow Clowes
and Partners before the management of its funds was taken over by Barlow
Clowes Gilt Managers in 1987.
The vice-chancellor said that application was 'misconceived,' but the DTI
was entitled to judgment because the investors had been the victims of a
fundamental breach of contract in June 1988 when BCGM was compulsorily wound
up.
Mr and Mrs Clowes, both of whom are legally aided, are considering an
appeal. At present their assets are charged to the joint liquidators of
Barlow Clowes, leaving them without funds.
They were ordered to pay the DTI's legal costs, but the judge said the costs
order was not to be enforced without further leave of the court.
This means in effect that the costs order will not be implemented unless the
couple accumulate money in the future.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Camdessus pleads with US to agree increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), yesterday delivered an urgent plea to the US Congress for it to vote
through America's share of his organisation's proposed Dollars 60bn (Pounds
34bn) capital increase.
Calling the 50 per cent increase in the IMF's capital 'absolutely critical,'
Mr Camdessus begged Washington not to delay voting on its Dollars 12bn
share.
Mr Camdessus warned that without new resources, he might have to halt new
IMF commitments late this year or early in 1993.
'I know some people have suggested this is not urgent, that the IMF quota
increase can safely be postponed. Please believe me this is not so: we need
the additional funds this year,' he told the US Chamber of Commerce
yesterday. But chances of winning early congressional approval for the
increase appeared dimmer than ever yesterday.
Advocates of the capital increase had hoped to attach the measure to a
foreign aid bill before the end of this month, but the breakdown of
negotiations on Israel's request for Dollars 10bn of US loan guarantees now
appears to have killed any prospect of this bill emerging.
Without US agreement, the entire IMF capital increase would be halted,
because the organisation's rules require approval from countries
representing 85 per cent of its votes. The US's 19 per cent voting share is
enough to block the measure.
The need for new capital is especially great because of the call on IMF
resources from the countries of eastern Europe and the republics of the
former Soviet Union.
The IMF chief hopes their membership applications will have been processed
by the summer.
But Democrats in Congress are wary of voting for the IMF funding, which
proved political suicide in 1983. They want the Republican administration to
make a more public commitment to the measure to avert the possibility that
their opponents might use it against them in this autumn's congressional
elections.

FT  19 MAR 92 / US in 'cash for clunkers' pollution plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US plans to introduce an innovative system to allow industrial polluters
to meet environmental standards not by reducing their own emissions, but by
buying up and scrapping heavily polluting old cars.
Companies which bought such cars would be able to offset the amount of
pollution savings against the requirements imposed on them to reduce their
own emissions.
The proposed system, known to the administration as 'mobile/stationary
emission source trading' and to the layman as 'cash for clunkers,' provides
a way of introducing market forces into efforts to improve the environment,
instead of imposing detailed 'command-and-control' regulations.
This kind of market-based environmental protection has been advocated by the
OECD.
The Environmental Protection Agency is to set up a scale of emission credits
for different models of car, based on their level of pollution and likely
future lifespan.
Mr Richard Morgenstern, an administrator at the agency, said cars built
before 1980represented only 38 per cent of the cars on the road in the US
but produced 86 per cent of vehicle carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon
emissions.
'The dirtiest 6 per cent of cars on the road emit 50 per cent of the
hydrocarbons.'
The administration withheld a proposal to couple this measure with a plan to
weaken fuel efficiency standards for cars using reformulated petrol, which
produces lower levels of hydrocarbons.
Carmakers are obliged to meet an average fuel efficiency standard of 27.5
miles per US gallon.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Islamic Jihad says it bombed Israeli embassy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC JIHAD, an underground Shia Moslem Lebanese group close to Iran,
yesterday claimed responsibility for bombing the Israeli embassy in Buenos
Aires in which at least 20 people died and 240 were injured.
Yesterday rescue workers continued to comb the wreckage for two Israeli
embassy officials and up to eight other victims believed still buried under
the rubble.
The group said in Beirut Tuesday's attack was carried out by a suicide
bomber, named Abu Yasser, an Argentine convert to Islam, in reprisal for the
Israeli assassination last month of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah
leader.
Islamic Jihad is an off-shoot of the Lebanese Hizbollah, loyal to Iranian
hardliner Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
The claim, resonant with terms used over the past nine years in other
Islamic Jihad claims of responsibility for bombings and kidnappings,
demonstrated for the first time the ability of the fundamentalist cell to
strike far outside the Middle East.
The Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday denied that Tehran played any
part in Tuesday's attack. It issued a statement 'categorically' denying any
type of relation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and that event.' It
said Iran 'lamented' the bombing and expressed its 'condolences' to the
government and people of Argentina.
Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior min-ister, blamed the attack on
'extremists from abroad who received logistical support' from local groups.
Argentina has Latin America's biggest Jewish community, numbering about
300,000-400,000, as well as a large Arab community, whose most prominent
member is President Carlos Menem, the son of Syrian immigrants.
Argentine officials confirmed that a car bomb loaded with 100kg of
explosives was used to virtually demolish the embassy.
The attack is likely to prompt swift Israeli retaliation against targets in
Lebanon.
Even before the Islamic Jihad claim, senior Israeli officials said they
would inflict 'painful punishment' on those who carried out the attack and
those who sent them.
Officials said the bombing would not cause Israel to withdraw from the
Middle East peace talks.
Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said a 'Damascus-Tehran axis' supported
acts like the embassy bombing and the killing earlier this month in a car
bomb explosion in Ankara of an Israeli embassy security officer.
In Damascus, President Hafez al-Assad denied Syria had been involved in
either this bombing or any such acts and said he did not know who was
responsible for the explosion.

<TEXT>
THE PERUVIAN government and five leading banks have reached agreement on a
cut in interest rates as part of a strategy to depress the overvalued local
currency.
For the past three months the sol has continued to strengthen against the
dollar, to the detriment of exporters and local manufacturers, increasingly
unable to compete with cheap imports.
Interest rates will fall by an average of 3 per cent, discouraging capital
from abroad, which has been flooding into Peru at over Dollars 100m a month.
The participating banks  - comprising about two-thirds of Peru's banking
system  - will now charge 18 per cent annually to customers borrowing in
dollars and 7 per cent a month for local currency.
The new rates 'are not obligatory', explained Mr Carlos Bolona, economy and
finance minister, 'but other banks are invited to co-operate'.
The government has taken steps to reduce banking costs by temporarily
suspending a 0.4 per cent tax on all cheques written.
The central bank appears to be planning to play a bigger role in exchange
rate regulation. Its president, Mr Jorge Chavez, announced that daily dollar
purchases would be increased to a maximum of Dollars 3.5m a day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Mr Hafez al Assad, his Syrian
counterpart, yesterday said they opposed renewed military action against
Iraq, in an apparent signal to the US and its allies to cool talk of such a
step.
Mr Assad, long at loggerheads with Iraq said after several rounds of talks
with his Egyptian counterpart: 'We are not prepared to support military
action against Iraq.' Mr Mubarak echoed his words, saying: 'Supporting the
use of force, we are against it.'
Syria and Egypt both sent ground forces to join the coalition which ousted
Iraq from Kuwait, but are now cautioning restraint because of fears that
renewed conflict might fuel instability in the region.
The five permanent members of the Security Council have become increasingly
frustrated over Iraq's tardiness in complying with Gulf war ceasefire terms
which require the destruction of its nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile
facilities. The US and Britain have revived talk of military action in order
to exert additional pressure on Baghdad.
Mr Assad said, meanwhile, that Syria would continue to participate in Middle
East peace talks with Israel, but he doubted Israel's sincerity. Damascus
had been threatening to withdraw over what it claims is Israeli
intransigence.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Conservatives seek political life beyond Treurnicht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOUTH AFRICA'S ultra-right Conservative Party (CP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the last and most fervent champion of apartheid  - is in the market for a
new policy, and a new leader.
Its dream of creating separate tribal homelands for each of the white and
black tribes of South Africa  - originally the platform of the National
Party, but latterly the goal of the Conservatives  - was firmly rejected in
the referendum. The voters' verdict on Mr Andries Treurnicht, the CP leader,
was equally harsh. He is unlikely to survive the humiliation.
The whites-only poll was the Conservatives' last chance to win power through
the ballot box; a 'no' vote would have forced the ruling National Party to
resign, leaving the CP with certain victory in the ensuing general election.
Now there will never be a CP government  - unless the military should decide
to install one, a most unlikely prospect.
The CP can still claim to represent more than 1m voters  - fully 30 per cent
of the white electorate  - but it cannot force through its lunatic plans for
social engineering.
Even before the referendum defeat, the party had begun to jettison some of
its policies in a move to occupy the centre-right of white politics. An
influential group of younger, more moderate CP members of parliament  - led
by the witty and articulate Mr Koos van der Merwe, and the brothers Pieter
and Corne' Mulder, members of a famous South African political family  -
sought to hijack party policy from older reactionaries who clung to
old-style apartheid. They defended the campaign for a separate Afrikaner
state by arguing that this was no more odious than the demand for an
independent Croatia, merely a reflection of the ethnic nationalism sweeping
Europe.
They forced the ultra-conservative leadership of the party to reverse its
decision to boycott the poll, arguing that the CP could not refuse to fight
with honour. Then they unilaterally announced policy changes which caught
senior leaders off guard. Mr van der Merwe said the CP would not reinstate
apartheid. However, this was largely sleight of hand: apartheid laws would
not be needed in the white homeland which Mr van der Merwe proposed, because
blacks would not be citizens of such a state. They could be kept out by visa
curbs, rather than the hated pass laws.
The maverick MPs also said the CP was willing to negotiate political reform
with blacks. Official party policy has been to boycott the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-racial forum which is
negotiating a new constitution. Party officials now say they are ready to
talk  - though not in Codesa, where voting rules favour the National Party
and the African National Congress (ANC).
But most importantly, the CP compromised on its central demand that whites
should occupy 87 per cent of South Africa as their own homeland, with
millions of blacks crowded on to tribal states on the remaining 13 per cent.
That was the original plan of apartheid: a constellation of black states
federated to a large white nation. The concept of a loose confederation will
remain, even after yesterday's defeat; but it seems likely that the CP will
dramatically scale down its demand for land.
Eventually, the more moderate party faction would probably settle for strong
regional government in areas such as the Western Cape where there are large
numbers of whites, rather than a fully-fledged geographic homeland.
The CP is likely to end up placing more moderate demands on the table at
Codesa. But it is too early to say whether the party will split over the
issue.
Mr Treurnicht is almost certain to step down, but the battle has yet to
begin between Mssrs Mulder and the more conservative Mr Andries Beyers. Once
the choice is made, the defeated candidate could lead an exodus of loyal MPs
out of the party. That could leave an ultra-radical core of right-wingers in
the Conservative party, with a 'new right' faction sitting at the table in
Codesa.
Conceding defeat in the referendum, Mr Treurnicht warned that the white
'struggle for freedom and survival' had entered a new phase. It was
'continuing in even greater earnestness than before'. The new phase would
not include armed action, but he added: 'We say to de Klerk, don't force us
under a Marxist government.'
It is clear the wishes of 876,000 white voters who voted 'no' cannot simply
be ignored. In fact, the right could prove more dangerous than ever. Many of
the more fanatical Conservatives will feel the constitutional route to
opposition has been blocked: the hard core now claims to have a moral
justification for violence.
Their numbers would be few  - witness the pitifully small demonstrations
staged by the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) during the
campaign  - but a few well-placed bombs could cause considerable havoc, and
seriously damage the prospects for reform.

Blacks in Johannesburg  - above  - celebrate the referendum results before

FT  19 MAR 92 / Budget targets black issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday presented a budget for 'equity through growth and
stability', with a commitment to higher spending to improve economic
conditions for blacks.
Total expenditure for 1992-93 will rise by 16.5 per cent to R100.7bn (Pounds
20.1bn), a 2 per cent growth in real terms. Revenue is budgeted to increase
by 15.8 per cent from the revised estimate for 1991-2 to R84.8bn.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the minister of finance, described the budget as
'exceptionally difficult', in the light of the demands which had to be
financed from stagnant revenues. "
Considerable progress is made towards equalising pension payments, with the
gap between different racial groups narrowing by 40 per cent. After the
changes monthly pensions will be: Whites - R345; Coloureds and Indians-
R318; Blacks - R293. The remaining discrepancies will be removed next year.
There were also large increases in expenditure on education, housing and
health. Defence spending is cut by 9 per cent in real terms, but most of the
monies released are taken up by a 22 per cent increase in the police vote.
The burden of financing the increased expenditure falls on the individual
taxpayer, who will pay 26 per cent more in tax than in 1991-92, largely as a
result of fiscal drag, whereby wage increases for inflation have pulled more
earners into higher tax bands. There is some relief for middle and lower
income taxpayers, who are taken into lower tax bands by a simplified income
tax banding structure.
Individuals will pay 40.3 per cent of tax in 1992-93, compared to 33.1 per
cent as recently as 1990-91 and 26.8 per cent in 1977-78. Customs and excise
levies are to be increased, and the petrol price will rise by 8 cents a
litre.
A negative trend is the large size of the deficit which is estimated at
R15.9bn for 1992-93, or 4.5 per cent of GDP  - the same size as the eventual
deficit in 1991-92; R1.6bn of the deficit would be financed from sales of
strategic stockpiles, mainly oil.
Finance department officials said the size of the deficit was a 'temporary"
but acceptable diversion from the IMF norm of a 3 per cent deficit.
Economists, however, have expressed concern at the implications of such a
large deficit for the size of the government debt. Debt servicing will
account for about 16 per cent of spending in the budget.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Financial markets cheered but remain cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Foreign and Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSER trade, investment, and financial links with South Africa were
predicted in the financial and business community yesterday following the
referendum, although there was caution about the future.
Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest commercial banks, said it would
proceed with a bond issue for Escom, the electricity utility, which had been
postponed during the referendum. It will lead an international consortium
for the issue.
German banks have already paved the way for South Africa's return to the
international capital markets after a six-year absence. Deutsche Bank, the
country's biggest bank, was the lead manager in a DM400m (Pounds 139m) issue
for the republic last September, increased from DM300m because of strong
investor demand.
Deutsche Bank yesterday welcomed the outcome, as did Mercedes-Benz, one of
Germany's largest corporate investors in South Africa. Mercedes said the
vote was a vindication of its decision to stay in South Africa  - where it
employs nearly 5,000 people.
Corporate America's initial reaction was muted. A handful of companies and
banks surveyed said it was too early to plunge back into major investment in
South Africa.
Ms Jennifer Kibbe, an official at the Washington-based Investor
Responsibility Research Centre, which tracks US investment in South Africa,
said US companies regarded the referendum vote 'as a necessary, but not a
sufficient condition for them to go back in.'
Citicorp, the biggest US bank, bank indicated it would need to see what type
of interim government came to power before it could consider changing its
position. Citicorp which closed its office in South Africa in 1987, does
have a limited business in South African ADRs (American depository
receipts), but it is unlikely to expand that business immediately. After
sanctions were lifted Citicorp said it had no plans to resume lending and
that position has not changed.
The Ford motor company, which withdrew in 1988, said it would conduct a full
review before changing its position.
Among British companies, Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa in
1986 in response to student protests, said it was a positive result but that
it would wait to see how the situation developed. 'As the political
situation and economic climate becomes clearer .. it is possible that in the
future Barclays may establish some representation in South Africa to look
after large corporate business in that country and to service the bank's
global clients,' the bank said.
RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it was
'delighted'. It saw 'nothing but good coming out of the complete integration
of southern Africa.'
On the international bond market, the result was widely seen as likely to
bring forward further bond issues from the republic. Bankers said further
political headway would have to be made before there was fresh fund-raising.
South Africa has launched three international bond issues since last summer,
two in the name of the republic and one in the name of the Development Bank
of South Africa. All have been sold mainly to German private investors,
rather than institutions. Concern about political risk, and ethical or legal
obstacles, still loom large.
The republic's Ecu250m (Pounds 178m) of bonds, launched in January, were
trading at a yield of 10.63 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point above offer
price  - a reflection that demand for the bonds, though reported to have
picked up yesterday, has yet to affect the price.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Exporters keen for CIS deals find back-up
lacking - Problems of finance are proving a brake on business with republics
of the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of doing deals in the fast-liberalising central European
countries that used to make up the Soviet Union is tantalising. The reality
is more sobering, and the single most critical barrier is finance: the
freezing of joint-venture bank accounts, announced early in March, is the
latest contributor to chronic uncertainty.
Exporters keen to do deals are anxiously awaiting agreement between the
International Monetary Fund and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
on a programme to manage debt repayments, share debt responsibilities
between the republics and identify sovereign guarantors.
But they would be rash to expect the IMF programme to provide the
transparency and security they seek. In view of already giddying levels of
exposure to possible CIS default in countries such as Germany and Italy,
there can at best be a cautious and selective resumption of business.
To pinpoint good business in the chaotic atmosphere of the former Soviet
Union is a perplexing matter. Trading and financial institutions have
disappeared overnight. People experienced in foreign trade are on the move.
Privatisation plans are creating turmoil in Russia.
Inexperienced officials in other republics are wrestling with the awesome
task of filling the void left as Moscow-led institutions have been cut
adrift. Raw material supplies to factories are in jeopardy wherever they can
be sold to the west for foreign exchange. Banks that can be trusted as
sovereign guarantors for projects are almost totally absent outside Russia.
Even government-backed loans, such as the Pounds 280m offered to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin by UK Prime Minister John Major during a London
visit in January, are blocked until the IMF has agreed a programme with the
former Soviet republics. This would have to include identification of
sovereign guarantors.
Already a queue of more than 300 UK projects hopes to tap the British loan.
It is clear that even the most worthy and viable of projects can expect
little in the way of export credit cover. Country by country throughout the
west, an uncommon unanimity exists over their unwillingness to provide
export credit cover. Instead of 'caveat emptor' the watchword is 'caveat
vendor'.

</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Mexico are near accord on arrangements to end dolphin deaths in
tuna fishing nets, paving the way for lifting the US embargo on imports of
yellowfin tuna from Mexico, Venezuela and some 20 other nations. The embargo
was condemned by a Gatt disputes panel last year as against international
fair trade rules, to the fury of environmental groups who want to use trade
sanctions to enforce 'green' behaviour.
Mr Jesus Seade, Mexico's ambassador to Gatt, told its governing council
yesterday that the proposed multilateral accord would involve a five-year
moratorium from March 1994 on yellowfin tuna fishing using purse nets in the
eastern tropical Pacific.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the White House was putting
forward legislation to Congress to promote an international solution to
dolphin protection and end the embargo. The Gatt panel on the US embargo,
imposed on Mexico, Venezuela and about 20 countries re-exporting yellowfin
tuna from these two countries, was originally requested by Mexico. It later
dropped the issue to promote talks on a North American Free Trade Agreement.

<TEXT>
TALKS aimed at resolving the EC-US row over subsidies to civil aircraft
makers resume in Washington next week, after two-and-a-half days' discussion
ended inconclusively in Brussels yesterday.
This week's talks between senior EC and US trade officials had been billed
as the last chance for a deal before the self-imposed deadline of March 31,
when the US may seek a ruling from the Gatt disputes panel on the issue.
An EC spokesman said yesterday progress had been made on technical issues,
but added: 'There are still problems of substance which are not negligible.'
The US is unhappy about subsidies which it says EC governments have been
paying to Airbus Industrie, the European manufacturing consortium.
The EC counters that US aircraft-makers have enjoyed subsidies from their
government in the guise of space or defence research grants.
Officials refused to comment on the detail of the talks yesterday, but the
outstanding problems are likely to include US attempts to lower the
proportion of grants awarded to Airbus, and improve the transparency of the
consortium's financing.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Ukraine to return N-missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE was reported yesterday to have backed down from its threat to retain
possession of tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told parliamentary deputies he had
been assured by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, that the
missiles would be returned to Russia by July 1 as planned. A Nato spokesman
was also quoted as saying Ukraine had pledged to do so.
Last week, Mr Kravchuk announced he would halt the transport of the missiles
because of instability in Russia. In Kiev, Maj Gen Georgy Zhevitsa, chief of
the Ukrainian general staff, said he had no information of a change of
policy.
But a western diplomat in Moscow commented: 'We can assume that someone in
the west has sat pretty hard on Mr Kravchuk.'
If confirmed, this would be the second turnaround in Ukrainian policy due to
international pressure in the past few days. Last week, the government
agreed to jointly repay the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union, having
originally insisted on individual repayment of its share, put at 16.37 per
cent.
Meanwhile, another warning of disintegration in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) armed forces was delivered yesterday by Colonel
General Viktor Samsonov, CIS chief-of-staff. Speaking to the army daily
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Samsonov said the army was facing widespread
desertions and evasions of the draft in the face of rising ethnic struggles,
especially in the Caucasus. 'The situation has arisen where we can no longer
defend ourselves. There is no-one left. There are units in which officers
have to stand guard. It is shameful,' he said.

Armenia has declared a state of emergency because of a growing economic
crisis caused by civil strife and a blockade by Azerbaijan, Armenian radio
said yesterday, Reuter reports.
The announcement came as leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia scrapped peace
talks proposed for this week, casting fresh doubt on prospects for settling
the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave populated mostly by
ethnic Armenians but surrounded and administered by Azerbaijan.
In a statement, monitored by the BBC, the republic's foreign ministry
yesterday called on the international community to persuade Azerbaijan to
end the blockade.
The dispute coupled with civil strife in Georgia to the north has virtually
closed Armenia's supply routes for months, starving it of the oil and gas it
needs to generate electricity, the fuel it needs to run vehicles and the
food it imports for its 3m people.

POLAND'S government yesterday approved a controversial draft budget which
would include large cuts in education, health and welfare spending in an
attempt to curtail inflation, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The draft was presented to the cabinet by Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance
minister who this week wrested assurances from the International Monetary
Fund in Washington that the deficit of Zl65,500bn (Pounds 2.8bn) written
into the document was acceptable as a basis for talks on reactivating a
Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) extended loan facility.
The facility was suspended last year when Poland failed to meet its
performance criteria. The IMF also agreed to encourage western governments
to help finance some of this year's deficit.
Ministers expressed dismay at having their spending plans curtailed but Mr
Marcin Gugulski, the government spokesman dismissed the possibility of
protest resignations and said 'the entire cabinet would stand by the budget
in parliament' when it is debated next month.

AFGHAN President Najibullah offered yesterday to hand over power to an
interim government proposed by the United Nations as part of a plan to end
the 13-year-old civil war in his country, Reuter reports from Kabul.
He made the offer in a broadcast over the state radio and television after
talks with a UN envoy. 'I agree that once an understanding is reached
through the United Nations process for the establishment of an interim
government in Kabul, all powers and executive authority will be transferred
to the interim government as of the first day of a transition period,' he
said.
Mr Najibullah, whose regime has survived the withdrawal of Soviet troops,
said he would not insist on his participation in a proposed assembly of 150
Afghans from all sides of the war which the UN plans to hold in late April
in Vienna or Geneva as a prelude to the interim government, which must halt
the war and hold elections.
He said the interim government must have the appropriate powers and
authority to 'guarantee the unity, safety and security of the Afghan people,
as well as the territorial integrity of Afghanistan'.
'The interim government should also guarantee full respect for human rights,
and organise and conduct free and fair elections for the establishment of an
elected government of Afghanistan.' No immediate reaction was available from
guerrilla parties fighting the Kabul government.
Radical guerrilla groups have already rejected the UN peace plan, which has
been backed by the moderate guerrilla groups as well as Pakistan and Iran.

Oil and other energy prices in Russia will soon be freed, according to Mr

The date will be kept secret so that energy producers will not hold back
supplies. The price rises are expected soon, however, because the cost of
subsidies is crippling to the Russian government. In addition the income of
the oil producers is insufficient to stimulate investment and greater
production. The energy minister is under great pressure from other former
Soviet republics, especially Ukraine, to delay the oil price rise because of
the economic effects it would have.

THE Russian government is finalising details of a mass privatisation
programme which could place 50 per cent of the shares of Russian industry in
private hands within a year, according to one of President Boris Yeltsin's
closest foreign advisers.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University in the US said yesterday that
foreign investors would play a key role in the sale of 'dozens' of the
largest Russian enterprises in the oil, gas telecommunications and car
sectors.
Shares in thousands of other industrial enterprises would be offered to
workers, management and the public through a system of individual vouchers
and investment trusts, similar to those being used in privatisation
programmes in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
Prof Sachs, speaking to European journalists by satellite before testifying
to Congress in Washington yesterday, stressed that it was essential that a
sense of ownership be introduced into Russian industry as soon as possible.
Details of the mass privatisation programme would be unveiled in a few
weeks, he said.
Prof Sachs outlined plans under which most industrial companies with fewer
than 500 employees would be sold to their workers and management under
favourable conditions.
The Russian public would be able to participate in the privatisation of
larger enterprises following legal changes later this year defining property
rights, creating a civil code and detailing the responsibility of company
directors.
Prof Sachs repeated earlier warnings about the low level of Western
financial support for Russian economic reforms, and said 'the next couple of
months will be crucial' to the success of the programme. He said that most
west European countries were prepared to back IMF proposals for Russia, but
said the US had so far failed to appreciate the need for quick action to
support the Russian reforms.
'Russia can escape from hyperinflation,' he said, 'but if the west sits back
and leaves the rouble weak, then the industrial and regional collapse
already evident in the country could multiply.'
Russia yesterday announced plans to more than double the minimum wage,
although the new level will still be only half the amount needed for bare
essentials, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The Russian deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin told parliament the
government planned to raise the minimum monthly wage to Rbs750 from next
month. The present minimum wage is Rbs342, the same as the minimum pension,
which is to be raised to Rbs650).

FT  19 MAR 92 / Major maps out series of new policies: Kinnock stresses
revival aims as main parties launch manifestos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR committed the Tories yesterday to a raft of new policies in an
attempt to seize the initiative during the last three weeks of the election
campaign.
As the Conservatives and Labour presented their manifestos for the election,
two opinion polls gave further conflicting signals about their standings
with the voters.
In the wake of surveys this week pointing to a five-point Labour lead, a
Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph showed the Conservatives holding a
two-point advantage. By contrast, an NOP survey for The Independent gave
Labour a four-point lead.
Mr Neil Kinnock unveiled a prospectus with few surprises, emphasising his
party's commitment to economic revival and to long-term investment in the
economy and the welfare state.
But a re-statement of Labour's plans to take control of the water industry
and of the national electricity grid brought sharp falls in the shares of
the water and electricity companies. The falls came in spite of suggestions
from senior party figures that such control might well fall short of
renationalistion. The party looks more likely to opt for closer regulation
of the industries.
The glossy 29,000-word Conservative prospectus for the 1990s, entitled the
Best Future for Britain, promised to stick to the core economic policies of
Mr Major's predecessor. It pledged further cuts in the taxes on incomes,
savings and inheritance and a renewed drive towards deregulation and
privatisation.
Mr Major emphasised the importance of the Citizen's Charter in improving the
quality of public services by announcing the creation of a cabinet post to
oversee its implementation.
Speaking at press conference to launch the manifesto, he said its essential
goal was to extend 'choice, ownership, opportunity and responsibility'.
British Rail freight and parcels operations are to be sold, along with
British Coal. But, initially at least, BR passenger services are to be
franchised on a regional basis rather than sold.
Mr Major insisted he aimed to 'build on the successes of the last 12 years',
but the manifesto also set out a clutch of policies designed to counter any
'mood for change' among the voters.
Alongside typically 'Thatcherite' plans to extend curbs on union powers and
to boost home ownership, it pledged public money to revitalise inner cities,
and policies on health care and social security leading to a generous as
well as prosperous society.
The manifesto included scores of measures designed to appeal to specific
groups.
Labour's document  - It's Time to get Britain Working Again  - sought
largely to reconfirm the party's shift to the centre ground since 1987. The
28-page manifesto, condensing the 1991 paper, Opportunity Britain, sought to
promote the Pounds 2.7bn in new funding for economic recovery and public
services in Mr John Smith's Budget. Stressing the need to counter the
recession's impact, the manifesto promises immediate action on investment,
jobs and training to build 'sustained and sustainable recovery for the
future'.
Measures include a Pounds 1.1bn package of enhanced capital allowances for
industry and job creation, Pounds 1bn for the health service and Pounds 600m
for education funded by the planned tax increases on the higher paid.
The 10,000-word paper was also at pains to limit its commitments on
constitutional reform. Earlier hints that regional assemblies for England
and reform of the House of Lords might be pledged within the lifetime of a
parliament have not emerged.
Mr Kinnock used his foreword to commend a Labour government as offering 'a
fresh start for Britain'. He concluded: 'It will mean greater freedom,
security and opportunity. It will mean change for the better.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Retail sales show rise for second consecutive month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET sales rose modestly in February, perhaps indicating a cautious
upturn in consumer demand.
Sales rose 0.4 per cent, the second consecutive monthly rise, bringing the
year-on-year increase over February 1991 to 1.5 per cent.
The three-monthly figure, the best guide of the underlying trend according
to the Central Statistical Office, was less encouraging.
Sales grew by only 0.1 per cent in the three months to February compared
with the previous three-month period. In the six months to January sales
hardly grew.
The Conservative party said the rise indicated imminent economic recovery.
'Retail sales volumes are now firmly established on a modest upward trend,
as consumer confidence is being restored,' said Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's spokesman on trade and industry, said that
hundreds of jobs remained at risk in Britain's high streets.
Economists yesterday cautioned against reading too much into the figures,
saying the pick-up could easily be reversed.
Mr Michael Saunders, of securities' house Salomon Brothers, said: 'The trend
in retail sales is still generally flat. Consumer spending in coming months
is likely to be held back by weak personal incomes and falling personal
wealth.'
The official figures showed that last month's rise was concentrated in mixed
business - mainly department stores - where sales rose by 3.4 per cent on
the month. Non-food sales rose 0.7 per cent on the month after falling 1.6
per cent in January. Food sales dropped 1.2 per cent in February after
rising 2.3 per cent during January.
Sales in household goods - rose 3 per cent in the three months to February
compared with the previous three month period. On the year, household good
sales in the latest three months rose by 5 per cent although all the
year-on-year comparisons were distorted by weak sales a year ago during the
Gulf war.
The more optimistic view of the economy suggested by yesterday's retail
sales figures contrasts with the monthly output figures earlier this week
which showed a fall of 0.7 per cent in February. The year on year decline in
manufacturing output was 3.5 per cent.
The two sets of figures suggest that, in order to meet demand, retailers are
running down stocks rather than making new orders.

FT  19 MAR 92 / De Klerk heralds new S Africa: World leaders welcome 70%
vote to end apartheid in whites-only referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday promised to change the face of South Africa
as he celebrated the white electorate's overwhelming endorsement of his
reform policies.
Nearly 70 per cent of the voters in Tuesday's whites-only referendum backed
an end to minority rule in what is one of the most momentous decisions in
their 400-year history.
It brought a unanimous welcome from the international community and raised
hopes for a new era of peace in southern Africa.
Mr de Klerk captured the spirit of a remarkable day for South Africa when he
told the country: 'It doesn't often happen that in one generation a nation
gets the opportunity to rise above itself. The white electorate has risen
above itself in this referendum.'
He added: 'Today we closed the book on apartheid.'
The mandate, a triumph for Mr de Klerk who staked his political future on
the outcome, could lead to an interim multiracial government within months.
Mr de Klerk said: 'Today is the real birthday of the real, new South African
nation . . . let us use this magnificent result as a great impetus for what
we have to do. We have changed, and we will change, the face of South
Africa.'
He called the poll after the government's defeat in last month's
Potchestroom by-election and promised to resign and hold a general election
if he failed to win support for his reforms.
The 3.3m white electorate was clearly galvanised into an 86 per cent turnout
by the prospect of a rightwing government trying to reintroduce apartheid
and reviving international hostility
The future of the rightwing Conservative party is now uncertain. Some
members may continue to pursue their claim for a white homeland at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for
constitutional talks.
Others may echo the defiance of the CP leader, Dr Andries Treurnicht. 'I
will never enter talks where I have to beg for my freedom from Nelson
Mandela,' he said yesterday: 'The struggle for freedom and survival is now
continuing with even greater earnestness.'
Mr Mandela, president of the African National Congress, described the
outcome as 'a source of encouragement to all in South Africa'  - but
continued to insist that sanctions should remain until an interim government
was in place.
International leaders welcomed the outcome. Mr John Major said 'the result
would never have been achieved without the courage and leadership shown by
President de Klerk. I congratulate the white electorate for choosing the
path of reform'.
US president George Bush welcomed Mr de Klerk's endorsement and said he
believed all races should join in building a new democracy.
President Francois Mitterrand said France rejoiced at the massive yes vote
while Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, responded
warmly to the referendum result. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth
secretary-general, said the result was 'a vote of confidence in a non-racial
future'.
The ruling National party and 18 other political organisations, including
the ANC, have agreed on a framework for a transitional administration.
The agreement at Codesa provides for a multiracial power-sharing
administration which would draw up a post-apartheid constitution.
But ANC officials, concerned by the continuing violence in black townships,
struck a cautious note, seeing the 30 per cent whites who voted for the
rightwing Conservative party and its extremist allies as a potentially
destabilising factor.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Midland rebuffed Lloyds' takeover advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK is privately furious with Midland Bank following Midland's
decision to reject a takeover proposal after two months of negotiations.
On Tuesday, Midland announced that it had agreed to be bought by Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation in a deal which is likely to create a
transcontinental bank with a market value of Pounds 8bn. But it emerged
yesterday that only two weeks earlier Midland had told Lloyds it did not
wish to be bought by it. Negotiations between the two banks began in
January.
The talks were the initiative of Lloyds' chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman.
'He thought he had reached agreement with Midland,' said a financier with a
close knowledge of the negotiations. 'He was deeply disappointed when
Midland said it was no longer interested.'
One banker close to Lloyds said he did not believe the bank would now make a
hostile bid for Midland.
The Bank of England was told of the talks and raised no objection to an
agreed takeover of Midland by Lloyds. It advised both banks that they might
face difficulties persuading the competition authorities in Brussels and the
UK to sanction the deal, because a combination of the two banks would be a
powerful force in the UK banking market.
The negotiations were conducted by Sir Peter Walters and Mr Brian Pearse,
respectively chairman and chief executive of Midland, and by Sir Jeremy
Morse, chairman of Lloyds, and by Mr Pitman. Midland was advised by the
merchant bank SG Warburg and Lloyds by Baring Brothers.
A banker close to Midland said yesterday it decided to reject Lloyds'
advances having been given legal advice that the competition authorities
were likely to block a bid.
Another banker said Mr Pearse was also concerned at the impact on morale
within Midland of a deal with Lloyds. Mr Pitman's prime goal in buying
Midland was to cut the costs of the combined operations by closing branches,
shutting one of the banks' head offices and shedding up to 20,000 staff.
Midland's board was informed of the talks with Lloyds. Mr William Purves,
chairman of Hongkong Bank, is a Midland board member. Hongkong Bank has had
a 14.9 per cent stake in Midland since the end of 1987 and had considered
buying the whole bank.
Its takeover plans were put on ice at the end of 1990. At the end of
February Mr Purves reactivated these plans having learned of Lloyds'
interest.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (55): A new way to look at
company finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE multimedia applications have focussed on traditional areas such as
training and 'point-of-sale' information, there are signs that the
technology could move into mainstream applications.
This month, UK software company Pegasus is launching a multimedia 'front
end' for its accountancy software. The software for the 'front end' is
derived from a package called Show Business, a program which can be used to
build multimedia applications on top of Microsoft's Windows 3 environment.
Mr Morel Fourman, managing director of Show Business developer Samore, says
that the Pegasus 'front end' will bring a new dimension to accountancy
software.
'The idea came from the need to present accounting information to senior
executives,' he says. 'Traditionally, accountancy software has the databases
and the reporting tools - by adding multimedia you can start to interpret
the information they provide.'
Mr Fourman goes on to say that the combination turns out ' by accident' to
be an executive information
system - and therefore gives senior executives a simple way to look at their
company's financial position and make informed decisions.
The Show Business software sets up 'buttons' on the screen which can be used
to provide more information about an item in a display.
An example would be a button on a total sales field which, when selected,
would display a more detailed breakdown of the figures.
The data used to create the sales figures is derived directly from the
order-processing and invoicing processes in the accountancy software.
The idea has already worked well in practice, says Mr Fourman. The UK
Department of the Environment (DOE) has used the Show Business software to
prepare data from a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet for assessment under its Green
House Programme. The Programme aims to channel funding to UK regions to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and involved the assessment of nearly 500
detailed 'bids' from regional authorities.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (51):  Technology Briefing - Back
to the bells and whistles: The instant visual appeal of multimedia
technology and the promise it holds for new applications often detract from
the real issues of its application. This is particularly noticeable in the
lack of genuine business uses of multimedia - although this looks set to
change.  Developments in multimedia technology.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE IDEA of multimedia technology is attractive
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
both to suppliers and to users. It has an instant visual appeal. It can be
demonstrated easily to impress potential users. And it promises to open the
door to exciting new applications.
Multimedia technology combines animated, high-resolution graphics and video,
hi-fi sound, computer data, communications and - most important of all -
interaction between the system and its user.
Simply put, multimedia brings back the flashing lights and 'bells and
whistles' which made the first computers so exciting.
But in the same way that the flashing lights blinded users to the problems
of getting computers to work, multimedia technology can be a distraction if
it is not applied properly. As far as business applications are concerned,
multimedia is still a technology looking for a problem to solve.
So far, the main application of multimedia technology has been in
traditional applications such as training and 'point-of-sale' information.
But there are clear signs that this will change in the next two years.
Hardware and software suppliers now have well-advanced products, costs are
falling and the standards' infrastructure, which is needed to make
multimedia a success, is beginning to emerge.
At the same time, genuine commercial applications in areas such as executive
information systems (EIS) and business simulation, have started to appear.
In common with most marketing terms, multimedia has, unfortunately, come to
mean whatever suppliers want it to mean.
As a result, the term is applied to everything from a 'charting' module in a
spreadsheet program to a full-blown digital audio/video presentation system.
But a consensus appears to have settled on a definition of multimedia which
includes audio, video, graphics, data and text, held in a digital form under
the control of a computer.
The 'digital' element is important. It distinguishes multimedia computing
from earlier technologies such as interactive video - where an analogue
video machine is controlled by a digital computer.
The conversion of traditional media into a common digital format is what
gives multimedia its wide appeal. It means that any type of data can be
stored, transmitted and manipulated with software.
It also means that the data can be mixed together easily - so, for example,
a graph showing increased sales can be accompanied by a video picture of the
salesperson. Or, an estate agent's description of a house can be accompanied
by a video 'tour' and so on.
The complete media 'package' can, in digital code, be transmitted over a
network, stored on a floppy disk or even transferred to standard video
format.
Mr Morel Fourman, managing director of UK multimedia specialist
Samore,describes multimedia as 'the ultimate cognitive tool' and sees it as
the most effective
way to present complex information - 'people's cognitive response to
information goes up each time you add an extra medium. Multimedia offers the
possibility of the maximum cognitive bandwidth,' he explains.
'We are standing on a growing pyramid of information but we have no way to
interpret it. Multimedia gives us the point of the pyramid.'
He defines the formal function of multimedia as a way to make information
'timely, relevant, understandable and accessible.'
Apple Computer, one of the leading players in the multimedia market, has a
more pragmatic view: 'Multimedia is about making technology available to the
masses. It brings ease of use to interactive television,' says Ms Ferhan
Cook, multimedia marketing manager at Apple Europe.
She emphasises that the key to multimedia's success is good software: 'Apple
has recognised that we must offer more software because multimedia is
software-driven - with everything going digital, this is inevitable.'
Apple was one of the first manufacturers to see the potential of multimedia
technology and has promoted its Macintosh as an 'engine' for multimedia
applications since the launch of its Hypercard software in 1988.
Hypercard was one of the first software packages to combine different
presentation media into a single program.
Apple hopes, with its multimedia products, to repeat the success it had with
desktop publishing systems in the mid-1980s.
But Apple is not alone in the market and there is a fierce battle raging
between suppliers over which technology and formats will dominate
multimedia.
There are parallels with earlier technologies such as camera film formats,
audio recording technology and video. All of these technologies appeared in
many different and incompatible forms until a dominant 'standard' emerged.
Multimedia is no exception. Computer manufacturers, software developers and
consumer electronics companies are currently jockeying for position and
backing one or other of the potential standards for multimedia.
In the last year, leading computer hardware manufacturers, in particular,
have moved aggressively into the market.
Early in 1991 Apple started to push the multimedia features of the latest
version of it s Macintosh operating system software - System 7.
IBM announced a multimedia version of its PS/2 personal computer - together
with a batch of multimedia software - in October 1991.
At the same time, DEC launched a multimedia hardware and software based on
the Unix operating system.
In addition to their individual promotions, Apple and IBM announced in
October that they were working together on a project to build multimedia
products through a joint venture company called Kaleida.
Other leading manufacturers involved in multimedia development include NCR
and Hewlett-Packard in the US, NEC and Sony in Japan and Philips and Bull in
Europe.
Software companies are not far behind.
Database software suppliers like Oracle and Informix are strongly promoting
multimedia 'enhancements' to their data base management products. Oracle
launched Oracle Card, a competitor to Apple's Hypercard only on the
IBM-compatible PC, last summer.
The most important software player is, however, Microsoft, the developer of
MS/DOS operating system and the Windows 3 graphical environment. It has been
involved in developing multimedia technology on PCs since the mid-1980s.
It was a pioneer of CD-ROM, a high-capacity storage technology for personal
computers similar to that used for audio compact disks.
Last November Microsoft recruited backers for its Multimedia PC (MPC)
standard and attracted several important players including Olivetti, Tandy,
Philips, Zenith (Bull), NEC and Fujitsu.
The MPC 'standard' lays down a minimum hardware configuration for the
personal computer, which includes a CD-ROM drive, and runs the multimedia
extensions to the Windows 3 software.
The MPC 'standard' has still to prove itself. But given the overwhelming
success of Windows 3, it seems likely that MPC will emerge as a primary
platform for the development multimedia applications - despite the rival
standards promoted by IBM on its PS/2 and Apple on the Macintosh.
The extended Windows 3 software provides the ideal base for mass-market
multimedia applications and the first ones are
already on the market (see box,page 31).
'Microsoft has a big lead and will certainly have a huge influence on
multimedia,' says Mr Rob Wirszycz, marketing director of the UK-based
multimedia specialist, Callhaven.
'But Apple is also very strong and has a good product range for the
Macintosh,' he adds.
Apple's answer to Windows 3 is an applications-build ing language for the
Macintosh called Quicktime. Like the Windows 3 extensions, Quicktime
provides the mechanisms to handle different media and to build them into
applications.
Mr Wirszycz says that software like Quicktime and Windows 3 makes it easier
to build useful multimedia applications and there are development tools
emerging to take advantage of the facilities they offer - 'we are looking at
Macintosh software like Macromind Director and Authorware Professional as a
way to build applications. Multimedia is moving away from its technical
background and becoming more generally usable.'
He notes that the last year has seen a notable shift in attitude to
multimedia and, partly as a result of the new tools that are available, an
increased demand for multimedia applications.
'Until recently, we have concentrated on prototype and pilot projects. But
now customers are actually throwing some serious money at multimedia - they
actually have budgets for it now,' he says.
Computer manufacturers and software suppliers will be keen to get their
hands on a large slice of these budgets.
But they will not be the only ones. Multimedia stretches well beyond the
traditional markets of the computer industry and offers opportunities to
companies which have grown to prominence in the consumer electronics field.
Philips and Sony, for example, are very active in developing multimedia
hardware technology. Japanese manufacturers like Yamaha and Roland dominate
the digital audio market. These companies, too, will want a slice of what
promises to be a highly-competitive market in the 1990s.
It is also a market where flashing lights and 'bells and whistles' are
likely to be a key selling-point.

open system - User view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
MEDICAL pathology company JS Pathology had to find a system which could deal
with large volumes of data storage when the time came to move from a
proprietary system to an open system,* writes Claire Gooding.
Its existing Wang system ran a US-developed package, specially developed for
its business. Now its choice of a relational database has enabled it to cope
with its existing workload, and even consider broadening its services.
JS Pathology carries out tests for hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other
organisations such as insurance companies, dealing with 2,000 requests
daily, around half a million annually. This workload put performance
considerations high on the list of requirements for the system.
While the company wanted to re-create the specialised functions of its
existing system, information technology manager David Taylor was also
looking for integrated accounting and other applications, all based around a
database.
'We wanted to move from proprietary to open systems, and also replace third
generation languages, such as Basic, with a fourth generation language (4GL)
which would serve us into the 1990s,' he explains.
The selection of hardware was based on looking at all the options available
under Unix, and the main Unix database suppliers, Oracle, Ingres, and
Informix. Cost and performance considerations won the business for Informix,
in a contract worth in total (including hardware) around Pounds 750,000.
JS Pathology dealt direct with Informix, and also used its training services
for its development staff.
JS Pathology has done all its own development, with an in-house staff of
eight development staff. Around 120 people use the resulting applications,
with only the development staff having direct access to the database.
'We didn't want to give users access. If there was a genuine requirement, we
add a new applications.
'We don't plan to give users access through the SQL language, though we
might develop smaller sub-systems. We want users to get on with their jobs,
not worry about how to to use SQL.'
He sees clear business benefits from his choice of a relational database -
'we have widened the scope of products we can offer, and as well as
developing a better service to our users, we can serve our clients better.
'We've always managed to cope, but a lot of applications which were
cumbersome are now a lot easier.
'The choice of a Unix system makes communications a lot easier, and means we
have a wide choice if we want to expand the network.
He adds: 'There are great benefits in the relational approach to storing
information: for instance, we can use SQL for ad hoc queries for management,
and as a development tool to produce prototype applications.'

<TEXT>
CHARLES TAYLOR shipping insurance works in a business where demands
constantly change, writes Claire Gooding.
Dealing with that change - according to Gordon Groves, director of
information systems - was the main motivation for considering a new
database, and, he hopes, will be the main benefit of the new Informix
database now running on a Unix-based MIPS 6280.
'One of our problems is a two-year development backlog: another was that
information couldn't be shared internally. The insurance market changes so
fast that we need to keep abreast of changes, and I hope we'll be able to
offer an improved service to our existing clients.'
Charles Taylor's previous system was a DEC-based, with applications written
in DEC Basic. Gordon Groves was keen to move to open systems: other items on
the shopping list were SQL, for easy applications development, a relational
database, and a fourth generation language, (4GL).
Both of the short-listed solutions, Unify/Accel and Informix, were set the
same problem. TIS, the supplier of the chosen MIPS hardware, according to Mr
Groves, 'solved it more easily, with an elegant, quick and more flexible
solution.'
The contract, worth Pounds 300,000 for the computer, and Pounds 500,000 for
the software, went to TIS and Informix, with TIS doing initial training, and
Informix providing more specialised training on its most recent products.
Eventually, the installation will support more than 100 users, all of whom
will have direct access through the end-user language.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (46): Bad news for drug smugglers
 -User view: Customs and Excise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN someone is discovered trying to smuggle drugs through Customs, officers
must make a record of the details so that information is available for the
later prosecution of the case.
In years gone by, the painstaking recording of data proved to be
time-consuming (taking up to two hours in many cases) and was also liable to
clerical error along the way.
Then, between November 1988 and May 1989, HM Customs and Excise looked into
three database packages for its seizure documentation system at London's
Heathrow airport. The product chosen, Sybase, submitted the cheapest bid,
and it was also at that time, according to Vic Whittington, head of the
informationtechnology (IT) infrastructure division,'way ahead on
client-serverarchitecture.'
With the new system, details of incidents are recorded on a local personal
computer. After entry, the data is sent across the network to the Sybase
server, where it is stored. Information can then be sent back to the local
personal computer, if necessary, to be printed out.
The Sybase system has speeded-up the recording process, releasing officers
to spend more time dealing with the public.
In what must be bad news for drug smugglers, the system has also improved
the accuracy and 'trackability' of recording of evidence on drug trafficking
which is so essential to provide records for court evidence.
Vic Whittington says that the rate of development of the system was slower
than expected, largely because of HM Customs' own strategy, not because of
the product - 'Sybase has met our requirements, but then so would any
other,' he says. It is, though, now part of HM Customs' IT strategy.
Although the system is so far only being used for recording the seizure of
drugs, it will soon be extended to include all contraband material.
Later, it will feed information into the intelligence unit, warehouse and
management information systems.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (48): New aid towards healthier
cattle - Agricultural application: An easy-to-use relational database helps
in the control of farm animal diseases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S Department of Agriculture and Food aims to reduce all cattle
diseases, especially tuberculosis. This brings about a complex systems
requirement: all Irish cattle have to be granted a movement permit, and
therefore have to be identifiable. The testing system for animal disease did
not cater for the new Animal Movement Permit Headage, so the department
decided to look for a relational database to write the application from
scratch.
Government procurement policies meant that the department had to find an
'open systems' solution, which also had to be compliant with the standard
query language, SQL.
Another consideration was the department's multi-platform hardware policy:
Cincom's Supra's ability to run in IBM, UNIX and PC environments gave it an
advantage over IBM's DB/2 database. Software AG's Adabas also satisfied the
criteria, but the department tested both Supra and Adabas with a prototype
application, using a subset of real data.
'The Supra application won on ease-of-use and flexibility,' reports John
McCarthy, information technology manager,'but we were also happy with the
performance.'
Cincom won the IRPounds 350,000 contract, which included consultancy,
implementation and training - 'they provided an easy, fairly trouble-free
upgrade,' says McCarthy.
About 250 users have interactive access to the database, interrogating it
directly for ad hoc reports, which is why ease of use was another factor in
the choice.
The business benefits, says John McCarthy, are not yet visible, but he is
confident that the system will lead to a better control and eventually
reduction of agricultural diseases - 'also, when it comes to the
renegotiation of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), having a database of
clients means we will be able to respond to any changes of direction for
agriculture.
'Having a database also means we'll be able to react swiftly, and we'll be a
lot happier than we would have been three or four years ago,' he adds.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (47): Handling data on 750,000
travel-related policies - User view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDIAL Assistance (UK) is a fast-growing travel assistance company and its
information technology (IT) systems must be able to cope with that growth,
writes Michael Powell.
The company markets a range of travel-related services, the best-known of
which is its emergency breakdown cover. Mondial offers a 24 hours a day,
seven days a week service to its clients, which is managed by a Sybase OLTP
(see buzzwords, right) database.
This keeps details of more than 750,000 policies, and allows access to that
information when a customer calls in with an emergency. It was one of the
first Sybase sites in the Britain.
'It was a bit unstable at first, but it is a good product now,' comments
Richard Pemberton, information technology manager. 'We are happy with its
client-server technology.'
Mondial's business is entirely reliant on its computer system. To guard as
much as possible against errors, the company has a back-up server system
which, through the use of 'two phase commit' (see definition, below) is
virtually a mirrored system, giving a 'hot back-up' - in the event of
failure of the primary system, the second can be cut-in almost seamlessly to
take over.
Moreover, it allows back-up of data at any time, without needing to disable
the on-line system. Mr Pemberton stresses the importance of an open systems
strategy to Mondial - 'we chose Unix for expandability. We can strap on more
disks almost seamlessly. We have already upgraded in a number of ways.'
In a growing business, this allows the company always to have the
appropriately-sized system for each phase of its business. Mondial's future
plans are to use Sybase to develop a new travel business, which will include
medical assistance. Mr Pemberton confirmed that all its future business
systems will use it.
BUZZWORDS
Two phase commit: Any company intending to run more than one database, or
using multiple hardware hosts, should be aware that database updating is not
a simple process. A single transaction may need to update a number of
records at a time. Moreover, when more than one processor is involved (as is
the case in client-server and distributed databases) that transaction may
need to interact with more than one, unsynchronised, processor.
If there is a system failure at some point during this process, it may be
impossible to tell how far each element in the transaction proceeded before
this happened.
One processor may have finished, another may be only part completed. In a
single processor environment database management systems normally have the
ability to 'roll back' or undo those transactions if necessary.
In a multiple processor environment, more care is needed, since, to roll
back the overall transaction, the system needs to know more information
about each part of the transaction.
For example, a personnel database could be distributed so that one processor
held employee data, another departmental information. A user updating an
employee's record might update both these databases with a single
transaction. The fact that this update affected both databases would be
quite transparent to the user.
If the update started, and then a system failure occured before it
completed, the departmental data update might have been completed, but the
employee data may not. A conventional roll-back process would not return the
department data to its previous state, although it would correct the
employee information.
Thus, the overall data would cease to be correctly synchronised. Two phase
commit deals with this process in the following way:
Firstly, a record is made of the transactions which will be performed on the
various databases. This is a hard record which will be used, in the event of
a failure of the actual transaction, to roll-back the individual database
entries.
Only when the various processors report that this information is
successfully recorded is the second phase initiated. If the process fails
during this first phase, no actual data has been recorded.
Uncompleted first stage commit data will be cleared during the initial
re-start, and have no further effect. The second phase consists of updating
the actual databases. Only when each has reported that its update has
happened successfully will the first stage data be removed.
If a system failure happened at any point during this second stage, the
first stage data is available to tell each processor how far to roll back.
This ensures data integrity.

decisions - Case Study: Building company upgrades database system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a time when the slump in the housing market has made cash flow
uncomfortably tight for most building companies, Laing Homes has a system in
place which enables it to make well-informed decisions about the state of
the market.
It has centralised information so that all users, from the directors
downwards, are tapping into the same source of information.
Laing Homes wanted to take one step at a time when it came to upgrading its
systems. Its problem in 1985 was a number of different systems, spread
across different hardware, including old DEC PDP 11 minicomputers.
'We wanted to make changes, and we particularly wanted software to be easy
to transport between systems,' explains John McNab, John Laing's director of
computing services, homes division.
Communications was the real problem: there was no way of passing information
between the various applications such as accounts, stock control, material
take-off and job costing, including quantity surveying for materials - 'to
get our applications communicating, we had to move to an integrated
environment, and update the applications one by one.'
Laing also recognised that it needed a relational database, to make
information retrieval easier in the new applications, and knew that PCs
would be an important vehicle for that activity.
A shortlist of five products, including Oracle was picked and tested. DEC's
Rdb was dropped early on because it was 'single platform' software (ie
limited to one specific hardware-host), and Supra was also ruled out in the
early stages. Adabas lost out because it was felt that at the time, its VMS
version ran a poor second to its IBM base, and this concentrated attention
on Ingres and Oracle, both of which were 'native VMS' developed, although
running in other environments. At the time, Ingres had no PC version, and
Oracle clinched the deal by scoring higher on functionality.
'We were commercially more comfortable with Oracle,' recalls John McNab.
The availability of a strong 4GL had also played an important part in the
selection, and Oracle was further helped by its ability to offer a number of
ready-made applications, such as Oracle Financials (now called Business
Patterns). This now forms the core of the accounting systems.
'By choosing Oracle, we could change platforms,' says John McNab. 'If we
were going through the same exercise now, we might well be looking at
RISC-based Unix machines: VMS software licences are more expensive than
Unix. The beauty is that we now have that option if we want it. The software
alone in the contract cost Pounds 100,000. About 100 of Laing's 400
employees use the Oracle software, with a handful of them - no more than
four - empowered to make interactive queries against the database, using the
SQL language themselves.
Since the installation, Laing has developed its own Oracle applications,
known as CASE - Construction and Sales Events. Built in Oracle by the four
in-house development staff, this helps to provide up-to-date, consistent
information on the state of the construction process, and the stage of each
estate sale.
In the recession, the need to match construction with sales ever more
tightly became important - 'there's a definite business benefit in knowing
exactly where the sale is: completion, exchange, and so on.'
The benefit of integrated applications is less easy to quantify in business
terms, but one advantage has been the increase of accuracy in the
information, since very little now has to be re-keyed.
Management users of the system include Colin Seymour, financial director,
who regularly taps into the mainframe to use the information for financial
planning. He uses the SQL language to make his own direct queries.
One advantage of this power is the constant 'refining' process which takes
place. For example, on one occasion he picked up an inconsistency in the
data to do with progressing sales of a set of dwellings. The classification
had not taken into account an important factor: the houses were retirement
homes, and those buying were, in the main, not in need of mortgages, a
common factor revealed in his off-the-cuff search.
The quality of information means that Laing is in a better position to make
good business decisions, on such issues as what percentage of deposit is
needed before building starts. The central warehouse - through which all
materials were channelled and stockpiled in the building boom - is no longer
necessary, as there is better control over materials and building planning.
John McNab feels that the venture into relational database, undertaken at an
early stage of the market, has given Laing a distinct advantage - 'no other
housebuilder has comparable systems,' he believes. But he also observes that
five years ago, there were no software packages dealing with housebuilding,
whereas now, software developers seem to have woken up to the possibilities
in this particular 'vertical market.'

systems.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (44): Laing uses the right tools
for the job - Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAING Homes is a good example of using the correct systems to achieve its
business goals.
The central problem for housebuilders is to match demand and supply as
accurately as possible. Building houses involves long lead times so Laing
Homes needs to have as much information as possible.
Its approach has been sensible and it has chosen tools which are scaleable
in size and performance.
Laing also combined tools such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Oracle to take advantage
of the strengths of each.
Oracle is used for the central data storage and manipulation. This is its
major strength. Lotus is then used for preparing reports in tabular and
graphic form.
The monthly report sent to senior management is clear and informative with
creative use of shading in tables to highlight key pieces of data. The
graphs were uncluttered and enhanced the raw information by showing trends.
There is a marked contrast between this study and that of Willis Corroon,
(see page 8). Laing Homes have used the correct tools for the job. A report
takes only a few minutes to prepare and is accessible by non-computer
personnel.
Timely information is crucial to most businesses, but it needs to be in a
digestible form.
The use of graphs makes the sales figures comprehensible at a glance. Too
few corporate reports use graphs for anything more than decoration.
I was pleased to see that Laing's graphs were integral to the report, rather
than tacked on as an afterthought.
With Laing Homes moving away from the previous strategy of maintaining a
warehouse as a stock buffer, it is essential that it maintains cost-control
over its suppliers.
While the building industry is not yet up to 'Just In Time' techniques, the
recession has made suppliers very aware of the need for quality service.
The logical next step at Laing will be to implement a cut-down materials and
resource planning function to streamline its house building still further.
I have every confidence that the IT staff will choose and install the
correct tools to achieve this.
In a tough market, only the wise (or the very lucky) survive. Laing Homes
has been around for a long time and appears to have the information
technology infrastructure to keep it alive for some time yet.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (41): Stringent demands met in 11
countries - International user report: How Sun Microsystems selected a
database system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS a champion of 'open systems,' the manufacturer of Sun workstations and
computers, Sun Microsystems might be expected to have some inside knowledge
when it came to choosing a database. But the company arrived at a Progress
Software application through an unusual route, writes Claire Gooding.
Mr Aitken Paton, project manager for Sun's worldwide field organisaton,
explains: 'Our strategy was to find an application which would allow us to
standardise on such operations as order processing, invoicing, accounting,
and so on, in 11 countries. '
The package had to meet a stringent functional specification, and this meant
that the choice of the database running underneath was dictated by finding
the right 'front-end' package.
Sun was looking for a multi-language, multi-currency application, running
with a relational database and 4GL under a client-server system.
Despite a thorough search, assisted by consultants KPMG, only one package
came up to scratch: the MFG-Pro suite, which happened to be written using
the Progress database and language.
The others, says Paton, 'didn't come close,' meeting only 50 per cent of
Sun's requirements.
MFG's developers, Santa Barbara-based QAD, had recently appointed a European
representative, Minerva, based in Holland, and Minerva won the Pounds
500,000 contract, including training, modifications, and hotline support.
The number of system users varies from country to country - in the UK there
are around 50 - but all can do direct interactive queries, formulating ad
hoc reports at will. According to Aitken Paton, the business benefits are
largely internal at present, but customers will notice a difference in the
future.
'The Progress language in particular has saved us substantial programming
work, time and effort, simply because it is so powerful.
'We have been able to build a lot of tools ourselves, to interact with the
application and the database. We are now looking at providing information
for managers.
'Eventually, the benefits will filter through to our customers, in the shape
of an improved service, a higher standard of documentation and accuracy, and
even electronic data interchange of data,' he says.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (39): Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHAT a relief to see evidence of a strategy, and an effective one at that.
Unilever has a collection of difficult IT problems. As an acquisitive
company, it inherits the systems of its purchases. It then has to integrate
these with its own strategy without adversely affecting the profitability of
the new company.
In addition, it faces the problems of internationalisation. Few countries
speak the same language or even have the same alphabet. This means that
software is very difficult to transfer between two countries even if the
same underlying concept applies in both.
The strategy that Unilever has applied is a pragmatic one. It recognises
that local conditions will vary. Sensibly, it tries to minimise the
translation overhead by specifying a range of acceptable options (hardware
and software) with inter-operability. Many other companies try and adopt a
complex world vision that usually ends up increasing the effort.
Unilever's focus is firmly on the business benefits, rather than technical
brilliance. I particularly liked the way that the IT group sees its role as
facilitating the transfer of ideas between subsidiaries, rather than as the
fount of all
wisdom.
They may still need to address further the issues of integrating PCs, which
are outside the Open Systems approach, but they have made an admirable
start.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (38): A global view of planning -
Case Study: Unilever - A streamlining of its worldwide operations, involving
500 companies, is one of the benefits Unilever is seeing from a co-ordinated
policy on information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTIPLY a good idea by 500, and it becomes a strategy. As a multi-national
operator in many different markets, Unilever is interested in creating
products, not re-inventing the wheels of information technology. Its
approach of creating re-usable software, founded on flexible relational
database products, has already proved its value in its operating companies.
Unilever's Personal Products Co-ordination (PPC) deals with everything from
shampoo to prestige perfumes, from such well-known names as Elida Gibbs,
Rimmel, Elizabeth Arden, and Calvin Klein. All these companies report into
London where John Rothenberg, senior commercial member of personal products
co-ordination, is responsible for planning, buying, and logistics, as well
as finance.
Interwoven with all these areas is another concern which Unilever puts under
the 'commercial' umbrella; information technology (IT).
This had become a many-headed monster as old and existing IT systems were
absorbed into the Unilever structure.
'We had a real hotch-potch of systems, common to most multi-nationals but no
more than most companies that are very acquisitive,' explains John
Rothenberg.
Two years ago, Unilever recognised that its information technology needed to
be more business-oriented, and Rothenberg's predecessor at PPC - Mike
Johnson  - became head of information technology.
Now, the entire group is already beginning to see the benefits of a globally
co-ordinated policy for information technology which is streamlining its
operations. It is bringing all its applications into line behind two
'standard' Unilever database products, chosen by the central Information
Technology Group.
The incompatibility of computer systems was a further hurdle in what is
already complex structure of reporting and communication within PPC.
Information-gathering within the group takes place on a huge scale.
Elizabeth Arden, for example, is just one company, operating in 25
countries, which is responsible for Dollars 3bn turnover worldwide.
Both Arden and Calvin Klein are accountable to the US head offices which
report into London.
The personal products group started by defining the similarities between its
operating companies rather than their differences - 'factory planning and
logistics was the initial focus. A number of companies had a need in
common,' says John Rothenberg. 'So we looked for a way to develop systems to
implement in various operating environments without throwing away everything
we already had.'
Following the policy set out by the central IT Group, the group looked
around for 'added value': not just a package, but the best possible system
to serve the business.
The plan was to find a model which would meet current planning needs and use
it as the basis of a common system which would adapt to future needs.
The improvement would take place once, centrally, not re-invented in every
company in the US, Italy, or wherever, using a generic database as its
foundation.
'The benefit was that we would get everyone up to current 'best practice' in
terms of the planning process,' says Mr Rothenberg. 'Not only would the
system be more efficiently developed, but in a shorter timescale, and any
further improvements could be passed round very quickly after
implementation. The technology and the development approach allows us to do
that better.'
They found the best foundation in France in February 1990, in a custom-built
system called Socrate at Elida Gibbs-Faberge.
The task was then to re-build the system using an 'open' database so that it
would become globally relevant, and useable across different computers in an
open environment.
'It was a matter of taking the best in terms of functions, not the computer
hardware or software, and writing in that functionality,' explains Roger
Clarke, commercial member of Unilever's Products Group. 'That's why the open
systems environment offered us a real opportunity.'
The open systems policy allows the team to take a modular approach, taking
step-by-step in what would eventually be an interlocking worldwide project.
The long-term aims are to improve customer service, and maintain it at a
high level thereafter while reducing peration cycle-time without affecting
customer service.
The applications project starts with supplier management and purchasing,
manufacturing, planning and scheduling.
As explained by Roger Clarke, the plan is to interface the systems rather
than integrate them, the difference being that existing applications can
interface with new ones, (ie pass data) without necessarily being part of
the same database-derived structure - 'but those interfaces have to be
defined very carefully' he adds.
The first step is a supplier performance system, for measuring how well
individual vendors deliver to Unilever's required standards. The work on
this particular module has been done 'in a relatively short time,' according
to Roger Clarke, and is running in a test version in several European
countries.
Significantly, the work took weeks rather than months to complete, thanks to
the development language, Uniface, and the database beneath it, Sybase.
Sybase and Oracle are the two 'standard' databases settled upon by the
central information technology group at Unilever's head office in
Blackfriars, London, which has defined a policy for the whole of Unilever.
'One of the reasons for choosing Uniface is that it interfaces with other
database systems including Oracle,' explains Clarke. 'In this particular
application, we chose Sybase because of its strength in transaction
processing. We were dealing with high-volume data and processing of data:
the choice was made jointly with the central IT group.'
Geoff Webb, head of the business applications group in Unilever's central
information technology group (ITG), outlines the approach to global
development, used not only in the personal products group, but in many other
IT initiatives elsewhere in Unilever.
'We can only support such international projects by using open systems and
standard tools around the entire group,' he says.
The approach to the process of development is as important to Unilver as the
choice of software tools, he emphasises.
Mike Johnson's core IT team has defined strategies which apply throughout
the rest of Unilever's 500-company empire. The idea of a universal IT
strategy is business-based, as Webb demonstrates by a detailed grasp of the
issues behind the Personal products prototype application - 'some of our
suppliers are highly sophisticated IT-users, others are not: clearly, we
have relationships with strategic suppliers and build partnerships to
optimise them. There are a lot of things you can do to raise the bar to
other competitors.'
Geoff Webb's own business background in Unilever took place in various
operating areas including detergents and animal feeds, and has fuelled his
view of IT as a strategic weapon.
'Historically, Unilever is no different from anyone else, in that 10 or 15
years ago, IT was primarily used for automation. But recently we have
decided there is more opportunity for using IT to support competitive
operations. Our technical policy is driven by our business vision.'
Redeployment of good ideas is at the core of the philosophy which led to to
the selection of not one, but two 'in-house' database products.
'With 500 companies, if you have a good idea in one company, you should be
able to roll it out around the world' says Webb. His attitude to Open
Systems is pragmatic, and springs from Unilever's worldwide commitment to
three hardware suppliers: IBM, DEC and Hewlett-Packard.
'Traditionally, you can't take an implementation of an idea from and IBM
environment and put it into DEC Vax without a substantial effort. Now, with
open systems, it's much easier to transfer applications between
environments, and a whole wealth of business opportunities open up.'
The choice of Sybase and Oracle was made from a shortlist which included
Ingres, Progress, and Informix, whittled down from an original 20 or 30
database products. There was a long process of selection, by analogy with
the choice of standard hardware suppliers. A lot were excluded because of
being proprietary, and non-portable, others for the lack of installed base.
The parameters included richness of function and, says Webb 'people with a
vision.'
The final choice hung on commitment to standards, distribution and support,
with geographical spread playing an important part in the latter.
Unilever also believes in 'partnership': for Oracle, Unilever is a major
customer, served by a worldwide accounts team. So far, there are more Oracle
than Sybase customers.
'There are areas of detail where Sybase and Oracle may not have the highest
functions available in the market. But we have to use building blocks that
are the same in 75 countries. That's where the richness and advantages are
to be found.'
The team was reluctant to put all its eggs in one database basket, not just
for the business reason of being tied to a single supplier, but to give
far-flung companies a better chance of finding local support.
The uniformity extends to the look of the final applications - 'we want one
look and feel, one way of interacting with the information on the screen, so
whether people use Lotus, Wordperfect, Express EIS or whatever. PCs have to
go down that path as well. By the end of 1993 all users will have the Motif
interface.
'What we say to our suppliers is that we want them to 'add value' in areas
that matter to us as users. The key to the partnership is mutual value: we
deliver an attractive market, they deliver services.
'A strong dimension is dealing with someone in whose strategy you have
confidence - someone who will be there in five years' time.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (36): Boost for 'talking books'
library helps 70,000 visually impaired - User View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVIDING a constant supply of 'talking books' for its 70,000 visually
impaired members poses some problems for the Royal National Institute for
the Blind which are beyond the scope of most library applications.
Its 8,700 titles, all recorded by professional actors, readers, and
broadcasters, result in around 300,000 cassettes, from which stock the RNIB
sends out around 13,000 tapes daily.
By 1989, keeping track of who had received what was stretching the existing
Ferranti system to its limits, and no ready-made application could meet the
Talking Book Service's needs.
The production centre at Peterborough had standardised on the Pick database,
with the assistance of consultancy Clark Whitehill. The Talking Book Service
decided to stay compatible, and brought in a consultant to help with
programming. Now it has an off-the-peg system, used by about 20 'customer
care' staff who are able to formulate their own enquiries.
'The system has made us much more efficient,' explains Talking Book Service
manager, David Mann.
'Not only have we cut down on turnaround time by half, but we've been able
to computerise subscriptions.
'We run the system with the same number of staff, but with no frustrations,
and they have access to a much wider range of information. It's more
flexible: we can produce lots of analytical reports.'
The database has enabled the RNIB to look at other possibilities: cross
references, browsing, and catalogues, even tracking specific readers so that
it is possible to offer them a suitable 'pick-list' of fresh titles likely
to suit their particular tastes and interests.
The RNIB's Talking Book Service in London is contactable on 081.903 6666.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (33): After privatisation comes
intense competition - Seeboard integrates its data resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEEBOARD, the UK's South Eastern Electricity Board, is now free to compete
for national business. It was this change that triggered off the the need
for a co-ordinated sales and marketing policy in energy marketing.
'The problem was that we had a variety of in-house systems, on different
machines, everything from mainframes to old standalone PCs,' explains energy
marketing and sales manager Robin Brown. In all, there were five different
databases catering for different market sectors, and the data they produced
was not interchangeable.
Seeboard, whose turnover exceeds Pounds 1bn, had decided to focus on
'concept selling,' but for this it needed to focus its data resources, and
take a close look at how valuable its data really was. It was also vital to
have a system which would allow integrated applications - for other areas
such as staff management and project management. In this respect, the
constraint was Seeboard's existing systems, which included a central IBM
mainframe 9000.
'We didn't want to paint ourselves into a corner, so we started looking at
Oracle because of its multi-platform support,' says Mr Brown. Buying Oracle
 -in this case for use on an IBM Unix system, the RS/6000, was in line with
company policy on using 'open' systems for departmental needs. (See Oracle
profile, page 24).
The sales and marketing effort could stay in line with the corporate
mainframe system, (used for high-volume processing), while pursuing its own
departmental business on a smaller machine running the same software, under
a different, 'open' operating system, Unix. The entire system software and
hardware, cost in the region of Pounds 250,000 initially.
After building a 'quick and easy' prototype, the sales and marketing staff
had a clear idea of what they needed, and it was something more
comprehensive, with full reporting facilities.
At this point, Shamrock Marketing was able to help with its marketing system
(covered in Software At Work, issue 3, Autumn 1991). The system, which is
Oracle-based and costs around Pounds 9,950, was developed in conjunction
with Seeboard to its industry-specific requirements.
There are around two million addresses in Seeboard's database for its own
region, but this was not the best source of information for the more focused
sales effort. Mr Brown and his colleagues recognised early on that the real
decision makers were consultants, architects, surveyors, and electricians -
not necessarily the consumers. Certainly, the address alone could not reveal
whether the addressee was a real prospect or not, and the long process of
refining data began.
'Once you've got the database, populating it with valid data is the real
problem,' explains Robin Brown. 'It was a matter of changing the focus of
the data and the way users look at it. One can spend hours agonising over
the choice of hardware and product, but the real costs are hidden, in staff
training and briefing, and checking the accuracy of the data.'
Although the efforts have not yet borne fruit, Brown is confident that the
business benefits will include tighter and more accurate control of staff
and sales activities. Direct access to the mainframe data, through SQL, has
already been a boon, with new users able to create meaningful reports within
an hour or two of first sitting down at the computer.
'We are getting away from junk mail - no longer sending out 6,000 mailings
for a handful of leads. We have found out who our customers really are.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (30): Fleet company takes a
long-term view - System Selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Britain's leading fleet management companies, Wincanton Contracts,
wanted to take a 'long-term view' of its information services, bringing them
in-house to provide better control and a swifter response to customers,
according to Marj Laurie, data processing manager
When Wincanton considered a new database three years ago, it needed a system
which could keep all fleet management details, including road test data,
taxation,billing of customers and purchasing records.
The system also had to be capable of reading the files of the previous
Hoskyns computer system, and of absorbing the data resulting from the
acquisition of a smaller fleet company, Arlington.
The need to access the previous DEC-based RMS files played an important part
in the selection of what was then Cullinet (now CA's) database offering.
(See profile, below). Another significant factor was the promise of a
client-server version of the software, now available, and the fact that the
fourth generation language supplied with the database could generate 'third
generation' code in such languages as Cobol, Fortran, Basic or C.
This means that the final applications run fast, and high performance was a
consideration for Wincanton, since the entire company (150 employees in
London and Birmingham) would have access to the database.
Cullinet won the contract, worth Dollars 150,000 for software alone, mostly
on technical grounds, although Wincanton was also influenced by the style
and priorities of the suppliers on its short-list. However, the timing of
the CA takeover forced Wincanton to turn to contractors to help with
implementation and training in the initial months.
Now, says Marj Laurie, everyone has access to the database, for ad-hoc user
reports, and minor, but time-saving extras such as centrally updated
telephone lists.
'Demand is such that we're looking for a better end-user tool, and we're
beta-testing the CA PC product, QbyX, for that,' adds Marj Laurie.
'We haven't yet realised the full benefits of the database, but as far as
our customers are concerned, better access to information makes us more
responsive.
'We can produce ad hoc reports on maintenance of vehicles, cost, current
fleet size and so on. We now have faster response, better service, and
improved management of the business.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (31): Manufacturer integrates 13
European sites - Access to wider markets: Relational database allows faster
response to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING its business in Europe was the incentive for starch manufacturer
Cerestar to find a database system.
In 1985 it decided to integrate all 13 European sites, using a single
hardware supplier and a single database, writes Claire Gooding.
Cerestar was looking for complete systems for logistics, sales, purchasing,
maintenance, and sales order processing, the latter having to deal with
thousands of different grades of starch.
The previous system had run on McDonnell Douglas equipment.
Cerestar looked initially at hardware suppliers: Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and
and Digital Equipment (DEC), and narrowed the choice of databases down to
two: Cullinet's CA-DB (now owned by Computer Associates), and the SQL
language on IBM.
Cerestar went for the 'Vax cluster' solution - the most upgradeable and
flexible hardware available before the spread of open systems, according to
software development project leader David Burchill.
The use of a fourth generation language (4GL) was one of the main reasons
for the choice of CA: the product now known as CA-Build was available on DEC
equipment at the time.
The Pounds 1.5m contract covered all 13 sites, and included some initial
training from Cullinet, later taken over in-house at Cerestar. There are now
about 500 users at each of the sites: no-one has direct access through SQL,
all use the applications developed by Cerestar's seven-strong development
team.
Mr Burchill is confident that the development of a fully-integrated database
makes Cerestar more responsive, and has allowed the company to develop its
business across Europe.
'We now sell to Germany,' he says. 'We couldn't have done that before.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (26): Keeping tabs on software
customers - User View: Supplier finds the right system to maximise the use
of time and staff and simplify its IT strategy.

THE CHOICE of the correct database was essential to Powertec, a software
house specialising in human resource systems, writes Claire Gooding.
'With the sort of systems we install, people constantly want changes,'
explains managing director Tony Ive.
'We give support over the line via modems, so that our customers can add
screens, items, or change their applications, so we were looking for a
database which could store all that customer information. Open architecture
was very important to us.'
So 'open' were Powertec's intentions that the other two contenders alongside
Starbase user, Oracle and Ingres, lost favour with Tony Ive, despite their
ability to run on different hardware. See Starbase supplier profile, below.
'If you buy Oracle, then you are tied to using other Oracle products and
tools. With Starbase, you can use it with Cognos' own database, or with any
other file structures; HP, DEC, anything under Unix.
'The ability to read other file structures, from different hardware systems
elsewhere, was vital, from our users' point of view.'
Powertec claims around 35 clients for its package, built up over three
years: the most recent installation supports 50 concurrent users, all of
whom are able to interrogate the database directly.
There are further advantages to Powertec customers, according to Mr Ive.
'As far as the package users are concerned, Starbase is totally invisible:
they don't know it's there. Starbase is also self-tuning, which means that
users don't need in-house database expertise to run it properly, as they
would with Ingres and Oracle.'
This, he says, greatly simplifies the strategy for information technology,
and helps to make the best use of time and staff: there is simply no need or
technical database knowledge.
'The benefits come in the speed with which clients can respond to changes,
and make alterations very swiftly.'
Note: as a value-added reseller for Cognos, Powertec would not usually
qualify for a user interview. Cognos' proposed user-site declined to be
interviewed for this issue of Software At Work, but Powertec's views
provided some useful insights in substitution.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (24): Meeting the need for high
speed data - User View: 'Real-time' performance is paramount for the FT's
customised financial information service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN the Financial Times purchased the Empress database, its intention was
to use the software as a 'real-time' feed (ie events reported
instantaneously) from the London Stock Exchange to the FT Prices Room,
writes Claire Gooding.
The main use of the software is now for customised client profiles,
distributing such information as stock exchange prices and unit trusts,
share prices, and tables.
Four years ago, the search was on for a database, because the existing
systems, written in the language C, were difficult to maintain and adapt.
'To make the modifications we wanted, we really needed a 4GL (fourth
generation language) and a relational database' explains Mr Phil Duke,
software engineer.
Oracle, Empress and Unify were all considered for the network of Compaqs
running Unix, as all satisfied the criteria of compliance with SQL, open
systems, and the facility for being upgraded in the future.
Empress won on its speed, since the real-time performance was paramount: the
others, says Duke, were simply not quick enough.
Now, however, a management decision has brought in another relational
database, Sybase, as the strategic product for in-house developments.
'In effect, for what we are doing, almost any database would do the job,'
adds Phil Duke. 'The two are really comparable: both are good and easy to
use, although Sybase comes across as more professional.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (25): History of British films
stored on database - User View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO played the female lead in Yield to the Night in 1956? Film buffs with a
lapse of memory for such details should soon see the benefits of a five-year
programme at the British Film Institute, to log all its visual and
historical data on an Adabas database.
The SIFT (Summary of Information on Film and Television) database is unusual
in two respects. It has been designed specifically for hands-on use by
non-computer experts, and will be used to store visual and historical data,
as well as text. Eventually, the plan is to provide terminals on desks at
public libraries, with CD ROMs holding an encyclopaedia of filmographic
information.
The BFI has around 500 staff and a turnover of Pounds 20m, half-financed by
the government, the rest coming from donations and sales. Its activities
include setting up the National Film Archive, a collection of more than
170,000 films and TV programmes, some dating back to the earliest days of
cinema. At present, around 130 in-house staff use the database, all through
application 'front-ends.'
'We have a basic enquiry system that's very simple to use,' comments Frank
Carberry, BFI's database administrator.
One of the main concerns in the choice was the volume of data: everything
previously had been kept on a million or so card files, sorted by film
titles. This made the information inaccessible and impossibly bulky: for
practical use it had to be cross-referenced.
'Basically, BFI had many sources of information - individuals,
organisations, even different departments,' explains Mr Carberrry.
'Different bodies had 'packets' of information: we needed the database to
bring it all together, validating the pieces of information against one
another.'
Because of the volume of information, database performance was a main
consideration in the selection process. The BFI also had a strict spending
limit. Other contenders were Oracle and Ingres, both running under the
'open' Unix operating system.
BFI plumped for Adabas mainly on the grounds of speed and performance. At
the time, Software AG had no Unix offering, (it has only recently delivered
one), so the BFI could not benefit from the competitive pricing of various
Unix hardware offerings: the best value, with promised upgradeability, was
the Digital Vax.
The SIFT database runs on a Digital Vax 4300 computer, though it may well
need an upgrade eventually: Mr Carberry ventures that a greater number of
users could create an i/o bottleneck, leading to slow response times.
The BFI has done no in-house development at all: it used Software AG's
consultancy, although the specification was written by computer manager
Peter Rutland. One of the advantages of the database, according to Frank
Carberry, has been far wider access to the data, and greater speed.
Reports are far easier - for example, ad hoc reports by subject. Despite the
fact that hardly any of the BFI staff had seen a computer before the project
was implemented in 1988, there is great in-house enthusiasm, and now there
are requests for weekend use of laptop computers.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (21): Setting the record straight
 -Case Study:  Guinness Publishing - Claire Gooding searches the archives to
discover how a database proved a winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE can only be one filing system in the world which has a drawer
labelled:
'Sitting in liquid substances . . . to throwing.' This strange file - among
several hundred other bizarre categories - belongs to The Guinness Book of
Records.
Unique as the book might be in its preoccupations, Guinness Publishing faced
problems of data storage and retrieval which it shares with publishers of
international directories, and others.
The problems of wrestling with text organisation and retrieval are mirrored
in all businesses where the written word is of the essence.
More than three years ago, Guinness Publishing took the step of
computerising its typesetting. This one change triggered off many others,
not least the idea of keeping the facts and figures for the world-famous
book on a database, making updates easier.
There were several main problems, explaines Donald McFarlan, now editorial
director of Guinness Publishing, but until recently the editor of the famous
Book of Records.
First, the book itself was trapped in a format that needed revision, but it
simply wasn't possible to rearrange the order in which items appeared
without some radical re-thinking.
'For example, the miscellaneous section, the one full of various stunts, was
getting far too big. We wanted to 'explode' it out from this ghetto into
other chapters.'
Translating the Book of Records into 36 or so different languages resulted
in a more far-reaching consequence of the item-ordering problem. The
subtleties of English versus American spelling, for example, pale into
insignificance next to the problems of contents. US readers expect to see
records about US sports which interest few UK readers.
Guinness Publishing produces the text for both the UK and the US versions of
the book, which means duplicating some entries in different spellings, and
allowing for categories that appear in one book, but not in the other.
Further, each nation likes to see its own 'national record' appearing
immediately after the world record: look up the dimensions of mountains in
the French edition, and the highest mountain in France appears next to the
highest mountain in the world: would one bother in a Dutch edition?
The publishers with whom Guinness Publishing contracts the foreign language
versions have certain amount of discretion over contents. But the fount of
world-record wisdom is still in Guinness Publishing' headquarters in
Enfield, ten miles north of London. And here is the third big problem: that
of space.
'In the 36 years since the book was first published, vast amounts of
information come our way,' says McFarlan. 'The hard copy filing system goes
back to the 1950s.'
One small room in the company's Enfield comfortable but compact office is
given over to filing cabinets, 'but if it were all kept here, it would take
up acres,' he adds. A lot of the overflow is stored off-site. Outside the
small filing room sits the entire editorial team. Not, as the popular
imagination might expect, a mass of people beavering away with reference
books.
'People have a picture of teams of researchers. In fact, the entire
editorial team is the editor and four deputies,' explains Donald McFarlan.
And they have to know - or be able to find out  - a great deal. 'People
expect us to know whether a specific item is in the book or not: not always
easy when we don't run every category every year, and some have been dropped
altogether.'
As befits a publication which was first envisaged as being kept behind the
bar in pubs to settle arguments, Guinness Publishing still provides the
answers to telephone and written enquiries. This is a goodwill service, not
one it wishes to encourage . . . 'but people expect us to know the answers.'
Not knowing them, or being able to find them, was a blow to the morale of
the hard-pressed team. Any cross-referencing was along with the main
repository of knowledge - inside their heads.
Now, in a company of 50 people, these four - and the press officer  - are
the main users of the database, on which only the recent years' text is
stored. The search for a database started in 1988. The company turned to
Promco, which had become very intimate with the business in the process of
implementing the computerised typesetting.
'We may seem foolhardy, but Promco knew us so well that we trusted them with
everything technical,' says McFarlan. 'Nor was cost a huge consideration. We
were more frightened of the implications of making the wrong decision.'
The brief was to find a long-term solution. Simon Johnson, managing director
of Promco, was well aware of the vagaries of Guinness' particular problems
of text formatting. He initially researched 300 companies, in everything
from text retrieval specialists to hypertext and database companies, and
academic innovators.
Simon Johnson spent a lot of time with the larger database companies, such
as Oracle, (already in wide use at the Guin-
 ness group), Ingres, Sybase and Unify, as well as exploring AI, hypercard
and other innovations. The solution had to be relational, support text
retrieval, and able to hold typesetting instructions.
Ten potential database products were rapidly whittled down to three:
Empress, Adabas, and Basis (now called Basis Plus). One important
consideration was the ability to hold variable length texts. Another was the
development environment on offer, and this was where Basis and Adabas lost
out - 'neither had the flexibility for future development that Guinness
required,' reports Simon Johnson, who chose Empress, and its C development
language.
This, he feels, ensures high performance as well as long life for the
Guinness applications, as there is as widespread base of skilled
C-programmers, far more so than in Adabas Natural. Promco had caught Empress
in a net spread wide: the initial sweep of letters sent to over 300
companies. (See Empress profile, page 18).
'It's a highly flexible relational database, in terms of capability and
performance. I can still think of none better, but the company is not
switched on to marketing: I feel we were lucky to find it.'
Promco looked after the programming and implementation, saving time by
downloading the text into the database - 'Simon became an extension of the
company: at one stage, leading up to the implemention, he was around at
least part of every day,' recalls Donald McFarlan.
A long-term intention is to get all the archived material - some of it in
packing cases in the brewery - into the system. But in the short-term, the
main desire was to fix the actual text, along with ways of searching it.
'We had clear idea of wanting to search the text and find every instance of
a particular word. For instance, place names: we don't have an index of
those, so if Leningrad chan ges its name overnight, or Peking becomes
Beijing, it's a problem for us. Now we are less reliant on memory for such
occurrences, and it's easy to scan the text for a spelling - such as 'ise,'
to turn it into 'ize.' '
As Donald McFarlan points out, the book itself is merely a 'snapshot' of the
state of records in the last week of August. 'The day it's published, it's
out of date.' But, as he points out, updates and research, and most
particularly enquiries, go on all year round. We don't charge for the
service, but we are expected to know the answers.
'Telephone enquiries are a serious headache. It demotivates people if they
can't answer them. There is a huge benefit in having the database, not just
in terms of smooth running, but in morale. A quick response gives us a much
more polished appearance to the outside world.'
The database is also a valuable potential editorial resource for 'spin-off'
publishing. For instance, another Guinness publication, Superlative Britain,
would have been easier to produce had the database been up and running at
the time. Now, it will be easy to respond to commercial 'novelty' requests,
for subsets of data, such as that from a battery maker on 'durability'
records.
Peter Matthews, editor of the Book of Records since July 1991, demonstrates
the database with enthusiasm. He is quickly able to answer the most unlikely
off-the-cuff enquiries with a text-search.
Some answers are run to ground in the filing cabinets, especially for some
obscure categories which have been dropped, such as the haircutting
marathon. (As one of the coiffed heads assisting in the 1985 record, this
one sprang to the interviewer's mind as a test search . . . both computer
and paper systems delivered impressively.)
The US edition, says Peter Matthews, is now much easier to produce. Not only
contents, but spelling, idiom, style and punctuation has can be converted
easily. Now the system supports two separate, but linked, records.
There are at least 150,000 edits made between editions: towards the end of
the March-to-August review cycle, every record is flagged for publication or
non-publication.
Alex Reid, systems manager at Guinness Publishing, reports around 10,000
interactive queries a year on his five megabytes of data (expanded to text,
it takes up around 120 megabytes).
Initial problems, including a particularly alarming one which tagged random
records - were quickly sorted out. And, happily for everyone, the
correspondence editor and secretary are able to answer the 700 letters a
month that much more easily. In keeping with the book's origins, telephone
enquiries reach a peak on Friday afternoons, often topping 40.
Can this be a record?

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (22): Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MOST companies, a database represents the records used to run one or more
of its functions, such as accounting or sales information, but the product
of the business itself is different.
The database used by Guinness Publications is most unusual, because it is
the product, containing a large part of the raw material for printing,
including typesetting instructions. The database is not enormous, nor has it
a complex structure.
The search criteria are simple, based on on the position, (chapter, section
and item number) of an entry within the book. However, it is radically
different from many other commercial databases because it needs to store,
and perform searches within large amounts of textual information. To find an
entry whose textual data matches against certain criteria would be
impossible with
normal relational database query languages like SQL. For instance, to answer
an enquiry about the oldest pilot, the software must find and return every
record whose text portion contains the word 'pilot' anywhere in it.
Promco, the consultant, wrote extensions to make such searches possible in
Empress. A significant benefit of the product (see supplier profile, page
18) was that it allowed such alterations without compromising the product's
basic functions. Empress was chosen because it also supports 'binary large
objects' or 'blobs,' (see buzzwords, page 2). These are essential for
holding the text of the book with the typesetting commands. In 1988, Empress
was the only such product available. Now that pictorial database are
becoming more common, many packages support blobs. However Empress
still offers the advantage of allowing considerable scope for manipulation
of its data by external programs. The relationship between Promco and
Guinness has proved fruitful, and Simon Johnson is seen almost as an
extension of Guinness Publications' own staff.
This means Guinness can rely on a person who understands its business but
who can also call on expertise from his own company which would not be
available to in-house staff. The company's future automation plans are
currently under review.
It is aware that the capabilities of equipment and software are constantly
improving: for instance, the pictures are not yet stored on the computer.
Empress' blob technology is capable of handling this data, and typesetting
equipment to deal with such pictures is becoming affordable. Promco as well
as other consul
tants have been asked to submit plans and proposals to obtain a balanced
view of the possibilities. This is sensible. However well a consultant,
internal or external, has done, you should see if there are other ways of
working. The industry is changing fast. Your expert might easily have missed
an important development which could make all the difference to your
business.
This case study holds an important lesson: once you have chosen to use an
outside consultant who has proved his ability in a particular area, rely on
him - he will understand your business, and will have a deeper knowledge of
what is technically possible than will a typical in-house employee.
However, ask the opinion of other consultants from time to time, to keep a
finger on the pulse.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (18): Strategic link with the Met
 -User view: London's Metropolitan Police adopts a corporate, rather than an
ad hoc approach to information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE METROPOLITAN Police chose Ingres as the means to link together a number
of information systems, to make possible the exchange of data between
disparate multi-vendor systems.
This has not precluded the use of other databases - the Met also uses
Sybase, Informix and Rdb.
'We are looking for competitive pressure to improve the whole marketplace,'
explains Royston Barker, manager of information technology (IT)
infrastructure. The Metropolitan Police wanted to go for a collaborative
venture between itself and its suppliers - 'our view was put up or shut up -
I can only listen to salesmen for so long,' says Royston Barker. 'We got
round the table with Unisys, DEC and Ingres.'
An ICL flat file database was successfully converted to Ingres, in full view
of all the parties. This convinced the Metropolitan Police that it could
extract existing data and integrate it with information on the new system.
This gave the Met confidence that the product worked and fitted its
strategy.
Accordingly, it signed a five-year, unlimited access licence, covering the
whole Metropolitan Police area. This also gives the Met access to products
which may be released within that period.
'We have a good relationship with Ingres, we even have access to the source
code,' he adds.
Client/server architecture is used to enable processing power to be located
at the most appropriate location. Administrative systems will continue to be
centralised, while those which are more critical will be distributed, even
as far as individual police stations.
The Met adopts a corporate, rather than ad hoc, approach to development. Its
policy is to pool and share expertise. Ingres offers it a tool to carry this
forward.
'It may not meet all our needs, but we have an eye on other developments'
says Royston Barker. 'The key is to be able to extract corporate data and
move it across development platforms.'
Open systems capability, independent of hardware, is therefore an important
requirement. Although not a commercial organisation, the Metropolitan Police
shares many IT needs with large companies trying to impose coherent
strategies to network corporate information.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (19): The backbone for a
worldwide software solution - Consolidating Accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI, the UK industrial and TV rental conglomerate with subsidiaries
all over the world, is faced with a complex task in consolidating accounting
information to produce half yearly and year-end figures.
The group used to send out spreadsheet-based forms to each company, and
received back figures electronically or on disk. The data was then
validated, currencies converted and adjusted as necessary. The process was
largely automated; however, if any changes were necessary, for example, this
could only be achieved by extra programming. The result was potentially
error-prone and protracted.
The group looked for a packaged solution but failed to find anything
sufficiently flexible and powerful - 'we were trying to get our
reporting-times down,' says Roy Cater, information systems manager at Thorn
EMI. 'We decided that we needed as much flexibility as possible.'
A database (DBMS) solution was chosen, so that users could set up their own
fields if necessary. Ingres' Knowledge Manager enabled this to be done
without losing data integrity.
'We needed a relational DBMS for flexibility, with controls on integrity so
that we could let users free on the system and be satisfied that they could
not accidently 'harm' themselves.'
The user enters via a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Beneath that is the SQL
link product which, to quote Roy Cater, 'magically threads data into the
spreadsheet.'
Data from the Ingres database is brought in, a page at a time, for the user
to manipulate. A key criterion of the design was to give the consolidation
accountant access to all necessary data, whilst preserving control
throughout.
'The system operates like a mill, bringing in data and consolidating it as
far as possible as it goes along. The engine is pre-emptive, checking data
for validity and progressing as far as it can with what it has.'
This ensures rapid results, and an increasingly accurate overall picture
until the whole consolidation is completed.
The system was successfully used to produce last September's half-yearly
figures, and the company is doing the year-end figures with it now.
So successful is it that Thorn EMI are now considering marketing the system
as a package.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (17): Keeping tabs on 7,500
product prices - User View: A complex job that once took two weeks can now
be finished in a couple of hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JIM NAPLES uses Computer Associates' SuperCalc5 spreadsheet package to
produce price lists for the 7,500 products his company sells in eight price
bands. Mr Naples is managing director of Matsushita Automation Controls, the
UK subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Works, one of the top 40 industrial
companies in Japan.
Matsushita Electric Works is the world's biggest manufacturer of
electro-mechanical relays and also makes other automation control components
and systems, such as vision recognition systems, testing systems and
programmable controllers.
Mr Naples and his 20 UK staff in Milton Keynes get product numbers and
prices in Deutsche Marks on magnetic discs from the European headquarters in
Munich. He has set up a spreadsheet which takes this data, applies factors
such as exchange rates and freight costs and produces a UK price list.
The calculations are complicated by the fact that products are offered in
eight price bands, typically depending on the quantities ordered. Sections
of the price list, for example those relating to particular product ranges,
can be run off and sent to customers if required - 'we do some basic editing
of the look of the page, using SuperCalc, and can make it quite attractive,'
he says. Price updates come from Germany every month and it takes about five
minutes to calculate the new UK prices.
In the early 1980s, the price list was prepared manually, using a
calculator, a job which took two weeks. In 1984 the company bought
SuperCalc2, but that only handled 250 rows - and therefore 250 products - at
a time. This meant the program had to be run 20 or 30 times -
'we've gone from a total time of two weeks to three days using SuperCalc2
and now to a couple of hours for the total job using SuperCalc5,' he says.
Jim Naples, an electrical and electronics engineer, wrote the spreadsheet
program himself - 'it was nothing very clever: just a case of looking at
SuperCalc's capabilities and deciding how to use them.'
The other main use is budgeting. Matsushita, typical of Japanese companies,
plans far ahead, so Mr Naples produces five-year forecasts for the UK
business. These can include factors such as planned orders, turnover,
expenditure and the target profit on product types. Alongside these
five-year models are spreadsheets of monthly forecasts and actual results,
for easy comparison of plans and performance.
He has also written a spreadsheet to help him decide when to buy marks, yen
and dollars to pay for products bought from Matsushita in Germany, Japan and
Thailand. He can enter different assumptions about exchange rates to decide
whether to stay with sterling for the time being or buy one of the other
currencies.
Matsushita Automation Controls uses PCs for tasks ranging from
computer-aided design to word processing. Mr Naples runs SuperCalc on an
Amstrad 386SX.
'The only thing we've not been too happy about is that after we bought
SuperCalc5 for nearly Pounds 400, Computer Associates cut the price to
Pounds 79,' says Mr Naples. But he adds: 'Even so, it was a super deal at
the old price - and it's fantastic at the new price, especially when I
consider what I pay for my children's computer games.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (16): Legacy systems live for
ever - Comment: Old database systems never die . . . they simply become
'legacies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT report from Informix, a database supplier in the open systems
market, highlights the home truth that once a company selects its database,
it shackled to it, for better or for worse.
'Legacy systems will live forever - or, to put it another way, the data that
has already been stored and the database management systems that are already
in existence and the applications that are run in most corporations of the
world, will be organic and evolve,' says the report. 'They will not be taken
out and replaced. Open Systems are the future of computing architectures as
opposed to proprietary closed systems.'1
For many companies, the choice of a database is so central to their
information technology (IT) strategy that it dictates the choice of
everything else, including applications and development language. Years ago,
when programs were written largely in Cobol, each program contained its own
data. The centralisation of data into a database meant that it could be
retrieved, re-used, and shared between applications: a computerised version
of the old filing cabinet.
This issue of Software At Work concentrates on database products for
multi-user and minicomputer systems, the 'mid-range' of the market that
includes Unix-based or 'open systems.'
Here there is an enormous choice. The software industry's premier directory,
The Software Users' Yearbook,2 lists over 200 database products, and there
are more to be found under the categories of fourth generation language, and
data dictionaries.
Many of the 200 are PC products (dealt with in our Autumn 1991 issue).
However some of these have 'grown up' to cater for the local area network or
multi-user market. At the other end of the scale are mainframe products,
such as IBM's IMS and DB/2, limited to one proprietary environment.
Other 'mid range' options such as Software AG's Adabas and Computer
Associates' IDMS have come down-market from the mainframe environment, and
have been re-written in Digital Equipment DEC/ VAX and Unix versions. Yet
more - about half a dozen well-known names including Oracle, Ingres and
Informix - were built from scratch to run on a variety of different
computers, although they are best known in the 'open systems' area.
Several concerns emerged from the dozens of telephone interviews carried out
with various database users. It was clear that portability - the ability to
transfer applications between different makes of computer - played a crucial
part in many decisions, hence the emphasis on open systems offerings, (see
Unilever case study on page 22).
Another common criteria was the ability to support future growth: others
were swayed by the need for a strong development language.
The common data access language SQL has set the standard here. With SQL, the
database need no longer be 'strategic,' argues a report comparing 20
database products from consultancy ButlerBloor. 3
The report covers 20 database products running on IBM, DEC VAX and UNIX
computers, as well as covering vendor-specific systems such as Tandem,
Unisys, and Hewlett-Packard.
ButlerBloor stresses that with SQL, users can keep their applications
separate from the data, and the database becomes a mere commodity, removing
the danger of being locked into a specific vendor. SQL support was an
important element for users in the sample interviewed, especially for those
running more than one database product, or creating applications to be used
across Europe or globally, rather than in the UK alone.
As ever, there is no 'best product,' because everyone has different needs.
But user-comments are often illuminating. So, in an addition to the usual
format of supplier information, users' comments are shown suffixed to the
product details. These 'pros and cons' are appraisals and opinions expressed
by users about various databases, where there is a sufficient sample of
interviewees. The comments do not necessarily indicate a product endorsement
 -or otherwise  - by Software At Work.
Pros and cons: some comments may well refer to old versions of the products,
so in referring to these 'pros and cons,' it is worth bearing in mind that
the decisions they reflect may have been taken some time ago. More recent
versions of the products may have superseded particular shortcoming
mentioned.
Comments shown in bold have been made by more than one user. The absence of
adverse ('con') comments does not indicate a perfect product; simply that it
did not appear on other interviewees' shortlists. The details of the
products themselves are provided by the suppliers, and the FT cannot be
responsible for their accuracy.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (13): Even a beginner can't go
wrong - Wingz: User View
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE marketing services company, Programmes, picked the Informix Software
Wingz package not for its spreadsheet facilities, but for its graphics.
Programmes, in Corby, Northamptonshire, provides marketing services ranging
from telemarketing to building databases; it offers related consultancy in
fields such as market analysis, business planning and information technology
strategy; and it provides training in everything from presentation skills to
managing corporate change.
The company had been using Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet product and still
has this for general-purpose jobs but has switched to Wingz for preparing
graphs and charts for reports for clients.
Analysis of raw survey data is handled by the SAS System, a statistical
package starting at Pounds 800 from SAS Institute which itself has over 3m
users world-wide. This system is run on a Sun Microsystems computer and the
refined data is then passed to an Apple Macintosh running Wingz.
'Wingz is not easy to learn, but once you're into it you find it has a lot
more features than Excel, notably on the graphics side, and that makes it a
better package to use,' says Mr David Fleming, research director at
Programmes.
'In fact, it is probably harder to learn because of the features it has.'
Ms Jackie McKay, a marketing information consultant who has a background in
design, says that - as a now-experienced user  - she finds Wingz
'extraordinarily friendly, with enormous variety and elegance.'
Ms McKay points to the horrors of design which can emanate from amateurs
when they are given a package with unlimited choice - 'with the Wingz auto
facility, even a beginner can't go too far wrong,' she says. 'Wingz has
elegance and produces graphs, pie charts or whatever, which are neater and
tidier and have delicate lines.'
Wingz does some summary calculations on the survey data and Jackie McKay
says that here, too, the product comes out well. 'It was clearly designed by
people who knew what information was all about,' she says.
Mr Fleming agrees: 'We went for the product initially because of its
graphics, but once we got into it we found it has more spreadsheet
facilities too.'
Despite the praise for Wingz, Excel is still the most widely used package in
Programmes for pure spreadsheet work: producing business plans, financial
summaries and so on. This is partly to do with the very point made by Mr
Fleming that it is easier to learn.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (12) A question of balance - Case
Study: The Forestry Commission: How a national pioneer in the use of
personal computers in business is seeking to move spreadsheet processing off
the central computer system and on to its 200 PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Forestry Commission runs the 20/20 spreadsheet package on everything
from personal computers in forest offices to the central installation at its
national headquarters in Edinburgh.
The central set-up is a cluster of six DEC VAX computers supporting over 400
DEC VT terminals in the head office and in seven regional offices, plus
personal computers in the local offices, forest offices and workshops which
manage the 4,375 sq. miles of land directly under the Forestry Commission's
control.
The commission was a pioneer in using personal computers both as
self-contained machines and as terminals to a central system. In 1983 it
installed personal computers in local offices, choosing the Kennet machine
made by UK company Logica and sold by British Telecom as the Merlin. Nine
years later many of these machines are still running and make up about half
the commission's 200 personal computers.
Local and forest offices use the personal computers to manage their local
operations, running applications ranging from spreadsheets to payroll for
industrial staff. They link to the headquarters machines for central
applications such as financial systems, although the commission is looking
at passing some accounting functions out to the local offices, too.
Users can extract data relating to their operations from the centre and use
it in their 20/20 spreadsheets: there are around 35 local personal computers
running 20/20 and this is increasing to 55.
This combination of local and central processing reflects the fair amount of
autonomy given to the local operations.
However, the Forestry Commission also has headquarters functions, to which
the regional operations are quite closely tied. Staff in all these offices
need access to corporate financial and other systems for everything from
data entry to management applications.
In addition, they communicate with each other by electronic mail, controlled
by the central VAX set-up. Central software includes DEC's All-In-1 office
automation package and ledger systems from Dun and Bradstreet Software, as
well as 20/20: there are almost 290 20/20 users on the network.
These users have standard DEC VT terminals, connected to the centre by
British Telecom Kilostream fast digital links.
'We are keen to provide spreadsheets on local machines for local data
manipulation but there is also a central role for 20/20,' says systems
development manager Mr Alan Mitchell.
'It's horses for courses,' he says. 'For example, 20/20 on the central
machines is used to pull together information from local offices in summary
form. This is done for quite a few systems. As a matter of policy, certain
information is needed at specific times each month.'
Even so, the Forestry Commission wants to move spreadsheet processing off
the central system and on to personal computers where possible, although
many standard spreadsheets will continue to be run centrally for the
foreseeable future.
For the terminal-users, this possibility is being opened up gradually as old
terminals are replaced by personal computers, still linked to the centre.
'Spreadsheets are hungry beasts in terms of processing demand and the more
that are run centrally, the more power is taken out of the VAX,' says Mr
Mitchell.
'We want to provide the facility and, indeed, we offer training on demand
and we are producing examples of what people can do. But we are also looking
at ways of controlling the extent of the use, because of the demand on
processing resources.
'For example, we largely restrict central use to the headquarters and
regional offices and we are considering things like limiting the computer
memory space available to spreadsheet users.'
The commission is also striking a balance between encouraging spreadsheet
use and preventing users taking over all the processing power by providing
standard templates for some applications. This also ensures that, in some
cases at least, users are running spreadsheet programs which have been
professionally written and tested by the central computing team - rather
than risking writing incorrect programs of their own, which Mr Mitchell
regards as 'worrying, but difficult to control.'

Case study: Willis Corroon - Brokers working on renewal business can now
quickly extract mainframe information to produce vital statistical data via
personal computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE broker Willis Corroon has a UK network linking a big IBM
mainframe, DEC VAX minicomputers and 1,000 personal computers - but a Pounds
475 software package is proving the key to unlocking the data held in this
set-up for business users.
Willis Corroon, the world's fourth biggest broker, has settled on Lotus
Development's 1-2-3 spreadsheet package as a standard. It is offered to
users for their own ad hoc spreadsheet applications and is used by a central
computing team to develop major information systems which combine personal
computers and the mainframe.
'We see the spreadsheet as a tool which will allow us to exploit transaction
information already captured for other purposes,' says information services
manager Mr Peter Mellor.
'The personal computers on which 1-2-3 runs are seen not just as PCs but as
part of an overall mechanism for delivering information and system solutions
to meet business needs: it's important to think in terms of application
delivery, not individual items of hardware.'
These are fine words but they pose 'quite a challenge,' as Mr Mellor puts
it, both for users and for the computing people providing the systems.
One major information system now being used live but in prototype form and
expected to be snapped up eagerly across broking divisions highlights the
challenge.
This system uses standard business transaction data stored on the mainframe
to produce statistics for brokers working on and negotiating renewal
business.
'Previously, we would ask for the information and two days later we would
get a rain forest's worth of paper to wade through to find a useful figure
every 20 pages or so,' says Mr James Denison, a broker who has been a
leading figure in the user team behind this development. 'We now get the
information on demand.'
The term 'on demand' is relative here. A special program has been written at
the mainframe-end to extract the relevant data from the central database and
put it in a file which is passed to a personal computer. It takes around 25
minutes to load the data and run the system. This is far better than the
previous three days and the system produces information in an immediately
useable form - but it is still 25 minutes. A team led by Mr Andy Miles,
which develops 1-2-3 and other personal computer applications, is now
looking at ways of reducing this time, perhaps by doing preliminary
calculations on the mainframe.
Even so, the team has rejected the idea of running the mainframe version of
1-2-3, partly because spreadsheet programs can demand a lot of processing
resources and slow other jobs down and partly because running a package
designed for personal computing on a mainframe cuts its flexibility.
'The mainframe version is 'mainframey' and not so interactive for
end-users,' says Mr Miles.
At the user-end there are standard 1-2-3 spreadsheet templates for this
application, developed and tested by Mr Miles' team with the user group. But
users still have - and need  - considerable control, as Mr Denison explains:
'Lloyd's syndicates have three-year accounting periods but each has a
different way of handling, for example, the carrying forward of amounts
expected for outstanding claims. Our central accounting system, from which
the data is drawn, handles this in a single way; I have to translate that
into what it should be for each syndicate. I can't expect the central system
to know all the syndicates' different methods.'
Putting this power in users' hands demands considerable training, compared
with that needed for standard transaction processing applications on the
mainframe, Mr Miles says.
'We regard it as an obligation to disseminate as many of our professional
system development practices as possible, perhaps in a cut-down form, to the
business users so that they can use technology in the best ways by
themselves,' Mr Miles says.
'In addition, we can help in any way they wish: we can do the complete
project or provide consultancy or do quality assurance if users want to do
the actual development themselves.'
There are several ways in which users and computing people get together for
this passing on of professional computing practice and for users to pass
back their needs. Each business unit has its own systems manager, either a
computing person or a business person with deep computing knowledge and
interest. These people meet bi-monthly in user groups in London or at the
administrative headquarters in Ipswich, Suffolk, to discuss general topics.
There are also information technology steering groups and more technical
review groups, all regularly bringing together business and computing
people.
In addition, the information systems department produces a quarterly
newsletter, not a rough sheet but a professionally presented newsletter
which comes out on fixed dates.
'The user groups give us direction for doing things and we tell them what we
are doing and they disseminate the information back to their business
units,' Mr Miles says. 'We research new applications, directed by the
business, we support end-user computing and we do bespoke development.'
Spreadsheet applications developed by users themselves generally relate to
ad hoc statistical reporting. However, Lotus 1-2-3 has also been used by the
central team for major system development normally associated with a
mainframe computer.
A prime example is that of a system to produce credit and debit notes and
track their progress through the accounting process. The standard problem of
development backlog meant the computing department could not get round to
this system and then get it up and running on the mainframe for seven months
 -so an interim system was developed in four days using 1-2-3. Peter Mellor
insists that the system had to end up on the mainframe, even though it was
producing and tracking the credit and debit notes successfully.
'It had to integrate with other things on the mainframe,' he says. 'Yes, it
was cheap and quick to develop but if you keep doing things in this way you
end up with a mess of lots of little PC additions to mainframe applications
and a lot of extra manual effort to ensure the different but related aspects
running in different places are kept in line.'
Andy Miles says certain applications sit naturally on a personal computer,
especially those demanding great flexibility in information analysis. James
Denison, as a user, agrees: 'We analyse business by different brokers, for
management and this is very complex,' he says. 'It would take a very long
time to code this program using a traditional programming language. We did
it with Lotus 1-2-3 in 10 days.'
Willis Corroon settled on 1-2-3 because 'when we went into PCs it seemed the
natural choice,' as Andy Miles puts it. Any personal computer user is
allowed to have it.
Willis Corroon has 900 Compaq IBM-type personal computers in the UK and 100
Apple Macintosh machines. The Macintosh computers have been used mainly by
brokers in London: an extremely successful application here has been the
production of presentations for clients and underwriters.
Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet package has been the standard on the Macintosh
in Willis Corroon so far, but Lotus 1-2-3, launched on that machine late
last year, is now expected to take over - 'it's important to have a
consistent user-interface across all systems,' Andy Miles says.
With Lotus established as that user-interface for information analysis
systems, Mr Miles concludes by echoing Peter Mellor's earlier comment: 'Our
ultimate aim is to provide access to any information, regardless of where it
is stored, so that a user with a PC can see data from a big host computer as

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (6): Measuring the impact of
media campaigns - User view: Spreadsheets analyse product references in
press and TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London and Leeds-based public relations company, Infopress, believes it
has cracked the problem of accurately measuring the impact of media
campaigns with a system developed using the SuperCalc5 spreadsheet package
from Computer Associates, one of its clients.
Infopress, with 40 staff and a turnover of Pounds 3.2m, sends cuttings and
broadcast transcripts to freelance researchers. They work out the length and
how many times a company's name is mentioned and note occurrences of any
marketing messages being promoted by the media campaign. The impact of each
message in each item is given a score of between plus 10, representing
unqualified praise, and minus 10, for stinging condemnation.
The service typically covers the client and two competitors, plus three
messages, although in theory there are no technical limits on the number of
companies and messages being covered. Infopress makes this work as objective
as possible by not telling the researchers which company is the client.
The findings are sent in standard formats to Infopress, mostly by electronic
mail, over a dial-up communications link or on disc sent by post.
The data is received by a DEC Microvax 3400 computer, which combines all the
information from different researchers and does preliminary
number-crunching, using a program written by systems manager Dr Robert
Walker. The data is then passed to SuperCalc spreadsheets running on a Wyse
personal computer.
The current data can be displayed graphically, typically as bar charts, to
show, for example, the number of name references in specialist trade
journals, general business journals, national newspapers and television and
radio. This analysis can go right down to individual journals and
journalists if necessary.
Other spreadsheets show the impact of all promotional messages and of
individual messages, again across the different media. Up to this point,
SuperCalc is used mainly to convert the data into charts for easy
assimilation.
Indeed, Infopress considered desktop publishing packages for this task but
settled on a spreadsheet product because of the next stage in the data
analysis. In this next stage, Infopress uses the spreadsheet linking
function to combine the current and historic data to show trends over the
year.
'We particularly like this function, because the trend analyses enable us
for the first time to show a client clearly if a programme is really taking
off or if things are starting to go wrong,' says deputy chairman Dermot
McKeone.
The system, which Infopress calls Impact, allows the company to fine-tune
campaigns, for example by showing that the technology leadership message is
being picked up well by the trade press but not by national newspapers.
'Impact is designed to cut out the white noise to focus attention on
priorities and provide data on which strategic and tactical decisions can be
based,' says Mr McKeone.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (4):  Importance of central
control - Case study: Arthur Andersen/Credit Lyonnais: Avoiding errors - How
businesses in the financial sector keep a balance between unrestricted use
of spreadsheets and a measure of benevolent control.  Packages risks the
danger of amateur programmers producing incorrect business models on which
important decisions might be based.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That is a view shared by the UK heads of computer support services at
accounting and management consultancy firm Arthur Andersen and the French
bank Credit Lyonnais. Both have large numbers of users of the Microsoft
Excel product across the UK and try to strike a balance between unrestricted
use of spreadsheets and a measure of benevolent central control.
'I am concerned that spreadsheets can be dangerous in the hands of the
uninitiated,' says Mr David Freeman, director of audit computer services at
Arthur Andersen. 'You're giving what amounts to a programming tool to
someone with no programming training.
'Whenever we see spreadsheets from outside, our checks invariably reveal
that under certain circumstances they will give erroneous results.'
Mr Freeman says tax calculations are a prime example of a basic business
factor which is too often set up incorrectly in a spreadsheet: 'People tend
to build in tax calculations in a simplistic way and you find, for example,
that losses are not handled properly.'
He adds: 'I'm sure there are many companies making incorrect decisions
because their spreadsheets have errors in them.'
Even so, Mr Freeman says there are no restrictions on the use of
spreadsheets at Arthur Andersen - however, major spreadsheet development
work tends to be done by a specialist central team 'who know the traps and
tricks of preparing such models,' as Mr Freeman puts it.
Credit Lyonnais actually encourages users to develop their own so-called
macro-programs to extend their spreadsheets, using program instructions
supplied with the packages - 'we can't develop every program that everyone
wants centrally, so we encourage users to do as much as they can
themselves,' says Mr Danny Dawes, head of personal computer services.
'However, users have to realise that they shouldn't start relying on a macro
written by someone in their department and not supported by computing staff,
because if that person leaves, no one will understand the spreadsheet
program.
'We encourage users to tell us what they want and what they are trying to do
themselves and we like to work with them as much as possible, especially if
they are developing quite an involved spreadsheet program.'
Each department has someone who is the main liaison person for the central
computing unit. These people meet quarterly for a whole day to exchange
ideas and experiences. If a department has developed a useful spreadsheet
application which generates wide interest at the meeting, the computing unit
examines it with a view to providing central support for all departments.
'We don't want people re-inventing the wheel,' says Mr Dawes. Both Arthur
Andersen and Credit Lyonnais limit the potential duplication of spreadsheet
development effort, while exerting some central control, by providing
standard spreadsheet templates for often-repeated tasks.
At Credit Lyonnais, for example, in the head office on the edge of the City
of London and in branches across the UK, there are standard templates for
working on account histories and company analyses and for sending exchange
rates each day from the dealing room to the branches.
At Arthur Andersen there are around 400 professional staff using Excel,
mainly for auditing and documenting financial results of clients. Many take
portable computers - the company's preferred model at present is the Compaq
LTE - to clients' offices and can load data directly from a client's
spreadsheet into Excel, eliminating the need to key in the information.
'We previously used paper for documenting results but it's a lot easier with
an automated spreadsheet,' says David Freeman. 'An auditor can store the
data and roll it forward from year to year, so he doesn't have to start with
a blank sheet every time.
'If we can directly load in data from a client's spreadsheet we can annotate
that information. In addition, the spreadsheet can produce information in
graphical form, which is far easier to absorb quickly.'
Arthur Andersen and Credit Lyonnais have both switched to Microsoft's Excel
from Lotus 1-2-3 as their standard spreadsheet package because of Windows.
This is Microsoft's so-called graphical user interface, which offers users a
means of communicating with software in a simple way through graphics
displayed on the screen rather than instructions typed through a keyboard.
It also enables users to switch easily from one application program to
another: for example from word processing to running a spreadsheet.
Suppliers of personal computer software - including Lotus  - are adapting
their products to run with Windows following its early success: 5m copies of
the landmark 3.0 version were sold in the 12 months following the launch in
1990 and that figure has risen to 9m in the last eight months.
'We were fairly heavy users of Lotus 1-2-3 since its launch but we
recognised the effect of having lots of software packages - word processing,
spreadsheets and so on - which were not consistent: for example the F1 key
in one package would be F10 in another,' says David Freeman at Arthur
Andersen. 'So we moved to Windows, mainly for cost-savings on training.
'Once you're familiar with one package under Windows, the learning curve for
the next package is much lower than for a software product which uses the
traditional instruction style.'
The firm is using Excel, Word for Windows for word processing and Powerpoint
for presentation graphics.
'We previously standardised on Lotus 1-2-3 across the world and we have now
made a world-wide strategic move to Excel,' Mr Freeman says. 'This is a very
big issue: time is money for professional people, so we want to get the most
effective use of information technology in the shortest possible time.
'In addition, standardising on particular products makes support a lot
easier and also enables us to use purchasing power. We have central control
of purchasing to ensure people can't buy whatever they want: this might
sound a bit harsh but the benefits demand it.'
Danny Dawes at Credit Lyonnais agrees: 'Windows is certainly more fun,
pretty and easy to use, which is important when you've got 200 users who
only use a personal computer now and then.
'All the packages have the same look and structure, so if you've been on the
Excel course, the Word package for word processing makes sense quite
quickly. Users find packages running with Windows are more intuitive: they
can find their way round the products fairly easily. This in turn makes
support through our personal computer help-desk much easier.'
One of these support people also organises training. This person came in on
a government training scheme last autumn after joining a programming course
from a career in marketing in the computing industry. She started her period
of work experience at Credit Lyonnais by going on an intensive Windows
course, then set up a Windows awareness course for the bank's own staff and
started training users. She was so successful that the bank offered her a
full-time job.
Users at Credit Lyonnais get much of the raw data for their spreadsheets
from the central IBM 4381 computer. The bank has a data and electronic mail
network covering the UK, linking local area networks of personal computers
in branches and offices to the centre.
Like Arthur Andersen, the bank standardises on Compaq personal computers. It
has around 220 Windows users: 180 use Excel - this has cost the bank around
Pounds 35,000 for copies of the networked version - and a similar number use
Word.
Mr Dawes says there was some resistance to change among Lotus 1-2-3 users.
But he adds: 'The users quickly saw that operating under Windows was much
better. In addition, there's a 1-2-3 help facility in Excel to help Lotus
users get familiar with the Microsoft product.'
Lotus spreadsheets can be converted to Excel and initially some users took
up this opportunity, but that soon changed.
'Translating existing spreadsheets from another product would not allow us
to take full advantage of the power of Excel,' says Danny Dawes.
'In addition, many of the Lotus spreadsheets were written some time ago,
possibly without the same level of quality assurance or documentation, so
we've taken this opportunity to re-analyse and redesign them from scratch,
using Excel.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Beware: unexploded bombs -
Consultant's viewpoint: In forecasting, clever-looking spreadsheets often
present an air of correctness that would never apply to a simple column of
figures. The risks involved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOTUS 1-2-3 macros 'are like unexploded bombs all over British industry'
says a computer expert at one of the companies that the FT has visited for
Software At Work.
How true is this view?
Frighteningly true. Modern spreadsheets have an incredibly rich programming
language called the macro. Under Microsoft Excel, a macro can erase all the
files on a hard disk, reformat it and then crash the system. Yet, almost no
companies have any control over the programming that goes on across the
organisation.
There are two sorts of risks in using spreadsheet macros:
Firstly, the results they produce may be wrong.
Secondly, the macros quickly become impenetrable to anyone except the
original author.
Spreadsheets are often used by financial staff such as accountants who are
trained to look critically at the way that numbers are presented and
analysed. Sadly, they rarely apply the same criteria to their own creations.
It is rare to see a spreadsheet that has full cross-checking of the figures
used.
For example, in a table of figures, the rows and columns should be totalled
separately and the results compared. This maximises the chances of detecting
simple errors that often occur, (see table, above right).
In addition, the way that spreadsheets operate makes it easy for an error to
percolate throughout an entire calculation; and a small error may produce a
very large effect.
Spreadsheets often give an air of correctness that would never apply to a
simple column of figures. The workings are all hidden beneath the surface.
Much as with opinion polls, opinion rapidly becomes presented as fact, once
glossed with the spreadsheet mystique.
The classic example occurs in forecasting for which spreadsheets are often
used. The sales team sit with their trusty 1-2-3 system and try to estimate
the sales for the next 12 months. They put their 'gut feel' figures into the
sheet and look at the effect.
Often, a figure is used and then assumed to grow at a given rate (say, by 10
per cent a month). If the spreadsheet shows that the company will make a
profit at this level, the more cautious forecaster will try other figures
(say nine per cent or, perhaps, 11 per cent).
It is rarely questioned whether the sales will really grow in this fashion -
and, in fact, they very rarely do.
The sales director then presents the plan to the board showing how sales
'will' follow this pattern. Only the bolder managing director will question
how the original figures were derived, or how the growth rates were
calculated.
The key issue, therefore, is 'the margin of error.' If the original margin
of error was plus or minus five per cent and the monthly growth rate was
plus or minus five per cent, then the figure in 12 months' time may be as
much as 80 per cent wrong. Errors in forecasting are like compound interest.
And experience indicates that these errors are rarely on the favourable
side.
The other danger lies in the creation of sheets which are complex
mathematical models by people with no programming discipline. They tend to
ignore structure and commenting and rarely have any idea of the design.
Spreadsheets tend to grow organically, with new bits being tacked on as
required. The result is a mess, even if it is a mess that appears to work.
However, no company remains static for long and the model will require
updating. This may be difficult or even impossible, if the original writer
has moved on.
The solutions to these problems are not simple. It is unrealistic to expect
staff to leave all macro-writing to gurus in information technology. The
best solution is to train relevant employees in the correct use of
programming methods in macro-writing. This can be summed up in two words:
'comments' and 'design.'
If staff can only manage one, they should aim for comments. It is easier to
understand a badly designed sheet that has copious comments explaining each
stage, than a well-designed macro where there is no trace of the rationale
behind the design.
As a minimum, insist that columns and rows should self-check wherever
possible. Above all, ask for the margin of error in any forecasts.
Companies should develop (or buy) guidelines for macro-writing which spell
out the essentials of good practice. These should be distributed as part of
the training and regularly reviewed and modified in the light of experience.
They must also be enforced by periodic reviews of macros in use. A peer
level review is usually sufficient and can be a valuable team-building
exercise in itself.
Where macros exist that are important but too dangerous to touch, get a
professional in to deal with them. This will usually involve examining the
sheet and documenting what it does - and how. It can then be re-written in a
correct style and proper provision can be made for future growth.
Spreadsheets can be an excellent tool and a valuable business aid if
properly used. They need to be recognised as programming tools and subject
to the same development criteria.
Managers must remember that the results are no better that the original data
and to query the assumptions that underly any forecast. Perhaps Mark Twain's
famous saying about lies and statistics in 1924 could now be updated . . .
'There are three kinds of lies - lies, damned lies . . . and spreadsheets.'

IT PAYS TO CROSS-CHECK: The cell E5 has the wrong calculation  -
and in many cases, the incorrect total might not be spotted. Simply by
cross-checking the row totals with the column totals, the error can be
identified. It is relatively simple to add a cell with a line like the
following: IF (E7=E8, E7, @ERR). This will display the total if the two
values match, otherwise it will display an error.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (2): A much-ignored problem - Key
Issues for users: Important business decisions are increasingly based on
spreadsheets, but few companies have any way of testing their accuracy and
significant errors can occur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE proliferation of personal computers has put a spreadsheet package on
virtually every business user's desk. So the package suppliers - and many
big user companies - are now looking beyond financial modelling towards
promoting these products as a standard way of accessing central information
systems. But encouraging users to be more adventurous is raising new issues
of control and verification as important business decisions are based
increasingly on spreadsheets.
Certainly the spreadsheet package is well placed to become a standard
business tool, just like a calculator. A survey by the UK's National
Computing Centre has shown that 98 per cent of companies supply spreadsheet
packages to their personal computer users. These products are marginally
more popular than word processing packages, which won a 97 per cent vote.
Some way behind, in third place, were database packages, mentioned by 87 per
cent.
In addition, a tiny handful of products dominate the market and have
therefore become virtual standards, certainly in individual companies which
direct their users to one package to make training and support simpler and
to get the best discounts.
Lotus 1-2-3, launched around the time that computer industry leader IBM made
the personal computer respectable by entering the market, now claims 16m
users world-wide. The various versions of 1-2-3 took almost half the UK
market in unit sales and over 60 per cent in sales by value last year,
according to market research firm Romtec.
Computer Associates' SuperCalc and Microsoft's Excel both had around 20 per
cent of unit sales, Romtec says. Excel had over 20 per cent by value and
SuperCalc, which is a fifth of the price, had just over six per cent.
These three products took 90 per cent of the UK market between them.
According to VNU Business Publications' Software Users' Yearbook there are
around 55 spreadsheet packages available in the UK, including eight versions
of 1-2-3.
If different versions of each product are counted as one, the choice comes
down to around 40 - only a few more than the number of add-on packages
listed: everything from systems to print spreadsheets sideways to get a
better fit on the paper to products for linking into databases. This is a
far cry from the 400-plus accounting packages thought to be available in the
UK, for example.
In addition, the different focuses of the leading suppliers have restricted
the choice further on different computers. The most notable case here
concerns the Apple Macintosh computer: Lotus 1-2-3 was launched for this
machine only in December, which means Excel has so far been the only one of
the top products to be available to Macintosh users.
So, with a relatively limited number of very widely used products and with
just three of these dominating the market, the scene is set for suppliers
and users to see spreadsheet packages as standard tools in other fields,
too.
'There's no doubt that in the last 18 months or so we have been promoting
1-2-3 not only for personal use but also for use at work group or
organisational level,' says the head of Lotus Development in Europe, Mr Paul
Bailey. 'We have versions for mainframes, for networks and so on, to
facilitate the use of 1-2-3 as a front-end to corporate data.
'There are categories of front-end tools: other tools might be more suited
to transaction-based applications but the spreadsheet fills the category
which meets the need for analysis of data once it's extracted from the
corporate database.'
Mr Bailey says the spreadsheet package is thus moving into the area
dominated and perhaps created by the more expensive executive information
system - 'we certainly use the term 'executive information system' in our
marketing now,' he says.
Some of the companies interviewed in the following pages are already going
this way; others are now using spreadsheet programs for imaginative
applications which are far removed from the original financial modelling job
that the products were mainly designed for.
However, as some of these companies also point out, letting amateur
programmers develop business models on which key investment or other
decisions will be based is not without risk. This risk is highlighted by a
survey this year by accountancy and consultancy firm Coopers Lybrand
Deloitte.
This survey of spreadsheets produced by 31 top companies found that over 90
per cent had errors of more than five per cent in their results.
'In four companies, the spreadsheets were so poor that the results were just
meaningless and the models had to be rewritten,' says Mr Gavin Potter, a
principal associate, who led the study.
He quotes examples of the impact of these errors: a net present value was
wrong by 54 per cent; an incorrect interest calculation showed pre-tax
profit which was wrong by six per cent; an incorrect depreciation rate led
to a seven per cent error in net profit.
Design or programming errors made up 69 per cent of the total. The other
problems were errors in financial or accounting theory (19 per cent) and
human error, typically typing mistakes (12 per cent).
'Clearly, most of the errors occurred because the writers of the
spreadsheets had had little training in how to produce robust results,' Mr
Potter says.
'Yet despite the widespread occurence of significant errors, we found that
this is a much-ignored problem.'
The following pages feature some companies which believe they are doing all
that can reasonably be done to overcome the problem without restricting use
of the products.
They provide, for example, central training, consultancy and a focal point
for the exchange of user-experiences.
Yet even these companies cannot guarantee to have eliminated the danger. It
is thought that users typically use only 20 per cent of spreadsheet package
facilities, so the danger must grow as business people become more familiar
with spreadsheet programs, use more of the facilities and trust them
increasingly as part of their day-to-day work.
A 54 per cent error such as that mentioned by Mr Potter at Coopers Lybrand
Deloitte could make quite a difference to a business decision.
But as Mr Potter says: 'Although spreadsheets are often heavily relied on
despite their relatively recent introduction, few firms have any way of
testing the accuracy of the results generated.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Buzzwords explained
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE are some of the technical terms you will encounter in this issue of
Software at Work. The following brief definitions are for readers who may
not have a technological background:
OPEN SYSTEMS: front ends.
A relational database stores 'relationships' between data items, as well as
the data itself, so that information from different files can be combined in
one search. Previously, 'hierarchical' systems were organised in separate
files, each with a unique index, and a search for information might require
a custom-built report program, (such as now can be managed with a one-line
SQL statement).
SQL: This product, the Standard Query Language originated by IBM, has become
the lingua franca for access to all relational databases.
Blobs: The types of data items (or 'attributes') held in relational
databases are normally restricted to strings of characters, of fixed length,
and numbers, to hold, for example, names and addresses and salaries. It is
becoming increasingly common to support a further type of data, the binary
large object or Blob. This is a data item of any variable length, and
containing any kind of data. The most common use for Blobs is to hold text
and digitally stored picture data.
OLTP: Online transaction processing is the instant entry and handling of
business transactions, for example, orders. Such systems have to be robust,
reliable, and 'failsafe,' and usually make heavy demands on the computer.
Poor performance is often caused by an 'i/o bottleneck' (input/output), a
traffic jam of transactions queueing between the processor and data storage.
A fourth generation language or 4GL, is a marketing term applied to software
products used for writing programs. They provide short cuts for programmers
(and sometimes end-users). Typically, a one-line 4GL statement, often in an
English-type form, translates into several lines of code in a traditional
('third generation') computer language, such as Cobol.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): Global aims call for softer
software - Comment: Companies seeking business in world markets are becoming
aware that their plans must be backed up by an effective strategy in
information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE globalisation of business is fast becoming a reality for large and
medium-sized companies. Most large organisations expect by the mid-1990s to
be doing business in more countries than they are today.
For these businesses, the need to think globally while acting locally has
become an imperative. Global operations have a number of advantages of which
the most important is economy of scale. Fashion and taste are beginning to
converge in all the world's major markets as a consequence of improved
communications and media coverage. Global distribution and marketing brings
the possibility of increased sales volumes without the need to duplicate
research, development and production budgets.
Many managers, however, would subscribe to the view that designing a
successful international operation is a huge challenge. The trick is to
strike an effective balance between central authority and local autonomy.
Too much strength at the centre can result in a top heavy bureaucracy that
inhibits flexibility and initiative at the local level. IBM is just one
global giant struggling to overcome this difficulty. Give the local
operations too much power, however, and fragmentation of purpose can destroy
synergies and economies of scale. The world's motor manufacturers, for
example, are only now beginning to scent success in their search for a
'world car' after years of trying. Local operations were too fond of
designing models to suit only local needs.
An effective global business strategy, moreover, must be underpinned by an
effective global information technology strategy. Accurate and timely
information provides a means of co-ordinating business activities worldwide
and improving marketing. Devising a global information systems strategy,
however, is a difficult trick to master.
Some companies do not even try. A study carried out last year for the Amdahl
Executive Institute revealed that 52 per cent of large companies rarely or
never considered information systems in their global strategy development.
Only 14 per cent of the companies canvassed always took information systems
into account.
Yet companies such as Unilever, featured in this issue of Software at Work,
have clearly gained significant competitiveness from a level headed approach
to internationalising their information systems strategy.
In particular, Unilever understands the difficulty of transferring software
between different countries and has applied pragmatism rather than
technological fireworks. The company has laid down a limited number of
hardware and software options all of which will work together in an open
framework.
The lesson is that 'softer' software - much easier to use than today's
cumbersome code - is a prerequisite for global success.
The advent of 'multimedia' (see pages 30-32) may offer less formal ways of
ensuring transferability of software between different countries.
Multimedia systems combine text, graphics, still and moving video images and
sound. It is possible because once translated into the computer language of
'0s' and '1s', all media are grist to the computer's mill. Compact disk
drives provide the essential low-cost storage.
As Philip Manchester points out, (page 30), multimedia has to date been a
technology looking for an application. But the technologies which together
constitute multimedia are no longer laboratory curiosities and new and
practical applications are emerging almost daily. Apple, for example, claims
to have systems that recognise continuous speech - without having to be
specially 'trained'.
So just as Apple's Macintosh technology and Microsoft's Windows 3.0
interface have made software packages much simpler to use, so at some point,
multimedia techniques - which look like the best way of communicating
complex information through a computer system - could ease the
transportability of business software across national boundaries.
But until that time, Unilever's example of hard-headed pragmatism will be
the one to follow.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: An end to double VAT taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to impose value-added tax on the private use of company cars could
backfire on HM Customs and Excise and result instead in a reduction in the
cost of car leasing.
As well as removing existing VAT charges to employees who pay for their
cars, there would also be a benefit to businesses as diverse as hospitals
and insurance companies.
Customs sees the benefit of private use as a service supplied by companies
to their employees, on the value of which VAT should be paid.
The ensuing dispute with the companies, however, could end in a fundamental
change to the way the UK applies this European tax. Since the issue revolves
around a case initially brought by a German individual against his local tax
office, it also illustrates the extent to which the UK has already
irretrievably ceded control of its taxation to superior and sophisticated
European legislation.
The change in VAT treatment now seems likely because the Customs' action has
focused attention on this German case in which the European Court of Justice
in Luxembourg ruled that a German statute similarly taxing the private use
of a business vehicle was overridden by the direct effect of European VAT
legislation.
From the ruling it is quite clear that the UK has made the same fundamental
error as the German VAT authorities in implementing the tax, and has failed
to follow the principles of the underlying European legislation. This
failure is unnecessarily inflating the price of various services, including
car leasing, and costing VAT-exempt businesses and private users a double
charge of VAT.
To appreciate the significance of the error it must be understood that at
present the whole UK car leasing industry is taxed unfairly. Unlike any
other taxable business, car lessors cannot deduct the VAT on the purchase of
cars from the VAT which they must pay on rentals.
In the UK, VAT can only be deducted on the purchase of a new car for resale,
not when it is used for leasing or in any other kind of business. This means
that, contrary to the general system of VAT, when a car is leased, tax is
paid to Customs twice.
In the German case, a Dr Kuhne successfully relied on the VAT principle that
there can be no taxation without a corresponding deduction. The European
Court of Justice supported him in his claim that he should not be taxed on
his private use of the car since he had been unable to recover VAT when he
acquired it.
In the UK, Customs and Excise have been busy in recent years ensuring that
VAT is not deducted by exempt businesses, such as insurers, banks and
hospitals, which are not allowed to do so because they do not have to charge
VAT on their services.
The principle upheld by the ECJ for Dr Kuhne supports counter-action by
those businesses to remove double taxation arising from the insistence by
Customs that VAT should be paid, for example, on the use of assets shared by
groups of such companies.
It seems that Customs has not yet fully recognised that it is administering
a European tax whose principles cannot be altered or omitted, and which
override national laws. This was plainly demonstrated in the Kuhne decision.
The Kuhne case involved the private use of a vehicle for which the business
owner made no actual charge to himself. The German authority therefore
assumed a value for the deemed supply of the private use and assessed for
tax accordingly.
This action was taken under a German national statute, corresponding to the
European provision for taxation of private use of business assets, but with
one essential difference - the European law does not charge for deemed use
where the business, for whatever reason, has not been able to recover VAT on
the asset purchase.
With the help of the ECJ, Dr Kuhne was therefore able to defeat the VAT
charge. The Court said that the European legislation was complete and
legally perfect and consequently capable of having direct effect in
Community countries. The European law simply overrode the effect of the
local national statute in Germany.
Although the European principle has not been enshrined in UK national law,
until recently Customs and Excise did not attempt to tax such private use of
cars where no actual charge was made for the use.
However, that policy showed disturbing signs of change last year with the
emergence of the so-called salary sacrifice issue. It became known that
Customs was levying VAT on the difference in salary between those employees
who opted for company cars and those who did not, on the basis that the
supposed shortfall represented the value of the car to the employee.
This policy must have caused some minor embarrassment to the Treasury, whose
fiscal policy seems in recent years to have been encouraging employees to
swap cars for salary.
So far, in a case involving the Co-operative Insurance Society, the VAT
Tribunal has decided this matter against Customs. However, Customs is able
to appeal the matter to the higher courts. Although the case was decided on
other grounds, the Tribunal noted that prima facie the UK VAT law was proved
defective by reference to the Kuhne decision.
So how does this help car leasing and exempt businesses sharing assets, all
of which, unlike Dr Kuhne, make an actual economic charge for the use of the
asset?
The answer is that the principle is precisely the same, whether or not any
charge is actually made. There can be no taxation without deduction and if
deduction is blocked, taxation must not follow.
As might be expected of legislation which is complete and legally perfect,
the relevant relief is to be found in the same EC Sixth Directive on VAT
invoked by Dr Kuhne, which dates from 1977.
Article 13 of the Directive deals with exemption from tax and exempts the
supply of goods (which may include supply by way of lease) on which VAT has
not been deducted. To leave no doubt as to its intention, the Article
specifically includes those items on which VAT deduction has been blocked by
national order, such as the UK block on cars.
It therefore seems clear that, if asked to decide on the matter, the ECJ
would conclude as it did in the Kuhne case that the exemption provision is
complete and legally perfect so as to have direct effect in the UK.
Such a decision, given to a UK company, would radically change the taxation
of UK car leasing and ease the burden of VAT administration for exempt
businesses. It would mean either that car lessors no longer needed to charge
VAT on rentals or that they should be given the right to deduction on their
purchases of cars.
In either event, the cost of leasing would be reduced and, on cars purchased
for the business, there would be no charges of VAT to employees, whether or
not they paid for private use. In its wider application, hospitals and
wholly exempt insurance groups, for instance, would no longer need to be
concerned that the movement of assets might produce further charges of
irrecoverable VAT.
It remains to be seen whether Customs will act to resolve the anomaly, or
will resist such a change on the grounds of fiscal cost. There is, however,
more at stake than a slight drop in the tax take.
The harmonisation of VAT and the removal of European trade frontiers after
1992 is meant to ease administrative burdens and level the fiscal playing
field for national competitors.
The Kuhne case, and others like it, have proved that the European VAT
legislation works in practice and is truly self-sufficient. It would be a
pity to find that UK businesses were disadvantaged in the single market by a
national administration which, in failing to recognise this fact, continued
to implement an incomplete form of VAT and penalised its own trading
community.

   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL uncertainty prompted volatile trading which saw the March contract
slip back in a highly nervous FT-SE futures market, writes Christopher
Price.
March opened down at 2,471, but hesitant buying squeezed it higher, the
contract reaching 2,483 by mid-morning, which turned out to be the high
point of the day.
Weak short sterling and gilt markets prompted further nervousness, and March
began to drift downwards, although trading remained thin.
The downward trend accelerated in the late afternoon as independent traders
sold their long positions, joined by a number of institutions.
March found support at the 2,458 level and recovered slightly to close at
2,460, down 29 on the previous session and at a discount of around 8 points
to its 4-point fair value premium and at a discount to the underlying
market. Turnover was a low 5,126 lots.
There was also thin volume in the LTOM, with just 25,000 lots traded.
Midland Bank was the favourite, trading 2,910 contracts, although it and the
other top traded stocks - Sears, Amstrad and Wellcome  - reached their
contract expiry date and traders closed out their positions

FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: More scope for Anglo-Danish trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Davis, chairman of Scandinavian Seaways Ltd, the UK arm of the Danish
ferry company, adds the position of chairman and director of the Danish-UK
Chamber of Commerce to his long list of other directorships.
Davis, 63, says he intends to give the organisation, which was founded as
recently as 1989, 'a shot in the arm'. 'On their side there are all these
wonderful names like Carlsberg, Bang &amp; Olufson and Lurpak, and Denmark is
one of our oldest allies. But we do a whole lot less business together than
we might.'
Whereas Britain is Denmark's third largest trading partner, Denmark ranks
fourteenth with Britain. Last year British imports from Denmark amounted to
Pounds 2.27bn; exports were worth Pounds 1.4bn.
His career has been spent in international shipping and transportation,
including at P &amp; O, followed by 15 years as a director covering shipping and
transportation finance at Kleinwort Benson. He says he qualifies for the
Chamber on a number of scores - 'with two Danish au pairs, and one Danish
girlfriend a long time ago'. He has also chaired Scandinavian Seaways UK
since 1984.
Other current commitments include the chairmanships of TIP Europe and
Bromley Shipping and a directorship of Associated British Ports Holdings.
Davis's predecessor at the Chamber of Commerce was Sir Ronald McIntosh, who
is now advising John Gummer and the UK government on food aid to Russia.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: New head for PA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PA Consulting Group, the international management and technology
consultancy, yesterday named Jon Moynihan as group chief executive.
Moynihan moves to PA from First Manhattan Consulting Group in New York where
he is currently managing vice president. He joined First Manhattan in 1982
shortly after the company was founded and played a prominent role in its
growth in financial services consulting.
Before joining First Manhattan, Moynihan, 43, worked for McKinsey in Europe,
and Strategic Planning Associates in the US. His education similarly spans
the Atlantic; he has degrees from Balliol College, Oxford, the North London
Polytechnic and MIT.
Moynihan's appointment follows the decision made last September by John
Foden to step down as PA's chief executive having completed six years in
that post and three as chairman, though he remains non-executive chairman.
PA Consultancy currently employs 1,700 staff worldwide.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls to
new five-year low

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
THE Nikkei average fell to a new five-year low yesterday as selling by
corporations and financial institutions continued to depress share prices,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average shed 153.32 to 19,764.31, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks registered a decline of 26.09 to 1,407.78, falling for
the 13th consecutive day, its longest losing streak since 1953.
After opening at the day's high of 19,878.14, the Nikkei fell to the
session's low of 19,490.53 on broad-based selling by institutional and
individual investors, and on arbitrage unwinding.
Volume expanded to 400m shares from 350m, as life insurance companies were
seen cross-trading to realise profits ahead of the March book-closing.
Declining issues overwhelmed those advancing by 840 to 165, while 124 stocks
were unchanged.
A total of 454 shares, or 37 per cent of all the shares listed on the first
section, fell to new lows since the start of last year.
An announcement that the government had scheduled talks on measures to
stimulate the economy failed to lift the market's negative sentiment.
Market participants are now looking for shares to bottom out. More
optimistic analysts believe the next support for the Nikkei lies around
19,600, its one-year moving average.
Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg Securities said that while some market
participants did not see any support until the 18,000 level, investors were
looking to buy shares around 19,000.
Foreign pension funds were seen purchasing low-priced blue chips related to
the automobile industry. The slight recovery in automobile demand in the US
encouraged investors. Honda Motor moved up Y30 to Y1,490 and Nissan Motor
firmed Y1 to Y570.
In contrast, large-capital steels, which investors see as 'benchmark
stocks', lost more ground. Nippon Steel slipped Y6 to Y296, falling below
Y300 for the first time since July 1986. NKK lost Y15 to Y266 and Kawasaki
Steel retreated Y11 to Y292.
Issues previously active on the Aids and environment themes weakened on
meeting profit-taking. Okamoto, the leading condom maker, fell Y70 to Y1,130
and Japan Storage Battery Y40 to Y1,070.
Financial shares were lower as companies continued to liquidate holdings.
Industrial Bank of Japan dropped Y210 to Y2,310 and Mitsubishi Bank fell
Y110 to Y2,200.
Brokerage issues declined on earnings concern. After the market closed,
leading houses announced downward earnings revisions for the current year.
Nomura Securities receded Y10 to Y1,120 and Yamaichi Securities dipped Y5 to
Y730.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 423.50 lower at 20,914.37 following a
record volume of 614.7m shares.
Roundup
THE CONTINUED weakness of Tokyo weighed on bourses on the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG recovered after falling more than 100 points to an intraday low of
4,938 as investors switched out of HSBC following Tuesday's announcement
that it was to buy Midland Bank, of the UK.
HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 3.00 or 6.6 per cent to HKDollars 42.25, while
the Hang Seng index finished a net 9.32 down at 5,036.07 in turnover of
HKDollars 3.4bn, against HKDollars 2.2bn.
Bargain hunting drove the market up after the early falls and other blue
chips gained. Hang Seng Bank put on 75 cents or 1.7 per cent to HKDollars
44.00 and Bank of East Asia moved forward 90 cents to HKDollars 22.00.
Property group Cheung Kong, forecast to report a strong increase in 1991
profits next week, advanced 50 cents or 2.2 per cent to HKDollars 23.10.
TAIWAN fell as failure by the ruling National Party to resolve an internal
dispute over democratic reform continued to depress sentiment.
The weighted index lost 38.37 to 4,851.95 in turnover of TDollars 24.4bn,
after TDollars 29.3bn.
MANILA recovered lost ground as Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT)
and Philippine National Bank (PNB) were in better form after two consecutive
days of falls. The composite index rallied 18.26 to 1,101.27 in turnover of
118m pesos.
PNB rose 11 pesos to 260 pesos and PLDT gained 20 pesos to 870 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR ended the day above the 600 level, the first time since March
2. The composite index put on 5.91 to 600.40 in volume of 34m shares,
against 27.1m.
Tanjong, the gaming group, gained 90 cents to MDollars 10.80 amid rumours
that it may extend its local operations. Telekom Malaysia rose 30 cents to
MDollars 11.60 on 1.7m shares.
SEOUL dipped slightly in the afternoon session, with buying from the Market
Stabilisation Fund preventing a steeper decline.
The composite stock index ended 0.83 off at 614.36 in turnover of
Won300.34bn.
BANGKOK was lifted by demand for property and finance stocks and the SET
index closed 12.73 up at 808.49 in turnover of Bt6.75bn.
Krisda Mahanakorn, a property group, rose Bt8 to Bt226 and Bangkok Land
gained Bt6 to Bt204.
BOMBAY fell for the second consecutive day, the BSE index closing 70.77
lower at 3,128.01.
AUSTRALIA eased afresh, the All Ordinaries index slipping 10.7 to 2,416.6 in
turnover of ADollars 171.8m.
TNT lost 4 cents to ADollars 1.93, having announced earlier this week that
it was to expand further in Europe through the acquisition of a French
express carrier.
NEW ZEALAND remained lacklustre, with the NZSE-40 index closing 5.78 down at
1,448.66 in turnover of NZDollars 22.13m. Carter Holt Harvey appreciated 4
cents to NZDollars 2.32 while Telecom declined 1 cent to NZDollars 2.35.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses focus on special
situations in mixed trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL stocks featured in mixed trading yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS was dominated by special situations. The CAC-40 index fell 15.41 to
1,928.18 in turnover of FFr2.5bn.
Pechiney International jumped FFr7.60 or 4 per cent to FFr198.60 in heavy
volume of 765,600 shares after getting the green light to sell its aluminium
activities to its parent, leaving it with the more profitable packaging
side. Dealers were surprised that the shares reacted to strongly, since the
restructuring had been widely expected. Investment certificates in the
parent fell FFr6 to FFr327 with 65,250 units traded. CMB, another packaging
group, fell 90 centimes to FFr198.90 with 125,000 shares traded. Some
analysts expect investors to switch out of CMB into Pechiney International.
Perrier fell FFr63 or 3.9 per cent to FFr1,545 with 64,650 shares traded.
There were rumours that the Agnelli group and Nestle had done a deal to
resolve the struggle for the mineral water company, whereby Nestle would pay
FFr1,575 per share to the Agnelli group, giving it a capital gain, and in
return, Nestle's bid would be unopposed. Euro Disney is due to replace
Perrier in the CAC-40 index by today.
FRANKFURT gave up some of its early gains to close with the DAX index 2.11
higher at 1,732.18, after an intraday high of 1737.77 and a 2.18 gain to
704.45 for the FAZ at midsession. Turnover eased from DM4.4bn to DM4.3bn.
Company news moved shares both ways. BMW rose DM4.50 to DM553.50 on
expectations of a 10 per cent rise in net profit when it reports today.
Schering dropped DM7.90 to DM849.10 on fears that Japan might shelve plans
to legalise the pill. Schering ran sixth in the active stocks list in
turnover of DM205m. Asko came 10th as it rose DM25 to DM770 on Tuesday's
story that profits could treble between 1990 and 1995.
AMSTERDAM again focused on Heineken as it reached another record high,
closing up Fl 4.80 or 2.6 per cent at Fl 186.00. The CBS Tendency Index rose
just 0.2 to 125.8.
Since reporting better-than-expected 1991 results nearly two weeks ago,
Heineken has gained over 11 per cent. Investors have taken confidence from
the results and signs that the company's performance in 1992 will be even
better. Grolsch was pulled along by Heineken to close up Fl 1.00 at Fl
207.00.
Elsevier also recorded a new high, gaining 20 cents to Fl 117.70 ahead of
tomorrow's 1991 results. VMF Stork slipped back 80 cents to Fl 44.40 after
reporting a modest rise in 1991 net profit.
MILAN closed higher but dealers wondered if the bourse could hold on to its
new-found strength. The Comit index rose 6.81 or 1.4 per cent to 510.09 in
turnover estimated at L95bn after L80bn.
Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, rose L58 or 3.5 per cent
to L1,713 following news earlier this week that the group had raised L120bn
by selling a stake in a German automotive parts company.
Italcable rose L200 to L5,500 after reporting 1991 results in line with
expectations. Italgas recovered from a drop earlier in the week on
disappointing 1991 figures, closing up L90 to L3,418. Some analysts said
they were downgrading their 1992 forecasts, citing margin pressure and
increased debt levels.
ZURICH saw slightly higher profits and a rise in dividend, but no stock
split at Brown Boveri, whose bearers rose SFr70 to SFr3,640 and gave the
market a firm tone as the all-share SPI index closed 3.2 higher at 1,133.7.
STOCKHOLM majored on Tuesday's Wall Street gains and steady profits from
Asea, co-owner with Brown Boveri of the international operating company,
ABB. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 13.8 to 1,002.5 as Asea B climbed
SKr14 to SKr338.
The forestry index closed 3.9 per cent higher, with Stora B up SKr14 to
SKr289, on US recovery hopes.
MADRID weakened ahead of today's holiday. The general index closed down 0.67
at 258.55 in turnover of some Pta12bn against Pta10.8bn.
OSLO rallied with the all-share index closing up 8.07 or 1.9 per cent to
432.45 in turnover of NKr438.62m. Norsk Hydro put on NKr4.5 to NKr149.5
while Saga Petroleum free shares closed NKr3 higher at Nkr89.00.
ISTANBUL was boosted by a cash inflow from bond maturity repayments and the
75-share index closed up 128.05 or 3.4 per cent at 3,899.15 in turnover of
TL235.8bn. VIENNA's ATX index rose 11.72 to 1,052.35 after a 1.5 per cent
gain on Tuesday with Maculan, the construction, real estate and building
materials group, up another Sch40 to Sch1,275.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore ignores favourable prospects
 -Domestic brokers shrug off any good news as an aberration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most investors in these troubled times would be happy to put money into the
stock market of a country where the economy is predicted to grow at between
4 and 6 per cent this year and where brokers are forecasting average
corporate earnings growth of around 15 per cent.
Not so the glum speculators of Singapore. Ignoring the underlying strength
of their own economy and the spark-ling stock market performance on Wall
Street and in Hong Kong, they fear a repeat of the 1985-86 south-east Asian
recession and have marked down the local stock exchange accordingly.
Foreign investors have been forced to follow suit. Yesterday the Straits
Times Industrial index slipped 3.52 to 1,441.84, for a fall of 3.3 per cent
since the start of the year, in characteristically dull trading.
Any hint of bad news has the Singapore Chinese punters nodding as if to say:
'I told you so.' Good news is shrugged off as an aberration: when DBS Bank
announced 1991 profits at the higher end of expectations this month, the
share price promptly fell. Even Sembawang Shipyard's 38.5 per cent increase
in net earnings for last year has failed to lift the gloom.
'These are strange times,' says one foreign broker, who thinks the real
economic prospects are relatively rosy. 'We have seen the market take fright
over the economic outlook.'
A local Chinese stockbroker explains that investors remain nervous about the
effects of the world slowdown on Singapore's trade-dependent economy, and
are more interested in the Tokyo market's poor performance  - and Japan's
financial scandals - than in Wall Street.
Furthermore, he complains, over-regulation by the Singapore authorities has
driven away some of the speculators
Growth prospects in Singapore's maturing domestic economy are less exciting
than they were, and many of the most dynamic companies on the island are not
those listed on the exchange, but the wholly-owned foreign enterprises on
the industrial estates. 'In the domestic corporate sector, there is a lot of
capital facing too few opportunities,' says another broker, 'and rightly
they are cautious about overseas expansion.'
Singapore may be dull, but few analysts think it has far to fall. The market
is on a historically low prospective 1992 price/earnings ratio of about 15
times, local interest rates are low, liquidity is plentiful, and most large
companies are not highly geared.
The Stock Exchange of Singapore, meanwhile, hopes that turnover will be
increased by the gradual introduction of paperless electronic trading, by
the advent of stock options later this year, and by this week's allocation
of SES seats to seven foreign stockbroking companies, known as international
members. Mr Kok Kar Wing, SES executive vice-president, says: 'Ours is
predominantly a retail market, but gradually the insti-tutional share is
growing.'
SES officials intend to make Singapore a regional share-trading centre: 10
Hong Kong shares and, for the first time, an Indonesian Depositary Receipt -
for the tyremaker Gadjah Tunggal  - are already quoted on the central limit
order book (Clob) system.
So are 113 Malaysian stocks, because much of the stock is held and traded in
Singapore in spite of the split between the Kuala Lumpur and Singapore stock
markets three years ago. Malaysia has announced plans to go paperless, which
threatens to take business away from Singapore, but the SES and the brokers
are hoping to devise a way round the problem.
'I do not think the market in Malaysian shares will disappear,' says Mr Kok.
'We will find a way round the Malaysian thing,' agrees the Chinese broker.
At least it gives everyone something to think about until the market
recovers.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming groups seek safety in
numbers - A merger that will create the country's biggest agricultural
co-operative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING competition in agriculture has just wrought the largest ever
consolidation of farmer co-operatives in the US. Farmland Industries, the
Kansas City-based co-operative that ranks 143rd on the Fortune 500 list of
industrial companies, and Union Equity, based in Enid, Oklahoma, the biggest
US grain co-operative, have agreed on a merger.
This would result in the largest agricultural co-operative in the US,
surpassing Agway in DeWitt, New York. The combined assets of Farmland and
Union Equity exceed Dollars 1.7bn. But even at this size, Farmland will face
some significant risks in re-entering the grain trade.
The US world market share in grains has been shrinking steadily in recent
years, with American maize exports at the lowest point in 15 years and wheat
exports at the lowest in nine, according to grain market analyst Mr Daniel
Basse, research director of AgResource in Chicago. While the US has claimed
a big slice of exports to the former Soviet Union - which it has won largely
through government credits  - it has lost significant market share in other
grain importing countries.
Decreasing exports have exerted such pressure on the US grain industry in
recent years that it has suffered a shake down, with numerous companies
consolidating or going out of business.
Union Equity, which exports more than half its members' production, has not
escaped unscathed, losing some Dollars 20m since 1989. In addition, it has
had difficulty in earning profits on its grain storage elevators.
While these once were used by the US government to store grain stocks, a
change of policy by Washington on storage has left excess capacity in
elevators. Union Equity had to close seven of its 17 terminal elevators in
1990 and attempted, but failed, to sell other elevators last year.
Some in the grain trade suggest that Union Equity needs a cash infusion and
they wonder if Farmland will have the deep pockets required to keep it
afloat.
Under the proposed deal, which is expected to be approved in June, Farmland
would purchase the assets of Union Equity. Terms of the sale have not been
disclosed. The merger does, however, have considerable potential benefits
for both partners.
Farmland, a manufacturing and food marketing co-operative with 1,820 members
in 19 states, makes fertiliser, feed, batteries, tyres, agricultural
chemicals, animal care and petroleum products, as well as pork, bacon and
sausages for consumers. Last year, it earned Dollars 50.2m on sales of
Dollars 3.6bn.
Although its recent diversification efforts have largely been meat-related,
Farmland wants to step back into the grain business to secure supplies for
its value-added food and feed products. Its previous experience in the grain
industry was with the acquisition in the 1970s of Far-Mar-Co, a grain
marketer with large storage facilities.
But as the economy soured in the early 1980s and losses accumulated,
Farmland was forced to sell Far-Mar-Co in 1984. The buyer was Union Equity.
Union Equity, with 480 members in nine central and south-western states, is
a top buyer and exporter of hard red winter wheat and grain sorghum, or
milo. Union Equity moved during the last decade to broaden its commodity
base, adding some maize, soyabeans and other grains.
Last year, it had sales of Dollars 1.1bn and is expected to have sales this
year of Dollars 1.7bn, according to Farmland officials. Union Equity's
spokesman, Mr Jim Erickson, said that the co-operative has wanted to become
more involved in food processing and value-added products using grains and
that Farmland offered that opportunity. Since 1990 it has already moved in
the value-adding direction with the purchase of a part ownership in the
Kansas City-based grain processing firm, Cereal Foods.
Many in American farming circles believe that they must move into more
value-added products to reduce their vulnerabilities in the volatile
commodities markets and to raise their profit possibilities.
The two co-operatives say that a merger will serve the interests of their
memberships, which have a considerable overlap. They had in fact discussed a
merger in 1990, but talks were interrupted by Farmland, which decided to
embark on a restructuring of its field sales and marketing and its financial
structure before pursuing the consolidation.
'The transaction is completely compatible with our two organisations' mutual
strategic goal of furthering our members'interest in value-added food system
marketing activities,' said Mr William Allen, president of Union Equity and
Mr HD Cleberg, president of Farmland, in a joint statement.

London's robusta COFFEE ended an afternoon of nervous trading with moderate
gains but just below the day's highs as the market waited for the outcome of
talks in Brazil on official policy to wards a coffee pact. 'We started up
this afternoon with New York looking terrible, but then suddenly near May
shot ahead and London just went with it,' one trader said yesterday. The
upside move was attributed to unconfirmed rumours that the Brazilian private
sector had decided to support a pact with economic clauses after an informal
meeting in the morning. On the LME COPPER maintained its recent strength as
Tuesday's constructive US economic data helped to hold three-month metal
above Dollars 2,240 a tonne. Prices have encountered good support on dips
towards Dollars 2,220 recently and the market looks set to move up to a
Dollars 2,275 target. The ALUMINIUM market consolidated Tuesday's move above
Dollars 1,300 for three-month metal. Overhead resistance is expected between
Dollars 1,315 and Dollars 1,320. NICKEL was under pressure from talk that
fresh Russian metal was en route to Rotterdam although scale-down buying
limited the extent of price falls. Earlier, the market was boosted by news
of strike action at Western Mining's Kambalda facilities.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falkands farmers import rams to
improve wool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALKLAND ISLANDS sheep farmers, who are selling their wool at below the cost
of production, are aiming to return to profit by improving the quality of
their production, writes David Blackwell.
They are establishing a new stud flock based on 650 sheep imported from
Tasmania. The islanders want to change the genetics of the Falklands'
650,000 sheep by supplying the 90 sheep farms with rams producing finer
wool.
Councillor Kevin Kilmartin, who owns Bluff Cove farm on East Falkland, said
in London this week that Falklands wool was being sold at Pounds 2 a
kilogram clean, while production costs were about Pounds 2.50 a kilogram. At
the moment the islands' government is subsidising the sheep farmers with
some of the revenue generated by the issue of fishing licences.
The introduction of the Pounds 260,000 stud flock is expected to reduce the
diameter of Falklands wool fibre by 3 microns on average over a period of
three years. Most of the islands' wool is between 25 and 29 microns at
present, and is sold to the clothing industry. But finer wools fetch a
higher price. Mr Kilmartin pointed out that below 20 microns clean wool is
fetching Pounds 8 a kilogram.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts at odds on land prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICES of American farm land may be headed substantially upwards - or
downwards - or they may stay the same in real terms, depending on which
agricultural economist you are listening to.
At a recent conference sponsored by Choices, the publication of the American
Agricultural Economics Association, some agricultural economists saw US farm
land values rising as much as 35 per cent in real terms in the 1990s. Mr Rex
Wilcox of Stalcup Agricultural Service said they would outperform other
types of investments in this decade. Rentals would yield 6 to 8 per cent,
compared with 5 per cent on many certificates of deposit, he said.
But others are deeply sceptical. The increasingly bleak prospects for US
grain exports have convinced economists such as Mr John Scott of the
University of Illinois that land prices will fall during the next decade.
'We're going to be locked out of Europe,' he said. A recovery in agriculture
in the former Soviet Union and some eastern European countries would mean
fewer markets and more competition in exports.
Taking the middle road, Mr Philip Raup of the University of Minnesota said
that land prices would keep pace with inflation during the 1990s and avoid
the boom and bust cycles that have characterised land values over the past
two decades.
Whatever the prospects for the rest of the decade, the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago reports that the annual rate of increase in Midwest farm land
values slowed in 1991 - continuing the decline that has been in progress
since 1988. In a survey of agricultural bankers in the region late last year
a majority believed that farm land values would remain flat in the first
quarter of 1992.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consumption forecast to surge
by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM CONSUMPTION by the automotive industry is set to rise by 55 per
cent, or 865,000 troy ounces, to about 2.4m ounces between 1991 and 1995,
according to a report by the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy
organisation. Car manufacturers consumed about 36 per cent of total supply
last year and could use 50 per cent by 1995 as tougher limits on vehicle
emissions are introduced, it points out.
On the supply side, the consultancy suggests that exports by Russia,
second-largest producer after South Africa, are already falling and this
year are likely to be pushed back by production difficulties from nearly 1m
ounces to 370,000 ounces, near the levels seen in the 1980s.
During the 1980s the Soviet Union sold an average of 350,000 ounces a year,
equivalent to about 12 per cent of total annual platinum supplies. In 1990,
however, Soviet sales jumped to 700,000 ounces, about 17.5 per cent of total
supply, and last year they are estimated to have reached 990,000 ounces or
23 per cent of supply.
Some of this came from strategic stockpiles or industrial stocks rather than
current production, which is probably well below annual capacity, estimated
to be between 700,000 and 800,000 ounces.
The big jump in sales from the former Soviet Union boosted the annual supply
surplus from 210,000 ounces in 1990 to an estimated 455,000 ounces last
year, says APMA.
However, this year there may be a small supply deficit (about 75,000
ounces), which by 1995 could widen to more than 300,000 ounces. 'This
deficit, in combination with rising investor interest, will force platinum's
price substantially higher by the middle of the decade,' the report
suggests.
In spite of cuts recently made to South African producers' planned expansion
programmes, its platinum output could rise by more than 40 per cent between
1991 and 1995, from 2.8m ounces to 3.95m, says APMA - 'if South African
politics and race relations don't interfere.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US increases spending on wheat
export subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTION
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Agriculture has been spending more than ever on wheat
export subsidies, despite a projected 18-year low in US wheat stocks, in
order to maintain US foreign market share.
Most of the subsidies, paid out under the US Export Enhancement Program, are
still going to wheat shippers, although stocks are projected to fall to 390m
bushels by the end of the marketing year, according to the National
Association of Wheat Growers. It said total subsidies could surpass Dollars
1.5bn this year - 50 per cent more than the 1988 record.
Although the US price strengthened to about Dollars 4 a bushel, subsidies
were averaging about Dollars 54 a tonne through February, well above the
previous year's levels. This month they have fallen to the mid-Dollars 40s
level, which is still above 1991, a USDA official said.
This is being watched closely by Australian officials, who earlier this year
pleaded with President Bush to ease up on market-depressing subsidies. Mr
John Sault, attache at the Australian embassy in Washington, said: 'It is a
considerable concern to us that the EEP is being used so aggressively in
circumstances where US stocks are historically low'.
American officials, however, have argued that they are simply trying to
match the price set by the EC. 'We get the same story from Europe,' he said.
'There is an element of validity on both sides, but once you get competitive
subsidisation going on, then prices don't rise to the extent that they
should.'
At the same time, the US wheat farmers were infuriated by a USDA refusal to
offer subsidies for a 1m tonne sale of wheat to India. Department officials
offered various excuses, including one that India was not a 'traditional' US
customer.
The wheat growers' association argued, however, that the Indian market
offered more growth potential the former Soviet Union, which was
consistently able to get subsidies. There is some quiet speculation that the
US wants to help Canada in the Indian market.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker warns of 'oil price
shock'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD is storing up an oil price shock for the mid-1990's which could
see the price of a barrel shoot up by between 40 and 65 per cent, London
stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson Securities said, reports Reuter.
'The longer world oil prices remain under Dollars 20 a barrel, the greater
the risk of another oil price shock in the middle of this decade,' Kleinwort
said in a report presented at a London seminar for oil industry and
financial institution officials.
'We are bound for another oil price shock and could see prices between
Dollars 25 and Dollars 30 a barrel,' Kleinwort analyst Mr Mehdi Varzi told
delagates at the seminar.
Oil prices on the London futures market have barely strayed from the Dollars
18 level for the past month.
Today's prices are in real terms the lowest in 18 years and are providing a
strong disincentive for upstream investment in exploration, Mr Varzi said.
'Current oil prices are sending the wrong message to the international oil
market over the medium and long term,' he added.

THE credit rating of two commercial paper programmes of Olympia &amp; York, the
Canadian property group, were yesterday put under review for a possible
downgrade by Dominion Bond Rating Service, writes Our Financial Staff.
The agency said there was 'nothing fundamentally wrong' with the company or
with its two commercial paper programmes, but that 'continuing rumours and
negative press reports' were making it hard for the company to roll over its
commercial paper.
News of the possible downgrade comes in the wake of O&amp;Y's decision to wind

FT  19 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Denmark's Ecu1bn issue attracts firm
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of sovereign and supranational borrowers tapped the Eurobond market
yesterday, boosting investor interest in an otherwise lacklustre market.
Denmark launched its long-awaited Ecu1bn 10-year bond offering, which is
listed in Copenhagen but will be traded internationally. The deal, priced to
yield six basis points more than the 8 1/2 per cent French Treasury issue
due 2002, met firm demand from institutional investors, even though the
pricing was not considered generous.
Many fund managers had made room in their portfolios for the Denmark
offering as the deal was first announced several months ago. However, the
deal did not excite the same enthusiasm as other quasi-governmental bond
issues in the sector, such as the UK deal last year.
The delay was caused by the technical difficulties of creating bonds that
could be traded and settled both in Denmark and internationally. The issue
is structured like a Eurobond, with clearing through Euroclear and Cedel,
but is also registered, and can be cleared through, the Danish Securities
Centre.
Denmark's benchmark Ecu bond was prompted by political motives rather than
any need for funds. The proceeds of the issue will be added to foreign
exchange reserves, but the Danish government was keen to place Copenhagen on
the map as an Ecu trading centre.
Dealers in Denmark said that domestic demand had been better than expected,
accounting for placement of around 25 per cent of the transaction. Danish
investors, who have no tradition of buying Ecu bonds, will be encouraged to
be more active in the market by the establishment of a repo market and a
market making system.
Den Danske Bank and Unibank, the joint bookrunners, will act as domestic
market-makers, along with Bikuben, Jyske Bank, and Sydbank.
Also in the Ecu sector, the World Bank launched a small offering of
five-year bonds. Dealers said the pricing of the Ecu150m deal to yield less
than the five-year French government Ecu OAT issue was over-ambitious.
However, lead-manager Credit Lyonnaise reported strong demand from Italian
investors for whom the World Bank name is exempt from withholding tax.
In the dollar sector, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the
Austria-guaranteed Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB) each raised five-year
debt.
The EIB's Dollars 500m deal was considered rather aggressively priced at a
yield spread of 12 basis points above the five-year US Treasury yield.
However, five-year sovereign and supranational paper has outperformed the
rest of the market due to stronger investor demand for quality issues.
Goldman Sachs underwrote the entire transaction, with only a small selling
group; consequently, it was hard to gauge how much paper had been sold.
A Dollars 200m five-year deal for OKB, priced to yield 25 basis points above
the five-year Treasury, met strong demand from institutional investors.

THE South Korean Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) has relaxed stock market
registration requirements which had barred investments by overseas unit
trusts, investment trusts, pension funds and non-limited companies, Reuter
reports from Seoul.
'This is to actively solicit foreign investment and promote the opening of
the stock market,' the SSB said.
South Korean rules initially excluded all but individual foreign investors
and foreign corporations from investing in the market, which was opened to
limited direct foreign investment on January 3.
However, South Korea has gradually relaxed the rules, permitting foreign
governments and certain pension funds to invest.
A Finance Ministry official said 828 foreign investors had registered as of
March 17.
In an effort to generate liquidity, the Finance Ministry also announced that
country funds would now be permitted to increase their capital and local
investment trusts would be permitted to offer new investment products.
The Korea Fund, the Korea Europe Fund and the Korea Asia Fund, capitalised
at a total of Dollars 360m, will be permitted to increase their capital by
Dollars 50m each.

ARAB Banking Corporation (ABC), the biggest international Arab bank, posted
a Dollars 90m pre-tax profit in 1991 compared with a pre-tax loss of Dollars
47m in the previous year, Reuter reports from Manama.
'The turnround was reflected in the healthy trend towards the growth and
diversifications of non-interest income, which jumped by 56.5 per cent from
Dollars 168m in 1990 to Dollars 263m at the end of 1991,' the bank said.
'This more than compensated for the slight decline in interest income
resulting from the prevailing low-interest rate environment,' it added.
Operating income rose to Dollars 622m from Dollars 555m the previous year.
Total assets dropped slightly to Dollars 20.45bn against Dollars 20.55bn.
Operating profit before provisions, tax and minority interests rose to
Dollars 213m against Dollars 153m.
The bank allocated Dollars 102m for possible loan losses in 1991 compared
with Dollars 179m the previous year.
Deposits from interbank markets increased to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars
5.7bn in 1990.
Customers' deposits fell to Dollars 10.5bn compared with Dollars 10.9bn a
year earlier.
ABC, which is owned mainly by Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Libya, became the first
Gulf-based Arab bank to offer shares to investors on the open market with a
Dollars 350m issue in June 1990.
Saudi Arabian private investors now hold 6.5 per cent of its shares and
international investors own 15 per cent.

VICTOR Company of Japan (JVC) plans to reduce its range of products,
increase outside component sales and lengthen product cycles to fight back
against the effects of the consumer electronics slump, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
Almost half of JVC's sales are in videotape recorders, a flat market. In
February, JVC forecast a parent pre-tax loss of Y2.8bn (Dollars 21m) and a
group pre-tax deficit of Y4.4bn for the year to the end of March. It would
be its first loss in 40 years.
To trim design and development costs, it plans to reduce the number of its
products by 20 to 30 per cent by eliminating products that are considered
too similar to others.
JVC will also sell more components - such as the magnetic heads used in
videotape recorders - to other manufacturers, and produce more components
internally for its own use.

BRIERLEY Investments (BIL), the New Zealand investment and trading group,
and its UK-based associate, GPG, plan to reduce their joint offer for
Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL) to 20.5 Australian cents a share
from 23 cents a share, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
Sir Ron Brierley said in a letter to ACIL that the proposed takeover offer
was being reduced because the target company last week announced an
agreement to pay ADollars 14m (USDollars 10.6m) to settle a claim from the
liquidators of Spedley Securities.
Sir Ron wrote on behalf of Rossington Holdings, a company jointly-owned by
BIL, his former investment company, and his new investment vehicle, GPG. BIL
owns 40 per cent of GPG.
Sir Ron said ACIL's payout was inconsistent with previous indications that
the Spedley claims were 'tenuous as best.'
He said the 'gratuitous capitulation' by ACIL seemed like 'gross
incompetence' by the directors.
Sir Ron said the 2.5 cents-a-share reduction in the offer price brought the
value of the bid down ADollars 14m. He said Rossington had applied to the
Australian Stock Exchange for the necessary approvals to lower the proposed
bid.

HENDERSON Land Develop-ment, one of Hong Kong's leading residential property
developers, announced a 12.4 per cent drop in net profit for the six months
to December to HKDollars 1.38bn (Dollars 178.3m), compared with HKDollars
1.58bn in the year-earlier period.
The decline came from a reduction in the number of developments completed in
the first half of the year. However, the company forecast a 'satisfactory'
increase in profit for the full year.
Henderson completed five developments in the first half of its financial
year, but it has already commenced pre-sales of a further 15 projects.
Turnover declined by 23 per cent to HKDollars 2.5bn at the interim stage,
due to the reduction in property sales, but there was an increase in
investment income, particularly from its portfolio of shopping centres.
Its two associate utility companies - Hong Kong and China Gas and Hong Kong
Ferry - also reported strong profit growth.
The company said that 'with local interest rates presently staying at a
level below inflation rate, the public is generally keen to acquire
residential properties as a hedge against inflation and the property market
is likely to remain active.'
The company recommended an interim dividend of 19 cents, compared with 16
cents in 1990.

<TEXT>
GRUPO Financiero Bancomer (GFB), the holding company comprising Mexico's
second largest bank, has placed Dollars 836.7m of stock in the international
markets. The offering will enable the group to meet the final payment due on
the recently-privatised bank.
The private placement, arranged in the US, priced each Mexican C and B share
at 4,200 pesos (Dollars 1.38), and each American depositary share, worth 20
Mexican C shares, at Dollars 27.50.
GFB had aimed to raise Dollars 500m from the placement, but increased the
number of shares available last week due to heavy demand. In the months
preceding the placement, GFB sold Dollars 298m of C shares, bringing the
proceeds from recent share sales to Dollars 1.13bn.
The Mexican government sold 56 per cent of the equity in Bancomer late last
year for a sum, including subsequent accrued interest, that has risen to
Dollars 2.88bn.
Mr Ricardo Guajardo, head of Bancomer, said that Dollars 300m from the
placement would be used to meet the final payment of Dollars 1.73bn due on
April 6, and the rest to buy up shares in GFB and its subsidiaries.
Grupo Financiero Banamex, which contains Mexico's largest bank, is expected
to announce soon its international share offering, although for a much
smaller sum.

<TEXT>
TWO US electronics companies are to revive the heart of east Germany's
electronics industry which Siemens, the German electronics group, regarded
as being beyond saving.
Both companies are getting their stakes without payment, but will later
transfer know-how and technology.
LSI Logic of California agreed with the Treuhand privatisation agency to
take a 19.8 per cent share in Mikroelektronik of Erfurt, with the remaining
stake going to the Thuringian Landesbank, which has yet to be formed. The
Treuhand agreed to invest DM125m (Dollars 76.2m) in the new company to cover
expected losses and modernisation.
It will also provide the site for a factory to produce Asics integrated
circuits.
VLSI Technology, another California company, will take a 19.8 per cent share
in Mikroelektronik Dresden. An unnamed private bank is to hold 49 per cent,
and an investor, still to be found by the state of Saxony, will get the
remainder.
The Treuhand said it would give the new company DM125m for R&amp;D and
production of integrated circuits. The Dresden company expects sales this
year of DM22m to rise to DM91m by 1994.
The east German electronics industry, developed at enormous cost by the
Communists to produce obsolescent chips and computers, was considered the
most difficult industry to save. Employing 22,000 people in 1989, it is down
to fewer than 4,000 employees. The Treuhand said more than 1,500 jobs were
to be retained under the new plan, approved on Tuesday by the managing
board.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, a Treuhand spokesman, admitted the new electronics
ventures were a very 'shaky affair.
He said the Treuhand agreed to set up the joint ventures as a result of
'political pressure' from the state governments where the electronics
companies were located. The states had previously refused to invest money in
the Treuhand's MTG electronics holding company, which had losses last year
of DM327m on sales of DM78m.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT said yesterday it would launch a new version of its widely-used
Windows personal computer program next month and expects to sell 1m copies
within 30 days.
The announcement appears designed to pre-empt International Business
Machines' expected introduction, later this month, of a competing operating
system for personal computers.
The former partners are gearing up for a marketing battle. Microsoft will
for the first time use television advertising to promote Windows. IBM is
also planning a publicity blitz.
Price competition is also expected to be fierce, with Microsoft offering a
Windows upgrade package to current users for Dollars 50. At issue is control
over the direction of personal computer software.
Windows provides personal computer users with a graphical interface, similar
to the Apple Macintosh, replacing typed commands with a 'point and click'
method of selecting applications and functions.
Windows works in conjunction with Microsoft DOS, the operating system used
on about 90 per cent of personal computers.
The new update to Windows, called Windows 3.1, includes enhancements that
make it faster, easier to use and more robust than previous versions,
Microsoft said.
More than 9m copies of Windows 3.0, the current version, have sold since its
introduction in June 1990.
Shipments of Windows 3.1 will coincide with IBM's introduction of OS/2 , a
competing personal computer operating system.
Originally, Microsoft and IBM co-operated in the development of OS/2, but
parted ways after a dispute over the direction of future personal computer
operating system software.
IBM chose to promote OS/2 as a replacement for Microsoft's DOS and Windows.
Microsoft has focused on enhancing Windows.
IBM aims to break Microsoft's domination of the market with OS/2.

restructuring continues

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN Boveri, Europe's biggest electrical engineering group, has
announced a 2 per cent improvement, to Dollars 1.15bn, in 1991 pre-tax
profits after financial items. It pledged to continue restructuring efforts
this year.
The result underlines the extent to which ABB is being tested by
recessionary conditions in 60 per cent of its business. It had said at the
half-year stage that full-year profits should at least match those of 1990.
Operating earnings after depreciation rose 7 per cent, from Dollars 1.79bn
to Dollars 1.91bn, while net income edged up 3 per cent from Dollars 590m to
Dollars 609m. Orders received rose 1 per cent to Dollars 29.6bn, while
revenues increased 8 per cent to Dollars 28.9bn.
Mr Percy Barnevik, president, said the severity of the recession varied from
'light' in mainland European countries such as France, to 'fairly deep' in
the Nordic countries, with the English-speaking countries in between.
Growth in countries such as Germany, and in parts of Asia, had offset lower
order intake in some recession-affected markets. In the UK, the group
increased earnings, helped by a good performance in infrastructural business
sectors, which are normally less affected by recession.
On the outlook for 1992, Mr Barnevik said ABB expected a slow recovery in
recession-affected markets. He also foresaw a further decline in demand and
intensified pricing pressure.
However, in most of its infrastructure-related business, accounting for the
remaining 40 per cent of the group, the impact of the recession would be
smaller, and demand in several developing countries was expected to remain
high.
Overall, therefore, earnings after financial items this year are expected to
be about the same as this year.
Net debt was cut by about Dollars 1bn last year, and ABB would continue
balancing non-recurring restructuring costs with gains from asset sales.
Earlier this month, the group announced it would try to sell its global
instrumentation business, based in the UK. Mr Barnevik said a couple of
other 'pieces' might be sold, but he did not foresee any huge divestitures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the German chemical group, said operating profits in the first two
months of this year were slightly below expectations, and it expected them
to end close to last year's DM3.18bn (Dollars 1.93bn). Sales this year are
likely to climb 4 per cent to DM44.4bn.
The remarks by Mr Hermann Strenger, chairman, come only days after Bayer
announced the best 1991 result of the big three German chemical companies.
With a drop in pre-tax profits of 5 per cent, to DM3.21bn, compared with a
fall of over 20 per cent at BASF and Hoechst, Bayer alone has decided to
hold its 1991 dividend at the same level as last time's.
Bayer disclosed yesterday that operating profits for the group dropped by
10.5 per cent to DM3.18bn last year, reflecting poor conditions in the
chemicals industry. Last year, profits in polymers, organic products and
industrial chemical products dropped by 21, 56 and 43 per cent respectively.
Mr Strenger blamed the decline in profits on increased costs which could not
be passed on to customers because of tougher competition in world markets.
Total profits were held up at higher levels than those of its German
competitors because of Bayer's greater exposure to the non-cyclical
pharmaceutical sector. Health products accounted for DM8.8bn of group sales
of DM42.4bn last year - 21 per cent of the total  - but generated profits of
DM1.74bn, an increase of 11 per cent on the previous year.

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert have acted to dampen speculation about
its strategy in the insurance business. It announced yesterday that it was
open to insurance collaboration with any of BBL's large shareholders, as
long as they met certain criteria.
The bank yesterday held a board meeting - billed as 'D-Day for BBL' in one
Belgian newspaper - to decide between two proposals on collaboration in the
lucrative area of 'bancassurance' from rival insurer-shareholders.
However, it neither accepted nor rejected the two sets of proposals, one
from Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), and one from Royale Belge and
Winterthur of Switzerland.
Instead, BBL said it would create an insurance subsidiary, specialising in
car and fire cover, to add to its existing life insurance subsidiary.
Prospective partners would be able to take a stake in the new company, but
BBL would retain control.
Since last month, when the bancassurance talks began to attract attention,
BBL has been at pains to stress that commercial links should be considered
separately from any movement in its fragmented share register.
'The bank is negotiating with the insurance companies to act together in the
insurance field,' a spokesman said.
Royale Belge, together with its controlling shareholder - the French
insurer, UAP - owns 11.72 per cent of BBL, and Winterthur has 4.78 per cent.
ING, which controls 8.6 per cent, has never commented on rumours that it
wanted to bid for the whole of BBL.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group, is to
buy the metal interests of its international arm, which is listed on the
Paris bourse.
The Finance Ministry has given its go-ahead for Pechiney International, 25
per cent-quoted on the stock market, to sell its aluminium smelting and
trading businesses to its parent, Pechiney, owner of the remaining 75 per
cent of Pechiney International's shares.
The project aims to improve Pechiney International's lacklustre share price
performance by separating it from the volatile aluminium industry  - where
prices have plunged recently - and to reduce debts, which at FFr16bn
(Dollars 2.86bn) are nearly 1.2 times shareholders' funds.
Pechiney International's aluminium and trading assets could be worth between
FFr5bn and FFr7.4bn, according to Salomon Brothers, the US securities house.
Pechiney International, which groups most of the company's foreign
interests, will end up with 85 per cent of its turnover in packaging, where
it is the world leader, and the rest in aerospace components. Aluminium and
trading accounted for 17 per cent of Pechiney International's FFr44.9bn
sales last year, with 70 per cent in packaging.
The Pechiney parent company, itself 80 per cent state-owned - and most of
the rest held by state financial institutions - will accordingly end up with
all the group's aluminium activities.
Clearance for the scheme is a mark of the state's support for the strategy
of Mr Jean Gandois, whose second three-year mandate as chairman comes up for
renewal in July. He has been preparing the asset reorganisation over the
past six months.
It is also the latest example of the French government's growing pragmatism
over the financing of its extensive industrial portfolio, coming after the
recent sales of small stakes in Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group, and
Credit Local de France, the local authority bank.
Pechiney International was floated on the bourse three years ago to raise
cash for the purchase of American National Can, the leading US packaging
group, which Mr Gandois bought as a cash-earner to counterbalance the
cyclical aluminium business.
At the time, the government disapproved of the financial gymnastics of
creating a subsidiary just for the purpose of raising equity capital.
However, it was a legal way for Pechiney to get round the freeze which then
existed on privatisations and nationalisations.
Since then, the government has relaxed that rule, with a decree last year
allowing state-owned companies to sell up to 49 per cent of their capital to
private investors. The reorganisation could well pave the way for Pechiney
International to issue more equity capital, analysts said yesterday.

A CONSORTIUM comprising Total of France and leading Portuguese companies,
including the Espirito Santo group, has emerged as the only bidder for
Petrogal, the state-owned oil group valued at Es131bn (Dollars 916m), writes
Patrick Blum in Lisbon.
The timetable for offers closed on March 17, and a jury will now have to
consider the consortium's bid for an initial 25 per cent of the company. The
starting price for bids was Es1,700 per share. If the consortium's offer is
acceptable, the government is expected to approve the sale soon.
Another consortium, led by DuPont of the US, dropped out of the bidding.
Under conditions set out for Petrogal's privatisation programme, the
consortium will have to buy another 26 per cent stake in the company within
nine months, at the same price per share paid for the initial 25 per cent.
This will bring the consortium's holding to 51 per cent.

<TEXT>
MR FREDRIK Vogt Lorentzen, president of Elkem, the loss-making Norwegian
metals producer, has resigned after four years in the job.
Mr Vogt Lorentzen's departure comes less than two months after a board
reshuffle which involved Orkla and Saga Petroleum - Elkem's two biggest
shareholders - tightening their grip on the company.
Last month, Elkem announced a 1991 pre-tax loss of NKr528m (Dollars
160.38m), compared with a loss of NKr659m in 1990. The company also passed
its dividend.
'Two years with extremely difficult market conditions have contributed to
the fact that I have not reached my stated goal of achieving a profit at the
bottom of the business cycle,' Mr Lorentzen said yesterday.
'At the same time, the effort to reach this goal has significantly drained
my own strength,' he added.
At the time of the January board changes, Mr Finn Jebsen, Elkem's
plain-speaking chairman, said closer co-operation among the board, the
owners and the corporate management would be needed to improve the company's
operations and future results.
Elkem said Mr Ole Enger, currently vice-president, would become acting
president.

<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group, has
established a foothold in the US by extending its relationship with Kemper,
the Illinois-based insurance concern.
The two have signed an agreement of co-operation which will involve Kemper
servicing UAP's clients in the US. The deal represents the French group's
first foray across the Atlantic.
UAP said yesterday it did not envisage any equity participation with Kemper.
The two groups already have a four-year-old European joint venture to
service high-risk clients such as nuclear power centres and chemical
companies.
The agreement comes at a time when French insurers are taking advantage of
the problems of their US and UK competitors to expand internationally.
Association Generales des Assurances(AGF), which is, like UAP, a
state-controlled group, recently ran into controversy over its plans to
expand in Germany.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Weak oil price cuts Clyde Petroleum to
Pounds 3.04m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLYDE Petroleum reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits last year because
of the weak oil price. However, the independent oil and gas exploration and
production company still intends to pursue an expansive exploration policy.
Profits were Pounds 3.04m for 1991, down from Pounds 9.98m last time,
equivalent to earnings of 2p (2.9p) per share. The fall came despite a sharp
increase in daily production, from the equivalent of 19,000 barrels of oil a
day to 24,000 b/d. But the realised UK price amounted to Pounds 11.37 per
barrel, compared to Pounds 13.42.
The company's proven and probable reserves amounted to 195,774m barrels of
oil equivalent, down from 197,289m. Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the
company continued to seek new oil sources, mainly in regions outside its
traditional North Sea area of operation.
There had been particularly encouraging results from a well off the east
coast of the Malaysian peninsula. It was still being tested but appeared to
contain several reservoirs of high quality oil
The group is maintaining its final dividend at 0.75p leaving the total for
the year unchanged at 1.25p. It said, however, that there was inevitably a
conflict between the need to fund exploration and the requirement to pay
dividends.
Because of expanded international activity and the weak oil price, directors
said they would review future dividend policy.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Securicor boosts parcels presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURICOR Omega Express's purchase on Tuesday of Federal Express's domestic
UK parcel delivery business moves the group a small but significant step
closer to the Post Office's Parcelforce, the dominant market leader.
The Pounds 7.1m acquisition follows Federal Express's decision to withdraw
from domestic European delivery services and concentrate on its
intercontinental express services.
Securicor Omega, a subsidiary of Security Services, is buying Federal
Express's customer base, which last year had sales of Pounds 40m, and its
computerised despatch system.
Securicor Omega will not however, be responsible for any of the 3,400 jobs
which are to be lost at Federal Express although the company will be
increasing its own workforce by about 400.
The acquisition could add about 3 per cent of the UK Pounds 1.6bn parcels
market to the 12 per cent Securicor Omega already controls. But it leaves
the group a distant second behind Parcelforce, which controls 33 per cent of
the market.
The new business will fit directly into Securicor Omega's existing network
of 3,700 vehicles run out of 128 locations throughout the country. The
company will also buy 250 of Federal Express's 3,000 vehicles.
'We are increasing market share with profitable business and are taking on
Pounds 40m of business almost overnight,' said Mr Roger Wiggs, chief
executive of Securicor, which owns 51 per cent of Security Services.
Federal Express will retain the right to international collections and
delivery inside the M25 orbital motorway around London. Securicor Omega will
also deliver and collect all Federal Express's international parcels to and
from destinations outside the M25.
Mr Pat Howes, Securicor Omega chief executive, said that after buying into
the UK in 1987, Federal Express failed to gain the critical mass for a
nationwide domestic delivery service.
It had rolled out its branch network too quickly in a market that was then
hit by recession and the structure of its operations left it with very high
overheads.
Most of Federal Express's business was high margin overnight parcel delivery
and not the lower margin two day service which currently makes up the
majority of Securicor Omega's sales, Mr Wiggs said.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gateway, the grocery chain which forms the bulk of the Isosceles investment
company, is to convert 13 more stores to its up-market Somerfield trading
format by the end of April.
This will bring the total number of Somerfield stores to 27 with a trading
area of 210,000 sq ft.
Gateway is also converting three superstores to its Food Giant format
selling a wide range of heavily-discounted lines. This brings the total
number of Food Giants to 18.
Isosceles, which this week revealed it was planning to float Wellworth, its
Northern Ireland food retailing subsidiary, has been developing its new
format stores in an attempt to address what it sees as a segmenting food
market.
Somerfield stores, typically trading from high street sites in market towns,
are targeted at convenience shoppers. Food Giant is squarely aimed at the
discount market.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps Marley advance 75% to
Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION in overhead costs helped Marley, the building products
manufacturer, report a 75 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds
14.3m to Pounds 25m, for the year to end-December.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 37.2m (Pounds 35.2m) on turnover down
10 per cent from Pounds 639m to Pounds 574m.
Mr George Russell, chairman, said a 'worldwide blast' against a level of
overheads that could not be sustained brought savings of about Pounds 30m.
As part of the cost cutting exercise the group yesterday announced the
merger of five UK companies - Marley Roof Tiles, Marley Brick, Marley
Paving, Marley Transport and Thermolite - into one new group entitled Marley
Building Materials.
Provisions totalling Pounds 2m in respect of the restructuring, charged as
an exceptional item, were offset by surplus provisions and the sale of a
collection of paintings.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 5.5m reflected costs and losses associated
with the closure and sale of the North American roofing operations.
Plumbing, mouldings and flooring increased operating profits to Pounds 27m
(Pounds 19.3m) boosted by strong performances in Germany. Marley benefited
from the growth of DIY stores in eastern Germany. From nil at independence
there were now 200 DIY stores, a number which could double by the end of the
year.
Roofing increased profits to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 7.5m) in spite of a fall in
sales from Pounds 196m to Pounds 158m, benefiting from the group's cost
cutting exercise. Across the company the workforce was reduced by 1,500 to a
total of just under 10,000.
Bricks, blocks and pavers were worst affected by the recession, reporting a
Pounds 5m loss compared to a Pounds 1.5m profit.
Automotive components suffered a fall in profits to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds
1.8m), while property was down at Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 5.1m). The group also
announced the sale of a group of buildings for Pounds 6m.
Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 18m to Pounds 91.7m, giving gearing of
41.3 per cent. Mr Russell said the group was well placed to make
acquisitions to fit into the growing areas of the business.
Earnings per share rose to 6p (3.5p). A final dividend of 4.25p gives an
unchanged total of 6.35p.
COMMENT
If Marley is proving a recovery stock with turnover down it is not
surprising that analysts are predicting further earnings growth as sales
increase. Although last year's figures included an exceptional Pounds 7.7m
relating to redundancies and business rationalisation, the profit increase
was still impressive in the midst of a recession. Few at the centre were
untouched by the cost-cutting programme; the central personnel department
was axed and more than half of the 100 employees working at head office lost
their jobs. The dividend is barely covered. But it could easily have been if
the group chose to be less conservative about its accounting policies and
take a Pounds 3.5m currency gain below the line instead of through reserves.
With 1992 pre-tax profit forecasts of about Pounds 32m, giving earnings per
share of 7.6p, the shares are trading on a prospective multiple of 16,
indicating that the recovery is already in the price.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West up 11% despite bad debt
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; WEST, the 10th largest building society, last year increased
pre-tax profits by 11 per cent despite the depression in the housing market.
The outcome amounted to Pounds 67.4m, up from Pounds 60.6m in 1990, though
the society had to make a bad debt charge of Pounds 24.5m, up from Pounds
5.4m. Total group assets rose from Pounds 5.64bn to Pounds 7.14bn.
During the year the society took over the Cheshunt, only to discover that
its reserves were wiped out by its bad debt, leaving a shortfall of Pounds
5m. The merger contributed Pounds 392m to total assets, despite the high
proportion of bad debt.
The society also incurred a Pounds 3.5m loss on its two estate agency
chains.
Both its lending and savings businesses expanded during the year. The
mortgage book increased from Pounds 4.32bn to Pounds 5.34bn, with net
mortgage advances up from Pounds 1.18bn to Pounds 1.31bn. Mr Tony
FitzSimons, chief executive, said that the society had 5,600 customers in
arrears of 12 months or more at the end of 1991, about 3 per cent of its
total mortgage customers.
Savings rose sharply, growing from Pounds 189m to Pounds 436m.
The cost-income ratio was up from 50.7 per cent to 53 per cent, but Mr
FitzSimons said that the ratio for the building society operations was down
from 41.5 per cent to 40 per cent. During the year the society spent Pounds
14m on developing its computer systems and Pounds 10m on new store
developments.
Mr FitzSimons said that the society had turned in a strong performance. 'Our
balance sheet is absolutely rock solid,' he said.

<TEXT>
Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat producer, yesterday reported a 15
per cent fall in profits as a war between chicken manufacturers last year
undercut the market for its oven ready turkeys.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.2m on sales marginally
down at Pounds 148.4m (Pounds 150.1m).
Earnings per share fell from 7.99p to 6.95p and the final dividend is held
at 2.5p, giving a total of 4.5p for the year.
Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said the whole bird and oven ready turkey
market had been hit by chicken prices that fell last year to as low as 39p
per pound.
The recession had also hit food sales and there was evidence that there had
been an overall drop in food consumption.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bowthorpe declines 11% despite German
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWTHORPE Holdings, the electrical and electronic components maker,
yesterday announced an 11 per cent fall in profits as the impact from
recession outweighed a strong performance in Germany.
Pre-tax profits in 1991 fell from Pounds 45.5m to Pounds 40.3m - below
market expectations. Taking out discontinued businesses, the fall was 8 per
cent.
Mr John Westhead, chief executive, said any profit rise this year was likely
to be modest. 'But we have maintained our margins and are building for
recovery,' he said.
Turnover fell 9 per cent to Pounds 220.5m. In the UK, where its main
customers include the construction and motor industries, conditions were
tough. The UK accounted for 20 per cent of total sales, down from 28 per
cent last year.
But sales in Germany remained buoyant, especially in the construction
sector. Operating profits in mainland Europe increased from 37 per cent to
40 per cent of total profits.
Operating profits in the US improved, despite the recession, partly due to
strong sales to the medical sector from Thermometrics, which made a full
year's contribution for the first time.
Earnings fell to 14.04p (16.01p) per share. The company is recommending an
increased final dividend of 4.34p (4.13p) for a total 5 per cent ahead to
6.04p (5.75p).
There was a Pounds 180,000 currency loss and losses of about Pounds 1m on
restructuring costs. In the UK there were 150 redundancies.
COMMENT
Bowthorpe's long practised strategy of developing niche markets
internationally, and adding to growth through small acquisitions, is set for
a little bit of a shake up. The company said it now intended to aim for
bigger takeover targets, although the concentration on niche products would
remain. This should not present a problem, since the company held net cash
of Pounds 18.6m at the year end and has strong positive cash flow.
Meanwhile, Bowthorpe's leading position in its key markets will underpin
profits should the re-cession continue. Forecast profits for this year of
Pounds 41m to Pounds 42m put the shares on 15 times earnings. But until the
previous growth track is recovered, the shares are fully valued.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British-Borneo Petroleum at Pounds 3.9m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate, the oil and gas exploration company,
reported profits after tax of Pounds 3.92m from total revenue of Pounds
9.21m in the year to end-December.
This compares with profits of Pounds 2.59m on revenues of Pounds 4.4m in the
preceding nine months.
Oil and gas production achieved sales of Pounds 3.2m against Pounds 693,000,
while profits from dealing activities were doubled to Pounds 4.21m (Pounds
2.12m).
Sir Douglas Morpeth, chairman, said there had been a substantial growth in
production revenues from US operations, while the integration of new North
Sea assets, purchased in November 1991 from Norsk Hydro, had made an initial
contribution to the improved profits.
As forecast at the time of the placing and open offer in November 1991,
directors are proposing a final dividend of 4.433p, making a total for the
year of 7.1p (5.333p adjusted).
The dividend is covered 2.8 times by earnings per share of 19.95p (18.1p).

Profits of Spandex, a USM-quoted supplier of sign-making equipment, were
virtually static at Pounds 4.2m pre-tax for the year to end-December.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 4.3m for 1990, was struck from
turnover some Pounds 10m higher at Pounds 52m. The increase in sales
reflected organic growth and expansion into continental Europe.
A proposed final dividend of 4.1p makes a 6p (5.5p) total. Earnings fell 4p

performance. This was partly offset, however, by lower profits from
engineering.
Earnings per share rose to 13.71p (12.71p) and a same again final dividend

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAUNDERS Group, the Manchester-based housebuilder, unveiled a
relatively resilient performance in the six months to end-December.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.19m, against Pounds 2.56m in the
corresponding half of 1990.
Mr John Maunders, chairman, said that trading conditions would remain
'extremely difficult' until political uncertainty was resolved and purchaser
confidence returned.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 920,000 (Pounds 1.43m). Gearing at December
31 was about 22 per cent, although this will rise in the second half when
most of the group's land purchases are made.
Although the period saw more completions - 405 against 371  - turnover
declined 8 per cent to Pounds 26.8m partly reflecting discounted selling
prices. The average price dropped from Pounds 78,740 to Pounds 66,260.
Earnings dipped to 5.97p (6.84p) per 20p share; the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.3p.

With its share price bumping along the bottom at 5p, Porth Group, the
USM-quoted Christmas decorations maker, issued a statement yesterday to
clarify its position, writes Ivor Duce.
The group warned of losses for the full year but said there were early
indications of some upturn in orders for the 1992 season. Directors said
however that it was necessary to fund the cost of stock build-up to satisfy
the Christmas market for 1992 and they therefore announced that agreement in
principle had been reached with their bankers to extend the facilities
considered necessary to support immediate requirements for working capital.
Immediately following the announcement yesterday the shares rose 2p to 7p
before ending the day  1/2 p up at 5 1/2 p.

<TEXT>
RENTOKIL GROUP, the environmental services and property care concern,
yesterday continued to live up to its promise of delivering at least 20 per
cent growth in profits and earnings by reporting a 27 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 74.7m to Pounds 94.6m, for 1991.
Profits were boosted by strong growth from environmental services, which
contributed Pounds 87.6m (Pounds 62.6m), more than offsetting the decline
from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 5.41m in property profits.
Earnings per share rose to 15.59p (12.22p). Sales totalled Pounds 389m
(Pounds 309m).
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said Rentokil could continue to grow at
this pace because of the worldwide demand for its environmental services.
Sales grew faster outside the UK. While turnover was up 10 per cent in the
UK to Pounds 166.4m (Pounds 151m) it was up 22 per cent in North America at
Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 35m); 40 per cent in Europe at Pounds 112m (Pounds
79.7m) and 57 per cent in Asia, Pacific and Africa at Pounds 68m (Pounds
43.3m).
Year end net cash was Pounds 27.2m after acquisitions costing Pounds 43.6m.
A final dividend of 2.9p makes a total of 4.23p compared to 3.3p. A share
split is also proposed.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Try advances 22% to Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Try, the property and construction group, yesterday unveiled a 22 per cent
rise to Pounds 2.2m in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
It also reported that sales of its houses had doubled in the last six weeks.
Mr Hugh Try, chairman, said that although the actual number was small, the
company had seen a 'definite pick up' in sales. The increase in activity had
been felt across the group's geographical spread of Scotland, East Anglia
and south of London. During the year Try sold 168 units, compared with 171
last time.
He warned, however, that the contracting industry continued to face a
difficult period. 'We are not prepared to maintain volume without an
acceptable margin,' he said. Operating profits in the contracting division
fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.3m.
Group turnover during the year fell from Pounds 124.6m to Pounds 114.3m. The
housebuilding division reduced losses from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1m, after
the Pounds 1m exceptional write-down on the value of housing land. A further
Pounds 3.2m extraordinary provision was made against the closure of the
property development division.
The final dividend is maintained at 4p for a 6p (same) total.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Portals benefits from cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTALS GROUP, the world's largest supplier of banknote paper, reaped the
benefits of cutting costs last year to report a 2.7 per cent advance in
pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31.
However, the group warned that any significant advance on 1991 would depend
on an international economic recovery. 'We have already done an awful lot,'
said Mr John Lloyd, finance director, referring to the cost-cutting, 'and a
lot of that we can do only once.'
Profits of Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 26.9m) were struck on sales 2.2 per cent
higher at Pounds 194.3m, with the bulk of the increase in the paper-making
division.
Portals, which supplies some 130 countries with banknotes, reported a 21 per
cent rise in paper-making profits to Pounds 20m, while margins rose by more
than 2 percentage points to 20.5 per cent.
In the banknote division alone, said Mr Philip Conway, executive director in
charge of paper-making, staff cuts in 1990 had resulted savings of Pounds 1m
in 1991.
The biggest advance in the paper-making business came from JR Crompton, the
tea-bag paper group purchased in 1990, and included for a full 12 months. Mr
Conway said Crompton had made a significant improvement on the Pounds 4m
operating profit reported in 1990.
The success of the paper operations was offset by a more mixed return from
the environmental protection and control businesses. Although turnover in
this division rose by almost 2 per cent to Pounds 94.2m, operating profits
slipped 8.4 per cent to Pounds 7.83m.
Airoil-Flaregas, which makes low emission burners for the petrochemical
industry, returned a loss for the full year.
Houseman, which is dependent on the depressed construction industry through
its air and water hygiene businesses, maintained profits, while the computer
technology division improved its performance.
The loss-making Kay business, which makes gas and water pipe fittings, had
been closed at an extraordinary cost of Pounds 990,000.
Central operating profits, comprised of property gains offset against
overheads, reported a Pounds 2.2m drop to Pounds 234,000.
Net debt was cut from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 5.8m, making a gearing level of
6 per cent. The final dividend is raised to 8.8p (8p), making a total of
13.8p (13p).
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 31.42p (30.58p).
COMMENT
If you are looking for a great recovery stock, Portals is not the one. But
for a defensive play, the group cannot be faulted. Even in the deepest
recession, the world's tea drinkers will continue to boil kettles, and
banknotes will continue to circulate. What growth the group expects as the
economy recovers should come from the lower margin environmental businesses;
but, by its own admission, the next acquisition is likely to be in
specialist paper. This will further strengthen the group's defensive
position. Forecasts are for Pounds 29.5m pre-tax, giving a multiple of about
11.6. A stock for tortoises rather than hares.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: CE Heath to float Australian subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A move signalling its intention to concentrate on international insurance
broking, CE Heath, the listed UK broker, yesterday announced the flotation
of its long-established Australian underwriting business.
The group hopes to generate about ADollars 108m (Pounds 44m) via the sale of
72m shares in CE Heath International Holdings, its Australian subsidiary,
representing about 45 per cent of the company's enlarged capital.
The money is to be used to repay debt and fund the Australian subsidiary's
expansion.
Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, accepted that the flotation - which will
reduce HIH's contribution to Heath's profits - would be dilutive, which was
one of the reasons for a negative response from the market which marked the
shares down 21p to 418p.
After the flotation, which should go ahead in May, Heath aims to retain a 44
per cent holding in the enlarged venture, with HIH management holding 11 per
cent.
With long term investment in mind Heath will purchase from HIH its
shareholding in Trade Indemnity - representing 5 per cent of the issued
share capital - for Pounds 7.4m cash.
In addition Heath will purchase from HIH its 80 per cent holding in Lloyds
New York Insurance Group for Pounds 3.3m cash.
Some ADollars 45.2m of the proceeds are to earmarked to finance the
expansion of HIH, which specialised in commercial liability business.
ADollars 5m is to be allocated for the expenses of the flotation, ADollars
40m to repay bank debt and ADollars 17.8m to repay inter-company debt.
Ord Minnett Securities, the Australian stockbroker, will manage and
underwrite the flotation. The deal is subject to shareholders' approval.
In the year to December 31 HIH earned unaudited pre-tax profits of ADollars
24.6m on gross premium income of ADollars 365.7m.
HIH directors forecast a pre-tax profit of ADollars 43.7m for 1992, on the
assumption that the flotation goes ahead without any hitches.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: SEC filing prices GPA float at Dollars 25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED maximum offering price for shares in the GPA flotation is
Dollars 25 (Pounds 14.20p) according to its filing document with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, the US regulator.
Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was
quick to point out yesterday that it was not tied by a price that was simply
used to calculate its SEC registration fee of Dollars 93,750.
However, when GPA announces its price range in May, advisers to the group
believe it is likely to be below the proposed maximum price of Dollars 25
contained on the front of its document.
That is a view shared by some of GPA's shareholders, which could cause the
group some problems as its advisers negotiate terms to prevent them from
selling immediately after the secondary sale.
GPA's advisers expect all of the group's existing shareholders to agree to a
form of 'lock-up' that would allow them to sell some shares during the offer
but not for six to 12 months after the sale.
The Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, which according to its SEC
Form F-1 statement is its largest shareholder with 12.8m shares, is known to
be keen to reduce its holding. Air Canada, with 10.8m shares, and Aer
Lingus, with 9.9m shares, would also like to sell 'at the right price'.
But the problem is to determine the right price. Some of their shares were
bought for Dollars 32, although the majority were purchased at considerably
less. If shareholders do not come to an agreement with the company they
forfeit their chance to sell in the secondary offer.
One shareholder which has decided it is not worth waiting is Hanson, the
international conglomerate. It yesterday confirmed the sale of its 2 per
cent stake of 1.2m shares for Dollars 20.57 a share.
As Hanson put it: 'Our banks were not exactly about to default on us'. The
conglomerate may have thought that it was not worth negotiating a lock-up
agreement before a sale which would only realise a little more than it
received for all its shares.
Directors and executive officers of GPA have options to purchase 595,000
ordinary shares at prices ranging from Dollars 5.10 to Dollars 32.50, with a
weighted average price of Dollars 19 per share.
The F-1 document also contains new information on GPA's results for the nine
months to the end of December. Revenues from aircraft leasing increased by
46 per cent, from Dollars 416m to Dollars 606m, reflecting an increase in
the number of GPA aircraft on lease from 216 to 281.
Revenues from sales of aircraft and aircraft-related products fell by 20 per
cent from Dollars 1.05bn to Dollars 841m, mainly because the number of
aircraft sold fell from 40 to 22, reflecting the difficult trading
conditions prevailing in the industry.
The document warns: 'The duration and severity of these difficult trading
conditions will depend in part on the duration and severity of the recession
but management believes it is likely that they will continue through at
least fiscal 1993 and lease rates may not recover during that period.'
GPA made provisions of Dollars 11m against lease receivables in case
airlines get into difficulty and are unable to pay their leases. Although
they are required to pay an upfront deposit of three months, GPA expects
some airlines to default on their payments.
The group has also made provisions of millions of dollars against the
falling price of some of its older narrow-body aircraft.
The importance of the flotation is underlined by the fact that GPA's firm
orders to buy aircraft from manufacturers until the year 2000 has risen to
Dollars 12.1bn with options, costing Dollars 9.5bn, to purchase additional
aircraft.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ASH shares drop on 31% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Automated Security Holdings, which supplies burglar
alarms and other security products, fell from 133p to 102p yesterday -
knocking about Pounds 35m off its market value - on disappointing annual
results.
Pre-tax profit fell 31 per cent to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 33.2m) on turnover
of Pounds 193.7m (Pounds 200m) for the year to November 30. The market was
expecting nearer Pounds 30m. It was the first profit fall after 18 years of
growth.
Earnings per share were 51 per cent down at 11.4p (23.3p) on a higher tax
rate of 16 per cent.
Mr Tom Buffett, chairman and chief executive, said the main damage was
caused by large systems contracts for nuclear power stations and property
developments. This had turned from an Pounds 800,000 profit in 1990 to a
Pounds 2.6m loss.
The group had got involved in long-term contracts for the first time in late
1989 and it had turned out to be a mistake. A Pounds 5.9m charge for closing
the operation down contributed to a total of Pounds 15.2m taken below the
line.
Other extraordinary items included Pounds 4m of professional fees for an
abortive flotation of a loss prevention division and two halted
acquisitions. These costs had been building up over three years. A Pounds
5.3m loss was taken on the disposal of a stake in Gardiner Group, another
security concern.
In security systems operating profit slipped to Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 37.2m)
on Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 120.9m) sales. Loss prevention, including tagging
and telesurveillance, improved to Pounds 12m (Pounds 10.6m) on Pounds 61.9m
(Pounds 58.9m) sales. ASH planned to integrate the two business segments.
In the UK, where 71 per cent of turnover lay, the streamlining already under
way would save between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m a year, at an initial cost
of Pounds 4m.
Net debt stood at Pounds 95m in November, giving gearing of 59 per cent.
This was counting Pounds 60m of convertible capital bonds as equity. After
their issue in May, gearing had fallen to 37 per cent. Interest costs were
Pounds 800,000 down at Pounds 13.9m.
The dividend is unchanged at 4.9p after a 2.83p final. It necessitated an
Pounds 8.18m transfer from reserves.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity shares fall as loss grows
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE INDEMNITY, the leading trade credit insurer in the UK, yesterday
announced heavily increased pre-tax losses to Pounds 46.6m for 1991 and said
it would pay no dividend for the year for the first time in its 74-year
history.
Its shares closed 13p lower at 30p.
Mr Peter Dugdale, chairman, said: 'The fight against the ravages of
recession is not yet over.' But he reported signs that business insolvencies
were now levelling off at the 1991 level.
Trade Indemnity customers reported 8,824 business failures in 1991, up 60
per cent on 1990.
The company accounts for 82 per cent of the credit insurance underwritten in
the UK.
The company's pre-tax loss, which compares with Pounds 28.8m in 1990,
includes new provisions against an anticipated loss in the 1990 underwriting
year of Pounds 20.6m.
The total projected loss for that year is now Pounds 37.5m.
The second main contributor to the loss was a Pounds 19.5m provision to wind
up its Special Underwriting Unit, set up in 1985 mainly to specialise in
commercial mortgage insurance.
The overall loss, which is cut back to Pounds 38.7m after tax recoveries
amounting to Pounds 7.9m, consumes virtually all of last May's rights issue.
It had raised Pounds 39.6m at 55p a share.
There had been speculation ahead of the company's results that the company
would make a fresh call for funds. Mr Vic Jacob, managing director,
yesterday scotched such talk. He said liquidity levels were 'quite
favourable', and the solvency ratio strong.
Following a premium rate increase of 40 per cent in May last year, premium
income in 1991 rose by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 136.3m.
The company noted that record business failures had thrown the spotlight on
the value of Trade Indemnity's services, lifting new business of continuing
operations from Pounds 24m to Pounds 27m.
Trade Indemnity, which withheld its interim dividend in September, said
yesterday it would not pay a final either. In 1990 it paid a total of 1.9p.
Losses per share totalled 26.35p (21.64p adjusted for the rights issue).
COMMENT
A loss in the middle of the UK's longest post-war recession was no surprise
but analysts were shocked by the size of the deficit and the doubling of
gross claims to Pounds 163m. Worse was the Pounds 19.5m cost of closing the
Special Underwriting Unit. It was an awful postscript on the disastrous
decision to move into mortgage security in 1985. It is understood the unit
has paid out on, or made reservations against, virtually all of the 50-odd
polipany expects to make no provisions this year. This is scant comfort for
the nine European insurance groups who hold 80 per cent of its shares which
have collapsed from a 52-week high of 101p. There will be relief that no new
rights issue has been made immediately. But a fresh capital injection,
perhaps resulting in a rationalisation of shareholdings, cannot be ruled
out. Coface, the leading French export credit company with a 3.5 per cent
stake bought last September, is probably licking its wounds. Swiss Re and
Munich Re, which together hold just under 26 per cent, might see value in
closer linkage between Trade Indemnity and Hermes, Germany's leading export
credit company.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Call to revoke a restricting rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC shareholders will be asked to revoke the rule restricting shareholdings
in the company to a maximum of 1 per cent if it proceeds with its proposed
merger with Midland Bank, writes Simon Davies.
Following the planned share swap, the Kuwaiti Investment Office's 10.2 per
cent stake in Midland would make it the largest single shareholder of the
enlarged bank - assuming it accepts the proposals; while under the existing
regulations it would have been forced to sell down its stake.
The 1 per cent restriction is entwined in Hongkong Bank's history.
It was made part of the Hongkong Bank Ordinance to ensure a wide shareholder
base and to protect the institution, Hong Kong's quasi-Central bank, from
corporate piracy. But it would significantly complicate a merger/takeover of
a bank where no such restrictions apply.
The restriction was written into the articles of association of HSBC
Holdings following the restructuring of the banking group in December 1990;
but this can be overturned by a ruling from the board of directors. HSBC
sources were adamant it would be put to the shareholders.
The colony's banking commissioner Mr David Carse said 'this move would not
concern us as supervisors, as it is too low a threshold'.
He pointed out that under the existing banking legislation, anyone
purchasing stakes in the bank beyond 10 per cent and 50 per cent thresholds
would require the permission of the commissioner.
Asia Equity's research director, Mr Barry Yates, described the restriction
as 'an archaic regulation'.
'It is particularly inappropriate for an international bank to have a
restrictive limit on share holdings', he said.
The removal of the restriction would pave the way for stake-building in the
enlarged bank, potentially boosting its stock market rating.
And although it might open the company to greater influence from
shareholders, the banking group, which still acts as note issuer and manager
of bank clearing in Hong Kong, would remain protected from aggressors.

FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance ahead 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIC ASSURANCE, the life assurance group, yesterday announced total net
profits for 1991 of Pounds 24.7m, an increase of 37 per cent from 1990.
The figures included an exceptional transfer from its industrial life fund
of Pounds 4.9m. Life business profits excluding this transfer increased 21
per cent to Pounds 19.5m.
The transfer, which was made to bring Britannic's bonus payments for
industrial branch contracts in line with the bonus structure for its
ordinary savings contracts, increased the funds available to shareholders.
Britannic therefore paid a final dividend of 20.3p (17.3p) bringing the
total for the year to 29.5p, up from 25.3p.
This was slightly ahead of some expectations, and the shares rose against
the market trend from 847p to 852p.
However, analysts said that the exceptional transfer was not solely aimed at
maintaining dividends, and that the results pointed to promising underlying
strength.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'The really
important point to make is that they are already generating significant
profit from personal pensions which they sold during the recent boom. There
is some genuine growth in these results, based on recent management action.'
The total underwriting loss for the general branch was Pounds 6.81m,
compared with Pounds 5.89m in 1990. This included losses on property of
Pounds 4.96m, and on motors of Pounds 1.55m.
Mr Alan Richards, insurance analyst at James Capel, said: 'The underwriting
loss is 26 per cent of premium income, much in line with the industry
average.' He was predicting a surplus next year of Pounds 24.5m, and a
dividend rise to 33.5p.

FT  19 MAR 92 / BAT to pay uncovered dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, yesterday
announced an 8 per cent increase in its annual dividend although the payment
will not be covered by earnings per share, which rose 21 per cent.
The group reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 945m to Pounds 1.05bn for
1991 which Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, described as a 'year of recovery'.
Sir Patrick said the dividend rise showed a 'continuing commitment to
dividend increases substantially in excess of the rate of inflation'. He
expected the 1992 dividend would be covered by earnings. BAT's aim was to
rebuild dividend cover to 2. The shares rose 6p to 660p.
The proposed final dividend of 11.2p, up from 10.4p, gives a total for the
year of 33.6p, up from 31.1p, while earnings per share were 27.9p, up from
23p. BAT is reverting to paying two dividends a year, rather than three, as
it did until 1989. The interim will be declared in July and is expected to
be 40 per cent of the total.
BAT's tobacco business made record trading profits of Pounds 1.08bn, a 14.2
per cent increase. Cigarette volumes worldwide increased by 3 per cent,
taking BAT's world market share to 10.5 per cent.
BAT gained market share in the US, and exports to Asia and eastern Europe
were strong. Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary, returned to profit in the
second half after the government allowed price increases. However, the
Argentine business was unprofitable because, BAT said, it was the victim of
a Dollars 38m (Pounds 21m) tax fraud.
The financial services side was hit by difficult trading conditions in Eagle
Star's general insurance business, offsetting good performances from
Farmers, the US insurance group, and Allied Dunbar, the life and pensions
subsidiary. General business incurred a trading loss of Pounds 22m from a
profit of Pounds 145m, while the life business made a profit of Pounds 254m,
up from Pounds 234m.
Sir Patrick said he thought Eagle Star had 'hit bottom' with the
underwriting result better in the second half of 1991 than the first and
some signs that claims on the domestic mortgage side were reducing.
The group's net interest charge fell from Pounds 210m to Pounds 133m, helped
by lower interest rates and sales of investments. The group's net debt stood
at 52 per cent of shareholders' funds at the year end.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Cadbury Schweppes in Mexico water deal: Pounds 145m share
placing planned to fund purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks maker, is buying
Mexico's leading bottler and distributor of mineral water for Dollars 325m
(Pounds 188m). It is one of the largest acquisitions of a Mexican business
by an overseas company.
To fund three-quarters of the purchase, Cadbury is raising Pounds 145m in a
share placing that will expand its equity by about 5 per cent.
The issue is priced at 425p a share, compared with yesterday's close of
433p, down 10p.
Aguas Minerales is being bought from Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa),
Mexico's largest beverage business.
Mr Pablo Riveroll, an analyst with Baring Research in Mexico said the sale
would lift a cloud hanging over Femsa since October when its shareholders,
with separate regional investors, bought a controlling stake in the Bancomer
bank for Dollars 2.88bn. The deal would allow them to meet a bank payment.
Cadbury is buying three brands of plain and fruit-flavoured mineral water -
Penafiel, Balseca and Etiqueta Azul, which are estimated to have 68 per cent
of Mexico's mineral water market. The business has five bottling plants with
wells and last year made a pre-tax profit of 68.2bn pesos (Pounds 13m) on
sales of 388.4bn pesos.
Mr Frank Swan, managing director for beverages, said Mexico was the world's
second largest market for carbonated soft drinks. Each inhabitant consumed
an average of 130 litres a year, 50 litres behind the US but ahead of most
other countries.
Aguas Minerales' sales volume was 423m litres, larger than the group's
businesses in France, Spain or Australia. Turnover was about 40 per cent of
what it might be elsewhere because of the refillable bottle system. The
market was expanding at 9 per cent a year.
Cadbury is buying Aguas Minerales at 26 times after-tax profit in 1991, but
estimates that the multiple will fall to 17 this year. Earnings dilution is
expected to be marginal this year and just over 1 per cent next year because
of the tax impact.
Mr David Jinks, finance director, said the effect on the balance sheet of
finding the remaining Pounds 42.9m purchase sum, the share placing and a
Pounds 100m goodwill write-off would be to raise gearing from 39 per cent to
42 per cent. Over the year, net debt was expected to rise from Pounds 333m
to about Pounds 440m, including other acquisition spending.

FT  19 MAR 92 / McDonnell Douglas seeks speedy deal with Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group, is anxious to
conclude an agreement to sell up to 49 per cent of its Douglas commercial
aircraft subsidiary to Taiwan Aerospace and other potential equity investors
by the end of this year to enable it to launch a new Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) jumbo aircraft programme.
Mr Robert Hood, president of the Douglas subsidiary, said it was important
for the company to secure a launch decision for its 400 to 600-seater MD-12
aircraft programme this year to ensure first deliveries in 1997.
The longer-term future of Douglas as a commercial aircraft manufacturer
largely depends on its ability to secure financial backing from new
investors to expand its product range.
Although the company had originally envisaged building a larger three-engine
derivative of its MD-11 tri-jet, Mr Hood confirmed Douglas was studying the
development of a four-engine or possibly a twin-engine jumbo. The initial
model would probably involve a 400-seater aircraft to compete against the
Boeing 747-400 jumbo.
The MD-12 programme is part of Douglas's strategy to develop a broader
family of aircraft to compete against the wider product ranges of its two
rivals, the US Boeing company and the European Airbus consortium. Douglas
manufactures products in only two of the main aircraft markets, whereas
Boeing and Airbus offer products in five different markets.
However, this strategy hinges on finding partners to invest in the Douglas
commercial aircraft subsidiary and to participate in its MD-12 and other
programmes.
Although Mr Hood was 'optimistic' about the outcome of the negotiations with
Taiwan Aerospace, the timing and structure of the deal remained uncertain.
China Steel, the Taiwanese state-run company which could acquire a big stake
in Taiwan Aerospace, is heading a Taiwan team studying the Douglas equity
investment deal. On completion of its study, Taiwan would say whether it
wanted to continue negotiations, Mr Hood said.
Under an initial agreement signed last November, Taiwan is considering
acquiring between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of Douglas. Mr Hood said the
US company was also talking to other potential equity investors with the aim
of selling up to 49 per cent of the Douglas subsidiary.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Bush's rival virtually concedes defeat: Buchanan's attacks
on US president fail to sway voters
</HEADLINE>

MR Pat Buchanan yesterday finally conceded that 'only celestial
intervention' could deny President George Bush the Republican party's
nomination for the November presidential election.
The conservative television broadcaster declined to withdraw after suffering
heavy defeats in Tuesday's primaries in Illinois and Michigan, which left Mr
Bush with about 80 per cent of the delegates needed for the nomination.
Mr Buchanan said he would focus his energies on North Carolina and
California, which vote in early May and June respectively, but promised not
to air commercials criticising the president.
Mr Buchanan won only 25 per cent of the vote in Michigan, where he had
campaigned hard, and 22 per cent in Illinois. Both results were well down on
the 30 per cent plus protest scores achieved in earlier primaries.
Although not a factor in these two states, the apparently improving state of
the economy, together with Mr Buchanan's virtual concession of defeat,
leaves Mr Bush in his most comfortable political position this year.
Further qualified consolation was provided yesterday by the Federal
Reserve's latest survey of business conditions nationwide, the so-called
Beige Book, which found a 'modestly more optimistic' sentiment as a result
of strength in housing, car sales and housebuilding.
Mr Bush, however, may not yet turn his fire on the clear Democratic
frontrunner, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. His first target is likely
to be the Democrats in Congress, which is due this week to pass a
reflationary package containing some tax increases certain to attract a
presidential veto.
But the president may also stand back in the hope of seeing Mr Clinton
attract the same sort of withering attack from former governor of California
Mr Jerry Brown that Mr Buchanan had been inflicting on Mr Bush. Mr Brown
launched a vituperative assault on Mr Clinton before this week's primaries.
Mr Clinton took the two big industrial states impressively, with 51 per cent
in each, bringing his delegate total closer to half the 2,145 needed for the
Democratic nomination. He therefore established, beyond a doubt, his
credentials as a national candidate.
Mr Brown pushed former Massachusetts senator Mr Paul Tsongas into third
place in Michigan and cut into his support in Illinois.
Mr Tsongas was conspicuously downcast after the results and went out of his
way to congratulate Mr Clinton, seeking to eliminate some of the bitterness
that has characterised recent exchanges between the two. He may also have
been preparing the way for a withdrawal if the Connecticut primary next
Tuesday and New York two weeks later go badly.
Mr Brown, however, promised Mr Clinton no quarter, again raising questions
about the governor's character and sense of propriety. Some senior
Democrats, fearful that the party could tear itself apart, have urged Mr
Brown to tone down his rhetoric.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Peace, retrenchment and reform' ?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is with extreme reluctance that I write about the UK election campaign.
For there is no party which could be identified with the Gladstonian Liberal
slogan of 'Peace, Retrenchment and Reform' - of which Cobden was a more
consistent exponent than Gladstone himself.
Modern Conservatives would be embarrassed to be associated with the first
word of the slogan and they are the last group to be associated with more
than superficial institutional reform. Even on retrenchment, the very most
one can say is that they are less bad than the others. There is not much
retrenchment about adding to borrowing in the face of a Pounds 32bn (not
Pounds 28bn) budget deficit, before even privatisation or council sales.
The problem with today's Liberal Democrats is that they are not Gladstonian
Liberals but are very clearly the heirs of the so-called New Liberals of the
early 20th century, who saw it as their role to enlarge the functions of the
state. Paddy Ashdown has been saddled with too much interventionist baggage.
The case for supporting the Liberal Democrats lies not in their economic
proposals, but in their constitutional ideas. Unlike many commentators who
support proportional representation, I want to ensure inter alia, that
nothing like Labour's tax and minimum wage proposals are ever enacted. And
my main reservation is that some Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs are muttering
about being prepared to support a minority Labour government in return for
something less than full PR. That would be to repeat unforgivably the howler
made by the Liberals in the 1960s and 1970s when they sustained minority
Labour governments with nothing worthwhile in return.
As for Labour's shadow Budget: words almost fail me. Lord Hailsham once
wrote scathingly about the absurd importance attached to the party manifesto
'as a pronouncement from Sinai, with every jot and tittle, of that unreal
and unreasonable document, reverenced as holy writ'.
But worse than the manifesto is a so-called Budget drafted in opposition,
which is certain to be quite out of date by the time any chancellor has to
introduce a real Budget. Yet John Smith would feel honour bound to try to
stick to it.
The Treasury would not have any real secrets to impart to him other than the
bad forecasts with which it has broken so many governments. But it is still
possible that someone there, away from the heat of the campaign, has
something worthwhile to tell a new chancellor, which has not yet penetrated
to Mr Smith through the network of donnish supporters with Whitehall
friends. But this ridiculous document would prevent him from paying any
attention.
The whole document is so tawdry. If you want to make it like a genuine
Treasury Red Book, for goodness' sake carry the illusion through, and do not
insert 'Abolition of the bribe to opt out of Serps'.
As for the content of the proposals: a learned analysis is superfluous. The
idea behind it can be very straightforwardly illustrated if the reader will
play a little game. Take 10 piles of coins, or other counters, of different
height. Then take some coins off the two largest piles and redistribute
those taken away on to all the other eight piles. Ignore any effect of
shifting the counters around on the aggregate of all the piles. Then he will
certainly find that eight out of the 10 piles have gained - in this case
usually trifling amounts. If that is what voters want, and they believe that
all income belongs to the state to redistribute in this way, then they will
deserve all they get.
But even accepting these assumptions Labour has made a botch - maybe because
the original calculations were done so long ago. The new top band of tax
will be 59 per cent with employee national insurance contributions, and
70-80 per cent if properly calculated, to take in employers' contributions
and indirect tax. The so-called right wing of the Labour party were so full
of self-congratulation at the supposed moderation of this top rate that they
did not look too closely at where it would bite. This will happen at what
some Labour adviser presumably once thought was the extraordinarily high
income of Pounds 40,000 per annum - which is, in fact, only 2 1/2 times
average male annual earnings last year. It is indeed a good deal fiercer on
middle-upper incomes than the scale that Mr Denis Healey, who boasted of
making the pips squeak, left behind in 1978-79, although less steep at the
very top.
For what is all that to be used? For an untargeted, across-the-board
increase for all pensioners and for all beneficiaries of child benefit,
irrespective of means. And in addition for so-called public investment, much
of which will flow to the public service unions, and for handouts to
manufacturing companies for investment. Labour cannot rid itself of its zeal
to bribe corporations but penalise the people who make them function. The
real gainers will be the tax advisers.
What made me turn off the television set, despite promising the editor to
view it to the end, in a television debate with Norman Lamont and Alan
Beith, was when John Smith erupted and said: 'Anyone would think there is
something wicked or immoral in a minimum wage.' But there is something
immoral in some government authority interposing its clumsy know-best ukase
between a willing seller of labour and a willing buyer. There are all kinds
of situations, undreamed of in Social Charter philosophy, when such bargains
are in the best interests of the most disadvantaged people for whom the
left-wing parties are supposed to stand.
And please do not tell me about boys going up chimneys in the industrial
revolution. We are talking about agreements between consenting adults, as
the real Gladstonian Liberals pointed out at the time of the Factory Acts
legislation. I nearly switched off the set earlier when the shadow
chancellor was using arguments such as '10 out of 12 European countries do
X'. Has he not heard the talmudic saying about not following a majority to
commit a folly?
Nevertheless, I am not entirely sorry for the mess into which Conservative
ministers have got themselves. When asked what he was doing about the
recession, Norman Lamont gave a purely unreconstructed Keynesian answer
about the amount of his spending increases and tax cuts - despite the fact
that his own Budget speech repudiated the idea of giving the economy a
kick-start; and it was this blatant contradiction that irked me far more
than the policy.
The chancellor would have been much better off to have accepted some
Treasury advice that no net tax reliefs were advisable this year instead of
compromising on a moderate bribe. The lower-rate tax threshold is the
epitome of the second rate - superficially attractive, but deeply flawed.
Surely somebody warned Mr Lamont that raising tax thresholds was a much more
effective way of helping the least well-off taxpayers, and that Labour could
easily trump him by offering to do just that?
But what irritated me most was the lack of all historical sense. The
chancellor did not acknowledge that Denis Healey had previously inserted a
lower band in the 1978 Budget at a very late stage, at the behest of the
TUC, which Sir Geoffrey Howe had abolished in 1980. Nor did Neil Kinnock
remind him of these awkward facts, despite the measure having leaked into
one of the popular dailies.
The main reason of which I can think for the utter lack of style or
distinction with which the election is being fought is the predominance of
public relations and advertising executives, who are supposed to be the
experts on just such things, but are too tunnel-visioned to see beyond their
'research'.
* * *
Why have I not stuck to my last and written about policies to cure
recession? Because none of the parties has the least contribution to offer.
A sizeable reduction in interest rates will have to wait until the
Bundesbank decides that inflationary pressures in Germany have subsided
sufficiently for it to take the lead. Meanwhile the possibility of higher
interest rates under Labour to offset foreign exchange market distrust, the
blow to confidence among spenders in the south-east and the human deterrent
to inward investment risk delaying recovery. Is the risk worth it?

FT  19 MAR 92 / Letter: Role of the electricians' union at Wapping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC HAMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith's review (March 12) of my book, Maverick, is a little
lopsided with its concentration on Wapping. As for the headline, 'Hammond
admits to talks with Murdoch', I have never denied meetings with News
International.
Indeed, in our evidence to the Trades Union Congress in February 1986, we
said: 'Negotiations during 1985 between the TUC PIC (printing industries
committee) unions and News International about its Wapping plant had been on
the basis of the company's expressed intention that it proposed to use that
plant to print a new paper, The London Post, and not any of its existing
titles. This is confirmed by Sogat's evidence to the general council on
January 30. As these negotiations related to a new newspaper to be produced
at a new plant no union enjoyed any existing right of recognition or
negotiation in respect of that plant.'
But all our meetings were concerned with a new newspaper, The London Post,
to be produced on a new site. We had been successful with Mr Eddie Shah in
1985 and hoped to do the same with News International.
We were unsuccessful at Wapping because the print unions upped the stakes
with their strike and gave News International the pretext to transfer
existing titles to Wapping. We had nothing to do with that decision, nor
could we change it. The responsibility rests squarely with the print unions.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Letter: Amstrad chief charges Labour with not doing its
homework, and offering no route out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SUGAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have noted with disgust the comments of a certain Mr Gordon Brown who
has accused me of doing well out of the recession after reading the letter
published in The Times from 40 top industrialists.
I do not know who Mr Gordon Brown is. Excuse my ignorance, but I don't.
Whoever he is (shadow trade and industry secretary), he has not done his
homework properly. The man doesn't know what he's talking about. How he has
the audacity to say that Amstrad, or Alan Sugar, has flourished in recession
is a complete mystery to me.
Amstrad made its first loss ever this year. It is not a secret that our
share price has tumbled to about one-seventh of what it was. The value of my
shares has collapsed from Pounds 500m to Pounds 100m more or less overnight.
The salary I have been taking in the company is pretty meagre - about Pounds
170,000. It's nowhere near the million-pound bracket. So this talk that I
have prospered in the midst of recession is total nonsense.
I personally have made a lot of money in my time, despite coming from a
working class background in the East End. The money hasn't been handed down
from family to family or by the old boys' act. I was able to start from
scratch.
When taxation was 98p in the pound under the last Labour government I would
have been spending my time doing what I am doing now - creating wealth and
producing employment. I would have been better off going to Bermuda, the
Virgin Islands or Timbuktu.
But I don't want to go to Bermuda to avoid tax and lie on the beach. I don't
like paying tax, but I agree that the 40 per cent I pay at the moment is
reasonable and fair when you balance the fact that the country has got to
run itself somehow, and I like living in England.
So that's why I'm here. That's why I'm still spearheading my company and
that's why I'm still employing people, innovating and surviving in a very
difficult market.
Our letter to The Times talked of the importance of the enterprise culture
for the future prosperity of Britain. The thing that frightens me the most
about a Labour government is that it suppresses enterprise.
For instance, Labour's talk about investment is a bit of a joke. The capital
allowances for machinery, plant and equipment it urges are not going to
encourage people to rush out tomorrow and start equipping a factory or
making products.
If you've got good design and innovative products you don't need any help,
thank you very much indeed. You get on and make it. Amstrad is a classic
example. We built our own factories in Shoeburyness in Essex without a penny
grant on an 11-acre site. From there, in 1980, we fought off the Japanese to
turn ourselves into the market leader in audio equipment. I didn't need help
from anybody at that stage because we had invented good merchandise and good
products.
The same goes for satellite dishes today. We rule the satellite dish market
in this country and half of Europe and the dishes are made in Birmingham. I
didn't need any investment or any help to do it. All I needed was the
government to keep out of the way. More than 1m dishes have been sold to
date in this country alone. When we placed the orders in the factory the
satellite hadn't even been launched. It's that sort of entrepreneurial
spirit the Conservatives believe in and Labour doesn't understand.
The reason Labour flourished many years ago was the 'them and us' situation
that prevailed in England. There were the rich and there were the poor. At
that stage maybe I would have sympathised with the need for a Labour
government.
But that's all been changed now. Look around. Yes, there are the very poor
and more should be done for them. But almost everybody's got a microwave
oven, a car and a colour television - maybe more than one colour television
in their homes. Let's be honest with each other. 'Them and us' doesn't exist
any more, as I have demonstrated.
I have been able to come from the working class, achieve what I set out to
achieve and not be suppressed by anybody. Likewise, in the stock market
today there are bright young men with a Cockney accent doing deals and
buying and selling shares. It's not just the Heskett-Smythes mob that are
doing it. Anybody can do it.
The government has made mistakes; nobody's perfect. To be sure, somebody
took his eye off the ball. Now the belt has been tightened and there have
been casualties. But it is not just the poor unemployed factory worker from
the Midlands who is being thrown out of work. So are the merchant bankers,
the stockbrokers and the estate agents.
Labour offers no sort of route out of recession. It's out of date and - as
Brown's remark shows - it hasn't done its homework.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Building a cheaper roof over one's head: Proposals for new
ways to finance low-cost rented housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is widely accepted that the UK is in urgent need of more 'affordable'
housing for rent - an additional 100,000 such homes must be built each year,
according to some estimates. Housing associations could play a leading role
in meeting the demand for low-cost rented housing, but they are finding it
hard to attract enough private sector capital. New approaches may be
required if housing need is to be met.
Housing associations already receive substantial government grants to build
houses for rent. This year they will get Pounds 1.7bn, but they will need
another Pounds 500m of private sector capital to meet their housing targets.
In addition, they will require as much as another Pounds 2bn a year to
finance the acquisition of council homes - transfer to housing association
ownership is at the centre of the government's drive to improve the lot of
council tenants.
So far, associations have managed to raise sufficient funds from the private
sector. The Housing Corporation, the quango which regulates registered
housing associations, says Pounds 2.6bn has been raised over the past four
years, from 82 lenders. However, associations are finding it harder to raise
the finance they need.
One reason is fragmentation: only a handful of the associations are large
enough to borrow directly in the capital markets. Most rely on finance
provided by local bank or building society branches, usually at higher
rates.
But the number of lenders prepared to lend to housing associations has
declined. The National Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA) says fewer
than a dozen banks and building societies are willing to lend regularly to
associations - and each limits the amount it will lend.
In recent transfers of housing from local authorities, there have been only
four active lenders: National Westminster Bank, Halifax Building Society,
Bank of Scotland and Nationwide Building Society. Other lenders which backed
earlier transfers such as Banque Paribas, the French bank, have pulled back
from the market.
One organisation which could help is The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC),
a limited company set up by the Housing Corporation and the NFHA to raise
money for housing associations from bond market investors, such as insurance
companies and pension funds. So far it has found Pounds 250m, using single
bond issues to raise funds for several housing associations at cheaper rates
than they could get on their own.
But THFC has no capital base to absorb bond holders' losses if an
association goes under. Without this cushion, investors are mostly unwilling
to lend to associations.
A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a non-charitable trust which
investigates social issues, proposes an intermediary with its own capital
base, similar to 3i, the development capital firm, or the Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation. It suggests that an intermediary with Pounds 50m of
capital could raise about Pounds 500m from the bond market.
The Department of the Environment has commissioned a report from Hambros,
the City merchant bank, on whether such an institution is necessary and
feasible. The Labour party is also attracted to this approach; it is
committed to introducing a National Housing Bank which would perform much
the same function.
The government might, however, be unwilling to find the start-up capital,
fearing that the new body will be seen as backed by government guarantee.
Borrowing by a government-backed body would, under current accounting rules,
inflate the public sector borrowing requirement.
Capital could come from the banks, through a stake in the new intermediary
like that in 3i. Yet the banks are unlikely to be willing to invest in such
a project in the recession - they are already planning to realise their
investment in 3i by floating it on the stock exchange later this year, to
concentrate on core business.
An alternative to a capitalised intermediary would be new instruments to
allow housing associations to approach the bond markets directly. The
simplest would be a system of 'credit enhancement' where, in return for a
premium, specialised insurance companies would guarantee bond issues against
default, offering investors additional security.
The Rowntree report rejects credit enhancement because the cost would be too
high. But some housing associations are already considering credit-enhanced
bond issues to raise the large amounts needed to finance the acquisition of
local authority housing. Broomleigh Housing Association, for example, is
considering a credit-enhanced bond issue if it cannot get bank finance for
the Pounds 150m needed to purchase council housing from Bromley council in
Kent.
Finally, if new organisations or instruments are rejected, housing
associations might find it easier to raise the finance they need if their
borrowing requirements could be reduced. At present, when council homes are
transferred to housing associations, the associations pay an average of
Pounds 8,000 for each property under a Treasury pricing formula.
If the properties were transferred at a price which reflected the
outstanding debt on them, the unit cost would be reduced to less than Pounds
5,500, according to the Institute of Housing. This would reduce the amount
housing associations have to borrow, permitting less complex loans of
shorter maturity and almost certainly increasing the number of potential
lenders.
Attractive as it may seem, however, such a change would need to be handled
with political sensitivity if it were not to appear that the government was
selling off council houses on the cheap.

FT  19 MAR 92 / The gamble pays off: South Africa's 'yes' marks a political
point of no return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 40 years caught in the time-warp of apartheid, South African whites
have finally opted to join the modern world. Within months, the white
government will have abandoned the exclusive hegemony of centuries, and
blacks will enjoy political power for the first time.
For yesterday's unequivocal 'yes' vote for political reform takes the
country past a point of no return on the road to multi-racial democracy.
President F W de Klerk declared yesterday: 'Today is the real birthday of
the new South African nation. We have closed the book on apartheid.'
Mr de Klerk - who gambled his political future on Tuesday's whites-only
referendum - could not have been more delighted at a vote which was both
surprisingly large and overwhelmingly positive (and came on his 56th
birthday). Defeat in the referendum would have been a disaster for the
National party, and for South Africa. Instead, the landslide win will propel
the country towards early agreement on a multi-racial interim government,
and the international acceptability that such a move will bring.
The breadth of support for Mr de Klerk - from rural Afrikaner communities to
urban English-speakers - will have surprised even the most sanguine party
official. Only hours before the poll, National party organisers were
predicting at best a 55 per cent 'yes' majority, well below the eventual
68.7 per cent victory. In the end, only one of the country's 15 regions
voted 'no': the northern Transvaal, the last refuge of the ultra-right,
where border farmers have fought for years against real or threatened
terrorist incursions, where drought and poverty have radicalised whites.
But even in more liberal areas, informal exit polls suggest that relatively
few 'yes' voters were inspired by the glorious vision of racial justice and
equality proclaimed so eloquently by Mr de Klerk in his victory press
conference. Many voted for largely negative reasons: to prevent the white
supremacist Conservative party (CP) from taking power, and to stave off the
race war and economic collapse which a CP victory would almost certainly
have brought. But they voted 'yes' all the same: as Mr de Klerk put it, they
'rose above themselves'. Now he can claim their mandate to force the pace in
constitutional negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) and
other non-white political groups in the multi-party forum, the Convention
for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa).
The outlines of a deal have been sketched in already during bilateral talks
between the ANC and the government. An interim executive could be appointed
by Codesa as early as June, with committees to oversee the security forces,
local government, the budget and foreign affairs, as well as independent
commissions to control broadcast media and multi-party elections.
Within a year from then, elections would be held to a unicameral legislature
which would both replace the current parliament and draw up a new
constitution. This represents a significant concession by the Nationalists,
who have always insisted on a second chamber, a sort of 'house of
minorities', to protect whites. Such a legislature would meet the ANC's main
demand: that an elected constituent assembly draw up a post-apartheid
constitution, with decisions taken by a two-thirds majority.
This body would sit for about a year until elections were held under a new
constitution which would enforce power-sharing for a further five years. The
new parliament would be bicameral, with disproportionately large
representation in the upper house for minority political parties,
apportioned by region. And, crucially, many powers would be devolved from
central government to the regions. For this is the key to the National
party's plan for preventing black domination: the ANC could dominate central
government, but many of its powers would have been removed. In several
regions, whites would continue to have a large say in areas such as
education and fiscal policy.
The plan could change - especially if the big 'yes' vote inspires Mr de
Klerk to take a tougher line in Codesa on the ground that he can strike a
harder bargain backed by such a large majority of whites. Conversely, the
ANC might decide to be tougher, now that Mr de Klerk can no longer raise the
bogey of the right wing to force concessions from it on minority rights.
Either way, an interim government should be quickly in place.
Many 'yes' voters are likely to be dismayed when the outlines of the draft
constitutional settlement emerge in public. For the referendum campaign
focused largely on other issues: the threat that CP policies would provoke
international sanctions, and keep South Africans out of world sporting
events; the spectre of socialism from the ANC. They knew they were voting
for reform - but not at the breakneck speed now likely from Codesa. Unless
the proposed constitutional deal is substantially altered in weeks to come,
Mr de Klerk will be left with no choice but to reverse some referendum
promises. Voters may feel betrayed, but with no further referendum planned
to seek their approval for a final constitution, they will have little
chance to show it.
Herein lies the risk that the ultra-right - left with no legal outlet for
opposition after yesterday's resounding defeat - will turn to violence. For
the future of the newly united right must be tenuous at best. The
Conservative party may struggle on for weeks or months making a show of
unity where none truly exists. But eventually, the young moderates who argue
for a more pragmatic form of 'self-determination' - and who might eventually
settle for strong regional autonomy rather than a geographical homeland -
must either hijack the party or break away from it. The radical rump, along
with the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), can be expected
to destabilise negotiations with bombs or bullets.
The risk of radicalism from the left is equally worrisome: as referendum
results were being announced yesterday in a government office building in
Cape Town, thousands of ANC supporters demonstrated noisily outside. They
were not objecting to the referendum - indeed, the ANC did all it could to
ensure a 'yes' vote, clearly terrified of the prospect of negotiating with
the racists of the CP. They were protesting against the national budget
presented yesterday by Finance Minister Mr Barend du Plessis. The hammer and
sickle of the South African Communist party was much in evidence, and
posters demanded 'jobs for all'.
The demonstration illustrated the point often forgotten during the whirlwind
referendum campaign: that successful political transition will be difficult
against the background of South Africa's chronic unemployment (as many as 55
per cent of blacks are estimated to be unemployed) and three-year recession.
For Mr de Klerk must now turn away from the sideshow of white politics and
tackle the country's biggest problem: the economy.
Recent figures from the South African Reserve Bank, the central bank,
highlight the problem: real gross national product per capita has fallen
from R3,905 (Pounds 781) in 1981 to only R3,275 last year. Unemployment
continues to rise, the distribution of income is seriously skewed, inflation
is in double figures, skills are short and labour and capital productivity
low.
For while business yesterday welcomed the referendum outcome - which could
lead to the lifting of further international sanctions, with some nations
likely to argue even for the lifting of the United Nations oil embargo -
they know that only new investment can rescue South Africa's economy. And
though Mr de Klerk promised, during the election campaign, that a landslide
'yes' vote would bring new foreign investment, he must have known that to be
an unlikely prospect. Foreigners have not failed to invest because they
feared the right-wing threat which has now been defused: they fear the ANC
and the socialist bent of its economic policies.
The ANC is due to hold an economic policy conference next month, at which
the vexed issue of nationalisation will be debated. Though Mr Nelson
Mandela, ANC president, has recently said he is reconsidering the issue, it
remains immensely popular with the ANC rank and file, and with other ANC
leaders.
Politics has no answer for the problems of South Africa's economy. That is
where the real battle will be joined between white and black: over the
economic legacy of apartheid, over how to guarantee the prosperity Mr de
Klerk has promised to all his constituents in the new South Africa.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk has won the referendum. Now his troubles begin. In
the most momentous decision in their 400 year history, white South Africans
have shown they accept that minority rule can no longer be sustained.
Yet it is too soon to enjoy the luxury of excessive hope, and the world must
now find ways of assisting South Africa to consolidate its transition to a
post-apartheid society. The perils that lie ahead remain daunting. A third
of voters opposed reform and opted for the fantasy of apartheid. The danger
of violence from these right-wing extremists has never been greater. They
have many supporters within the ranks of the police and the army. Their last
constitutional opportunity to resist political reform has been resoundingly
lost.
The government has emerged from the referendum better equipped to cope with
this threat. The significance of Mr de Klerk's victory goes beyond the
mandate for negotiations that will end white rule. A new alliance between
Afrikaans- and English-speaking whites has been forged, bringing the liberal
Democratic party and the ruling National party together in pursuit of a
common goal. If he is to disarm extremists of the left and the right, as
sooner or later he must, the president can now claim strong political
backing.
Painful process
It has been a painful process. White South Africa inflicted much suffering
before bowing to the inevitable. The impact of sanctions, the fear of
isolation and of spiralling violence - all added up to overwhelming pressure
to abandon apartheid.
Had Mr de Klerk's gamble failed, internal conflict would have been
inevitable. An un-stable South Africa would have jeopardised the fragile
peace process in Angola and Mozambique. The region's worst drought in living
memory would have claimed many lives in the absence of secure access to
South Africa's ports and railways, needed to import the maize required to
prevent starvation.
That nightmare is over. The way is open for the early installation of a
multi-racial interim government, based on principles already agreed by the
19 organisations attending the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa). This should cement an alliance between Mr de Klerk and the African
National Congress president, Mr Nelson Mandela, the two men who hold South
Africa's future in their hands.
Negotiating skill
But Mr de Klerk still needs all the help he can get. The ANC may be the
Nationalists' most promising partner, but not all of its leaders are natural
democrats. Its links with the South African Communist party persist.
Maintaining human rights and a private enterprise economy will require great
negotiating skill and a huge amount of luck. As yesterday's budget shows,
South Africa's economy is depressed. There is no chance of meeting rising
black expectations and assuaging white extremists' fears within existing
financial resources.
So there are many potential pitfalls ahead. The new South Africa deserves
substantial assistance to help it redress the legacies of apartheid, and
boost an economy sapped by the need to run a balance of payments surplus in
order to service its external debt. It should have access to International
Monetary Fund facilities, and recourse to the World Bank and other lending
agencies. The sooner the outside world ensures that these resources are made
available, the better the prospects for a democratic South Africa.

THE GERMANS: WHO ARE THEY NOW? By Alan Watson Methuen, Pounds 17.99
TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME By Peter Millar Bloomsbury, Pounds 17.99
THE ECONOMY OF UNITED GERMANY By W R Smyser St Martin's Press/Christopher
Hurst, (no price indicated)
A larger Germany has become of larger interest to its neighbours. The rest
of Europe is now well aware that events in united Germany have a crucial
influence on a continent in transition. At the same time, it is apparent
that, in its efforts to make a success of unity, Germany faces a task of
epic proportions.
Germany may well be on the way towards strengthening its financial and
industrial dominance, as well as achieving new political sway too. But the
sheer psychological, as well as economic, challenge of integrating the two
parts of a two-tier nation is considerably greater than optimists like
Chancellor Helmut Kohl believed 18 months ago.
For all these reasons, books on Germany are a welcome addition to reading
lists. These three diverse volumes share a common merit: they set out the
material in a way likely to appeal both to casual and specialist students.
Watson, a broadcaster and businessman, examines German history, culture and
geography with sympathetic rigour. His book, which grew out of the recent
four-part Channel 4 documentary on Germany, suffers from an inevitable
drawback: its somewhat stilted prose reads like something meant to be spoken
in front of a camera. Yet perhaps this is no bad thing. Watson strips
Germany down to its basic parts - Heimat and Hitler, Congress of Vienna and
Catholic church, Deutsche Bank and Daimler-Benz - and reassembles the
components before the TV lens.
No stone has been left unturned, in both east and west, to track down
interviewees, from the Bundeswehr serviceman who opposes conscription, to Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, who admits a little too
readily that his institution would only sanction the creation of a European
central bank if it were 'almost exactly' a copy of the Bundesbank itself.
The result is a very thorough anatomy, ending with the optimistic conclusion
that the united Germans have now at last 'come home' in Europe - for the
good of the whole continent.
Millar's book is also a very visual narrative, in a wholly different - and
highly original - manner. A journalist who first lived in East Berlin when
working for Reuters in 1981, Millar has assembled a fascinating cast of real
Berliners who compellingly relate stories of their own lives - and of
Germany.
The tale starts in Millar's favourite East Berlin haunt, a agreeably
melancholic bar which forms a beery meeting point for disgruntled locals.
And the story keeps returning there throughout a series of meandering
episodes leading to Millar's own escapades in East ill-starred 40th birthday
celebrations in October 1989, when the Wall was breached a month later.
Millar's incursions into contemporary politics can sometimes be injudicious.
But, in a book which brings together a sharp eye for incongruous detail with
the racy flair of a novel, Millar convincingly sums up the bitter-sweet
atmosphere of East German life, shabby but somehow secure, before and during
the fall of communism. Through the rotating prism of the beer glasses in the
Metzer Eck pub, Millar shows the excitement, frustrations and pathos of his
Berlin friends - and discovers the emotions running through a nation
embarked on an unexpected adventure.
Smyser's book focuses on the same adventure, illuminated this time entirely
through the economic eye-glass. This is one of the first manuals on the
economy of united Germany, and it presents all the facts and figures - most
of them up-to-date  - that are necessary to examine the outlook for business
and finance.
Smyser, a Washington-based analyst, has no literary pretensions; there is
something curiously mechanistic about the sentence: 'Although Karl Marx was
a German, many modern west Germans have departed radically from Marxist
thinking.' Smyser's view of Germany is occasionally rather too obviously
that of the well-informed but distant outsider.
The book, however, rates a place on the shelf of any businessman trying to
come to grips with Mitbestimmung (co-determination), German social security
regulations or the Treuhand.
Smyser also pinpoints a dilemma which appears bound to become more acute in
coming years - Germany's struggle to decide on its priorities towards
eastern and western Europe. The Germans, he writes, must decide how they
wish to 'shape' Europe. Neither he nor anyone else expects any very clear
answers - one eminently good reason why books on Germany will continue to
flow freely off the publishers' production lines.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Manifesto to manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative manifesto published yesterday is twice the length and twice
the price of Labour's. This does not mean it is twice as good, although Mr
Major's programme contains more novelties than Mr Kinnock's.
Whereas Labour's document is the umpteenth in a series which began with the
watershed policy review in 1987, Mr Major's is the work of a team which
achieved power suddenly and has never quite had time to think through what
it stands for.
With Labour, the game is to study the passage in successive documents on,
say, energy, and then to try to work out whether a change in wording
represents a policy shift or just word processor blindness. Because Labour
has been in opposition so long, all we have to go on is its language, which
all too often buckles under the strain of scrutiny.
It is fitting that the Tory document should have on its cover a picture of
the prime minister. This really is the book of the man: level-headed and
clear about the central principles of individual choice and market forces,
supplemented by a commitment to better public services. The challenge of Mr
Major's second administration, if there is to be one, will be to reconcile
these two themes. In this document, that reconciliation is not achieved.
The strongest parts of the manifesto are those Mr Major inherited from Mrs
Thatcher and upon which he has built: increased competition in public
utilities, privatisation, performance-raising new structures in health and a
genuine commitment to the minimum necessary regulation of enterprise.
Its line on Europe is Thatcherism modified more in style than substance: no
to the social charter, but yes to a community of 22 by the end of the
decade, and an open-ish mind on monetary union.
Vague targets
Like his predecessor, Mr Major favours lower taxes; unlike her, he is
prepared to tilt that policy in favour of the lower paid. His targets for
balanced budgets and reduced public spending are vague.
But it is in wrestling with the public sector and regulating the lives of
citizens that the new approach emerges.
This is a world of badge-wearing civil servants; inspectors for everything
that moves, from social workers to firemen; task forces on truancy and empty
government property; a new Urban Regeneration Agency and an Environment
Agency; even a Hedgerow Incentive Scheme.
Proud reference is made to the Safer Cities programme and its '124 schemes
to improve street lighting'. Who said this was a government that had run out
of ideas? It has ideas on elephants, battery hens, joy riders, caravan sites
and even on the millennium, which is to have its very own fund, paid for by
a lottery.
Nanny state
What shall we name this vision? Surely it is none other than the nanny
state, wearing a smart blue pinafore. There she beckons, as through every
chartered street we go.
The central problem is that these Christmas stockings full of policies and
quangos, some good, some bad, hang from a tree of centralised government,
which is wilting under the burden. The Tories are so opposed to
constitutional reform, strong local government or even lucid debate on the
democratic accountability of public services, that such issues are nowhere
addressed.
Instead of a city-wide government, London is to be supervised by a minister
of London public transport and a cabinet committee chaired by the
environment secretary.
Labour, to its credit, is thinking its way through this inescapable agenda
of governance, proposing substantial decentralisation and reform, albeit
with gaps and self-contradictions.
The worry with Labour's manifesto is the old one. On markets, the party
talks the talk, but will it walk the walk? Government is there 'to ensure
that the market works properly'. But Labour will renationalise the
electricity grid, block competitive tendering in the NHS and local
authorities, introduce a minimum wage, cut coal imports. It wants a National
Investment Bank, but one 'operating on strictly commercial lines', in which
case, it must be inquired: what's the point? At heart, Labour still believes
that enhanced performance can be delivered at least as well by
administrative fiat as by competitive forces.
There are, of course, also policy overlaps and common blind spots. Both
parties want a broadcasting and arts ministry and neither has a credible
plan to revive the rental market in housing. But, taken with their sharply
differing views on personal taxation, these two manifestos confirm that
Britain faces a choice. It lies between parties which are distinctive from
each other, but neither of which has a monopoly of good sense.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's University College Opera presentation is of Lalo's once-famous
Roi d'Ys (Paris Opera-Comique, 1888). The choice may have been ambitious -
since heavier-than-usual demands are placed on chorus and orchestra - but
ambition has been rewarded. A lively, enthusiastic performance brings back
to London one of the most stirring and enjoyable of all operas outside the
regular repertory.
This attempt at a Breton Lohengrin marries Grand Opera trappings to the
concision and economy of the smaller-scale French operatic forms.
The tale, based on Breton legend, is threaded with Lohengrin-like intrigue
and treachery, with secret passion (of Princess Margared for the warrior
Mylio) and jealousy (of Margared for her sister Rozenn, Mylio's beloved) -
the libretto, not exactly distinguished in tone, is a model of
getting-a-move-on. Yet the musical foundation of the opera is its Breton
rhythmic pulse and colour, most delightfully experienced in the opening
choruses and the Act 3 Wedding Scene (including Mylio's beautiful Aubade).
What reads in the libretto as stock melodrama is made elatingly muscular and
pointed by the music.
Mike Ashman's production has been brilliantly designed by Bernard Culshaw in
terms of primary-colour costume and sliding panel; it works up a remarkable
amount of fast-moving spectacle in a small space and on a limited budget.
The means are modern, simple; the management of student-choral forces is
both daring and canny. The threat of inundation that provides the opera with
its finale is suggested with billowing sheets and cloths - an over-familiar
device made brand-new by the intelligence of its accomplishment.
Student opera-staging of this imaginatively bold kind is always a special
pleasure, especially when underwritten by such committed student-chorus
singing (in passable French) and acting. The valiant UCO orchestra's
struggles with the complexities of the scoring were less easily concealed.
In spite of this the conductor, David Drummond, kept a strong hand on the
dramatic unfolding: the mounting excitement of the closing scene was proof
of that.
Of the principals, all requiring a peculiarly French combination of power,
elegance and sweetness, by far the most stylish was Hilary Western as Rozenn
 -a lovely performance, accurately and truly sung, from an undervalued
soprano. Two young visitors from eastern Europe add to the interest of the
casting: the inexperienced but highly promising Russian tenor Alexander
Naumenko (charming in Mylio's Aubade) and the forceful but wooden Georgian
baritone Irakli Grigalashvili (the villain Karnac). As Margared, the opera's
beau role, the mezzo Jenny Miller released flashes of eloquence and passion
whenever a constricted vocal technique permitted. Performances tomorrow and
Saturday.

Seeing the people you telephone has moved a step closer this week as two
companies prepare to launch videophones for consumer use. BT and Amstrad
plan to introduce products, manufactured by GEC-Marconi, in time for
Christmas. The likely price tag will be Pounds 399.
Until now, most videophone research has been aimed at the business market
with advances in videoconferencing spearheading developments. But the new
GEC-Marconi videophone can use either traditional analogue systems or the
new digital exchanges, the latter making up around 55 per cent of the UK
phone network.
The difficulty with the analogue system has been in compressing the amount
of information required into the line to produce a clear moving picture and
adequate sound quality. But developments in data compression and integrated
software have enabled the breakthrough to be made to standards the
manufacturer hopes will become the norm for the industry.
The unit contains a three-inch square flip-up screen, which receives colour
pictures from a finger-sized camera situated above. It plugs into a normal
telephone socket and calls cost the normal rate. The screen and camera can
be placed down if not required.
The videophone has a 'picture refreshment rate' - the transmission rate of
frames per second - of around 10 compared with a television rate of 25. This
means that there is a slight time lag on sudden movements - and a tendency
to make the image slightly larger than normal. Otherwise the picture is
surprisingly clear.
GEC-Marconi says it is developing separate types of unit for Amstrad and BT,
although the product will use similar components.
These developments mark the latest stage in an increasingly competitive
business with manufacturers racing to open up the market. Earlier this year
AT&amp;T announced it was testing an analogue videophone in the US which would
retail at around Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 850).

FT  19 MAR 92 / Technology: Offices follow the factory's example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gains in office productivity could rival those achieved in manufacturing if
a new approach, known as business process redesign (BPR), succeeds.
The rationale behind BPR is that concepts like Japan's 'best manufacturing
practice', which uses just-in-time techniques, can be applied to the office
as well as the factory.
In manufacturing, physical layout is important because moving materials
around can be costly. In the office, delays in dealing with important
documents occur because they pass between too many people, departments or
offices.
'BPR looks at the targets which the business wants to reach and works
backwards to design the processes necessary to achieve them,' says Judith
Wainwright of the London-based consultancy Pagoda. 'It is a way of
simplifying the workflow, by reducing the number of stages involved in a
procedure.' Western Provident Association (WPA), the UK's third largest
health insurer, has made productivity improvements of 38 per cent from BPR.
'Processing an application for health insurance used to involve seven staff
and take 28 days,' says Julian Stainton, managing director. It now takes one
person only four days. This includes reviewing the medical history, setting
up the policy and arranging to collect the money from the customer's bank
account.
In addition, the file was only worked on for 45 minutes during the 28 days
(the rest of the time it was in transit). Now it is held on a computer and
takes just minutes to be processed.
Like many companies which opt for business process redesign, WPA uses a
combination of image processing and workflow software to speed up re-
engineered procedures. Image processing involves capturing a complete image
of a document (including signatures and graphics) on a computer. Workflow
software automatically forwards the document image on to the relevant worker
when it is time for the next action to be carried out.
BPR is gaining respect as companies look for new ways of raising
productivity and cutting costs. Delegates to a recent conference on the
subject attracted companies such as BP, Thomas Cook, Abbey National, Glaxo,
and Midland Bank. According to US researchers International Data Corporation
(IDC), BPR will be 'the next high-growth frontier for information technology
service companies,' with a compound annual growth rate of 46 per cent a
year.
One attraction of BPR is that it makes IT subordinate to business
objectives. 'The most mature processes take a lot of IT investment to
improve, but in most cases 80 per cent of the value of BPR comes out of
examining the way things are organised. Only 20 per cent comes from IT,'
says Paul Chapman, director of business and organisation at the National &amp;
Provincial building society.
BPR often evolves out of a 'total quality management' initiative. Rank
Xerox, a UK pioneer in business process redesign, took TQM as far as it
could but found that it still was not meeting customer needs. Rob Walker,
Rank Xerox's director of business management systems and quality, started to
apply techniques similar to BPR which he had come across in Japan in the
1980s.
As a result, many of the company's processes now take substantially less
time. Specialised individual contracts (for customers requiring, say,
special payment or leasing terms) take less than two days to process instead
of 100.
George Newman, IDC's US director of services research, estimates that the
worldwide market for BPR will be worth Dollars 2.2bn by 1996. 'BPR is the
high ground where the expertise of IT supplier, management and consultancies
overlap,' he says.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Accountancy Column: Green accounting and competitive
advantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING IS fast turning into the season for corporate reporting awards. Hot
on the heels of last month's Stock Exchange and joint chartered accountancy
institutes' annual award for published accounts comes an ecological
equivalent that companies ignore at their peril.
If the green bandwagon is beginning to creak from a surfeit of initiatives
of dubious quality, the 1991 environmental reporting awards sponsored by the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants deserves at least a little
attention as an attempt to cut through the hype.
There was a certain air of inevitability about the ceremony last Tuesday
evening. The venue was the Whale Hall of the Natural History Museum in
London. The individual making the presentation was Professor David Bellamy,
while the two companies receiving the joint award - Norsk Hydro and British
Airways - were names familiar to those with much knowledge of corporate
innovation on environmental issues.
Lessons to be learnt on the quality of environmental reporting exhibited by
companies and how best to assess that information should be important
elements in future debates about company reporting. It is time to inject
some rigour into green reporting.
While the judges of the published accounts award in late February found
themselves unable to identify smaller company reports of sufficiently high
quality to earn a prize, their counterparts assessing environmental
reporting could not even find many candidates to consider. The total number
of entries - including some which were entreated - was only 18. The number
of companies venturing into the green arena is, without doubt, still
relatively small. An international survey conducted by Clare Roberts at the
University of Glasgow in 1990 suggested that only 13 per cent disclosed
environmental information.
That proportion is growing fast, however. Professor Rob Gray, one of the
pioneers of 'green accountancy' and one of the judges of the award,
estimates that at least two-fifths of the top 500 British companies now
include some form of environmental statement as part of their annual
reporting process.
Mr Roger Adams, technical and research director at the Chartered Association
of Certified Accountants, argues that pressure for greater disclosure is
being driven by both strong accounting pressures - as expenditures such as
environmental clean-up become significant - and by legislation passed as a
political response to growing ecological awareness.
Mr Andrew Blaza, director of the environmental management unit at the
Confederation of British Industry and another of the judges, says that
competitive advantage is the drive towards environmental disclosure. 'It has
to be commercially-driven,' he says. 'I am saying to companies that if they
want to be first, they had better hurry up.'
The accuracy and usefulness of the green data provided is developing rather
more slowly, however. Gray highlights a number of weaknesses to existing
statements. 'They are often parcelled up very much in a public relations way
that owes more to advertising than accountability,' he says. 'We often
wondered if we were really just looking at advertising.'
He cites Body Shop as an example. 'They are very green by normal standards,
but their reporting is PR-driven. It doesn't get down to what they actually
do.' Many companies have tended to concentrate on peripheral activities and
do not scrutinise the environmental impact of the core operations of a
company, he says.
An analysis last summer of 670 UK companies by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of company accounts, showed that
only 10 per cent mentioned the environment and only 3 per cent provided a
separate statement on the subject. 'The majority of disclosures are of such
a low level as to be virtually meaningless,' it said.
As last year's survey of UK financial reporting from the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales illustrated, brief paragraphs
such as that in the 1989 accounts of Evered are not uncommon. It states
simply: 'The company is committed to taking responsibility for the
environment in which it operates. This policy manifests itself through
working closely with residents and local government groups.'
The problems in no way reflect poorly on the two companies which won the
environmental reporting awards this week. 'British Airways and Norsk Hydro
chose themselves,' says Gray. 'They were so far ahead of the UK field.'
He highlights a number of characteristics which singled out the winners.
Both concentrated their environmental reporting on core business areas,
approached the subject systematically, and gave data which allowed for
comparisons and could be audited. They also employed an external consultant
to verify the information provided.
Neither simply published flattering information. 'The charm is they they
didn't pull their punches,' says Gray. 'There was a lot of bad as well as
good. Nobody's going to believe a squeaky clean approach.'
Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest quoted company, first produced an
environmental report three years ago, which was widely circulated within the
country, including to every resident within three miles of all the company's
sites. It followed up with a 28-page report covering its UK activities,
published in late 1990. It shows trends over several years on topics such
emissions, discharges, industrial accidents and energy consumption.
BA produced a 100-page environmental review last year, which examined the
impact of its activities at Heathrow airport, including trends in aircraft
noise exposure, fuel consumption and emissions.
The acid test, Gray believes, is whether the two companies will repeat their
assessments. Bitter experience in the past has suggested that fear of
attracting criticism has detracted even those companies which have published
information from repeating the exercise.
Mr Charles Duff, corporate development manager for Norsk Hydro in the UK,
says there are discussions to produce an up-dated version of the UK report,
perhaps next year. More significantly, he says the company is considering
including a detailed environmental statement with its annual report and
accounts, which would include 'real pound-note numbers'.
Dr Hugh Somerville, BA's head of environment, says it is producing a report
analysing the company's activities at Manchester airport this year. Next
year there are plans to do the same at Gatwick and to assess the impact of
its holiday business.
BA is also seriously considering producing an annual environmental
statement, containing a numerical assessment of the business under six
headings: noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement
in the community. The first one is due out this summer.
The challenge for the future is to convert these first tentative examples of
good environmental reporting into a series of more detailed standards. How
far meaningful and comparable information can be coerced from the majority
of companies without legislation is questionable. But without greater
rigour, the mass of green data now being generated is probably not worth the
recycled paper on which it is printed.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Old Joe is giving doctors
the hump - Controversy over Camel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Old Joe Camel, the suave cartoon dromedary who has been credited with
reviving a cigarette brand, about to become a victim of his own success?
The US medical profession certainly hopes so. It hates him with a vengeance
 -so much so, that the US Surgeon General called this month for a voluntary
withdrawal of all 'Old Joe' advertising for Camel cigarettes. Old Joe's
problem, according to the medical lobby, is that children like him too much.
The furore says a lot about the tobacco advertising controversy in the US.
While Europe flirts with a comprehensive ban on tobacco ads, anti-smoking
campaigners on the other side of the Atlantic have settled down to a war of
attrition.
In some areas, particularly at state level, there have been well-publicised
successes. Californians, for example, voted in 1988 to increase tobacco
taxes and devote some of these revenues to anti-smoking promotions,
including advertising. More generally, US cigarette consumption has been in
steady decline - about 2 per cent a year - a trend which is usually
attributed to better publicity of the health issues.
But if there is one area where the industry and the anti-smoking lobbyists
still clash with particular passion, it is over promotions which allegedly
target 'vulnerable' consumers - ethnic groups and adolescents, in
particular.
No campaign has been more controversial than 'Old Joe'. The Camel trademark
is owned by RJ Reynolds, the number two tobacco manufacturer. Like many
full-priced brands, it had been losing ground both to aggressive rivals and
cheaper cigarettes. According to RJR, Camel's domestic market share in the
mid-1980s stood at about 4.4 per cent.
In 1987, however, the company decided to revamp a highly-stylised Camel
campaign which was originally devised in France a decade earlier. It had
featured a cartoon camel and preached a 'smooth character' message.
Soon, Joe with his protruding snout - suspiciously phallic, said the critics
 -appeared on a massive billboard in New York's Times Square. The cartoon
camel began to feature in print ads and on other promotional material. He
was seen in the company of other partying camels or in suitably luxurious
surroundings. He invariably commanded the scene in cool, macho style.
Last December, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)
published research which suggested that the 'Old Joe' ads were widely
recognised by children, even those as young as three years old. Moreover,
Old Joe was 'far more successful at marketing Camel cigarettes to children
than adults'.
According to JAMA, Joe's influence was evidenced by a sharp rise in the
percentage of children who picked Camel as their preferred brand - 32.8 per
cent in these new samples, compared with 0.5 per cent in surveys completed
before the Old Joe campaign began.
R. J. Reynolds' response was speedy and emphatic. It claimed that its own
studies (backed up by Office of Smoking and Health data) showed that 98 per
cent of Camel sales went to smokers of 18-plus.
It denied any interest in encouraging 'youth' smoking - not least, because
of the potential backlash which this could provoke. And it noted that while
the 'Old Joe' campaign had successfully stabilised Camel's overall market
share, it had done little to increase it. But it may not be the only US
tobacco company affected by the controversy. Brown &amp; Williamson, which is
owned by Britain's BAT Industries, is currently test-marketing two new
campaigns for its Kool brand.
The Ohio tests are said to involve traditional 'life-style' type
advertising, while the Virginia tests centre on Willie, a savvy cartoon
penguin. B&amp;W says the Virginia results are 'very positive, with the penguin
considered an adult symbol'. Nevertheless, after Old Joe's bumpy experience,
Willie's owners must at least pause for thought.
Nor are tobacco companies the only targets within the Surgeon General's and
American Medical Association's sights. Lonnie Bristow, an AMA trustee,
concedes that pleas for voluntary withdrawal of the cartoon camel are also
aimed at providers of advertising space and at cigarette retailers who use
promotional material.
Whether the anti-smoking lobby will prevail is equally debatable. RJ
Reynolds, not surprisingly, denies any backlash and suggests that most space
suppliers are firmly wedded to 'free speech' principles. Some evidence seems
to back this up.
New York Telephone, whose booths house 'Old Joe' posters, says that so long
as material is legal and in good taste, it would not discriminate against
any advertiser.
Meanwhile, out on Manhattan's streets, an unscientific straw poll suggests
that, while retailers know all about the 'Old Joe' controversy, keeping a
business afloat weighs more heavily.
'Ninety per cent of kids can recognise Joe Camel, but how many associate him
with cigarettes?' says the man operating a booth on 59th Street. 'Educating
kids about cigarettes is just not our job,' remarked a drugstore manager.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tide may turn as recession bites -
South-East: The question marks over a clutch of Tory marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the rich green fields, the shopping malls and the drive-in Mcdonalds
of southern England, the warm tide of Thatcherism rolled in during the
1980s, bringing prosperity.
Now, for thousands of home counties voters hit by recession, the tide of
wealth has ebbed - placing important question marks over whether the Tories
can hold on to a clutch of marginal seats strung across traditional
Conservative territory.
If Labour is to have any chance of forming the next government, it must
capture at least half a dozen marginal constituencies in the south - places
such as Slough and Swindon, Basildon and Dover, and the two Southampton
seats.
Neil Kinnock's party faces a tough struggle, but Labour has been helped
greatly by the regional pattern of the recession. In contrast to the 1980-81
downturn, high interest rates and sluggish demand have affected the
service-based economy of the south more than heavy industry in the north.
Starting from a much lower base, between February 1990 and January 1992, the
numbers out of work rose 210 per cent in Berkshire, 143 per cent in Essex,
131 per cent in Hampshire and 127 per cent in East Sussex. On Merseyside, by
contrast, the much higher unemployment rate has risen by a relatively modest
17 per cent in the last two years.
In Slough, one of the most crucial marginals where the Conservatives are
defending a 4,090 majority, the business mood is subdued.
Leslie Robinson, head of the Slough Chamber of Commerce, says job losses
have been felt across the board, from engineering to financial services,
although he sees glimmerings of an upturn in a recent pick-up in local order
books.
Mr Robinson says of the Conservatives: 'They are fighting an uphill battle.
They banked on being able to demonstrate quite clearly that the economy was
out of recession. But we don't see that. To some extent, that has left them
exposed.'
John Watts, a jovial accountant who took the seat for the Tories in 1983,
says he is confident of winning with a reduced majority. Eddie Lopez, his
Labour challenger, claims that early opinion polling puts his party ahead
with a double digit percentage lead.
These are still, of course, early days. Speaking of the many who are still
undecided, Mr Watts says: 'There are a lot of people who voted Tory last
time, and whose instincts are still Tory. We have to convince them that they
should follow their instincts.' He admits, however, that 'errors of
judgment' in the government's handling of the late 1980s boom have made the
pain worse. With a mortgage of Pounds 145,000 taken out near the interest
rate trough in 1988, Mr Watts says he, too, is feeling the squeeze.
In Southampton, John Denham, Labour candidate for the Itchen constituency,
says concern over unemployment, housing repossessions and falling incomes
have given Labour an early campaign lead.
Mr Denham, a 38-year old consultant, claims: 'A large number of people who
voted Tory last time have now come over to us.' Speaking of rising debt
problems for individuals and small businesses, Mr Denham says: 'A lot of
people are no longer secure. They feel betrayed.'
James Hill, Conservative MP for Southampton Test since 1979, defending a
7,000 majority, is confident of holding the seat. But, in a sign of the
Tories' overall defensiveness, he says additional economic turbulence caused
by the last few months of uncertainty over the election date has made him a
supporter of fixed-term parliaments.
Peter Beebe, director-general of the Southampton Chamber of Commerce, says a
'cold draught' has blown up the Solent. High interest rates to beat
inflation have exacted an 'enormous price'.
'It has curtailed investment, driven away consumer confidence and frightened
people from spending money, let alone borrowing it,' Mr Beebe says.
Local business fears that a Labour government might lead to 'high and
destructive taxation'.
But Mr Beebe says that the pragmatic Labour-controlled Southampton council -
from which both Mr Denham and Alan Whitehead, the Labour candidate for
Southampton Test, are drawn - is a good example of how a 'sensibly moderate'
Labour administration might work nation-ally.
In another 1980s boom town, Swindon - where Labour, as in Slough, needs a 4
per cent swing to unseat the Conservatives - the downturn has raised the
spirits of the opposition.
Jim d'Avila, the Labour candidate who is chairman of the local council's
economic development committee, says: 'People are suffering and feel
threatened. They're frightened that they may be next.'
The Conservatives' task across the Tory heartlands is to focus on a
different set of voters' fears: the uncertainties associated with a
prospective Labour government.
But the party will have to make a double effort to convince people like Ian
Devine, the hard-hit proprietor of a Southampton pine furniture shop, that
it is worth sticking with the Tories.
Mr Devine, who has had the 'sale' posters in the window ever since he opened
his shop a year ago, says he was 'forced' into setting up his own business
after being made unemployed.
'People are hanging on to their money. They don't want to spend it,' says Mr
Devine gloomily. 'It will be a very close election.'

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Big guns open fire on rogue candidate -
Winchester: The war of words in Wessex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the Tory party equivalent of sending a gunboat down the Itchen. Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday waded into the fray over the
two Conservative candidates for Winchester by calling for the withdrawal of
Mr John Browne, the renegade MP who is standing for re-election to the
Wessex capital.
Touring the damp city pedestrian precinct yesterday, Mr Hurd said Mr
Browne's candidature was causing 'complications' and advised him to stand
down. It was the same reasonable tone with which Mr Hurd has dealt in the
past with Saddam Hussein.
Mr Hurd was brought in to support the official Conservative candidate, Mr
Gerald Malone, a 40-year old Glaswegian solicitor. The former Tory MP for
Aberdeen South was selected as the official candidate after Mr Browne, in
trouble for failing to disclose business interests, was disowned by the
party, both locally and nationally.
The imbroglio has increased the Liberal Democrats' hopes of winning the
seat. Their candidate - Mr Tony Barron, an energetic 50-year old quantity
surveyor - yesterday predicted he would clinch a wafer-thin majority. 'I
don't care if they put up 20 Tory candidates, I'll still win,' he quipped.
With Winchester showing one of the largest unemployment rises in Hampshire
during the past two years, Mr Barron said the 'feel-lousy factor' was aiding
his cause.
Speaking in the Conservative Association offices above an estate agent, Mr
Malone said he was confident of a 10,000-11,000 majority. In 1987, Mr Browne
 -the MP since 1979  - won with a reduced 7,400 margin ahead of the Social
Democrats.
Mr Malone is benefiting from Central Office heavy artillery to show Tory
voters that he, and not Mr Browne, is the one to back. Mr Tom King, the
defence secretary, comes to Winchester today.
Of Mr Browne, Mr Malone said: 'He is trying to convince people that he is
the real brand of Omo, and I'm the biological version.' He predicted his
rival would reap a 'derisory' vote.
'The people in this election will be voting very seriously . . . They will
not be distracted by the diversion of an independent,' Mr Malone said.
Mr Browne has other ideas. Ensconced in the Winchester Conservative Club,
the nondescript building smelling of fried food which is his campaign
headquarters, Mr Browne forecast he would lose only about 20 per cent of the
32,000 votes he won in 1987.
Assisted by his American wife, who calls their campaign van the 'Jomobile',
Mr Browne says he is representing constituents' best interests by refusing
to bow to the local party's wish to unseat him. 'I have been fixed as a
scapegoat. They have now leapt on my back as a troublesome person.' He
accused the Tories of using methods to discredit him which would make the
KGB blush.
Watching Mr Hurd perform outside the local shops yesterday, Mrs Felicity
Hindson, chairman of the local Conservative Association, sighed: 'A lot of
people have been very annoyed about this.'
The Conservatives will be even more annoyed if this true-blue bastion
totters.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Northern Ireland - Disturbing the peace of
Ulster's 'Gold Coast': A four-way battle with crucial implications amid the
golf courses of the North Down seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORTH DOWN con-stituency in Northern Ireland is like no other in the
province.
Here is the 'Gold Coast' commuter belt of Northern Ireland, where a dozen
golf courses and the ubiquitous two-car garages, horse-boxes and
boat-trailers define the lifestyle of the business executives and senior
civil servants who run the province.
The buzz of lawnmowers and chatter of birdsong are all that are likely to
intrude upon the silence, not the blast of Semtex or bursts of gunfire -
even though the Falls and Shankill roads of Belfast are just 15 minutes'
drive away.
But North Down is about to become the most hotly contested seat in the
Northern Ireland general election campaign. Mr Jim Kilfedder, an independent
Unionist and MP for 22 years, is defending a 3,900 majority against a
three-pronged assault - from another Unionist, the Conservative party and
the non-sectarian Alliance Party. The nationalist SDLP does not normally
stand in North Down, as it has little local support. This is one of only
four Ulster seats it is not fighting.
The outcome will have little influence on the overall election result, but
could have a crucial bearing on the future of Northern Ireland politics.
The campaign is not being fought on tax cuts or government spending. All the
candidates agree it is being fought over the future form of government for
Northern Ireland.
The Conservative party is for the first time mounting a concerted challenge
to the Unionists, fielding candidates in 11 of the province's 17
constituencies. North Down, which would be a 'natural' Tory seat anywhere in
England, is where they stand the most chance of success.
Mr Laurence Kennedy, the Conservative candidate and the party's leader in
the province, says: 'Unionism and nationalism is responsible for so much
that has gone wrong in Northern Ireland.'
But all is not well in the Tory camp - the Conservative government, through
the Anglo-Irish agreement, is committed to an eventual devolved government
in Ulster; the Northern Ireland Conservatives are not.
'Conservative policy on Northern Ireland is very non-specific,' says Mr
Kennedy. 'We want the province governed in a similar way to the rest of the
UK, with stronger local authorities and more attention paid to Northern
Ireland at Westminster.'
Local authorities in Ulster 'currently only have powers to supervise rubbish
collection, playgrounds and to bury the dead'. Greater powers, he says, will
create the opportunity for the minority nationalists to exercise greater
influence.
Mr Kennedy is disappointed that Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland
secretary, 'has not come out and said that people here should join and
support the Conservatives'. It is doubtful that any senior ministers will be
showing the flag in North Down during the campaign.
This weakness in Mr Kennedy's campaign is being exploited by his opponents.
Mr Kilfedder claims that more than 80 prominent Tory figures have written to
him declaring their support. In the event of a hung parliament, there is no
doubt where his allegiance will lie: 'I will be voting with John Major.'
Mr Kilfedder's crypto-conservatism is exploited by traditional Unionists.
For the first time since he won his seat in 1970, he is being challenged by
a Unionist - Mr Denny Vitty of the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist
Party.
Mr Vitty describes both Mr Kennedy and Mr Kilfedder as 'wolves in sheep's
clothing'. He says: 'They cannot stand on both sides of the fence. They
cannot be true Unionists as well as Conservatives.'
His campaign will focus on the Unionist goal of ending the Anglo-Irish
agreement. 'We will use the opportunity of a hung parliament to negotiate
from a position of strength,' he says.'
He believes that the maverick Mr Kilfedder, who split from the Ulster
Unionist Party in the mid 1970s over his refusal to take the whip on a range
of policy issues, will not win hard-core Unionist support. He is confident
that the 5,000 new voters in the Protestant middle-class and working-class
housing estates that have sprung up in North Down in the past five years
will vote for back him.
Mr Addie Morrow, the Alliance candidate, hopes the divisions in the
Conservative and Unionist ranks and the failure of either tradition to
resolve Ulster's problems will create space for his party with its liberal,
non-sectarian profile, to win its first Westminster seat.
'If we can achieve a breakthrough it will change the whole face of Northern
Ireland,' he says. His party stands for a devolved administration in Ulster
and power-sharing between the two communities.
Whether an independent such as Mr Kilfedder can rely on his personal
popularity to survive remains to be seen. At his seaside home in Bangor a
portrait of Queen Victoria hangs on one wall. Framed pictures of the British
and Irish parliaments hang on opposing walls in another room.
Contemplating the multiple challenge to his seat, Mr Kilfedder looks out at
the small harbour in front of his house and laments he does not have time to
go boating. 'I don't even play golf,' he confesses.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Firepower sought for future
attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives' immed-iate attack on Labour's manifesto was in the form
of a new poster, showing a red-covered document called 'Labour manifesto'
dropping on a doormat beneath the slogan 'Oh no, it's a tax demand.'
Unveiling the poster, which will be on display at 3,000 sites across the
country, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, called Labour's plans a
'millstone mani-festo'.
'It charts the failures of the past, not the opportunities of the future . .
. out of touch, out of date and out of order,' he said.
For Labour, the main thrust of attack on the Tories' manifesto will be the
idea of 'same-again Conservatives' expressed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour
leader, and the claim that the document does not address the current
economic difficulties.
'It is old, it is the rehashing of policies that have already failed,' Mr
Kinnock said, calling the manifesto 'an excuse for the past'.
'There are a few policies that have been lifted from Labour's proposals but
there is nothing in there to get the economy going', Mr Kinnock added.
Each of the two main parties, however, will also use particular elements of
its opponent's manifesto for ammunition in the days ahead.
Each party must have been slightly relieved that there were few surprises in
the other's plans, and is already saying that the other has produced no new
ideas, and has failed to close off damaging lines of attack.
'Few foxes have been shot,' was the comment from one Tory aide.
Two specific areas already highlighted for targetting by Tory officials,
beyond the cost of Labour's programme, are the future of privatised
industries and Labour's defence policy.
Even without the scope for confusion between 'public control' and 'public
ownership' of the water industry and the national grid, the Conservatives
will exploit the increased regulation planned.
They will claim that this could extend to other privatised utilities,
hitting share prices.
As for defence, the Tories are confident that the Labour manifesto's broad
commitment to keeping nuclear weapons and providing 'whatever resources are
needed' for conventional defence will not last the campaign.
For its part, Labour will target the Tories' commitment to further
privatisation in British Coal and in British Rail, and the continuing
commitment to the national health service reforms.
Otherwise, it is the absences that will feature in Labour's attack.
Chief among these will be the failure to rule out a broadening of the base
for value added tax - a claim that Labour has made consistently over recent
months.
The party will also highlight the lack of a Conservative programme of
constitutional reform, and of a policy for industry.

RELOCATION of a civil service unit from London to Aberdeen, leading to the
creation of a European oil industry centre, will be promised in today's
Scottish Conservative manifesto, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary said
yesterday.
The plan involves about 80 civil servants from the Department of Energy's
Exploration and Development Appraisal Unit, which negotiates and approves
oilfield developments. It is calculated that this could save the government
Pounds 7m.
Mr Neil Kinnock has said relocation would be a certainty under Labour. The
Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats also back the idea.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Labour focuses on Scottish
parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE setting up of a Scottish parliament within 22 months of the election of
a Labour government is the centrepiece of the party's Scottish manifesto,
launched by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, in Edinburgh
yesterday, James Buxton writes.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said the Scottish parliament
would be able to legislate for local government, health, housing, transport
and the environment, and would have powers over industrial development.
It would also have the power to 'adjust basic rates of income tax'. Labour
has said in the past that the discretion would be limited to 3p up or down.
The manifesto confirmed that the Scottish parliament would be elected by the
additional-member system of proportional representation. Labour officials
say they envisage an assembly of little more than 100 members, with one
member for each of the existing 72 Scottish constituencies topped up by
members elected from party lists.
Local government would be reduced to a single tier, with the number of local
authorities left up to the parliament.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development
bodies, would set up their own investment banking divisions, working with
Labour's National Investment Bank. A new body named Scottish Exports
International would promote Scottish products abroad.

The gap between stocks that might gain from a Labour victory and those that

stand to lose from Labour's policies - for example the water utilities -
weakened noticeably after the Labour manifesto was published. They show up
in the 'Conservative gainers' portion of the index, which dropped by over 2
per cent, twice as much as the FT-SE index. Conservative gainers are now
four per cent below closing prices on the day the election was announced.

Aldershot Football Club, which has debts estimated at Pounds 1.2m, was
compulsorily wound up in the High Court yesterday in spite of a plea that an
unnamed rescuer was prepared to buy the club and pay off its immediate debts
of Pounds 125,000.
Mr Registrar Buckley made a winding-up order on a petition by the Inland
Revenue, a creditor for Pounds 92,897 in unpaid tax and national insurance.
Mr Mike Davey, the club's chairman, and Mr Colin Hancock, former chairman,
said they would discuss the possibility of an appeal. Mr Davey said: 'We are
still hoping to save the club.' The club survived three winding-up moves in
the late 1980s.
A petition to wind up Barnet Football Club was adjourned for six weeks
yesterday to give the club time to pay off its debts. The court had been
told that the club had paid Pounds 60,000 of the petitioning trade
creditor's Pounds 193,000 debt and expected to pay the balance by April 10.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Half of extra jobs 'have been lost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST half the jobs created between 1983 and 1990 were lost in the 15
months of recession up to the third quarter of 1991, according to Mr John
MacInnes of Glasgow University in a paper on the north-south divide.
Mr MacInnes says that in spite of the faster rise in unemployment in the
south in the latest recession the south has almost 750,000 more people in
work now than in 1979 compared with 500,000 fewer in the north. The north
has lost fewer jobs in the current recession because it had less new
employment created in the boom.
He also says that governments in the 1970s created more jobs than the
deregulating government of the 1980s, even including the large increase in
self-employment.
Several other reports on unemployment were published yesterday to coincide
with today's publication of the February unemployment figures:
A survey by Alfred Marks, the recruitment consultants, indicates that 55.4
per cent of companies have made staff cuts in the past two years while only
26.7 per cent have reported an increase in staffing levels. Clerical staff
have been the hardest hit.
The Campaign for Work argues in a paper from Professor David Piachaud that
permanent unemployment of 2.5m or more in the 1990s will worsen social
divisions and exacerbate the development of an underclass.
The AEU engineering union yesterday said it had identified 33,000 job loses
in manufacturing industry in the current year, representing a quickening of
the rate of unemployment compared with the last quarter 1991.
The Trade Union Congress yesterday published a report drawing attention to
the fact that the government's own labour force survey has estimated
unemployment to be 220,000 higher than the official statistics.
It adds that in certain regions - the west Midlands, East Anglia and the
south-west - unemployment would be 20 per cent higher using the labour-force
survey definition.
The least-affected job categories were visual display unit and word
processor operators (7.4 per cent) and computer system staff (8.5 per cent).
The most frequent method employed by companies to decrease staffing was
natural wastage, although two thirds made enforced redundancies.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Fed banks see improved economy: Beige Book survey reports
little upward pressure on prices

MOST Federal Reserve system banks see an improving US economy with little
upward pressure on prices, according to the Fed's latest survey of economic
conditions, known as the Beige Book, Reuter reports from Washington.
'Most Federal Reserve districts report some improvement in economic
conditions,' said the report, prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis. More house building and rising new car and other retail sales
were most often mentioned.
'Business sentiment is described as modestly more optimistic in many parts
of the country, though it remains cautious,' the survey said.
'There are few indications of significant upward pressure on retail and
wholesale prices of goods,' the Fed report said.
The Fed reports are issued at roughly six-week intervals. The latest one
sets the most optimistic tone since last summer about the economy's
prospects.
It says manufacturing remains flat with many districts reporting layoffs and
rising unemployment. 'Yet several districts report glimmerings of recovery
in manufacturing, with improving expectations for future activity.'
Bank loan demand 'is best described as flat', though home mortgage lending
was often mentioned as a bright spot. 'Mortgage refinancing activity appears
to be tapering off somewhat.'
Wage and price pressures 'appear generally quite moderate,' the report said,
though some mentioned lumber prices were rising because of more building and
restricted supplies.
Consumers were becoming more active. 'Most Federal Reserve districts report
some improvement in retail sales so far and guarded optimism on the part of
merchandisers.'
New car sales were reported to be rising modestly in Boston, Philadelphia,
Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The
only district where car sales were falling was Dallas, the Fed said.
But prospects for manufacturing industries remain mixed, with New York,
Minneapolis and San Francisco Fed banks reporting continuing layoffs and
rising unemployment rates. Although, in Philadelphia, Dallas and Richmond,
Virginia, there were modest rises in shipments or production rates.
Richmond and Kansas City said inventories were still falling, but Cleveland
said liquidation may have ended.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCUMBENCY may be losing its electoral advantage this year, on the evidence
of Tuesday's Democratic primary elections in Illinois.
Mr Alan Dixon, the two term senator and quintessential Washington insider,
was upset by Ms Carol Mosely Braun, the Cook County recorder of deeds. If
she wins in November, she would be the first black woman ever elected to the
Senate.
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, survived a primary challenge, but was held to under 60 per cent
of the vote for the first time in a generation.
Two prominent black congressmen from Chicago, Mr Gus Savage and Mr Charles
Hayes, were also thrown out.
Mr Savage has long been notorious for playing the racial card most
aggressively and, true to form, he blamed his defeat on 'the white racist
press and the racist reactionary Jewish misleaders.' Mr Hayes has emerged as
one of the biggest abusers of the House bank overdraft facility, bouncing
over 700 cheques.
But the message of their defeats was complicated by districts which had been
redrawn and by the fact that both lost to well known local black
politicians.
Mr Mel Reynolds, a former Rhodes Scholar who beat Mr Savage easily, may have
profited from being shot at last Thursday night. Mr Bobby Rush, a former
black panther and Mr Hayes's conqueror, was already a city alderman.
At a national level, the most interesting message from the Dixon defeat in a
three way race was the extent to which white suburban women joined with
blacks in preferring Ms Braun because of Mr Dixon's vote to confirm Judge
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court last year after the allegations that he
had sexually harassed Ms Anita Hill, the university law professor

FT  19 MAR 92 / Jerry Brown takes up protest vote baton: New voice of
national alienation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if 1992's baton of political protest is changing hands. As, bit
by bit, Mr Patrick Buchanan's Republican challenge to President George Bush
fades, so that of Mr Jerry Brown to the Democratic frontrunner, Mr Bill
Clinton, gathers steam.
Election night in Illinois and Michigan saw Mr Brown, the former governor of
California, promising 'to win the soul' of the Democratic Party back from
the 'decrepit' and 'corrupt power elite'. His mission, he declared, was
Jeffersonian, to ensure that a privileged few did not grow fat off the
labours of the many.
This is pretty much what Mr Buchanan has been saying all year on his
conservative crusade - which now seems on the wane, albeit with lots of
brave talk of the great battle to come in 1996. The question is whether Mr
Brown on more or less the left will have any more luck than Mr Buchanan did
on the right.
There is a lot of truth to Mr Clinton's charge in their stormy debate
confrontation last Sunday night that Mr Brown 'reinvents himself every year
or two'. It certainly is the case that in 1976, when governor of California,
he donned the clothes of the establishment to try and stop another
southerner, Jimmy Carter, winning the nomination: precisely the reverse of
his position today.
There is also a tendency to remember Mr Brown as 'Governor Moonbeam', which
roughly translates as a soft-centred, sometime visionary. This was
reinforced in the 1980s by his sojourn with Mother Theresa in Calcutta and
his study of Zen in Japan.
This year's reality is completely different. He has proved opportunistic,
sensing a national alienation in need of a voice; he is totally
unscrupulous, as the Sunday debate showed, willing to play fast and loose
with the facts and wildly misquoting the Washington Post article on Hillary
Clinton's Arkansas law firm in order to drag Mr Clinton down; and, not
unlike Mr Buchanan, he sounds like a xenophobe.
Thus he constantly inveighs against the export of jobs to Mexico, to the
point that his occasional qualifiers that he has nothing against Mexico per
se get lost in the wash. He would leave only 1,000 US troops in Europe,
cynically adding that a like number of European troops should be stationed
in the US as 'exchange students'. Any attempt to discuss aid to the former
Soviet Union is instantly reduced by Mr Brown into the greater need to
create jobs at home.
His family is intensely political: his father preceded Ronald Reagan as
governor of California and his sister, Kathleen, is currently state
treasurer. His political genes have clearly taught him to do whatever is
necessary to win.
His grab-bag of policy positions, often little more than slogans, strike a
certain chord in an uncertain country, and did so with a vengeance in
Michigan on Tuesday. Flat rates of tax, environmental activism, enterprise
zones, public works on a grand scale, disengagement from most things
foreign, have the beauty of simplicity.
As the opponents of Mr Clinton have fallen by the wayside, and with Mr Paul
Tsongas now barely competitive, Mr Brown has forced himself into the
Democratic Party's considerations. Party leaders want him to go away, just
as the Republican hierarchy has been urging Mr Buchanan to give up, because
they know he is also not electable in November. They certainly do not want
him to be the beneficiary of any subsequent scandal that really engulfs Mr
Clinton. This is why Mr Tsongas, faute de mieux, will be privately urged to
stay in the race.
But his messianic perversity could see Mr Brown taking his insurgent troops
with him on a third party candidacy in the election proper, as John Anderson
did in 1980; or, almost as bad, that he will not be reconciled with the
nominee, particularly if it is Mr Clinton, and keep them at home. He lifted
few fingers for Jimmy Carter in 1976 and California, of which he was then
Democratic governor, voted Republican.
Yet the hard facts of primary politics, which Mr Brown sometimes does
acknowledge, could also leave him with only the same alienated share of his
party that Mr Buchanan commands among Republicans. He could do well in
Connecticut next Tuesday and in New York two weeks later, while Wisconsin,
which also votes on April 7, has been notoriously fickle in the past. But
the increasingly impressive Clinton machine will now take some stopping.
If it is derailed, it will be because of another 'character' controversy. Mr
Tsongas, a decent man, will not have the taste to exploit it ruthlessly, but
Mr Brown would.

FT  19 MAR 92 / BCCI investigator calls on Bush to sack campaign deputy
manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR member of Congress investigating the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI) affair yesterday called on President George Bush to
sack Mr James Lake, the deputy manager of the Bush re-election campaign,
Alan Friedman reports from New York.
Mr Lake also serves as US public relations adviser to the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority, one of the key investment vehicles used by Sheikh
Zayed Sultan Nahyan to hold majority control of BCCI.
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who has led the US Congress's
investigation of the BCCI affair, said: 'I have to question the propriety of
the President of the United States' campaign being managed by someone who is
simultaneously being paid over Dollars 200,000 every three months to
represent BCCI's biggest shareholder.'
Mr Kerry, who held a BCCI hearing yesterday, said he did not know what
services Mr Lake was providing to Abu Dhabi, but he said there was 'an
appearance of impropriety here' and called on Mr Bush to ask Mr Lake to
resign his position in the Bush campaign immediately.
As a precedent, the Senator cited the example of Mr Ed Rogers, the former
deputy to Mr John Sununu, former White House chief of staff. President Bush
moved to distance himself from Mr Rogers last October when it emerged that
the former Sununu aide had accepted a Dollars 600,000 contract to represent
Sheikh Kemal Adham, the former head of Saudi intelligence and a key figure
in the BCCI affair.
'To be blunt, Mr Lake should not be sitting in on White House campaign
strategy meetings while he is also providing strategy to Sheikh Zayed on how
to deal with problems arising out of his ownership of BCCI.'
Senator Kerry said his committee had not drawn any conclusions about Sheikh
Zayed's role in the BCCI affair.
Mr Mark Helmke, a deputy to Mr Lake, confirmed that the public relations
firm of Robinson, Lake, Lehrer and Montgomery is a registered foreign agent
for the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and has advised Abu Dhabi on how to
deal with the US media on BCCI-related issues.
Mr Helmke said that Mr Lake's Abu Dhabi connection was reviewed by Mr Boyden
Gray, the White House counsel, and was considered to be irrelevant before Mr
Lake was named to the Bush campaign two months ago.
Mrs Linda Robinson, the president of Robinson, Lake who is married to Mr Jim
Robinson, chairman of American Express, said through a spokesperson that the
Abu Dhabi relationship was handled through the firm's Washington office.

FT  19 MAR 92 / South African Referendum: Hope at last for a peace
throughout southern Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE almost tangible sense of relief that gripped South Africa yesterday will
be felt well beyond the country's borders.
The white electorate's ringing endorsement of President F W de Klerk's
search for a negotiated settlement has as many implications for a long
suffering region as it does for South Africans themselves.
After three decades of conflict, costing hundreds of thousands of lives and
causing incalculable material damage, southern Africa can hope that peace
is, at long last, at hand.
Not all the trials and tribulations of the states of the region can be laid
at apartheid's door. Mismanagement and incorrect policies have contributed
to their predicament.
But just as the region's wars have been the single most damaging factor, so
a regional peace and a stable, friendly post-apartheid South Africa will be
the single most important factor in their efforts to revive often shattered
economies.
Like a malign, irascible, unpredictable giant, apartheid has dominated
southern Africa, first propping up minority white governments, later
cajoling, coercing or cudgelling black-ruled neighbours into submission.
From Angola on the western seaboard to Mozambique in the west, not a country
escaped the tactics of Pretoria, sometimes brutal, sometimes misleadingly
benign.
Mozambique, still battling rebels who not so long ago enjoyed Pretoria's
support, has endured both.
As one arm of the South African government helped Mozambique's rebel Renamo
movement sabotage vital equipment, such as railway rolling stock, the other
arm would be providing help in the form of locomotives from South African
Railways.
'It is like that Marx brothers film,' said one Mozambican official at the
time, 'where one of the characters went down the street throwing bricks into
shop windows, followed by his pal, a glazier who then mends them - for a
price'.
Pretoria's campaign, which only ended when President de Klerk took office
two and half years ago, had two main objectives.
The first was to drive the guerrilla wing of the African National Congress
out of its bases in Angola and Mozambique, and keep them out of Botswana and
Zambia, in an effort to create a cordon sanitaire around South Africa.
The second was to ensure that South Africa controlled the region's routes to
the sea, and direct the bulk of the area's trade through South African
ports.
Mozambique tried in vain to resuscitate what had before independence been an
important source of income - its ports and railways which served the
southern African hinterland of Zimbabwe and Zambia.
Admittedly, the region provided fertile soil for South African intervention.
Support for Dr Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebels fueled Angola's civil war; but
the authoritarian stance of the avowedly Marxist MPLA cost the government
much sympathy.
Southern Africa also had the misfortune to become a focus of super-power
tension, and the battlefield for proxy battles - with the US providing
military assistance to Unita in their war with the MPLA, backed by the
Soviet Union and some 50,000 Cuban troops.
'Southern Africa has had to undergo two wars of independence,' said one
African diplomat recently, looking back on events since 1960.
'The first was seeking to end colonial ties with Britain or Portugal, the
second with South Africa when we became the front line states'.
'The second has been the toughest - being caught up in South Africa's
struggle'.
For Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the first round was costly enough. In
Rhodesia's (now Zimbabwe) guerrilla war of independence over 25,000 lives
were lost.
Angola, like Mozambique, was born into chaos as a coup in Portugal in 1975
saw the collapse of colonial rule and the exodus of hundreds of thousands of
settlers.
But as the African diplomat indicated, the second round of fighting proved
the most devastating for Mozambique and Angola, caught up in civil wars
skilfully exploited by Pretoria.
The final toll of the war in southern Africa will never be known. Directly
or indirectly, whether through war or famine exacerbated by conflict,
hundreds of thousands of people have died.
For these front line countries, trying to sustain fragile ceasefires,
yesterday's referendum will be seen as a critical step in a peace process
that got under way in the late1980s.
Sapped by sanctions, drained by conflict at home, and acknowledging that
apartheid was unworkable, Pretoria ceded independence for Namibia in a deal
that paved the way to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, and the
ending of the country's civil war.
The process is now culminating in the most important development of all,
reaching into the heart of violence in southern Africa: the devastating
giant has taken a fundamental step towards reaching peace at home.

FT  19 MAR 92 / South African Referendum: Vote heralds rapidaccord on
interim government - Timetable to multiracial cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGREEMENT on a multiracial interim government should be achieved rapidly by
South Africa's constitutional negotiating forum, the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa (Codesa).
Codesa has yet to agree and there are many issues still to be negotiated,
but a three-phase plan has already emerged from the bilateral talks between
the two main participants, the government and the African National Congress
(ANC). Their proposal is as follows:
By the end of next month, Codesa could announce an agreement on interim
government. The existing tricameral parliament, which includes separate
houses for whites, coloureds and Indians, must then give the agreement legal
force.
A multiracial Interim Government Council could be established by June,
appointed by the 19 parties and groups represented at Codesa. The council
would likely hold veto powers over the country's existing cabinet, though
this has yet to be agreed. Independent commissions would be established to
oversee the public media and preparations for elections.
Four multi-party committees would oversee foreign affairs, security, local
government and the budget. The tricameral parliament would continue to sit
while multiracial legislative elections were prepared.
By at least mid-1993, elections would be held for a multiracial interim
legislature that would draft a new constitution. The interim legislature
would probably comprise only a single legislative chamber instead of the two
originally insisted on by the currently ruling National Party. Seats would
be allocated by proportional representation, with decisions on the
constitution requiring a two-thirds majority.
By mid-year, the Interim Government Council would be replaced by a new
cabinet representing, on a roughly proportional basis, the parties elected
to the legislature.
The National Party has proposed that parties pass a 15 per cent threshold
for representation in the cabinet, but this, as it would exclude everyone
but the ANC and National Party, will be resisted in Codesa. Cabinet
decisions would be taken by consensus; the National Party wants the
presidency to be held in rotation by different parties.
The new constitution would be agreed by mid-1994. Multi-party power-sharing,
either entrenched in the constitution or agreed informally, would continue
for at least five years, with decisions agreed by consensus. It is not clear
whether there is agreement for a rotating presidency or for a single elected
president.
Regional elections would be held to regional legislatures. The National
Party wants each party represented in the regional assemblies to be
allocated an equal number of seats for that region in the upper house
envisaged for the new national legislature that will follow the interim
arrangements.
This would give minority parties a disproportionately large influence in the
upper house, a measure that has not been agreed by the ANC, which has
assented only to strong regional government.
The National Party hopes that the long period of consensus government will
mean that the consensus principle will survive even after full majority rule
is achieved by the end of the century.

FT  19 MAR 92 / South African Referendum: Business greets spur to growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSMEN in South Africa reacted with jubilation to yesterday's
referendum result which, they said, would help their continued
re-integration into the world business community while improving domestic
growth prospects.
The business community campaigned strongly in favour of a 'yes' vote, with
some companies going as far as to warn employees that the consequences of a
'no' vote would be large-scale retrenchments.
The South African Chamber of Business said yesterday: 'The decisive outcome
of the referendum will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the medium- and
long-term performance of the economy and should lead to any remaining trade
and other sanctions being lifted soon.'
Businessmen cautioned, however, that this was merely the beginning of a
difficult road forward. Mr Tony Norton, president of the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE), said the result 'doesn't guarantee anything. It is merely a
condition precedent for economic progress.'
Financial markets moved sharply upwards in response to the result. The
overall index on the Johannesburg stock exchange rose by 1.2 per cent, and
the industrial index was 1.4 per cent higher.
The financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, closed at R3.71
to the dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of R3.96. Movements of this
currency are a barometer of foreign sentiment.
Mr Richard Jesse, analyst at stockbrokers Martin and Co, said markets had
taken a simple view of the referendum. 'No is bad and Yes is good and the
bigger the Yes the bigger the good.' The result had removed a major source
of uncertainty.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, chairman of the mining house Gencor, said the result
'was a great release of tension because it shows clearly that the
initiatives of the state president have very great support.'
He said the result meant a number of the company's projects, such as the
Columbus stainless steel project and the expansion of the aluminium producer
Alusaf, were now possible. They had been held up because of the lack of
foreign investment and access to foreign markets.
Mr Norton said the result showed people were not only ruled by their hearts;
that in the quiet of the polling booth simple issues like jobs, the value of
their houses and savings, counted more.
Mr Paul Kruger, managing director of Sasol, South Africa's largest fuel and
chemicals company, said the result showed 'a general realisation of the
realities in South Africa. The (white) electorate has now been satisfied
that the state president is not willing to give everything away, that he has
certain economic bottom lines.'
He added 'It also dispels the myth that the process is not irreversible.
There is no reason why any country in the world should continue with
sanctions.'
Mr Norton said he felt a key issue emerging from the referendum was the
strong and competent leadership shown by Mr de Klerk. He thought this, and
the size of the 'yes' vote, would impress foreigners. There was no doubt the
result would boost the country's trade prospects, and prospects for foreign
investment were also enhanced, he said. 'Today was one step closer to when
the notebooks become cheque-books.'

writers look at each country

GERMANY: The exposure of the country's Hermes export credit insurance agency
on contracts with the former Soviet Union amounts to around DM30bn (Pounds
10.4bn).
The government has imposed a ceiling of DM5bn on any further credit
guarantees in the current year. This will be reviewed at the end of March.
Apart from the DM30bn in Hermes exposure, a further DM11bn is outstanding in
untied, government guaranteed credits to the former Soviet republics.
In addition, some DM23bn of export contracts have 'agreement in principle'
for Hermes insurance, if they are realised. A further DM70bn worth of
applications for insurance is in the pipeline.
The immediate cost to the German exchequer of the Soviet payments' crisis is
only DM1bn in the current year - the cost of the debt deferral scheme
negotiated by the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states. That burden is
likely to increase quite rapidly if the payments crisis continues.
UNITED STATES: The Department of Agriculture has been rather more
forthcoming than the Exim bank, where exposure to the risk of non-payment
for contracts with the CIS is thought to be less than Dollars 100m.
The department, committed to aiding US farm exporters, has since 1990
provided credit guarantees amounting to Dollars 3.1bn through the Commodity
Credit Corporation. It insists that no more will be forthcoming until after
repayments start coming in. Another Dollars 650m may soon be allocated.
ITALY: The government, in line with the Paris Club, now regards its exposure
to the CIS as split between that to Russia and the rest of the former Soviet
Union. This is because Mr Yeltsin has given guarantees assuming Russian
obligations, while the situation in the other republics, both legally and
financially, is much more obscure.
Total exposure on this basis at the beginning of January is as follows:
L1,115bn (Pounds 516m) is at risk in Russia; L4,850bn in medium-term and
L713bn in short-term credits is at risk in the rest of the former Soviet
Union.
Payments will technically be in arrears by the end of March. Essentially,
all the above is covered by Sace, the export credit guarantee body. Arrears
at the beginning of January totalled Dollars 500m, none of which was covered
by export credit guarantees.
In addition, the Italian government has agreed L5,000bn of credit lines to
cover trade between 1990-94. This would be backed by Sace, but none has been
drawn down.
Separate from these credit lines is a L2,200bn facility agreed directly by
the Italian Treasury in 1990. Of this, L1,200bn is to cover balance of
payments needs and L1,000bn for arrears. The bulk is going to Russia.
FRANCE: The country's banks were among the fastest growing lenders to the
Soviet Union from the middle-to-late 1980s but have scaled back new loans in
the recent years.
Their exposure fell from FFr54bn (Pounds 5.5bn) at the end of 1989 to
FFr23bn by the middle of 1991, with FFr7.6bn of this guaranteed by Coface,
France's main export credit agency.
The guaranteed portion is political risk, backed by the state. Of the total,
FFr20.8bn is long-term, for seven years or more. The biggest lenders are
BNP, Credit Lyonnais, and Societe Generale.
French banks are pressing the French treasury to declare the former Soviet
Union a 'risk country' - or countries  - so that they can make tax
deductions for their provisions on loans there.
France agreed a FFr2bn credit line last November for the purchase of French
grain. In 1990, it agreed a FFr2.5bn line, again for food purchases. There
was also a FFr5bn official credit line in October 1990 for food, equipment
and loan refinancing.
BRITAIN: The Export Credits Guarantee Department remains coy about the level
of its exposure to the former Soviet Union. Contracts at risk are thought to
amount to just under Pounds 1bn. Prime Minister John Major agreed in January
a new Pounds 280m credit line, but this will be blocked until the CIS agrees
a programme with the IMF, and sovereign guarantors have been identified.

WINNING the world competitiveness race has not brought peace of mind to
Japan, senior executives confess in a survey published today, Frances
Williams reports from Geneva. While Japan's top businessmen say their
country has the edge in technology development strategies and 'values
supporting competitiveness', they rate their quality of life below that in
competitor countries and say the political system needs shaking up.
The survey covered 3,300 top executives in 36 countries. More disparaging of
their quality of life than Japanese were Turkish and Portuguese executives.
The Swiss and Austrians saw their life as the best. The survey was by the
Swiss-based World Economic Forum and the International Institute for
Management Development in Lausanne.

FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC fears Gatt obstacle to farm reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRUSSELS yesterday expressed satisfaction that Chancellor Helmut Kohl will
take up with President George Bush this weekend the farm dispute between the
EC and the US, which has threatened to stall the trade talks under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But it was also concerned
lest a Gatt ruling on soya beans push EC reforms off track.
Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, said he was confident the German
leader's discussions at the White House would 'cover all aspects' of EC
concerns about proposed Gatt farm reforms, and not just the US restraint on
cereal substitute exports that Mr Kohl was reported to be seeking.
'Once serious consideration at this level is given to recognising Community
concerns, we can be hopeful,' he said. Recent EC-US contacts had produced
some progress, but it was not yet sufficient.
The commissioner said he could not comment on the still-confidential Gatt
panel ruling this week, which is understood to have sided with the US in
criticising the Community's system of direct subsidies to soya bean
producers. But he said: 'I am satisfied that these per hectare payments will
be allowed - otherwise it will not be possible to have reform accepted by
the EC Council of Ministers.'
After Gatt ruled in 1989 that the EC was discriminating against imports, the
EC switched payments away from intermediary soya crushers to EC soya
growers, calculated on a per hectare basis. This form of direct support was
considered a precursor to Mr MacSharry's subsequent overall reform of the
common agricultural policy (CAP). This is why Brussels is concerned lest
Gatt overturn its principle.
Mr MacSharry yesterday confirmed he was proposing a roll-over of existing
farm prices for 1992-93. Proposing cuts would only distract EC ministers
from the far more important goals of CAP reform and a Gatt deal, which would
themselves lower prices.

MEXICO has criticised the US for planning to go ahead with building nuclear
and toxic waste sites on the Texas-Mexico border without appropriate
consultation, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City.
Mexico's foreign ministry said the sites would violate the 1983 La Paz
environmental co-operation accord. It has told its ambassador in Washington
to solicit 'urgently and formally' information on the building of the waste
dumps, and rejects 'whatever suggestion' that the decision to build the
sites is part of the exclusive jurisdiction of Texas.
The row comes just after the US and Mexico agreed a joint border
environmental plan meant to herald a new spirit of ecological co-operation
and defuse fears that the proposed Nafta agreement would further pollute the
border area.

THE victories of President Bush and Governor Bill Clinton in Tuesday's
Michigan and Illinois presidential primaries have sent a signal to
negotiators to push on with the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Despite protectionist rhetoric from their opponents, both candidates held
firm in support of the pact, though Mr Clinton said it must be 'the right
kind of Nafta', with labour and environment rules.
On Tuesday, Mr Bush spoke by phone with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
and Canada's premier Brian Mulroney. A US trade representative spokesman
said the US and Mexican leaders 'reaffirmed their commitment to Nafta'. Mrs
Carla Hills, US trade representative, said last week the negotiators had
been making remarkable progress and a preliminary text could be sent to
Congress for review this year.
Mr Mulroney said 'agreement in principle is possible once several matters of
substance are resolved'. Problems remain on cars, energy, financial services
and agriculture, but the US and Mexico are near accord on a domestic-content
rule they believe would set up a North American clothes-making area
competitive with Asian producers. The Mexican presidency said the three
leaders thought the talks were moving 'at a satisfactory pace'. Their teams
would keep meeting to close an agreement. Top negotiators meet in Washington
on March 23.

FT  19 MAR 92 / EC corporate tax proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE tax rates in the EC should be harmonised at between 30 and 40 per
cent, according to an experts' report for the European Commission which
could be transformed into legislative proposals before the end of the year.
The report, to be published in full in May, calls for rapid action to
eliminate differences in national corporate tax systems, which it says are
hampering cross-border business investment and shareholdings. Brussels has
already proposed a number of detailed measures aimed, for example, at
harmonising the tax treatment of interest payments between companies. The
committee recommends an extension of some of those directives.
But attempts to go further could fall foul of EC members' reluctance to let
the Commission tamper with its domestic tax rates and systems. All tax
measures require unanimous approval and as one national official said
yesterday: 'Hell will freeze over before any of these recommendations are
adopted.'
Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who chaired the panel of
experts, admitted there were political hurdles ahead, but said he was 'not
too pessimistic'.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax commissioner, said she would table a
paper inspired by the Ruding report in the next few weeks, but she did not
specify which of the recommendations the Commission was likely to favour.
The report recommends that certain measures should be in place as early as
the end of 1994. They include the removal of discriminatory differences in
the way profits earned in another member state are taxed, and measures to
enshrine a minimum corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. A maximum rate of 40
per cent could wait until the second phase of economic and monetary union
(Emu), the report says.

<TEXT>
MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, yesterday promised
the Commission would consult industry and consumers on its anti-pollution
plans at an earlier stage.
Presenting the EC's fifth environmental programme, setting general policy
goals up to the year 2000, Mr Ripa di Meana conceded the Commission had been
criticised in the past for 'handing down bans from on high'. He proposed a
'general consultative forum' in which the Commission would systematically
seek the views of all interest groups before finalising its proposals.
The commissioner said he detected signs of a 'more responsible' attitude by
industry to the environment. He contrasted the 'long rearguard action' that
EC car makers fought a few years ago against tougher emission controls with
the 'very encouraging' willingness by EC industrial producers and users of
CFCs to phase these substances out, largely on a voluntary basis.
In the new consultative forum, industry 'will have to speak out clearly' on
its environmental views, Mr Ripa di Meana said. More open consultation 'will
avoid the half-confidentiality on which so many misunderstandings have been
based in the past', he added.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Bundesbank warning on money market funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday declared broad support for the Bonn government's
proposals to reform Germany's financial markets, but underlined its
opposition to the introduction of money market funds in Germany.
The Bundesbank's comments, in its monthly report, follow the government's
package of measures unveiled in January to strengthen Germany's position as
a financial services centre. The proposals include establishing a
centralised regulatory body for the securities industry, introducing tough
new laws against insider trading, and changing the law to allow money market
funds in Germany.
The Bundesbank said yesterday that it opposed the introduction of money
market funds in Germany on the grounds that they would weaken its control
over monetary policy.
Money market funds, a highly popular form of investment in the US and many
European countries, give investors direct access to short-term money market
instruments (such as Treasury Bills in the US) and pay a better rate of
interest than short-term bank deposits.
The Bonn Finance Ministry believes that such products should be available in
a modern financial services centre, but the Bundesbank maintains that they
would endanger its minimum reserve policy, a central plank of its fight to
constrain money supply growth and keep down inflation. Under minimum reserve
policy, banks have to keep a proportion of all their deposits with the
Bundesbank. These funds are then used to manage market liquidity.
'The possible shift of funds from bank deposits covered by the reserve
requirement to a money market fund not covered by the requirement would lead
to a reduction in the minimum reserve base and weaken the efficiency of the
instrument of minimum reserves,' the Bundesbank cautioned.
There is considerable pent-up demand in Germany for money market funds as
short-term interest rates are at historically high levels. This is not
reflected in the rates obtainable in deposits.
The German banks are ambivalent about the introduction of the product. They
agree with Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, that money market funds
ought to be available in a modern and sophisticated financial services
centre, but fear that their costs would increase sharply if depositors moved
their savings from low-interest bearing deposit accounts into higher
yielding funds.

FT  19 MAR 92 / BTR to appeal against Brussels competition fine
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, is to appeal against the European
Commission's decision yesterday to impose an Ecu5m (Pounds 3.55m) fine on
its subsidiary, Dunlop Slazenger International, for hampering competitive
exports of its tennis and squash balls.
Mr Stanley Williams, BTR's company secretary, admitted yesterday there had
been a 'technical breach' of EC competition rules, because Dunlop Slazenger
had at one point asked a British wholesaler not to export its tennis balls
to continental Europe. But he added: 'We believe that the size of the fine
we have been given today is out of proportion with what has happened.'
He said BTR's lawyers would be examining the Commission decision to check
that proper procedure had been followed. The Court of First Instance, the
EC's lower judicial body, recently quashed a Commission fine on the grounds
that short-cuts had been taken by Brussels, but an official said yesterday
that the Commission had scrupulously observed its rules in this case.
The Commission has punished Dunlop Slazenger for restricting exports to
protect its sole distributors in other EC countries. BTR argues that the
Brussels competition authorities have misunderstood the market.
Mr Williams added that BTR only took over Dunlop Slazenger in 1985, and
therefore could not be held wholly responsible for restrictive practices
which began in 1977 and ended 10 years later. A Commission official said:
'If you buy a company, you buy it with all its (legal) liabilities.'
The Commission also imposed a fine of Ecu150,000 on Dunlop Slazenger's
distributor in the Benelux countries, All Weather Sports, for collaborating
with the British group in restricting other exports.
The Dutch builders' federation, facing a Commission fine for operating an
illegal contract cartel, repeated its intention to maintain the system until
the European Court decides whether the Brussels decision should be
suspended. The Commission said on Tuesday that it could impose penalty
payments if the cartel was not stopped immediately.

ANOTHER warning of disintegration in the former Soviet army was delivered
yesterday by Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief-of-staff of the armed
forces, now under the collective control of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
Speaking to the armed forces daily newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Samsonov
said the army was facing widespread desertions and evasions of the draft in
the face of rising ethnic struggles, especially in the Caucasus. 'The
situation has arisen where we can no longer defend ourselves. There is no
one left. There are units in which officers have to stand guard. It is
shameful,' he said.
Concern over the rising dissatisfaction in the army has prompted the Russian
government to create a Russian Defence Ministry, charged with preparing the
ground for a Russian army. However, Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
stressed to parliamentary deputies yesterday that the CIS remains 'an issue
of geoplitical and strategic priority for Russia'.
Confusion over the future of the armed forces, and their weaponry, was
underlined yesterday when Mr Yeltsin said Ukraine had backed down on its
threat to retain possession of tactical nuclear weapons on its territory,
while Ukrainian officials said they knew nothing of a change of policy.
Mr Yeltsin told deputies he had been assured by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, that the missiles would be returned by July 1 as
planned. A Nato spokesman was quoted as saying Ukraine had pledged to do so.
Last week, Mr Kravchuk announced he would halt the transport of the missiles
because of instability in Russia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday claimed a breakthrough in
European Community-sponsored talks on the future of the Yugoslav republic
when they agreed in principle to an independent state divided into three
separate areas along ethnic and geographic lines.
The document, called a statement of principles, appeared to pave the way for
international recognition of Bosnia as an independent state. Diplomats say
it is likely the EC and the US will jointly recognise Bosnia early next
month.
The accord would give the Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats regional control
over their local economies, culture, health and education, leaving foreign
and macro-economic policy to a collective government and parliament. It
appeared to be an attempt by the leaders of Bosnia's three main national
groups to defuse rising ethnic tensions which many fear could explode into a
civil war.
But the agreement left unresolved where the new boundaries would be drawn to
separate the intertwined ethnic groups in Bosnia's 4.4m population. It also
did not define future control over the police and the armed forces.
According to western diplomats, the Serb-controlled federal army now has an
estimated 100,000 troops in Bosnia.
Diplomats in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, were cautious about
the accord. 'This is a little progress, but don't be deceived,' said a
western diplomat. 'It is a journey of many miles'.
Mr Jose Cutilhiero, a Portuguese diplomat who chaired the two-day talks,
said it would take some long negotiations before a draft constitution could
be drawn up.
The agreement seemed to represent a concession by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the
Moslem president of Bosnia, who has opposed the division of Bosnia into
ethnic units.
Moslems, who comprise 43 per cent of the population, fear the republics of
Serbia and Croatia will now move to annex parts of Bosnia, leaving the
Moslems without a homeland.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, has consistently rejected
an independent Bosnia. Many Serbs have raised roadblocks in Bosnia in
protest against the 'yes vote' in the independence referendum on March 1.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Electronics giant may be stillborn: French plans for a
'competitive' conglomerate are faltering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S controversial plans to create a giant electronics and nuclear
energy conglomerate are running aground.
The Socialist government unveiled the project in a blaze of optimism last
December, when it described the plan as a way of giving French electronics
the muscle to compete with such as Toshiba of Japan and Germany's Siemens.
The idea was to merge the loss-making civil electronics businesses of
state-owned Thomson, the defence and consumer electronics group, with the
profitable CEA-Industrie, the public-sector nuclear fuel and plant producer.
Today, the gloss is being rubbed off the project by scepticism from the
opposition and complaints from the nuclear industry that it was never
consulted over the plan.
The senate, the conservative-dominated upper house of parliament, warned in
a report last month that the plan was poorly prepared, the result of
ideological dogma, and 'unlikely to see the light of day'. Officials close
to the scheme warn that the merger may not be ready by the government's June
deadline.
Its main supporters are Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, and her
special adviser, Mr Abel Farnoux, who has brought an interventionist tone to
her industrial policy. Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, is right behind
them - if only because he wants to separate Thomson's loss-making consumer
electronics businesses from its profitable defence arm.
The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA), the holding group for the
nuclear energy businesses concerned, has refrained from passing judgement in
public. Mr Philippe Rouvillois, its chairman, has simply warned that the CEA
expects to be reimbursed for the loss of the FFr400m (Pounds 40.85m) in
dividends that it draws from its industrial subsidiaries - due to be hived
off to the new company.
Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman of Framatome, the CEA-controlled nuclear plant
builder, is said to be deeply against the plan, because he does not want his
cash reserves to be used to run down the FFr10bn of Thomson Consumer
Electronics' debt.
Others feel that their general strategies are in question. 'Our development
projects are frozen, awaiting the public authorities' decision on the new
group,' said Mr Alain Vidart, chairman of Cisi, a CEA computer services
unit.
In charge of co-ordinating the project is Mr Jean Syrota, chairman of
Cogema, the CEA-owned nuclear fuel business. Mr Syrota has already shown, in
his quiet way, that he is going to be no push-over for Mrs Cresson's
planners.
He has done nothing to separate the chairmanships of CEA and CEA-Industrie -
the holding company for the commission's industrial activities - despite the
fact that the government has issued a decree allowing him to take this first
step to putting the project in place.
He has also dragged his feet over producing a detailed study of the
feasibility of the new structure by mid-February - as requested by Mrs
Cresson. Instead, his report is understood to have been an extremely brief
account of progress so far, emphasising that feasibility could not begin to
be assessed until the businesses involved had been fully evaluated. This is
now being done by banks called in by the government to arbitrate. Not
surprisingly, Thomson appears to value itself more highly than the banks do.
The final figures cannot be decided until Thomson's 1991 results - believed
by analysts to show another heavy loss - are published, in several weeks
time.
By then, the results of next Sunday's regional elections will be out. These
are likely to be another big blow to the government's confidence and could
hasten a general election. Clearly, a change of government would throw doubt
over the whole project.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (7): Talent capsized
by money wave - US managed funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGED FUTURES funds used to be seen as exotic, high-risk ventures, for
either the brave or the foolish. But the amount of money flowing into
managed futures - into public funds, private pools or individual accounts -
has mushroomed in the past few years.
Even pension funds, the most cautious and finicky of investors, are now
putting money into them.
Morton Baratz, editor of Managed Accounts Reports, a newsletter that tracks
the managed funds industry, estimates that assets in managed futures
worldwide have shot up from just Dollars 4bn in 1986 to Dollars 21bn today.
From 1980 through 1990, the average annual compounded growth rate was about
35 per cent for managed futures. And despite considerably slower growth last
year, a poor year for many markets, many in the futures industry expect that
managed futures will eventually be to commodities what mutual funds are to
equities - a vast, deep ocean of money.
The most explosive growth in managed funds occurred after the 1987 crash, as
investors became wary about equities. Also, in the last 18 months, the
decline in US interest rates has spurred many to consider managed futures
who would never have looked at them before.
American pension funds, for example, which must contend with strict
regulations as to how they invest, have begun to dabble in managed futures.
While the names and amounts of most of these investments are not known
publicly, industry experts guess that between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn
of pension-fund money is in managed futures.
Mr Baratz estimates that a third of the Dollars 21bn now in managed futures
is from foreign sources, though he says precise numbers are difficult to
establish. Many foreign institutional investors, particularly from Japan,
have placed money in the hands of American commodity-trading advisers
(CTAs), the professional managers of commodity funds. According to Jane
Martin, executive director of the Managed Futures Association, Japanese and
European investors are likely to provide managed funds' next biggest burst
of growth.
Overall, investors appear to be changing their attitude towards managed
futures. 'There are more institutions, both foreign and domestic, looking to
add futures to their portfolios than I've ever seen before,' said Frank
Pusateri, senior vice-president for investments at Prudential Bache in New
York.
The advent of guaranteed funds, in which capital is secure, has helped to
overcome the old barrier of horror about commodities markets, notes Peter
Matthews, chief portfolio strategist at Mint Investment Management, which
has some Dollars 900m under management.
CTAs have also emphasised to potential clients that they should take a
long-term view rather than a get-rich-quick stance. Most institutions would
be happy with returns of about 15 per cent a year. 'A 40 per cent to 50 per
cent return would probably scare them off,' said Mr Pusateri.
Like venture capital and international stocks, 'we are going through a
period of acceptance,' observes Robert Easton, president of Commodities
Corp, which has about Dollars 1bn under management. Yet the recent tide of
money into managed futures funds is already presenting them with serious
capacity problems. And this may slow down their growth.
In the US, speculative position limits inhibit the ability of large traders
in many markets, particularly in agriculture, where huge sums have been made
in the past. Often, too, there is insufficient liquidity to absorb the large
quantities that funds trade.
The limits on American exchanges and the need for diversification have
driven substantial amounts of managed-fund trading offshore. CTAs, including
some of the largest, have estimated that between 20 per cent and 70 per cent
of their trading is in non-US markets. One top CTA credits trading abroad
for his superior returns, compared with those who trade mostly in the US.
'Our preference would be trading in the US, but we'll go where the liquidity
is,' said Kenneth Tropin, president of JW Henry, which has about Dollars
750m under management, and chairman of the Managed Futures Association
(MFA).
There is also concern that the wave of money coming into managed futures is
overwhelming the current pool of trading talent. There seems to be a limit
to how much an individual can handle, and some CTAs have simply closed their
doors to new clients or restricted how much more money they will accept.
US futures exchanges are working with the MFA to win approval from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry regulator, to lift
position limits and prohibitions on trading certain contracts. The exchanges
are also seeking approval to change their rules, to favour large order
executions and provide average prices for large orders. Such steps 'are
helpful developments' says Mr Easton.
Exchange officials and many CTAs in the US complain that the regulatory
restrictions inhibit the growth of American markets, and place them on an
uneven playing field with their foreign competitors. They are pressing for
changes, without which the growth of managed futures is likely to be less
stunning than predicted.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (8): Techniques find
new markets - Equity and commodity swaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A decade of dynamic growth, the global swaps market stands at Dollars
3,000bn, according to estimates by the International Swap Dealers
Association. The application of existing technology to new markets is set to
fuel further expansion in the 1990s.
Most existing swap agreements are exchanges of interest-rate or currency
flows, allowing corporate treasurers to match assets and liabilities, to
hedge exposure, or to reduce funding costs. The same technology is now being
used to create commodity swaps and equity swaps. While both these sectors
still account for only a small portion of the global market, both have
engaged a new breed of swap-market participant.
While corporate treasurers are vulnerable to sharp movements of currencies
and interest rates, fund managers are equally affected by equity market
movements, and businesses that require large quantities of commodities
suffer if commodity prices rise.
For banks already involved in the swaps market, the new client base is an
attractive one. Interest-rate and currency swaps have become actively
traded, and, as competition among banks has increased, margins have shrunk
dramatically.
As they are still at an early stage of development, greater expertise is
required in the equity and commodity swap markets - partly because the risk
assumed by banks is more difficult to hedge - and consequently higher fees
can be charged.
In fact, the concept of the equity swap appears so far to have inspired
bankers more than fund managers. However, there are signs that the idea is
starting to take hold, particularly in the US. Several aspects of the
concept hold particular appeal for US fund managers.
First, it is an easy way of investing in foreign markets without assuming
currency risk, which US fund managers, unlike their European counterparts,
often prefer to avoid, or at least to separate. Second, many US fund
managers like the idea of being able to transfer expertise in one class of
asset to another.
An equity swap simulates the performance of an equity index. It can be used
as an alternative to futures and options for hedging. But it is most
attractive to fund managers, whose target is to out-perform an index.
In an equity swap, the fund manager receives a stream of payments which
replicate the return of a direct investment in an equity index, and in
exchange makes a stream of payments to the bank based on, usually, the
London interbank offered rate. The precise structure of the transaction is
tailored to suit the investment manager's needs.
An equity swap combined with core holdings can increase a fund manager's
ability to enhance returns. But there are deterrents. While swaps, unlike
futures, can run for up to 10 years, the element of credit risk is greater.
Although payments are normally made every three months to reduce exposure,
credit considerations can be an issue. However, there is no exchange of
principal, so exposure is relatively limited.
In the UK, fund managers are fighting shy of the concept, partly because of
uncertainty about the tax treatment of equity swaps. Since no such
uncertainty now exists for index futures and options, many fund managers
prefer to stick to this more travelled route.
Although the market has been in existence for about five years, estimates of
the amount of outstanding equity-swap agreements are difficult to gauge. The
market is not developing in isolation, but in conjunction with the surge of
business in equity derivatives, currently one of the most profitable
financial markets. Equity swaps are being offered alongside an increasingly
diverse range of products.
At the same time, activity in exchange-traded futures and options has
advanced strongly.
The commodity swaps market, on the other hand, offers hedging opportunities
where little or no alternative exists. Partly for this reason, the market is
experiencing a healthy growth rate. The size of the commodity swaps market
had grown, according to estimates, from Dollars 3bn in 1988 to Dollars 10bn
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and is now believed to total
Dollars 40bn.
The largest portion of the market - as much as 80 per cent  - is made up of
oil-related transactions, partly a result of the volatility of the oil
market. 'The Gulf war is the best thing that ever happened to the commodity
swaps market,' said one trader.
The extreme volatility of oil prices during the Gulf crisis appears to have
brought about a change in attitude among oil consumers, which extensive
marketing by banks had failed to achieve. Many companies, which had viewed
derivative instruments of speculative tools, were convinced (at the cost of
substantial financial losses in many cases) that, as banks had long argued,
it was often a more speculative position not to hedge exposure and so to
bear the full risk of any market movements.
In a commodity swap, a company receives a cash flow pegged to a commodity
index or price. Transportation companies, mainly airlines, have led the
field. British Airways and KLM have been active in the market since the late
1980s, while US airlines have been slower to participate, fearing that the
market could move in favour of unhedged competitors.
Activity in the swaps market has been boosted also by the realisation that
basis risk in the futures market is high. Since only a few exchange-traded
oil futures contracts exist, many contracts provide imperfect hedges. For
example, there is no jet-fuel contract, so a proxy, such as gasoil, has to
be used. Jet fuel has historically traded at Dollars 25 per ton more than
gasoil, with a high in early 1989 of Dollars 50. During the Gulf crisis, the
spread ballooned to an average of Dollars 65 and a high of Dollars 186. As
well as oil swaps, there are commodity-swap markets in gas and also in
metals, including copper, aluminium and zinc. Agricultural commodities
account for only a tiny portion of business.
While the ultimate level of activity in various sectors of the swap market
is hard to predict, the shift in attitude which has sparked demand for a
broader range of instruments is clearly visible.
'It is no longer acceptable for companies to attribute poor performance or
results to commodity price movements,' according to Katharine MacWilliams,
head of commodity swaps at First Chicago. Increasing competition within
their own industry - whether fund management, transportation or
manufacturing - is likely to provide the greatest catalyst for change.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (6): Diversification
is the spur - UK fund managers are looking again at derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK INVESTMENT managers have been slow to turn to futures and options
markets, preferring to rely on traditional skills such as stock-picking.
Although their portfolios continue to be dominated by UK shares, increasing
diversification is encouraging fund managers to look again at the benefits
of derivative products.
Banks are addressing, with some vigour, the task of converting UK investment
managers, a largely untapped investor base.
Some barriers have been removed. Most important, fund managers' tax position
was clarified in the 1990 budget. 'Taxation is no longer an issue,'
according to Mr Clive Gilchrist, chairman of the National Association of
Pension Fund's Investment Committee.
There has been progress on other issues, such as performance measurement. A
recent set of recommendations for the reporting of financial futures and
options in investment portfolios, published by the London International
Financial Futures Exchange and Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, is expected
to create an industry standard for the first time.
These guidelines should also help fund managers to clear another hurdle:
trustee approval. But once trustees are satisfied that the use of derivative
products is judicious, trust deeds may still need to be altered.
There are less tangible obstacles. Many analysts believe the structure of
the fund management industry has not favoured the development of derivative
strategies. A fund manager's performance is generally measured against other
fund managers' or against an index.
'The fear of doing worse than their competitors is generally stronger than
the desire to do better,' according to one derivative specialist, who
believes the greatest catalyst for change will be an extremely strong
performance by fund managers using derivatives.
For most fund managers, derivatives are an investment tool and not a
distinct asset class. This use of derivative products falls under the
concept of efficient portfolio management, under Securities and Investment
Board rules.
While futures and options can be used for a variety of purposes - to hedge
exposure (for example, to reduce potential losses on a cash holding of
stocks) or to pick stocks - it is the application of derivative techniques
to asset allocation that has captured the attention of UK fund managers.
The opening of many more foreign markets and the increasing level of
international trading is causing a change in fund management techniques.
Many fund managers have found that traditional skills of stock-picking are
less relevant than the identification of broader market trends - for
example, the difference in performance between US stocks and Japanese stocks
tends to be far greater than between ICI and Hanson shares.
However, to buy and sell large holdings of stocks or bonds can be both
time-consuming and expensive. It is often cheaper and more efficient to
shift exposure by, for example, buying FT-SE index future contracts and
holding a cash deposit, so creating a synthetic equity asset.
The growing use of derivative products by fund management groups is still
limited largely to institutional funds. According to a new survey by KPMG
Management Consulting, five out of 10 top pension fund organisations use
futures and options in more than 25 per cent of their funds - a substantial
increase on last year, when eight out of the 10 funds surveyed used futures
and options in only 25 per cent or less of funds managed.
In addition, the way has now been cleared for retail investors to buy unit
trusts which use futures and options. Last July, the Securities and
Investments Board opened the door for authorised unit trusts to invest in
futures and options through two new types of fund: futures and options funds
(FOFs) and geared futures and options funds (GFOFs). FOFs can invest up to
10 per cent of their assets in derivative products, while 20 per cent of
assets in GFOFs can be in futures and options which do not have to be
covered.
So far, only two companies have taken advantage of the new rules and
launched funds, although about 10 are believed to be awaiting authorisation.
The first funds, launched by John Govett, have so far made sales of over
Pounds 30m through financial intermediaries. However, these funds are
targeted at 'the top end of the UK market', according to director Adam
Parkin.
The only genuine retail product launched to date has been Legal &amp; General's
UK Tactical Allocation Trust, which has raised around Pounds 5m so far.
Prudential, which cancelled earlier plans to launch FOFs, due to adverse
reaction, is 'still working towards the launch of one or more
derivative-based funds', according to Mr Alan Wren, managing director.
So far these funds are available only in the UK. But the Joint Exchanges
Committee is lobbying to have the Ucits directive extended, so that such
funds are given an EC passport. Such a move is still some way off, however.
Meanwhile, another branch of the industry is developing: offshore futures
funds. Unlike the pension-fund industry, managed futures funds treat
derivative products as a distinct asset class, often using quantitative
techniques.
The industry had experienced massive growth in the US during the 1980s, to
around Dollars 20bn. A budding European offshore futures fund industry is
estimated to have reached only Dollars 2bn. Moreover, most of the actual
investment management is still done out of the US, where experts known as
CTAs (commodity trading advisers) are based. However, some specialist firms,
such as Rudolf Wolff and Sabre, are fostering home-grown talent. Some large
banks, including Citibank, are also marketing managed futures in Europe.
A gradual shift is under way in the UK fund management industry. Some very
large institutions, including Prudential, the British Rail pension fund and
Postel, openly declare their use of derivative products.
Some fund managers believe that economic conditions will create an added
impetus. They suggest that fund managers have been spoilt by high returns in
recent years and that, with returns set to fall, the argument for using
derivative products to enhance returns will become more compelling.
However, conversion of UK fund managers, who still hold the vast bulk of
their assets in UK stocks, will not be a speedy process.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (4): Fears of new
restrictions - A cloud hangs over derivatives in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS IN Japan's stock futures are awaiting the outcome of the
authorities' review of the effects of derivatives trading on the underlying
cash stock market.
The Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges have blamed the derivatives market for
the current weakness of Japanese share prices. Moves to tighten restrictions
in the futures and options markets have prompted criticism from many
participants, who see a threat to these markets' further growth.
The Nikkei 225 futures contract, which was listed on the Osaka Securities
Exchange (OSE), has become one of the largest stock futures markets in the
world. Last year, turnover in the Nikkei 225 futures trading was 35 per cent
up on the previous year, at Y536,729.9bn (Dollars 4,142bn).
In contrast, trading in the underlying cash market, listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange (TSE), has been hurt by deteriorating investor confidence.
Last year, activity on the first section of the TSE fell 39 per cent to a
nine-year low of Y107,108bn.
The Nikkei index, which reached a high of 38,915.87 in late 1989, has
plunged over 45 per cent as higher interest rates have squeezed speculation
out of the market. Last year's stock market scandals, involving Japanese
brokers who had favoured larger corporate clients by compensating them for
trading losses, have also shaken individuals, and the cash market is in its
third year of weakness.
Price fluctuations in the futures markets are reflected in the cash market
through arbitrage, profiting from the price differences between cash and
futures markets. Stock exchange officials blame the abnormal surge in
derivatives trading and speculative price movements on the futures markets
for intimidating individual investors.
'We have no proof that trading on the futures market has adverse effects on
the cash market, but if additional restrictions are going to alleviate the
fears of the individual investor, the futures market has to be sacrificed,'
says Mr Takao Tsutsumi, executive governor of the OSE.
The TSE increased margin rates for arbitrage trading three times last year,
to curb activity. Last month, the OSE implemented emergency measures to
enhance the transparency of the futures and options market by disclosing
trading of futures and options by brokers. The OSE also shortened the
trading hours of the futures market; and the exercise of option contracts,
also blamed for creating volatility, will be moved from the current once a
week to once a month with the June contract.
Frustration over derivatives trading has been heightened by the
deteriorating earnings of Japanese brokers against large increases in
profits at foreign houses, which booked profits due to their expertise in
derivatives trading.
Smaller Japanese brokers have also pointed to larger brokers, who have
increased their presence in the futures and options markets. 'The concept of
profiting from dealing rather than from broking is still seen as a sin,'
points out one analyst.
The popularity of the OSE's Nikkei futures has also led to tensions between
the two exchanges. Trading in the Nikkei 225 futures index accounted for
56.2 per cent of trading revenue earned by the OSE, while futures trading in
Tokyo on the TSE's Topix index only accounted for 2.6 per cent of its
trading income. Thanks to futures trading, the OSE managed to make a profit
for the interim period to last September, while the TSE, hurt by the sharp
fall in trading volume, fell into the red.
Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director of Nomura Securities, is
critical of 'speculation' in the futures markets. 'A futures market cannot
exist without the underlying cash market. The stock market's initial purpose
is for companies to raise funds, not speculation,' he adds.
However, Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, researcher at Japan Securities Research
Institute, points out it was originally the brokerages and corporations
which drove investors from the cash market.
'The cash market's appeal to investors has deteriorated due to focus on the
underwriting business by brokerages and the equity financing frenzy by
companies,' observes Mr Nikami.
Apart from the decline in liquidity in the cash market, investors are
attracted to the futures and options market as derivatives offer an exposure
to the equity market at lower costs due to lower commissions and tax-saving
benefits.
The OSE and TSE have started to tighten the grip on derivatives trading, and
are still working on further long- and short-term reforms. The two exchanges
have announced that, from next Monday, they will double commissions for
futures and options trading - the first increase of futures and options
contracts in Japan.
There is speculation in the market that Tokyo could impose a ceiling on
brokers' arbitrage positions, and place tighter limits on price movements on
illiquid stocks of the Nikkei 225. Critics of futures trading point out the
volatility can be created by manipulating the price movements of illiquid
shares within the price-based Nikkei 225 average.
Meanwhile, derivatives traders claim that adverse feeling against
derivatives trading is driving business to offshore markets such as the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where Nikkei 225 futures are traded.
'If derivatives traders see an opportunity on a price basis, they will move
to that market,' says Mr Alex Woodthorpe, derivatives analyst at SG Warburg
Securities. With margins for futures contracts higher on the OSE, an
increasing number of investors are moving to Simex, which is in the same
time zone.
The Simex Nikkei futures contract, launched in 1986, was the first futures
contract on the Japanese stock market. Trading volume on the Simex has been
boosted by the OSE's listing of its Nikkei futures. Daily volume, which
average 3,045 contracts last year, surged to 6,789 contracts in February.
Starting with the June contract, the last trading day and final settlement
price of the Simex Nikkei futures will be made identical to the OSE Nikkei
futures contracts. Simex will also list Nikkei stock options from today.
Traders point out that the Simex Nikkei contract offers more liquidity,
because it is traded on open bidding and offering on the trading floor, as
opposed to OSE's screen-based trading.
Japanese regulators are already concerned about the trading outflow. Mr
Mitsuo Sato, TSE vice-president, says that a 'level playing field' is
necessary, and adds that, if trading on offshore markets undermines investor
confidence in Japan, the TSE and the OSE will request implementation of
similar trading rules to overseas exchanges.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (5): Banks take
expansive view - Conflicting attitudes towards the OTC market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 150m treasury loss incurred by Allied Lyons last year, through
its involvement in the options market, had a dramatic impact on corporate
attitudes towards derivative financial instruments.
However, while the episode made companies look hard at their treasury
operations, bankers argue that there has been no significant slow-down in
the rate of growth or innovation in the futures and options markets.
They point to three main areas of growth:
New buyers are coming into the market as the price of interest-rate and
currency-hedging products falls to the point where it is efficient for
smaller companies to buy complex hedging products. Competition among banks
offering over-the-counter derivatives has intensified.
'Margins have come down to the point that they can not fall any further,'
commented Peter Hajas, head of interest-rate derivatives at SBC/O'Connor.
He estimated the price of simple sterling or dollar interest-rate products,
such as caps and floors, had fallen to just 25 - 30 per cent of the levels
seen at the end of the 1980s.
Banks are offering existing products in a wider range of currencies. Demand
has grown for interest-rate hedging products in European currencies such as
the lire and the peseta, while hedging tools such as forward contracts and
options are now available in a range of smaller currencies.
National Westminster Bank, for example, plans to make a forward market in
currencies from Korean won to Indonesian rupiah by early summer. By the year
end, it hopes to be offering options on these currencies.
New products are being developed which offer existing customers new ways to
hedge currency and interest-rate exposures.
Within the interest-rate derivatives market, there is growth in products
which allow buyers to manage previously inseparable risks.
For example, in buying an 'index swap', an investment manager might agree to
pay the bank Deutsche Mark interest rates in return for a payment linked to
US dollar interest rates. This is clearly an interest-rate hedge based on
the expectation of falling German interest rates and rising US interest
rates. However, the whole transaction is denominated in dollars, separating
out the risk of an appreciation in the D-Mark.
Within the options market, developments include drop-out or barrier options.
These offer a conventional option on a currency or market at an agreed
strike price, but the contract dissolves if the market moves too far away
from the strike price.
The product can be offered at a lower price than a conventional option,
because the bank's exposure is easier to hedge. On this basis, it is
favoured by fund managers or treasurers with a strong view on the direction
of markets.
Another development is 'tender-to-contract' options, which allow a company
to hedge a potential currency exposure when tendering for a large contract.
This works something like an option-on-an-option, but tries to take into
account the probability of the company's actually winning the contract.
The biggest draw-back on these types of instrument is that the bank writing
the option or swap can find it difficult to hedge its own exposure. This
cost is inevitably passed through to the company buying the hedge.
Another product being aggressively marketed by a number of banks is the
'average rate' option, on which the prevailing market rate is determined by
a sampling process through the life of the instrument - rather than by
simply taking the price on exercise date.
The idea is that the option will reflect the buyers' foreign-exchange or
interest-rate exposures, rather than taking an unrepresentative 'snap-shot'
on a single date.
But while bankers are keen to parade the latest examples of futures and
options-based financial engineering, corporate treasurers are showing a
desire to return to basics.
'There has been a reversion to a more fundamentalist attitude to treasury
management,' commented Derek Ross, head of treasury management consultancy
at Touche Ross. 'There is a growing awareness that every level of complexity
adds to the cost of financial products.'
For example, big companies with large, core foreign-exchange exposures have
started to use 'dynamic currency hedging' in preference to over-the-counter
(OTC) options.
Dynamic currency hedging involves the active management of a physical
currency portfolio, to 'synthesise' currency options. The core of the system
is a computer-trading model, which automatically buys and sell currencies
according to day-to-day exchange rate movements.
For example, a UK company needing to hedge a dollar exposure would buy
dollars as the US currency appreciated against sterling, and sell dollars as
the US currency depreciated, according to a pre-set formula.
While the theory is simple, setting up a sophisticated dynamic
currency-hedging system can be expensive, up to  1/2 per cent of the
exposure being hedged. There are also cumulative costs in the day-to-day
trading of the currency portfolio - although initial fees are reduced if the
trading is channelled through the same bank which sells the system.
Nick Goulding, head of derivatives at National Westminster Bank, estimated
that dynamic currency hedging was efficient only for companies with a core
foreign exchange exposure in excess of Pounds 50m.
However, big banks, including NatWest itself, already use dynamic currency
hedging techniques in place of OTC options. Blue-chip companies are
following suit.
The technique is popular in the management of 'translation exposures', which
arise from the translation of foreign currency earnings back into a base
currency for accounting purposes.
Dynamic hedging is least efficient in liquid currencies, because the cost of
the alternatives - including OTC options  - is less. However, simplified
forms of the technique are being used without a huge investment in systems
to manage exposures in 'exotic' currencies, where OTC hedging products are
only available at a high cost.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (2): Small markets
stock up - The growing competition in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES business, once dominated by the large US exchanges, is shifting to
Europe, reflecting the increasing level of trading in European securities.
But the success of Europe's exchanges is also fostering a more competitive
environment, as new exchanges and competing products spring up. While the
larger exchanges struggle for dominance of major European markets, smaller
ones may find a niche in trading products based on domestic instruments, or
by forging links with the larger exchanges.
Three European exchanges are battling for business: the London International
Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe); the Marche a Terme International de
France (Matif), in Paris; and the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), in Frankfurt.
Liffe's most successful contract, the Bund future, has come under threat
from a rival contract on the DTB, backed by the German banks. Although the
volume of Bund futures traded on Liffe has not fallen, activity in the DTB
contract has increased substantially, due to a combination of slashed
commissions, a new marketmaking system and daily targets. The DTB's market
share in the Bund contract increased from 8 per cent in January 1991 to 29
per cent in January 1992.
The DTB plans further expansion, which could threaten Liffe's strong
position in German interest-rate products. As well as an option on the
German BOBL (three-and-a-half to five-year bond) future, the exchange is
working on a three-month Euromark interest rate future. The contract, which
has not yet been approved by the board, would be the exchange's first
short-term interest rate contract.
The exchange's plans to expand overseas - currently stymied by regulatory
problems - indicate that it will not limit its sights to domestic business.
The exchange is also discussing the creation of futures and options
contracts on a pan-European stock index (two attempts so far have flopped:
Liffe's Eurotrack and the European Options Exchange's Eurotop contracts).
Meanwhile, Liffe has lost a battle, if not the war, over Ecubond futures
trading. A rival contract on the Matif, launched six months earlier, traded
110,000 contracts in January, compared with a mere 4,000 Ecu bond contracts
traded on Liffe, despite the launch of a new marketmaking system.
Roger Barton, managing director in charge of business development at Liffe,
admits that it will be 'a long hard slog' to win back Ecu business. But he
points out that the marketmaking system is providing two-way prices at a
tight spread.
The fact remains that the contract is barely traded, and many dealers use
alternative instruments for hedging: either cash bonds, such as the UK
10-year Ecu bond, or a proxy such as the Bund future.
While the failure of the Ecu contract has proved a setback, the success of
Liffe's Italian bond future contract, launched last September, has exceeded
all expectations. The contract fends off competition from a rival contract
on the Matif, also launched in September. In January, only one contract was
traded on the Matif, compared with 142,000 on Liffe.
However, a further challenge is on the way from the Italian authorities. In
June, they plan to launch a screen-based bond futures trading system, which
will be added on to their existing cash market trading system. There is
still some scepticism about the Italians' ability to meet that deadline,
although development of the clearing and trading systems is now under way.
Meanwhile, smaller European markets are also developing their own exchanges,
which will soon be stocked with derivatives on a range of domestic
instruments. In Vienna, the Osterreichische Termin und Optionenborse (Otob),
which opened for business last year, has made a strong start.
Currently the exchange trades only six individual stock options on Austrian
shares, but an option on the Austrian Traded Index, made up of 18 shares
traded on the Vienna stock exchange, will be launched in May or June, and a
synthetic government bond future is planned for later this year.
The Belgian Futures and Options Exchange (Belfox) made a rather
disappointing debut at the end of last year, with a Belgian government bond
future contract. But options on six Belgian stocks and futures and options
on its BEL-20 Belgian Stock Index are planned for later this year.
Spain's two exchanges are now trading under one holding company, Mercado de
Futuros Financieros (Meff), but are still based in both Madrid (equity
products) and Barcelona (interest rate products). Meff in Madrid recently
started trading futures and options contracts on a new index of Spanish
stocks, the Ibex 35, and plans to launch individual stock option contracts
later this year.
Meanwhile, the Swedish exchange, OM, with operations in Stockholm and
London, is in discussions with other exchanges such as the European Options
Exchange (EOE) about cross-listing of products (including its Swedish stock
options and stock index products).
Such linkage may be a way forward for other smaller exchanges seeking to
expand.
In the UK, the merger of Liffe and the London Trade Options Market (LTOM)
officially takes place next Monday, but the two exchanges have in fact been
operating under the same roof since January.
The merger is an attempt to revive the UK stock options market, which had
been languishing under the wing of the stock exchange. The prospects for one
key product, options on the FT-SE 100 index, are excellent. The FT-SE
options pit has already benefited from its proximity to the futures pit in
the new exchange, and from a surge of interest created by the merger. After
the merger, in addition to economies of scale, traders will be able to match
their futures and options positions.
But Liffe's Mr Barton admits that the 'significant growth' expected in FT-SE
option volume is unlikely to be matched in individual stock option trading.
'We are looking for steady growth over the next six to 12 months,' he said.
However, the signs are not encouraging. Liffe raised a bare minimum of
marketmakers in individual stock options, and most houses say they will be
concentrating their efforts on index products, which are used increasingly
by fund managers for asset allocation and hedging purposes.
The row over the future of stock options trading, which delayed the merger,
could erupt again. The large UK banks, active in stock trading in the cash
market, favoured a shift to screen-based trading, while smaller firms held
out for the continuation of pit trading
Although Liffe resisted pressure from the larger houses to move to a
screen-based system, an automated system is being developed for possible use
later.
'We took the view that the merged market should make that decision,' said Mr
Barton. 'The board of the merged market will decide if and when to move to
an automated system.'
However, the system will not be ready for another year, so the market will,
in theory, have some time to find its feet, unless members push for an early
decision on the issue. Some optimists still believe that Liffe's marketing
flair, combined with growing interest in derivative products among fund
managers, may produce a sufficient surge in volume to save the stock options
market in its present form.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (3): New products to
hold the line - US exchanges' share of world trading shrink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US COMMODITIES exchanges, once pre-eminent in the world futures industry,
are fighting to stem erosion of their world market share. As futures trading
has spread globally and foreign exchanges have blossomed, American markets
have seen their slice of trading shrink.
Last year, US exchanges captured just 53.2 per cent of world trading, down
from 58.9 per cent in 1990, according to figures from the Futures Industry
Association. A decade ago, American exchanges cornered virtually all
trading.
'We had 100 per cent of the volume. That doesn't leave a lot of room to go
up,' said Les Moucher, chief of the Chicago Board of Trade's new products
committee and second vice-chairman of the exchange.
US exchanges say their slide was to be expected as the inevitable result of
the growth of futures - a process that they themselves encouraged.
But they are trying to hold the line against any greater loss with a flock
of new and innovative products and the introduction of off-hours electronic
trading.
At the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the oldest and largest US exchange,
two of the industry's most novel new products are in the offing: insurance
and pollution futures.
Although scepticism about insurance futures has dogged their development and
the regulatory hurdles have been many, the exchange says it will launch
property and casualty (better known as homeowners') insurance futures and
health insurance futures this year.
Pollution futures, or clean-air futures as the CBOT prefers to call them,
will be based on the pollution permits issued by the US government under a
provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Industries can trade in these permits
in order to adjust how they comply with the law's new standards. The futures
are likely to be launched in early 1993, when the first auction of permits
takes place.
These two ideas may break new ground for the futures industry, but their
success is by no means assured. Roughly, only one in four futures contracts
succeeds and, unfortunately for the CBOT, it has had its share of flops
lately.
The most significant of these failures are the three-year and five-year swap
futures, launched with a fanfare last year. This was the first
straightforward attempt by an exchange to attract off-exchange business in
products similar to futures. The increase in off-exchange derivatives
trading is cited, along with foreign competition, as a barrier to more
trading on US exchanges.
But CBOT officials say that swap dealers are boycotting the contracts
because they perceive them as directly competitive. The exchange argues they
are not substitutes for swaps, and faults itself for not having marketed the
contracts better.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where volume rose by 5 per cent last
year, has in contrast been on a roll. It has already launched two
interesting new products this year: futures and futures-options on the
Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap Index, and non-dollar settled Deutsche Mark/yen
cross-rate futures and futures-options.
It also is planning to expand its equity index offerings with contracts on
the FT-SE 100, Eurotrack 100 and Eurotrack 200, and the Russell 2000 index
of small capitalisation shares. It is looking, too, at contracts in Euroyen
and EuroDeutsche Marks. While it is not breaking entirely fresh ground, it
is having greater success building on its product bases in equities,
short-term interest rates and currencies.
If there is a cloud over the CME, it is Globex, the after-hours electronic
trading system. Conceived by the CME, Globex is being developed with Reuters
and the CBOT.
Once heralded as the key to internationalisation of the futures markets,
Globex has suffered three years of delays and is beginning to look more like
an adjunct to that process - and perhaps not even the most technologically
advanced one. Recent trials are said to have gone well, but start-up plans
are still uncertain.
The New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) may indeed beat Globex with its
Access system, using technology from AT&amp;T. Given the global and
round-the-clock nature of the oil business, Nymex's Access may stand a
better chance of success in drawing in new international business than
Globex will for Chicago.
Nymex has also recently begun trading with modest success a sour crude
contract, of special interest to far eastern traders.
While 1991 was a bad year for US futures markets - overall trading volume
dipped for the first time since 1968 - American options exchanges fared no
better. In the two largest markets, the Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE) and the American Stock Exchange (Amex), volume dipped 6 per cent and
4.7 per cent respectively.
The good news for the US futures and options markets is that 1992 is off to
a flying start, with volume increases all round. This comes as an especially
welcome development for options exchanges which have seen slippage since
1987.
The CBOE has churned up substantial interest in its long-term options
(LEAPs), both for the S&amp;P100 and 500 indices and for individual stock
options. It also has FT-SE products coming up, is close to agreement on the
Russell 2000 index, and is discussing the possibility of a Mexican market
index.
At present, some 15 per cent of CBOE's trading volume is from foreign
investors, and it hopes that more foreign-based contracts, while largely for
domestic consumption, could increase that business.
The Amex has led US options exchanges in listing foreign equity derivatives,
such as warrants on the Nikkei stock index, the FT-SE and France's CAC-40.
It has also just launched the first US warrant on the British pound. The new
derivatives have given the Amex some trading dynamism, but it hopes that the
fresh interest in traditional options shown by investors since last October
will continue.
Both the CBOE and the Amex saw investors return to options after they had
begun listing multiply-traded (that is, traded in two or more markets)
options at the end of last October.
They are also benefiting from the surge of money into equities since a drop
in interest rates lessened the appeal of fixed income instruments. Each of
the exchanges is also working on a bio-tech index.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (1): Europe takes a
bigger share - Derivatives are likely to remain among the fastest growing
and most profitable financial markets, as an increasing number of exchanges
compete for business, and more banks develop derivatives units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE BANKS have been shrinking their loan books and cutting back their
trading operations in recent years, the vogue for futures and options
business has gathered pace.
The market in futures and options and other so-called derivative products is
at the forefront of technological development in the financial markets, and
banks are keen to operate in those areas where higher margins can be
charged.
However, innovative instruments are often quickly subsumed into the
mainstream. Many products which once earned rich commissions for traders are
now widely understood and commonly available, and trade just like bond
markets. Indeed, some markets have become so liquid that they tend to drive
trading in the underlying cash market, rather than the other way around -
for example, the Bund future on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange (Liffe).
But at the other end of the scale, the market in specially-tailored
products, designed to suit the specific needs of a corporate treasurer or a
fund manager, is also growing. As soon as a financing technique invented by
a particular firm is no longer proprietary, derivative specialists start
looking for new twists. Banks no longer offer just straightforward options,
but a seemingly endless variety of products, such as caps and
range-forwards, which slightly alter the degree of exposure to different
market movements.
The technology used in the derivatives market is often applied throughout a
range of underlying products. Swap technology, allowing counterparties to
exchange interest-rate and currency flows, is now being applied to the
equity and commodity markets.
Futures contracts, once limited to interest-rate products, are being
developed on clean air and insurance at the Chicago Board of Trade, the
largest US exchange.
The application of some techniques is limited only by investor-demand, which
has not responded to some of the more outlandish products on offer.
The development of futures markets has also been fuelled by the
liberalisation of bond and equity markets in Europe and the Far East, which
has opened up new markets for investors and new sources of funds for
companies. The emphasis on US markets has shifted as investors focus more
keenly on European markets, boosting the market share of futures exchanges
outside the US last year to 47 per cent.
Absolute volume continues to grow, however. January was a record month for
exchanges and products in both Europe and the US. As well as a steady flow
of new products - and new exchanges - in Europe, other financial markets,
such as Latin America, are also set to join the fray.
The shape that futures markets will take is still hard to predict. Talk of
links between exchanges, common a few years ago, has faded, although there
are signs that cross-listing of products may become more common.
Equally, the automation of exchange-traded business has lagged expectations.
The Globex trading system - developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME), the CBOT and Reuters - is still being tested, after repeated delays
to its start-up schedule.
Although some efforts at screen-based trading have been successful, such as
the Deutsche Terminborse in Germany, the world's most actively traded
contracts still use the traditional open-outcry system.
The expansion of futures and options markets is expected to be fuelled by
growing use of derivatives by investment managers. The managed futures fund
industry in the US has grown dramatically in the last few years, and now has
about Dollars 20bn under management. There is also increasing interest in
managed futures in Japan.
In most parts of Europe, fund managers are less familiar with the
attractions of using futures and options than with the potential risks. In
the UK, the Securities and Investment Board last year opened the door for
unit trusts, offered to retail investors, to use futures, with certain
limitations. However, they have shown some resistance to the concept. Of the
two funds launched so far, only one was aimed at small retail investors.
But interest among European pension and insurance fund managers is gradually
growing, particularly in the use of futures to shift exposure from one
market to another, generally a more efficient method of asset allocation
than buying and selling in the cash market.
The level of sophistication among European corporate treasurers has
generally been quite high (with a few notable exceptions, such as
Allied-Lyons which last year lost Pounds 150m through its use of currency
options).
The use of derivative products has become almost a pre-requisite for larger
international companies, because it is no longer acceptable for companies to
blame poor performance on movements in the foreign exchange markets.
The derivative markets, both on the exchange-traded and the over-the-counter
sides of the business, continue to attract an increasing number of banks.
Indeed, some non-bank players have also entered the market, benefiting from
the decline of credit quality among many banks which, particularly in the
swap market, can have a negative impact on business. For example, AIG
Financial Products, a subsidiary of the large insurance company, American
International Group, has built up a successful swap business.
Some banks have tackled the issue of credit quality. Last year, Merrill
Lynch set up a specially-structured unit with a strong capital base, called
Merrill Lynch Derivate Products, which gained a triple-A rating.
Although other banks have considered that structure, many have fought shy in
the belief that the return on capital would be insufficient.
The decline in bank credits quality has left only a handful of
triple-A-rated banks. Consequently, the hurdle has dropped to double-A -
that is, banks only start to lose business when their rating falls below
double-A.
Credit concerns do not appear to have driven clients away from the OTC
market to the futures markets, where credit risk is assumed by the exchange.
Meanwhile, banks and broking firms are approaching the derivatives business
from many different angles, depending on their own strengths and on their
view of the market's future development.
Some firms, such as GNI, have concentrated on developing their expertise in
exchange-traded business. Others have developed specialist product units,
where highly complex instruments are tailored to suit clients' needs. One
example is Credit Suisse Financial Products, set up two years ago, which has
developed a highly-successful client-driven business.
Few firms can claim to offer a fully-comprehensive range of products across
the three main areas of interests rates, foreign exchange and equity, and
across both exchange-traded and OTC markets. Only a few banks, mainly US
investment banks, claim to offer such a spectrum. Swiss Bank Corporation,
which early this year took over O'Connor, the Chicago-based options trading
firm, is now well positioned to offer strength across the board.
Other banks, however, have grown their derivatives business on a more ad hoc
basis, according to the relevant underlying market, so that, for example,
equity derivative traders are part of an equities group.
No particular formula has proved the key to success. However, the most
profitable derivatives businesses have generally been the most innovative.
Bankers Trust, which has been at the forefront of origination of equity
derivatives, is generally cited as the classic example of a highly
profitable, highly specialised derivatives house.
The large number of new entrants to the market, including some Japanese
firms, is generally welcomed, because new players are seen as providers of
liquidity. However, as the market becomes more competitive - and the
complexity of hedging risk assumed in the course of OTC business increases -
some participants could lose out.
But, while banks may be in for some disappointment, their staff are
generally benefiting, particularly in expanding sectors such as equity
derivatives. According to a recent survey on futures and options salaries by
Jonathan Wren, the recruitment consultancy, the development of the equity
derivatives market in 1991 brought 'an enormous upswing in salaries.'

Gleneagles). The first Book of Records was published in 1955.
The twin brothers Ross and Norris McWhirter, who ran a facts agency, were
invisted by Guinness director Sir Hugh Beaver to put together a publication
which would settle bar arguments over the fastest, highest, largest records:
an idea which originated when out shooting, from a dispute over the
comparitive speed of game birds. The Book of Records has set its own record
as a top-selling copyright book, with sales of 23.9m worldwide in 1974,
sales now stand at 68m a year worldwide.
Nature of business: along with The Book of Records, now printed in 36 to 39
languages, Guinness Publishing also produces another 50 titles, including
The Encyclopedia, British Hit Singles, and the soon-to-be- published
Encyclopedia of Popular Music, as well as a range of novelty books. It also
franchises exhibitions around the world.
Turnover: in excess of pounds 10m a year, although exact figures are not
disclosed: nor is profit, as Guinness Publishing is a separate trading
entity but also a wholly owned subsidiary of Guinness. The Book of Records
represents about half the turnover, but contributes more than half the
profit, due to overseas royalties.
Employees: 50 in all, with headquarters in Enfield, north of London. Key
personnel include editorial director Donald McFarlen; Book of Records editor
Peter Matthews; and Alex Reid, systems manager.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (10): Willis Corroon -
Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THIS was a disappointing case study. The task was relatively simple
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
to take historical statistics from a corporate database and then present
them in a tablular form.
The implementation was extremely pedestrian. Using Lotus 1-2-3 as a
relational database is inappropriate. It is a spreadsheet, not a database.
While excellent for analysing data and performing 'what if' analyses, Lotus
is hopeless as a database. It is both slow and inefficient in this context.
Waiting 25 minutes to produce a report may seem quick compared with a
three-day wait, but it is still dreadful. The system was not slowed up by
the complexity of any analysis but by the poor design and incorrect use of
available tools.
Some of the ideas in the IT group were commendable. I applaud their approach
of disseminating best practices to non-computer-literate users. However,
their stranglehold on buying will probably stifle the staff in the longer
term or may simply be subverted. I was astonished to hear that they made no
changes to a proposed system after using Lotus as a fill-in replacement. It
seems inconceivable that the design was perfect and needed no modification.
Sadly, it imples that the group does not appreciate the value of learning
from prototypes. There was no apparent soliciting of ideas from
subsidiaries, nor transfer of technologies across the organisation.
One broker appeared happy with the system and felt that it gave Willis
Corroon a competitive advantage. In that sense, it should be considered a
success.
However, I suspect that it reflects more on the paucity of the offerings of
the competition rather than any credit to the system as it stands. Unless
Willis Corroon can address the issues and use appropriate tools, this slim
advantage will soon vanish.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Call for more aid to east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL and economic instability could worsen in eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States if western finance for urgent
infrastructural investment is not increased, Mr Percy Barnevik, president of
Asea Brown Boveri, warned yesterday.
At the annual results meeting of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, Mr
Barnevik urged increased western support for such projects and, especially,
spending to boost nuclear power station safety. Referring to President
Bush's response to the economic needs of the former Soviet Union and eastern
bloc countries, Mr Barnevik said: 'My advice to Europe's politicians is:
forget about America. This is a European matter'. Some Dollars 20bn-Dollars
60bn was needed to correct a huge 'safety deficiency' at the 60 east
European nuclear stations.
Of these, the 16 oldest Chernobyl-type stations were beyond rescue; it was
unlikely another 10 could be upgraded to western standards without heavy
investment. For the rest, 'fast, urgent safety measures' were needed. For
countries dependent on nuclear power for up to 50 per cent of their needs,
such as Bulgaria, gas turbines should be made available quickly.
Estonia should receive western finance to switch from making electricity
from oil shale, a 'terrible way to produce it'; 15 per cent of Estonia's
land surface had been destroyed in this way. The shortage of western aid is
the main reason for ABB's discouraging view on short-term business prospects
in eastern Europe. But Mr Barnevik remains convinced a huge long-term demand
exists.

FT  19 MAR 92 / Afghan veteran shocked by Vukovar: Russian soldiers join UN
peace-keepers in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

   DALJ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I NEVER saw anything like Vukovar in Afghanistan,' said Colonel Aleksandr
Khomchemkov, a Russian battalion commander of the United Nations
peacekeeping troops, of the devasted town in eastern Croatia.
Col Khomchemkov, who is part of the first ever Russian peacekeeping mission,
earlier this week arrived in Dalj, just 15 miles north of Vukovar. He says:
'It is a second Stalingrad, a terrible scene'. Just then a civilian officer,
anxious to adhere to the strict UN code of neutrality, nervously interrupts
to point out that Col. Khomchemkov's comparison refers only to the level of
destruction and not to the nature of the conflict.
Major Kumal Budhathoki, of the Royal Nepalese army, a veteran of two
previous peacekeeping missions in Lebanon, says everyone was shocked by
Vukovar, the town which bears grim witness to last year's three-month-long
battle between Serb irregulars backed by the federal army and Croat national
guards.
In Dalj, the scars of war are not as appalling as in Vukovar. The local
school building which last August was littered with the corpses of Croat
policemen and civilians and splattered in blood has been repainted. Here Col
Khomchemkov and some 45 UN officers are billeted as part of a reconnaissance
mission working to define the exact boundaries of the peacekeeping zone, set
up communications and find accommodation for the 14,000 troops due to be
despatched next month to three UN protected areas in Croatia.
Major Jan Mulder, of the Royal Dutch signal corps, said: 'Five years ago I
never would have said it was impossible to be in a joint force with
Russians. Now there is no enemy.'
All the officers appear to agree the main task is to keep the peace. Maj
Mulder did not appear concerned about the distant gunshots he heard
overnight.
Despite the optimistic predictions of success from the Belgian, Dutch,
Russian and Nepalese officers, they are aware of perils awaiting them. A
peace-keeper, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had served in Lebanon
but called the situation in eastern Croatia more dangerous. He says: 'In
Lebanon we were welcomed by all but a small segment of the population. Here
there is a great danger of being perceived as the enemy, either by the Serbs
or the Croats. Then there will be no hope at all of keeping the peace.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: An odd tax system to encourage investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From STEPHEN R BOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A lot of hot air has been spoken in the last week on the subject of
capital allowances and corporation tax. Norman Lamont suggested during his
Budget speech that the present UK corporation tax does not act as a drag on
investment. Would that this were so, but unfortunately all the research of
which I am aware indicates that this tax does discourage economically viable
investments.
The reason is not hard to find. For investment financed by borrowing,
companies can deduct the approximate costs of both depreciation and finance
through capital allowances and interest deductibility, so that the tax is
approximately neutral. For investment financed from retained profits, they
can claim only capital allowances.
The lack of any deduction for the cost of using equity finance comparable to
interest deductibility in the case of debt means that equity-financed
investment is discouraged. Since about three quarters of total company
investment is financed from retentions, corporation tax certainly acts as a
drag on investment. Estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest
that this drag could be the equivalent of an extra two percentage points on
interest rates for investing companies. Add to this the discouragement that
business rates impose on business investment in buildings and the combined
effect begins to look serious.
The Labour party's response is a curious melange. Its 'shadow' Budget
proposal gives, for a temporary period only, a small subsidy to investment
in manufacturing plant and machinery. This form of investment accounts for
only one-fifth of total company investment in the UK, so the remaining
four-fifths would be unaffected.
Just why manufacturing investment in plant and machinery should temporarily
be singled out for special treatment is hard to fathom. While this would
achieve a modest and short-lived stimulus to this form of investment, it
looks like a very odd way to run a tax system.

FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland news surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, TERRY BYLAND, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIMING of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's agreed bid for Midland Bank
surprised the London market and triggered a burst of speculative buying
throughout the sector.
Midland Bank shares were immediately marked sharply higher, amid growing
speculation that a counter-bid could be in the pipeline. Shares in other
banks perceived to hold attractions for overseas bidders also came in for
heavy support.
The market's surprise at the news was evident from the performance of
Midland's shares. They opened marginally firmer at 254p and then rocketed,
according to dealers, to around 340p bid before coming off on profit-taking
and closing a net 76 ahead at 329p. Turnover had jumped to around 22m shares
by the close.
Traders spoke of the possibility of counter-offers to the Hongkong Bank bid.
In recent weeks there has been a series of rumours linking Midland with
Lloyds Bank and Barclays. Last week the market was rife with the story that
Hongkong Bank would launch a rights issue with its full-year figures to help
finance a bid for Midland.
Banking specialists said a Hongkong Bank bid for Midland would have to
approach 400p to succeed and that in the event of a contested bid the
takeout price would probably be in the region of 500p.
TSB, regarded as a potential bid target in the sector, improved 5 1/2 to 131
1/2 p on turnover of 13.6m. Royal Bank of Scotland, subject of an
unsuccessful Hongkong Bank bid around a decade ago, put on 6 to 176p. Lloyds
Bank's rumoured interest in Midland chopped the Lloyds share price by 6 to
388p in turnover of 3.8m shares. Standard Chartered, which fought off a
Lloyds Bank takeover attempt in the mid-1980s, added 10 at 443p.
Barclays Bank rose 5 to 341p, NatWest 7 to 302p and Abbey National 6 to
275p.
Hanson busy
Industrial conglomerate Hanson was the subject of speculative talk that it
was considering mounting a 'mega-bid' shortly. There were a number of
potential targets being rumoured, with some talk focusing on Lonrho, the
international trading group.
Tobacco concern BAT Industries was also being touted as a possible target,
although other suggestions were that Lord Hanson's group might make a large
disposal, with BAT being mentioned as a potential buyer of its Imperial
tobacco business.
Hanson shares added 4 1/2 at 223p in turnover of 5.7m, Goldman Sachs leading
strong buying from the US. Lonrho rebounded 14 to 99p in average turnover of
7.4m, while BAT was up 7 1/2 at 655p.
MTM activity
Bid speculation swirled around MTM, the specialty chemicals group, following
the apparent rejection by the Stock Exchange of requests for suspension of
the share quotation in the wake of two profits warnings within a week and an
official enquiry by the Exchange.
The shares closed 16 higher at 107p, making an advance of around 43 per cent
over the past two trading sessions. Traders believe that any predator, which
is likely to come from the blue chip ranks, might have to pay as much as
130p a share for the equity, valued at about Pounds 115m after allowing for
MTM's debt of Pounds 70m. However, trading volume yesterday was light at
well under 1m shares.
News that US investors have in excess of 10.6 per cent of BP stock, compared
with holdings last revealed in the region of 8.7 per cent, helped to keep
the BP share price steady at 266 1/2 p in good turnover of 6.5m.
Last week's BZW buy note prompted further support for Enterprise Oil, which
gained 7 to 378p. A suggestion that Norwich Union was about to unload a
large block of Goal Petroleum was regarded as unlikely by oil sector
specialists, who said a selling order in recent days could have been
misinterpreted by the market. However, Goal lost 3 to 41p.
Housebuilding and construction group George Wimpey raced up 16 to 147p after
the company announced a maintained dividend and a reduction in gearing to
around 35 per cent.
The fall in WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, was extended
as the market reacted to the fall in profits and dividend omission announced
this week. At 68p, the shares lost 12, after dropping 15 on Monday.
Elsewhere in the media sector, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi closed little changed at
17p on turnover of 16.6m, with advertising shares paying little immediate
heed to the optimism emanating from the US after the latest statistics on
housing starts.
Trading in Glaxo was subdued as the London market awaited developments from
France, where an official enquiry has been mounted into the group's
promotion of Imigran, a migraine treatment. The stock fell 12 to 771p with
2.9m shares traded as US sellers made their presence felt in London.
UK analysts regard the latest developments as casting further uncertainty
over Glaxo's pricing policies, but point out that the official moves in
France and Denmark - hints of similar moves in Italy were not believed
yesterday - imply recognition of the large markets on hand for Glaxo's
products.
The drugs sector remained under the shadow cast by the prospective sale of
Wellcome shares, and also by the signs of economic recovery in the US which
will switch investment attention away from defensive stocks, such as the
pharmaceuticals, and towards the cyclical sector.
However, most pharmaceutical leaders followed the general advance in UK
equities and also benefited from the brighter tone on Wall Street.
SmithKline Beecham rose 7 to 872p and Fisons added 10 1/2 at 366p as the
Midland deal revived bid speculation across the range of the market.
Wellcome remained dull, easing 2 to 963p in late trade.
Following the news on Midland Bank, renewed bid talk dominated the
industrial and engineering sector. Vickers, 8 stronger at 162p, Glynwed
International, ahead 5 at 230p, and Morgan Crucible, 8 higher at 255p, all
found themselves the subject of fresh takeover talk.
Dowty Group climbed 7 to 115p after chief executive Mr Bruce Ralph told a
news agency that the aerospace and polymer group was close to finding a
partner for its loss-making information technology division.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'A deal in the next few months would
bring much needed cash and transform the Dowty balance sheet.' The share
price has been undermined in recent weeks over dividend fears. Dowty
executives were meeting institutions at James Capel yesterday and were
believed to be soothing nerves over the dividend payment in the light of the
IT talks.
BTR announced it was undergoing a 'strategic review' which would include the
disposal of the group's 59 per cent stake in Hawker Siddeley Canada.
Analysts estimated this could fetch Pounds 100m. The shares rose 8 to 412p.
Optimism over the US economy helped Siebe to add 13 at 607p and TI Group 15
at 640p.
A profits warning following a fall in the share price of Rothmans Holdings
in Australia had no immediate effect on Rothmans International. In London,
Rothmans International 'B' nudged a penny higher to 1039p.
Among food retailers, Tesco gained support from a Kleinwort Benson
recommendation, rising 5 1/2 to 252 1/2 p. Kwik Save climbed 8 to 562p on a
more positive view expressed by analysts about the company's long-term
prospects. This followed a recent profits downgrading on concern that
price-cutting to protect its market share would erode margins. Another firm
feature of the sector was Iceland Frozen Foods, gaining 4 to 464p on hopes
of good figures next week.
Stores were slightly firmer overall, in spite of a lack of any great
enthusiasm about today's retail sales data, which is expected to show flat
volume in February. Marks and Spencer finished 4 1/2 higher at 319p, while
Lloyds Chemists continued to attract demand, rising 4 to 347p.
Encouraging comments from Hoare Govett about Hillsdown, and the general view
that the shares are undervalued, pushed the price up 2 to 176p.
Brewing and other drinks groups were generally firm. Guinness was 8 higher
at 568p and Bass rose 6 to 549p.

FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bank merger dominates share trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON equity market was dominated by the surprise news that Midland
Bank is to merge with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Shrugging
off poor UK economic and industrial statistics yesterday and resisting
pressure from the derivative markets, shares put on their first strong
performance for more than a week.
The FT-SE 100 Index opened firmly, bouncing back from the slide prompted by
disappointment over the governing Conservative party's Budget. It reached
its day's high within the first half-hour of official business.
Budget proposals by the opposition Labour party on Monday had tended to
allay the fears of traditionally conservative City observers. Political
optimism was boosted in the City by an opinion poll favourable to the
Conservatives and this helped the index to maintain its early strength.
However, the level of genuine business remained low throughout the day, with
only the banking sector sparking real excitement. Volume was principally
generated by dealing between marketmakers, with the institutions staying on
the sidelines ahead of the April 9 general election.
In fact, the day belonged to Midland. The bank's shares rose sharply
following the merger announcement and held their strength as traders hoped
that a contested bid might develop. The stock was the most heavily traded on
the Stock Exchange yesterday, as well as on the floor of the London Traded
Options Market.
The news also prompted heavy activity in a number of bank stocks as the
merger announcement was perceived as a sign that the Bank of England might
allow other takeovers within the sector.
In addition, the news revived interest in likely bid targets across the
range of the market. There were suggestions that beleaguered Lonrho might
attract a suitor, and other possible targets such as Smith &amp; Nephew, BAT
Industries and BTR received a fillip.
This positive attitude helped to counterbalance the announcements that
industrial output in the UK had fallen by 1.3 per cent and that the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement was worse than previously forecast.
It was also enough to help the cash market resist pressure from traders at
the Financial Futures exchange who, taking a more downbeat view, were
dealing the FT-SE 100 contract for March delivery at a discount to its
estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account dividends and
carrying costs.
Any tendency for shares to drift back during the afternoon was offset by a
healthy opening on Wall Street, which rose following the announcement of
encouraging US economic statistics. There was also a positive input from a
firm pound.
Nevertheless, there were some short-term losers, particularly Glaxo, which
suffered as a result of a French decision to investigate the marketing of
the pharmaceutical company's migraine drug Imigran.
By the market's close, the FT-SE Index was 20.5 better at 2,491.2, with the
rise in Midland Bank accounting for almost four points of that gain. The
Seaq ticker showed a turnover of 450m shares, above the previous day's
363.5m shares, which represented retail business worth only Pounds 676m.
However, yesterday's volume was extremely disappointing considering the bid
activity.

FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good housing starts help to
boost Dow
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
ENCOURAGING signs of economic recovery and lower US bond yields helped
equities move higher yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.68 higher at 3,256.04 after
moderate New York SE volume of 189m shares. Advancing stocks led those
declining by 1,057 to 651.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 3.19 at 409.58, while the Nasdaq composite
of over-the-counter stocks climbed 5.33 to 623.27.
The stock market took strength from more encouraging news about the US
economy, with February housing starts up 9.5 per cent after a 5.5 per cent
increase in January. Many players had expected static housing starts this
time. In addition, the slim recovery in Tokyo after Monday's stock market
plunge gave some support to US stocks.
Lower bond yields also helped. In late trading, the treasury's benchmark
30-year bond was  21/32 higher at 99 13/16 , yielding 8.01 per cent. Yields
had initially risen as the bond market reacted to the February housing
starts, but prices then turned higher on weaker than expected February
industrial production figures.
The equity market was further encouraged by the slight 0.3 per cent increase
in February's consumer price index, which indicated that economic recovery
might not be accompanied by inflation.
Singer, the sewing machine manufacturer, was one of the most active big
board issues of the day, rising Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 7/8 after the
company sold 7m shares at Dollars 21.875 each in an offering priced late on
Monday.
Unisys was actively traded for a second day in the wake of bullish
first-quarter forecasts by company executives, who said that the computer
company would post a profit for the first quarter, usually its weakest

FT  18 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar ignores strong figures

THE DOLLAR retreated from initial gains to test support at DM1.6490
yesterday, in spite of more encouraging US economic figures, writes Neil
Buckley.
February housing starts rose 9.6 per cent to 1.304m, against the 1.176m
expected, and was the largest increase for a year; industrial production
showed a slightly smaller than expected rise of 0.6 per cent, but was still
a turnround from a 0.9 per cent fall in January; and consumer prices rose
0.3 per cent (after 0.1 per cent in January), in line with expectations.
The dollar bulls had hoped these figures would take the currency higher. But
the market seems to have already priced in a US economic recovery, and a
push above DM1.66 only brought sellers.
The US unit closed at DM1.6500/10, after a DM1.6525/35 start, its lowest for
nearly a fortnight, and was easier at Y133.30/40 from Y133.50/60. Later in
New York it ended at DM1.6455 and Y132.80.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, said: 'Yesterday's figures
added to the accumulating evidence that the US recovery is under way. But
this was not sufficiently powerful for the dollar to break through strong
resistance at DM1.6720, and we could see further slippage in the near term.'
He added that economic fundamentals still favoured the dollar in the long
term, and most dealers still expect it to reach DM1.80 by the third quarter.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar firmed against the yen but barely moved against
the D-Mark in late trading, after falling sharply at first. Dealers said US
investors, Middle East speculators and Bank Negara, the Malaysian central
bank, had been active sellers of the dollar against the D-Mark. It closed at
Y133.32 and DM1.6528.
The D-Mark rose against most EMS currencies, as faint rumours circulated
that the Bundesbank might raise interest rates at its council meeting
tomorrow.
Even though money supply growth and inflation data have been high recently,
most dealers said they doubted that the bank would lift rates, but the
market was nevertheless squa-ring short D-Mark positions.
The Bank of Italy was said to have been forced to sell Ecu30m to support the
lira, which reached a technical low against the D-Mark of L753.80, before
rallying to L751.84/94.
Sterling finished at DM2.8610/15, up from a previous DM2.8578/83. Although
still near its floor against the top-placed peseta, it strengthened to 47
per cent of its allowed divergence below the central rate, from 51 per cent.
It was boosted by an opinion poll showing the governing Conservative party
three points ahead of the Labour opposition. It wobbled only briefly after
UK industrial output and PSBR figures, which one dealer called
'unambiguously awful'.
The pound also benefited from a weaker dollar, ending at Dollars 1.7340, up
from Dollars 1.7155. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.7355.
