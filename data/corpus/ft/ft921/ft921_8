FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Nikkei's decline ruffles
Japanese bankers - Capital-to-assets ratios are threatened by falling share
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHAN WAGSTYL

<TEXT>
THE Nikkei index's fall below 20,000 on Monday gave many financial
executives a sleepless night as they worked out the impact on their
companies. For Japanese bankers, the calculations were especially
nerve-racking.
The banks' main concern is the effect of falling share prices on their
capital reserves. Under rules set by the Bank for International Settlements,
Japanese banks are allowed to count as capital a portion of unrealised gains
on their stock holdings.
The more the market falls, the smaller are the unrealised gains. At the
20,000 level, leading commercial banks are close to the 8 per cent ratio of
capital to assets which the BIS has set as a minimum. As Mr Reese Harasawa,
a financial manager at Mitsubishi Bank, said: 'We are at the critical
level.'
The BIS standard does not apply until next year. But banks cannot afford to
wait until then to put their balance sheets in order. They must act now to
bolster capital and cut asset growth.
Moreover, banks are also suffering from an overhang of bad and doubtful debt
incurred during the speculative boom of the 1980s. Some of these loans will
have to be written off against reserves - further eroding the banks' capital
and reducing their ability to expand lending. As much as possible, banks
will try to avoid write-offs by taking possession of land and stocks held as
collateral and waiting for an opportunity to sell. But this could take
years.
As Mr Masashi Kojima, the president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, said
yesterday: 'It will take banks two years to really determine whether they
can recover their bad debts and decide which of the borrowers will survive
and which will die.'
For borrowers, in Japan and overseas, that means that credit will be harder
to obtain and more expensive. So far, the domestic impact has been largely
limited to property investments, where hard-pressed companies are being
squeezed by a collapse in asset prices and a rise in the cost of servicing
loans.
For the Japanese economy as a whole, the threat of a credit crunch still
lies in the future. With economic growth slowing, companies are running down
inventories and cutting capital investments, so their credit needs are
shrinking. The money supply, including loans, grew by just 1.8 per cent in
January, compared with same month in 1991 - a record low.
However, if the economy picks up later this year, as the authorities hope, a
shortage of credit could emerge as a serious constraint on growth. The
assets of Japanese city banks (big commercial institutions), which grew by
an annual rate of over 10 per cent in the late 1980s, increased by an
estimated 5 per cent in the year to the end of March and could grow by just
4 per cent next year, according to Mr Hiroki Akimoto, banking analyst at
Nomura Securities.
If the economy fails to recover as quickly as the government expects, then
the threat of a squeeze on credit would also recede. However, this will also
bring banks little relief since slower economic growth would erode their
customers' profits and so push more borrowers into financial difficulties.
In the meantime, banks are doing what they can to shore up their balance
sheets. Most importantly, they have taken advantage of falling interest
rates to widen their lending margins. So basic business profits for the year
to end-March should rise sharply - by around 30 per cent for city banks,
according to industry estimates.
Pre-tax and net profits, which take account of loan write-offs, stock
investment losses and other charges, will decline but not by as much as was
once feared. The worst result among leading banks is likely to come from
scandal-hit Fuji Bank, which has suffered losses associated with a
fraudulent loan scheme. Fuji has forecast a 74.9 per cent decline in net
profits to Y30bn - a poor result, but one that still leaves the bank in the
black.
Another step taken by banks to defend balance sheets is securing
subordinated loans, which count as capital under BIS rules.
The city banks have raised around Y1,700bn so far in this financial year and
plan to raise a further Y300bn or so by the end of the month. This follows
Y4,000bn raised in the 1990 financial year. The funds come largely from life
insurance companies.
Even these large cash injections could be dwarfed by large-scale write-offs
of bad loans. Banks keep silent about the true extent of their problems.
Under Japanese regulations they are not required to publish figures for the
size of bad and doubtful debts.
The Ministry of Finance may change the rules next year but even then many
problem debts are expected to stay hidden. Outside estimates of the bad and
doubtful loans of the big banks range up to Y20,000bn. Not all this money
will be lost because banks could eventually sell land held as security.
Some banks are much worse off than others. Long-term credit banks and trust
banks generally have stronger BIS ratios than commercial banks. But their
exposure to problem debtors is also bigger.
City banks generally are less exposed to property-related debts because
their branch networks gave them better information about market conditions
and the status of borrowers.
Each lurch of the Nikkei prompts banks to reassess their BIS ratios. They
must watch the yen, too, since exchange rate movements alter the value of
overseas assets, and so change the ratios.
So far Japanese banks have managed to keep their problem debts mainly under
cover. However, if the Nikkei falls any lower or the bad debts go much
higher, some banks at least would find it impossible to meet the regulators'
requirements.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: GPA reveals cast for flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, which
is due to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in June, has announced
the full cast of country lead managers for the deal.
The flotation could value GPA at between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 3.75bn,
based on a share price of Dollars 20 to Dollars 25. GPA is expected to issue
30m new shares, bringing the total number in the company to 150m.
Since GPA made its preliminary filing with the US Securities Exchange
Commission last week, the various country managers have started to build up
a book of investor demand for the issue. Allocations will then be decided
according to demand from the various investor centres, rather than being set
in advance.
Nomura is global co-ordinator and lead manager for the equity offering in
Japan. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers are co-leads for
the US, while Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Schroders are sponsors for the UK
offering.
The managers for the remaining centres of investor interest are: Swiss Bank
Corporation (Switzerland); ScotiaMcLeod (Canada); Dresdner (Germany); Banque
Indosuez (France); ABN-Amro (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg); and
Nomura and SBC (the rest of the world).
The IPO is intended to increase GPA's equity capital base, provide a public
market in its shares, and help finance the group's aircraft acquisition
programme. The group is committed to paying a total of Dollars 21.6bn for
new aircraft - if options to buy further aircraft are included - up to the
year 2000.
Full details will be announced after the publication of GPA's fourth-quarter
results in May, and the IPO will take place about a month later.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Toyota and GM strike Australian
joint venture deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA of Japan and General Motors of the US yesterday announced a merger of
some of the activities of their Australian subsidiaries in a joint venture
company - United Australian Automotive Industries (UAAI).
UAAI will co-ordinate the design, engineering and model-sharing activities
of General Motors-Holden's Automotive (GMHA) and Toyota Australia.
However, the Australian subsidiaries will maintain separate corporate
structures and their manufacturing and sales activities will remain largely
unchanged.
The deal falls significantly short of early indications that the venture
would take control of both companies' production facilities in Australia.
UAAI, formed in 1988, was intended to run the two companies' production from
July 1989. The more modest agreement is thought to be the result of
corporate differences between the two groups.
Toyota has also committed itself to building a ADollars 420m (USDollars
315.70m) manufacturing plant on a greenfield site in Melbourne. GMHA has no
plans for expansion.
Senator John Button, the Australian industry minister, said the completion
of the agreement was an 'historic decision' which would enable the companies
to achieve economies of scale and efficiency savings.
However, the agreement appeared to offer little progress towards the
government's objective of a more streamlined industry capable of competing
in an open market against overseas imports.
The joint venture proposal emerged after the announcement in 1985 of a
government rationalisation plan for the industry, in which five
foreign-owned manufacturers compete for a market of 17m people.
The plan provided for tariff protection to be progressively reduced from a
nominal rate of 57.5 per cent in 1985 to 35 per cent from January this year.
The government announced last May that tariff protection would be cut by a
further 2.5 points a year from next year, to a target of 15 per cent by
2000, to force the companies to speed up rationalisation.
New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated (NUMMI), the US-based joint
car-making venture between GM and Toyota, said its board has approved a
Dollars 339m investment for the production of the 1993 Toyota Corolla model
and the Geo Prizm, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
A top Ford Motor executive has called for trade restrictions aimed at
Japanese car-makers.
Mr Allan Gilmour, who heads Ford's worldwide automotive division, said Ford
would like to see Japan limit exports to the US to about 1.3m vehicles a
year. This would compare with current Japanese exports to the US of about
1.7m units a year, well below the 2.3m limit agreed by Japanese car makers
and the Japanese government.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move higher on US industrial
output data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices firmed yesterday following the release of a
weaker-than-expected US industrial production report for February.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was  5/8 higher at 99 25/32 ,
yielding 8.01 per cent, while the three-year note was up  1/4 to yield 6.26
per cent.
US industrial production rose 0.6 per cent in the month, below the estimated
0.8 per cent the market had expected. Similarly, US capacity utilisation was
reported at 78.2 per cent, below the forecast 78.5 per cent.
Price movements were exaggerated by the light volume.
The market initially moved lower on a report that housing starts for
February had risen 9.6 per cent to a rate of 1.3m, well above forecasts. In
addition, building permits rose significantly in the month, by 4.4 per cent,
to a rate of 1.16m.
There was little reaction to an increase of 0.3 per cent in the February
consumer price index, which matched with expectations. Stripping out the
volatile food and energy components, it rose 0.4 per cent.
The Federal Reserve arranged overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed
funds were trading at 4 3/16 per cent, above the Fed's perceived 4 per cent
target.
UK government bonds rallied by up to half a percentage point, helped by the
Conservative party's stronger performance in the opinion polls and firmness
in the US Treasury bond market.
An opinion poll published in the Daily Express newspaper gave the Tories a
three-point lead over the opposition Labour party. Traders said the gilt
market, which fell back sharply after last week's Budget and is now seen as
oversold, opened on a firmer note and strengthened during the day on
futures-driven trade.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 94.31, up on Monday's close of
94.23, and traded up to 95.09 by late afternoon. In the cash market, the
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 112 5/8 at the
opening to 113 7/32 .
The announcement of a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn for
February had little impact on the gilt market, although traders said it was
above expectations and seen as an indication of further deterioration in
public sector finances. The market is expected to focus on tomorrow's
unemployment figures and Friday's retail prices index.
THE US bond market's strength helped lift German government bond prices,
with the Liffe bund futures contract rising from 88.04 at the opening to
88.20 by late afternoon.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch bond market firmed slightly as traders
reported further buying interest in the latest tap issue. The Dutch Finance
Ministry's debt management agency said it had raised Fl 1.7bn of the 8 1/4
per cent Dutch bond due 2007 so far this week. The tap price, which was set
at 100.05 initially, was raised to 100.10.
The tap issue has attracted mainly domestic interest, as it appeals to
pension and insurance funds. Traders reported switching out of 10-year
issues into the 15-year tap.
JAPANESE government bonds rose on rumours that the Bank of Japan was about
to cut the official discount rate.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.42 per cent,
traded between 5.37 and 5.42 per cent and ended the day at 5.385 per cent.
The futures contract climbed from 102.50 to 102.64.
Rumours that the central bank was about to cut the official discount rate by
between 75 and 100 basis points circulated in the markets, and traders said
the continued stock market weakness reinforced hopes of an easing in rates.
Short-term interest rates edged lower, with three-month certificates of
deposit trading at between 4.90 and 4.92 per cent.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO Financiero Bancomer (GFB), the holding company comprising Mexico's
second largest bank, has placed Dollars 836.7m of stock in the international
markets, in an offering that enables the group to meet the final payment due
on the recently-privatised bank.
The private placement, arranged in the US, priced each Mexican 'C' and 'B'
share at 4,200 pesos (Dollars 1.38), and each American Depositary Share,
worth 20 Mexican 'C' shares, at Dollars 27.50.
In early trading, the ADS price rose to Dollars 32, reflecting the
enthusiasm with which the offering was taken up. GFB had aimed to raise
Dollars 500m from the placement, but increased the number of shares
available last week due to heavy demand.
In the months preceding the placement, GFB sold Dollars 298m of 'C' shares,
bringing the proceeds from recent share sales to Dollars 1.13bn.
The Mexican government sold 56 per cent of the equity in Bancomer late last
year for a sum, including subsequent accrued interest, that has risen to
Dollars 2.88bn. Mr Ricardo Guajardo, head of Bancomer, said that Dollars
300m from the placement would be used to meet the final payment of Dollars
1.73bn due on April 6, and the rest to buy up shares in GFB and its
subsidiaries.
Grupo Financiero Banamex, which contains Mexico's largest bank, is expected
to announce soon its international share offering, although for a much
smaller sum.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: RH Macy records Dollars 671m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
R. H. MACY, the large US department store chain which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, yesterday announced an after-tax
loss of Dollars 671.6m in the three months to February 1 - covering the key
Christmas sales period.
The figures, however, are confused by various write-off and restructuring
charges.
The company made a Dollars 499.8m loss before interest and reorganisation
expenses, but after a Dollars 284.9m unusual item. This compared with a
Dollars 182.5m surplus in the same period a year earlier - when there were
no unusual items.
The 'above-the-line' unusual items derive principally from a Dollars 241m
write-off of goodwill, in turn related to the purchase of the I. Magnin and
Bullocks divisions from Federated Department Stores in 1988. There is also a
Dollars 40m charge to cover the costs of realigning the group in the 'east'
and 'west' divisions.
The interest charge for the period dropped sharply, to Dollars 68.9m from
Dollars 178.3m but Macy then incurred a further Dollars 102.9m charge for
reorganisation expenses. Within this figure, the retail group is charging
Dollars 76m for store closings, Dollars 16m for deferred debt expenses, and
Dollars 8m for the write-off of preferred stock issuance costs.
Sales for the period totalled Dollars 2.05bn, a decrease of 6.4 per cent
from the same quarter in 1990-1. On a same-store basis, Macy said that the
fall was slightly reduced, to a 3.4 per cent decline.
For the first six months of the financial year, Macy's sales now total
Dollars 3.66bn - a 0.5 per cent fall on a comparable store basis.
Macy added that cash and cash equivalents on hand at March 13 totalled
Dollars 250m. It added that it has not yet used the Dollars 600m
debtor-in-possession financing facility which has been approved by the
bankruptcy court.
It said that it does not expect to do so in the spring season, although part
of the facility has been committed for overseas letters of credit.

British Petroleum's proven oil reserves declined by 4 per cent, from 4.65bn
barrels in 1990 to 4.44bn barrels last year. The company's gas reserves
slipped from 11bn cu ft to 10.92bn cu ft.
The company, which published the new reserve figures in its annual report,
said the downward revisions came after disposals and a change of 96m barrels
in its estimate of Canadian bitumen reserves.
Oil production, however, rose last year to 1.4m barrels a day from 1.3m b/d
previously.
BP's proven oil reserves have been declining for the past four years and the
company has embarked on an ambitious exploration programme in order to widen
its reserve base.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hold back Refuge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCENTRATION ON its core life insurance activities helped Refuge Group
report pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m for 1991.
The outcome compared with restated profits of Pounds 13.8m last time, but
was struck after exceptional provisions of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 705,000) for
bad and doubtful debts in the personal finance subsidiary.
Life net premium income expanded 13 per cent to Pounds 213m over the year as
the division's attributable profits rose from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 15m.
In contrast, general insurance succumbed to the depressed sector trend and
incurred increased losses of Pounds 708,000 (Pounds 469,000). Most premium
rates have been increased in recent months.
Losses in the Douglas Allen Spiro estate agency side amounted to Pounds
1.54m (Pounds 1.33m), but Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said there were signs that
the housing market was beginning to show improvement.
Earnings per share were virtually unchanged at 25.81p (25.6p). A proposed
final dividend of 20p brings the total for 1991 to 29p (26.75p).

B Elliott, the machine tool and engineering company, has reached agreement
with its bankers for a revised credit facility, writes Richard Gourlay.
As part of the facility, the group has agreed to suspend all preference and
convertible dividend payments.
Sir Norman Fowler, the former cabinet minister who joined Elliott as
non-executive director last July, resigned on March 13.
The group, which has watched its shares fall from 80p to less than 10p in
the past year, has recently been the subject of bid speculation.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Federal Express to cut 3,400 jobs in UK: US parcels delivery
service retreats from its loss-making European operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEDERAL Express, the US parcels delivery service, is cutting nearly 3,400
jobs in the UK in a restructuring of its loss-making European operations.
The Memphis-based group is closing 36 of its 39 sites in Britain as part of
a retrenchment that will cut 7,000 jobs, or 72 per cent of the European
workforce.
The move represents a significant retreat by Federal Express which devoted
the latter half of the 1980s to very aggressive international expansion, but
which has faced mounting losses from its international operations in recent
years. Like many other express package carriers, Federal Express had banked
on a rapid expansion of the European express package delivery market, partly
from '1992' harmonisation moves.
However, executives calculated yesterday that the intra-European express
package market remains at around 100,000 a day, compared with 2m-3m in the
US market.
Executives also admitted yesterday that there were problems integrating its
air-based intercontinental and US delivery systems with the predominantly
'ground-based' intra-European operations, and said it overestimated the cost
savings.
Federal Express has also faced tough competition from Brussels-based DHL
Worldwide Express, which is arguably better-known in Europe and more used to
dealing with European language and customs requirements.
Federal Express said it would discontinue all its intra-European express
services, and concentrate instead on providing a direct intercontinental
service between 16 European cities and the US. As part of the overhaul, the
US group will sell much of its remaining UK business to Securicor Omega
Express, Britain's largest independent carrier of overnight parcels.
Securicor Omega will increase its workforce by 400 as a result. It will also
act as a subcontractor for Federal's international package business, to and
from UK locations no longer served by the US carrier.
In a separate agreement, Federal Express said that it had arranged for TNT
Express Worldwide, the Australian delivery company, to provide a similar
sub-contractor service for inbound deliveries from the US to 10 other
European countries - mainly Scandinavia and the smaller Mediterranean
countries.
Financial details of the sale and subcontractor agreements were not
disclosed. Federal Express added that it expected to announce further
subcontractor arrangements for the French, German and Italian markets during
the 'next few days'. The 16 cities which it will continue to serve directly
include London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Zurich, and six in Germany.
The retrenchment will account for a large portion of a Dollars 254m (Pounds
144m) charge to operating expenses in its third quarter. Federal Express's
results showed a total operating loss (after this charge) of Dollars 250.6m
for the period, and an after-tax deficit of Dollars 193.4m.
The international division made an operating loss of Dollars 125.5m before
charges during the three months - up from Dollars 70.6m a year earlier - on
revenues of Dollars 602.1m. The company declined to say how much of this
related to the operations it will now cease operating.
Shares in Federal Express, which has been rumoured to be in talks with TNT
over its European operations for months, gained Dollars 2 to close at
Dollars 55 1/4 yesterday with analysts divided over whether Federal Express
had taken sufficient action to address its international problems.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Wimpey holds payout after Pounds 16m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, the large contractor and Britain's second biggest
housebuilder, yesterday announced its first pre-tax loss for at least half a
century.
The group - after provisions of Pounds 46.4m mostly against UK and US
housing land and a separate Pounds 12m provision against the Channel tunnel
construction contract - incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.1m. This
compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 43.3m in 1990.
It was the worst setback for the company since it was acquired in the 1920s
by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, founder of the modern-day Wimpey group.
Wimpey's shares, in spite of the expected profits decline, rose 16p
yesterday to 147p. The share price has risen a third since February 12 when
it stood at 110p.
The stock market, which has been encouraged by Wimpey's success in reducing
borrowings through disposals, was further cheered yesterday by its decision
to maintain its total dividend payment for last year at 10.5p.
Wimpey had to transfer Pounds 53.8m from reserves to cover dividend payments
and a Pounds 23.5m after-tax loss. The company made a loss per share, after
exceptional items, of 7.53p. This compared with earnings per share of 8.31p
in 1990.
Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, who said he had recently detected
flickers of life in the UK and US housing markets, defended a unanimous
decision by directors to maintain dividend payments.
He said it was the responsibility of companies in cyclical industries, such
as construction, to smooth out peaks and troughs and maintain a steady
reasonable return to shareholders - provided the balance sheet could afford
it and it did not impair future profitability.
At the end of last year Wimpey had reduced net debt by almost Pounds 100m to
Pounds 206.4m. As a result, gearing had fallen from 48 per cent to 35 per
cent.
Since the summer the group has raised Pounds 300m from commercial property
sales and the disposal of its waste management and offshore engineering
businesses. The group had identified another Pounds 100m of potential
disposals of which about half was expected to come from sales of investment
properties in the US.
Mr Dwyer said he was particularly encouraged by tentative signs of a revival
in the UK and US housing markets. Wimpey's UK house sales in the first 2 1/2
months of this year were running about 10 per cent higher than the company
had budgeted for. 'I believe we are now at the bottom of the cycle,' said Mr
Dwyer.

FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a touch of desperation about yesterday's announcement from
Isosceles that its Herman's and Wellworth chains are up for sale. The group
has long wanted to reduce its debt, although there is no formal requirement
to do so until next year. Perhaps its bankers are nervous. Selling
Wellworth, perhaps by a trade sale or management buy-out rather than the
suggested flotation, might bring in Pounds 150m. That looks mean given that
Northern Ireland's leading food and mixed retailer made Pounds 17.7m pre-tax
profit last year, but buyers have to consider the unique location.
As for Herman's, it looks increasingly as if Isosceles was wrong not to go
for an immediate fire-sale in 1989. While the sporting goods chain has been
improved and is apparently now profitable at the operating level, the market
for US retailing assets has crashed. Herman's book value was Pounds 194m at
the end of Isosceles' last financial year, but whether it will fetch that is
an open question.
In theory, paring its operations down to mainland UK food retailing ought to
enhance the attractions of a flotation. The problem is that there is no end
in sight to Gateway's suffering in the high street, and the Food Giant and
Somerfield shops are far from established. Investors might indeed find
Isosceles easier to understand. The danger is they will understand it all
too well.

FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey's dividend decision was always going to be one of the closest calls
of the current reporting season. In the end, shareholders can probably thank
Wessex Water for the maintained payout, though the disposal of Wimpey's
waste management business for what now looks like a fancy price was just one
element of last year's extensive balance sheet repairs. In rejecting a
dividend cut, the board may also have been conscious of the commercial
advantages to be gained from the contrast with weaker competitors.
For all the plaudits rightly heaped on chief executive Joe Dwyer, it would
not do to swallow the claim that Wimpey has ridden the current recession
without scars. There are certainly scratches. A mere 7 per cent fall in
group net assets, for instance, is undeniably impressive given the apparent
thoroughness of the provisions, but the reduction would have been greater
without the handy Pounds 45m revaluation surplus on group owned and used
properties. There will also be a Pounds 16m gap in this year's profits from
businesses which have been sold.
More pertinent for investors is how Wimpey exploits its newly restored
financial health to recapture the art of earnings growth. Housebuilding
hardly looks exciting for a volume player these days, a view implicit in
Wimpey's indication that this activity should be self-financing. Contracting
may labour under a Channel Tunnel cloud for a couple of years, while the
scope for adding to minerals is not limitless. At 147p the shares are
underpinned by a 9.5 per cent yield. Wimpey will have to prove that resumed
dividend growth is not just a distant dream before they go much higher.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest evidence of US economic recovery is not as decisive as Mr Bush
would like at this stage of the election process. Housing starts began to
pick up in the fourth quarter of last year, so the further improvement in
February, although welcome, is of limited value until there are additional
signs that consumer confidence is recovering. Hence yesterday's reversal of
an over-hasty jump in Treasury bond yields. All the same, the trend is
worrying for Wall Street. At their present high levels, the last thing US
equities need is a bond market in which yields rise every time recovery
moves a little closer.

FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: A joint account for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,491.2 (+20.5)
The Hongkong Bank's Mr William Purves has a canny sense of timing. With
Midland Bank's profits finally poised to recover and his own bank's share
price riding high after last week's 83 per cent jump in earnings, it was now
or never for a merger. Even after yesterday's 30 per cent leap in Midland's
share price, there is still an opportunity for HSBC, as the holding company
is called, to pick up a bargain. The risk to the UK clearer's shareholders
is that, after a five-year wait, their management will be in such a rush it
will sell the bank on the cheap.
Midland's depressed profits and shrunken dividend make its shares difficult
to value on any normal yield or earnings basis. By last night, however, they
were still at a premium of only 22 per cent to net assets, even after
adjusting the latter for the property devaluation not incorporated in the
1991 balance sheet. The present price barely discounts the prospect that, on
its own, Midland could expect earnings per share of some 60p by 1994.
Shareholders could reasonably demand a larger premium from HSBC. It is
likely to make a paper offer with scarcely a glint of cash. Acceptance would
add to Midland shareholders' risk by exposing them to the volatile climate
in Hong Kong, where the combined entity would have nearly a quarter of its
assets. The Hongkong Bank's results may have sparkled last year, but that
reflected wide margins in the territory's local banking market which are
unlikely to be repeated. Nor is disclosure of its hidden reserves guaranteed
to help.
The challenge for Mr Purves is to pitch the price high enough to lure
Midland shareholders without upsetting existing HSBC owners. It is not as if
he can claim large immediate cost savings, though Midland could benefit from
HSBC's retail banking technology. The complementarity of the two groups is
almost certainly an exaggerated advantage. It could generate some additional
business, though how much is open to question. Nor is it easy to forget
HSBC's dismal record at overseas diversification, epitomised in Marine
Midland and Australia.
HSBC's need to hedge its risks before 1997 means it needs Midland Bank much
more than the UK clearer now needs it. One has to assume yesterday's
announcement signals confidence that the regulatory hurdles can soon be
overcome and a price agreed. Once that price is known Midland shareholders
will need to ponder whether to accept or sell in the market and switch to a
bank whose recovery is not yet fully discounted.

FT  18 MAR 92 / SIB backs single watchdog for private investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE watchdog should be set up in the UK to regulate investments offered
to private individuals, according to a report published yesterday.
The recommendation has won the broad backing of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief investment watchdog, which sponsored the
report. It could herald a further rationalisation of the fragmented system
of investment regulation introduced after the 1986 Financial Services Act.
Creation of a single, super-regulator for private investors has recently
been put on the political agenda by the Labour party, whose City affairs
spokeswoman, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, has pushed for such a move. It has also
received wide support in the City.
The recommendation came in a report by Sir Kenneth Clucas, who was asked by
the SIB in October to look into the possibility of forming a single
self-regulating organisation (SRO) for retail investment.
At present, retail investment is regulated in the UK by four different SROs,
the SIB itself and a number of professional bodies. Under Sir Kenneth's
proposals, a super-regulator would be created to take over the bulk of the
job.
The Clucas review was prompted by growing problems at Fimbra, one of the
SROs, which is responsible for regulating independent financial advisers,
managers and brokers. The fact that Fimbra's members, who are largely paid
by commission, could not easily pass the costs of regulation on to their
clients had put them at a disadvantage to others, such as agents of life
assurance companies, the report said.
This had created a 'vicious spiral' of declining membership at Fimbra,
meaning that the 'organisation's future viability cannot be guaranteed'.
The new investment watchdog would combine the activities of Fimbra and
Lautro, which regulates the selling of life assurance and unit trust
investment products. This would bring life assurance companies into the
organisation, providing it with stronger financial backing than that enjoyed
by Fimbra. Fimbra has already relied on ad hoc contributions from life
companies to pay its way.
In addition, the new watchdog would take private client fund management from
Imro, the SRO responsible for investment management. However, Sir Kenneth
stopped short of suggesting a merger of Imro and the Securities and Futures
Authority, the remaining SRO, to leave the investment world with just two
watchdogs.
Sir Kenneth said regulation undertaken directly by SIB and the Insurance
Brokers Registration Council should pass to the new body, although
legislation would be needed for such a change.
The new body would not oversee retail stockbroking, and other 'recognised
professional bodies' would continue to be responsible for their members'
investment business.
The SIB said it welcomed the report and would set up a working party to
propose a structure and constitution for the body, which could come into
existence by April 1993.

FT  18 MAR 92 / High turnout in S African poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE the Jan van Riebeeck school polling station in Cape Town yesterday
there was a consensus: everyone in the 100-metre queue planned to vote 'yes'
in South Africa's make-or-break referendum - or if not, they were keeping
quiet about it.
There was a big turnout, with long queues forming at many polling booths
around the country as whites cast their votes in the most important poll in
South Africa's history.
'In my 40 years in politics I have never, never seen a voting turnout as
high as the one for this referendum,' said one anti-apartheid politician.
About 70 per cent of the 3.3m white electorate cast their votes, with
polling as high as 80 per cent in some areas.
Reformers and the right-wing opponents were both predicting that they would
be the victors when the outcome is announced this morning.
For a day at least, the intense rivalry of the campaign was set aside. Some
polling stations, festooned with colourful posters, had an almost festive
air. Party officials on duty, Conservatives and reformists alike, carefully
tended their portable braaivleis (barbecues), enjoying a ritual that
transcends party politics.
The day passed without serious incident. The violence that has racked
townships in the three weeks since President FW de Klerk called the
referendum abated yesterday.
By 9am hundreds of voters from the comfortable Cape Town suburb of Gardens
had passed through the school gates, clearly sharing a sense of the
momentousness of the occasion. Voter after voter proclaimed that there was
only one choice in the poll: 'Yes, of course.' Yes for peace, yes for
prosperity, yes for international sport and investment.
Given the relatively liberal politics of Cape Town - worlds away from the
harsh racist attitudes prevalent elsewhere - a majority 'yes' vote from
Gardens would be scarcely surprising. Most voters said they did not expect
their lives to change much if they voted 'yes' for power-sharing with
blacks.
Outside the City Hall polling station in Durbanville, just outside Cape
Town, one voter put it this way: 'A 'yes' vote won't make any difference at
all to my life. But a 'no' vote would be disaster.' Asked whether 'yes'
meant he would accept a black man as president, he hesitated, looking around
for a way to escape the question, before conceding: 'Well, maybe in a few
years.'
Voters in neighbouring Kraaifontein, a blue-collar suburb which is expected
to vote resoundingly 'no', have a more immediate worry: squatters. Mr Frank
Kratz, a former white settler in South West Africa, now Namibia, insisted
that the town was surrounded by 50,000 squatters. 'Kraaifontein knows that
the new South Africa means squatters. And they are voting no,' he said.
On the edge of the town, the squatters who have so upset Mr Kratz and his
neighbours sit outside hovels made of tin and packing cases, plastic and
cardboard. The camp has no water, no toilets, no amenities.
A local resident said he wanted whites to vote 'yes'. 'If they vote yes,
then maybe we will get jobs, and they will do something about this place.'
Even so, he seemed far from persuaded.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Ten killed by bomb at Israeli embassy: Pledge to punish
those responsible for attack in Buenos Aires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL vowed last night to punish those to blame for a bomb blast that
ripped through the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 10 people and
injuring more than 100.
The bomb virtually demolished the three-storey building and rescue workers
were still digging through rubble seven hours later to free victims.
Argentine president Carlos Menem said it appeared explosives were planted
inside the embassy, the attackers taking advantage of building and
decorating work under way there. Earlier an embassy official said the bomb
was in a car parked outside.
Mr Menem blamed the attack on an international terrorist group helped by
Argentine terrorists, although he said there was no prime suspect. He
denounced the blast as a 'vestige of Nazism' in Argentina, which has 300,000
Jews - the biggest Jewish community in Latin America.
Mr David Levy, Israel's foreign minister, said in Jerusalem: 'Israel will
know the way, or ways, to punish those responsible with all severity.'
He said the perpetrators of the blast were still unknown, but he went on to
accuse a 'Tehran-Damascus axis' of supporting recent attacks on Israelis. He
denounced the Iran-Syria link as an 'axis of blood'.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, said the bombing was part of a war of
terror against Israel, but claimed his government would continue to work for
a peace settlement with its Arab neighbours.
Forty people were in the embassy at the time of the explosion. Four of those
known to have died in the building - described by its officials as 'like a
fortress' - were said by the Israeli foreign ministry to be Argentine
electric company employees.
The blast damaged buildings hundreds of yards away and Mr Menem estimated
20-40 kg of explosives blew up.
Traffic came to a virtual standstill in the city centre as ambulances
ferried the injured to hospital. A witness said: 'All over the place there
were people injured from shattered glass - women, children, pregnant women,
old people. I could never imagine a scene like this.'
Many of the injured were in a church shelter for the elderly across the
street. A teacher at a nearby school said: 'I felt the ground moving under
my feet. Several children were taken to hospital.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Clinton takes stronger lead in fight to run for Democrats
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas early today took a further big stride
towards winning the Democratic party's nomination for a likely run-off
against President George Bush in the US presidential election in November.
Early returns and exit polls suggested Mr Clinton had won substantial
victories in his party's Illinois and Michigan primaries while Mr Bush
appeared finally to have curbed the right-wing challenge of fellow
Republican Mr Patrick Buchanan.
Mr Clinton had apparently won more than 50 per cent of the Democratic vote
in Illinois, and 48 per cent in Michigan.
The vote of Mr Buchanan, the television commentator, dwindled below the 30
per cent level that has so irritated the president and the Republican party
establishment. Ms Angela Buchanan, the challenger's sister, conceded that
snatching the nomination 'looks as if it's not going to be possible'.
Governor Clinton's victories, on top of his triumph in last week's 11-state
Super Tuesday contests, widened his lead over former Senator Paul Tsongas of
Massachusetts, who came second in Illinois. In Michigan, former California
governor Mr Jerry Brown came a surprise second with an estimated 29 per cent
of the vote, pushing Mr Tsongas into third position.
While Governor Clinton has appeared comfortably ahead of both Mr Tsongas and
Mr Brown, with deeper campaign funds, smoother organisation and support from
a broader range of voters, his successes had previously come almost entirely
in the south, where he held an advantage as the regional candidate.
The Midwest states of Illinois and Michigan, besides offering 295 delegates
to the Democratic convention in New York in July, represented neutral
territory.
The campaign was ferociously fought, as Mr Brown launched a vicious and
inaccurate attack on Governor Clinton and his relationship with his wife's
law firm.
Mr Brown sought votes among Michigan's unemployed carworkers. But according
to exit polls, Mr Clinton not only won 75 per cent of black votes, he also
won 53 per cent of the trade union votes that Mr Brown had courted.

Sir Rex Hunt, governor of the Falkland Islands during the Argentine invasion
ten years ago, takes a predictably robust view of the current British
election campaign.
In his latest column in the islands' main media outlet, the charmingly
quaint Penguin News, he says: 'It is difficult to write a letter from the UK
at this time without referring to the forthcoming general election . . .
Most of us are heartily sick of the mud-slinging and have already made up
our minds for whom to vote; but that will not stop the politicians from
wasting millions of pounds on their election campaigns.'
Looks like the Green Party might show a distinct swing in Sir Rex's
Sunningdale constituency.

Anyone seeking a sense of how long Hongkong Bank has been stalking Midland
need only talk to Bernard Asher.
Boss of the James Capel subsidiary and one of two 'honkers bankers' men on
Midland's board, he was the corporate planner during the Hongkong Bank's
abortive bid for Royal Bank of Scotland 11 years ago. Even then he liked the
look of Midland.
However, he did not start taking its charms seriously until 'six or seven
years ago' when he was in charge of identifying possible partners. The more
he came to know the Midland, the more logical a marriage appeared, says
Asher, a former director general of the UK's National Economic Development
Office.
One of his first intimations that wedding bells would ring came when he
wanted to discuss his pay with someone at his employers' headquarters in
Hong Kong. He was referred to a Midland banker who was on secondment there.
One difference from the Royal Bank affair is that the Hongkong Bank is using
Schroders as its adviser instead of Hambros - which may be connected with
the fact that Schroders' bos Win Bischoff is an old Hong Kong hand.
Or perhaps it was because the Bank of England fell out with Hambros last
time round after Hambros refused to dissuade its client from pressing the
bid. That, oddly enough, was much to the displeasure of the Governor, Gordon
Richardson, who just happened to be an old Schroders man.

Do recessionary times make difficult people even more difficult to cope
with? During the next four months, 15 one-day seminars on the subject of
'Dealing with difficult people' will take place, half as many again as in
the whole of last year.
The organisers, the Institute of International Research, put difficult
people into categories such as connivers, emperors, wet blankets, saints,
saboteurs, exhibitionists, steamrollers, and emotional misfits.
While Observer is quite sure that none of its readers could ever be so
described, those who have the misfortune to work in close proximity to a
likely example can cough up Pounds 99 (excluding VAT) and learn how to
devise their very own seven-point master plan to deal with the 'super
difficult'.

Dutch discotheque-owner Eric Doppen meant well when he installed an
electronic speaking-breathalyser outside his door. But although the
guilder-a-blow device has proved instantly popular, it is not being used
quite as he foresaw.
His object was to enable the Groenlo disco's customers to check whether they
were legally sober enough to drive. Instead, they are using it as a referee
for drinking-contests. The game is for parties to arrive by cab, whoop it
up, then the one ending with the highest count on the breathalyser pays
everyone's fare home.
'It's become a question of honour to be the one who pays,' the owner sighed.

Swiss claims on Scottish territory are about to be diminished by the sale of
the island of Gigha, off the Mull of Kintyre. Savills has been asked to sell
it by Interallianz Bank of Switzerland which took possession of it as
creditor of a property company named Tanap Investments UK.
The man behind Tanap is Malcolm Potier, who lives in Kent and has commercial
holdings in several Scottish towns. He bought Gigha (pronounced gear) for
Pounds 5.4m in 1989 from David Landale, secretary to the Duchy of Cornwall
which is responsible for the Prince of Wales's property.
The island's six square miles include a mansion, hotel, fish-farm, and grass
airstrip, not to mention gardens where camellias and rhododendrons flourish
in the frost-free air of the Gulf Stream.
Guy Galbraith of Savills in Edinburgh is not stating an asking price. He's
relying on the Scottish system of asking for sealed bids and setting a
closing date to work its usual magic, even at times like these.

GrandMet chairman Sir Allen Sheppard tells me he is well pleased at the
response to his round robin letter about the need to support the party
which, since 1979, has been promoting the renewed spirit of enterprise in
Britain.
Although far from all of his counterparts were willing to 'put their heads
above the parapet', he was 'quite amazed' that two out of every three he
approached were ready to sign his letter to The Times.
He has never found such a consensus before, except in the GrandMet
boardroom, he says. In terms of heavyweight names his letter is reasonably
impressive although it does not quite match the list of distressed
businessmen, led by Rolls-Royce's Lord Tombs, who wrote to The Times to
complain at the Conservative Party's ditching of Margaret Thatcher in 1990.
The only names common to both lists are those of Sir John Cuckney, Sir
Patrick Meaney, Lord King and Neil Shaw. One name surprisingly absent from
both letters is that of ex-cabinet minister and Cable and Wireless chairman
Lord Young, author of The Enterprise Years.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Griffins and dragons: A merger of the Midland and Hongkong
banks to create an Pounds 8bn group would not be a marriage of equals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank and HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, approach their impending union, announced yesterday,
with very different emotions.
Directors of Hongkong Bank can barely contain their excitement at the
prospect of carrying off a big European bank after more than 30 years of
courtship. 'We have been looking for an acquisition in the UK since the late
1950s,' said an executive.
For almost exactly the same length of time, Midland Bank has been in
decline. In the early 1950s it was the biggest bank in the world. But for
the past two years, it has been touch and go whether it made a pre-tax
profit.
However, in the past couple of months, Midland had begun to believe that it
had turned the corner under its new chairman, Sir Peter Walters, and new
chief executive, Mr Brian Pearse, who were appointed last spring. Although
its after-tax profits were wiped out in 1990 and 1991 by losses on loans to
UK companies and consumers, there were signs of progress: costs have been
kept under control and revenue from interest and commissions has been rising
strongly.
So Midland's directors are slightly disappointed to be deprived of the
challenge of steering the bank back to health as an independent entity. But
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, is ready to make them an offer
they cannot refuse.
If the deal goes through - and bankers were confident yesterday that it
would - it will create the world's first genuinely transcontinental bank,
with strong businesses in both the Far East and Europe, together with a
smaller presence in North America and the Middle East.
The two banks made only the tersest of public statements yesterday when they
posted the bans. They said they had agreed that a 'merger of the two groups
would now be in the best interests of both companies and their
shareholders'.
Until a formal offer from Hongkong Bank is on the table, the executives of
the two banks are constrained from making any further public statements
about the deal by the Takeover Panel and the Stock Exchange. If bankers make
statements which seem to put a value on the two businesses, the regulators
can insist that any merger terms are based on those implied values - which
Hongkong Bank or Midland might later regret.
Nonetheless an account of the gestation and aims of the deal can be
constructed from interviews with the bankers and their advisers.
Formal terms cannot be agreed until the banks have examined each other's
balance sheets and loan books and formed a view of the relative value of the
two businesses. This process of 'due diligence' should not take more than a
couple of weeks, since the organisations know each other well already.
Hongkong Bank should then ask Midland shareholders to swap their existing
shares in the bank for new shares in Hongkong Bank - analysts said yesterday
that Hongkong Bank would probably offer one of its shares for each Midland
share, valuing Midland at more than Pounds 2.5bn and the combined group at
about Pounds 8bn. Not only was the official statement from the two banks
short, but bankers make it clear that it was slightly economical with the
truth. This will not be a 'merger' or marriage of equals. If the
negotiations are successful, Hongkong Bank will make a takeover offer for
Midland and will emerge - under the chairmanship of Mr Purves - firmly in
control of the combined businesses.
However, a takeover cannot be completed without the formal approval or
behind-the-scenes blessing of a number of regulators and governments.
Hongkong Bank has sounded out the Chinese government which will take control
of Hong Kong in 1997, and is hopeful of winning its approval.
The attitude of the British government - whether Labour or Conservative -
would depend on foreign policy considerations and thus on an assessment of
China's stance. Neither the UK Department of Trade and Industry nor the EC
competition authority in Brussels is expected to block the deal - the
combined business is unlikely to be seen as having an unfair competitive
advantage, since Hongkong Bank's presence in Europe is relatively small at
the moment.
As for the Bank of England, it will examine any takeover proposals
carefully, although it is expected to give its approval. The Bank's primary
aim is to protect the interests of Midland's depositors. So it will seek
guarantees that Midland's deposits will not be used to make loans in the
colony - just in case there is an economic calamity in Hong Kong after 1997
when it reverts to Chinese rule.
There should be big advantages for both banks in combining their businesses.
Hongkong Bank should acquire a big source of earnings outside Hong Kong. It
points out that it is not turning its back on Hong Kong and would not expect
to reduce the scope of its operations there either before or after 1997. It
has made that clear because it does not want to alienate the Chinese
authorities.
But a deal with Midland provides it with extra insurance in the event -
which Hongkong Bank says is unlikely - of economic decline, panic in the
local banking market or nationalisation of assets in the colony after the
Chinese take over.
Last year, it took out a preliminary insurance policy by creating a holding
company, which became owner of all its operations and is domiciled in London
rather than Hong Kong. This makes it difficult for any Chinese government
more hostile to private enterprise than the current one to control the
group's assets outside the colony.
As for Midland, takeover would end years of uncertainty about its financial
strength and its future ownership. Putting aside the uncertainties relating
to the Hong Kong economy, which cannot be quantified, Hongkong Bank has a
very strong balance sheet.
Indeed, in the next few weeks it will reveal quite how strong it is, when it
discloses its secret 'inner reserves' - which analysts estimate at about
HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and which have been tucked away for a rainy
day.
With the backing of Hongkong Bank's capital, Midland will have valuable
additional resources to expand its businesses. It will, for example, be able
to lend more to UK companies and individuals, rather than shrinking its
balance sheet, as it has been doing recently.
The margin between Midland's borrowing and lending rate should also improve.
IBCA, the leading European rating agency, said yesterday that it was likely
to upgrade the credit rating it gives to long-term deposits with Midland.
What this means is that Midland will be perceived as a stronger business
under Hongkong Bank's ownership, and should therefore have to pay less
interest to attract deposits.
Given that the two operate in separate markets with separate cultures,
integration will not be trouble-free. But it should be less difficult than
if it involved other banks from different countries for two reasons:
Hongkong Bank has a strong British tradition. It was founded in 1865 to
serve the local trading houses in Hong Kong and Shanghai and its senior
directors tend to be expatriate Scots.
It has been working closely with Midland since December 1987, when it took a
14.9 per cent stake in the British bank.
Hongkong Bank's pursuit of Midland falls into two distinct episodes. From
the end of 1987, the two banks started to learn about each other's
operations and to ascertain where they could work fruitfully together. In
the succeeding two years, they traded certain assets. Midland injected most
of its Far Eastern operations into Hongkong Bank and took control of
Hongkong Bank's fledgling continental European businesses.
The goal was a full merger - and at the outset, there was a hope within
Midland that it would be a marriage of equals. When Hongkong Bank bought its
stake, it gave a commitment that it would not increase it or dispose of it
for three years. This was regarded - both inside and outside the bank - as a
merger deadline.
But by the summer of 1990, both banks had begun to have cold feet. Hongkong
Bank's US and Australian operations were making losses running to hundreds
of millions of US dollars - sorting them out was clearly going to occupy
management.
Midland's difficulties were, if anything, even more serious. The onset of
the UK recession meant that it was facing the prospect of enormous losses on
UK loans. The magnitude of the problem was shown early in 1991, when it
became the first clearer to cut its dividend since the 1930s.
If the management of both banks faced serious problems running their own
organisations, they were perhaps going to face too much of a challenge in
managing the integration of their two organisations.
There was an additional obstacle. At the time, Chinese approval was in
doubt.
So on December 17 1990, the two banks issued a public statement that it was
not the 'right time' to consider a merger. This was interpreted by bankers
and the press as an attempt by Hongkong Bank to say in the politest way
possible that it had no intention of marrying Midland.
Sir Kit McMahon, Midland's chairman and chief executive at the time, was
disappointed, having been the leading proponent of the deal. He had never
based his strategy purely on the assumption that the merger would take
place, but he had allowed expectations to build up inside the bank and in
the City that a deal was likely.
Bankers in London say that he was probably also a little too slow to
reorganise the core UK banking operations, which had become relatively less
efficient than their main UK rivals. As a result, the Bank of England
encouraged Midland to replace Sir Kit. The Bank sponsored the appointment of
Mr Pearse and Sir Peter, which took place in March last year.
Nonetheless, Sir Kit had begun to cut costs and to ensure that Midland was
pricing its products in a profitable way. Mr Pearse encouraged this process.
By the end of the year, Mr Pearse and his colleagues began to be convinced
that Midland had a future as a successful independent bank.
But Hongkong Bank still had its 14.9 per cent stake and the Kuwait
Investment Office, the investment arm of the Kuwait government, has a
further 10 per cent, which it acquired in the 1980s as one of its strategic
holdings. 'We were aware that we were very vulnerable if Hongkong Bank
decided it was still interested in bidding,' said a Midland banker.
In the past year, Midland has had conversations with about 15 banks which
said they were interested in buying parts of the bank, of which a third
hinted they might be interested in a full-scale merger. But nothing could
happen until Hongkong Bank decided what to do with its shares.
At the end of last year, Midland became aware that Hongkong Bank was
becoming amorous again. Midland got its first hint in an interview with the
Hongkong Bank's deputy chairman, Mr John Gray, which was carried in the
South China Morning Post. 'We started to dust off our Hongkong merger
files,' said the Midland banker.
Hongkong Bank's confidence had returned, because the losses in Australia and
the US were diminishing and its profits from Hong Kong were at record
levels.
Then the day after Midland published its 1991 results on February 27, Mr
Purves became less coy. Midland started to work around the clock on the
details.
On March 5, he had his first conversation with Midland's chief executive and
chairman on the details of the takeover. Mr Pearse and Sir Peter now had no
illusions. Independence was no longer an option.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Picasso et la Danse - Opera de Paris Garnier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years the programme planning for the Paris Opera Ballet has been
commendably imaginative. Themes have been explored in triple bills, which
have ranged from American choreography or the traditional Lifar repertory to
the aspirations of the new French dance and the prowess of the young
generation in the troupe. These compilations have been illuminating,
challenging, to dancers and public, and nowhere more so than in the latest
evening: Picasso et la Danse.
Picasso's involvement with ballet began under Diaghilev, with the creation
of Parade in 1917, and was confirmed by his marriage to the Ballet Russe
dancer Olga Khoklova in 1918. For the next seven years he made varied
collaborations with the dance, notably in the glorious Tricorne of 1919. Two
works, Le Rendezvous of 1945 and Icare in 1962, marked a late revival of
interest. The new Garnier programme brings Le Tricorne into the repertory
with the two ballets for which Picasso paintings provided a front-cloth:
Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous and a re-creation of Nijinska's Le Train bleu,
made for Diaghilev in 1924.
The reconstruction of Le Train bleu was undertaken by the choreographer's
daughter, Irina Nijinska, and the American scholar Frank Ries. The current
fashion for rescuing long-lost ballets from textual sources and dancers'
memories is curious, commendable, but ever-open to question. Scrupulous
though the research may be, the loss of a direct performance tradition means
that what we see today as Nijinsky's Sacre, or Balanchine's Le Cotillon - or
Nijinska's Train bleu - is more optimistic than actual, and the more
ephemeral the piece, the more delicate its fabric, the more likely we are to
see a ghost rather than any theatrical flesh. The recent restorations of two
major Massine pieces - Choreartium and Les Presages  - seem to me valid in
that they are sprung from the direct performance experience of their
producers (and members of their first casts have given the stagings their
approval).
Le Train bleu was a Cocteau-inspired capriccio about the brightest of goings
on in the heyday of holidays at Deauville or Eden Roc. Diaghilev identified
its lack of substance by calling it une operette dansee when he presented it
during the 1924/25 seasons, with the athletic, magnetically beautiful
presence of Anton Dolin its justification as the darling of the plage, le
Beau Gosse. Without Dolin's panache - he left Diaghilev in 1925 - the piece
was dropped.
Cocteau had hoped that Nijinska could identify the hieratic force of
sporting gesture through classic dance - there are evocations of Suzanne
Lenglen and of Edward, Prince of Wales, dressed pour le golf in the
characters - but in this staging the frivolity lacks any aesthetic or
physical conviction. The fun has gone, and the Blue Train has not run for
years. The Nijinska dances lack savour, and the Opera's gifted casts are at
a loss.
The Milhaud score is delightful; Henri Laurens' architectural set is
interesting, and the Chanel clothes are exact, while across the front-cloth
Picasso's two Amazons (hugely magnified from the painting 'La Course')
energetically thunder. How revealing that Les Biches, which explored
something of this same territory and pre-dated Le Train bleu by only six
months, should still convince utterly in the theatre. Nijinska's post-war
revivals preserved both the life and the spirit of the choreography, and
life and spirit are missing in Le Train bleu.
Le Train bleu typifies its age, and so does Le Rendezvous. Roland Petit made
it for his Ballets des Champs Elysees in 1945. It breathes the existential
bleakness of the war's end, with its Jacques Prevert scenario about a young
man who thinks he has cheated Fate, until fate duly catches up with him in
the guise of the Most Beautiful Girl in the World, who kills him. Prevert's
cinema associates provided other elements - Brassai, the photographic
blow-ups of Paris streets; Kosma, the score; Mayo, the costumes - and Petit
responded with choreography in which realism and romanticism combined
marvellously. Le Rendezvous was one of the key early works of the Champs
Elysees seasons - and we have imperishable memories of Petit as the
hero-victim and Jean Babilee as a hunchback who is chorus and companion.
But after 47 years could it still convince? This revival by Petit, on the
hugeness of the Opera stage, was proof that it could. A superb cast  - Kader
Belarbi as the Young Man; Cyril Atanassoff as Fate; Marie-Claude Pietragalla
as the Girl; Fabien Roques as the Hunchback - found exactly the intensity,
the melancholy poetry, that is evoked by the nocturnal streets against which
the tragedy plays itself out. The scene in which the haunted Belarbi is
faced with the menacingly deliberate Atanassoff (a chilling figure) is
superlative dance-theatre. The Picasso front-cloth - a candle, a mask  - is
oddly apt.
Le Tricorne must always ravish eye and ear, and the glowing accuracy of the
Opera workshops' reconstruction of the designs, (though where is the Dandy's
kite?), and the vibrant account of the score from the Spanish conductor
Edmon Colomer, are grand achievements. The ensembles were lively, and were
better at the second of the two performances I saw at the week's end, but
the ultimate success of the piece depends on the playing of the Miller and
his Wife. We were fortunate just after the war to see Leonid Massine in the
part he created for himself as the Miller, alert, vital; and no less
fortunate to see Violetta Elvin (in performance at Covent Garden) finding a
ravishing sensuality and wit for his wife. On Friday night, Patrick Dupond
and Monique Loudieres went through various motions associated with these
roles, and were inalienably themselves as etoiles.
It was at the next day's matinee that Le Tricorne came fully alive. Jose
Martinez is young, tall, with an elegant physique and bright technique (he
was impressive in last season's evening for the Opera's Young Hopefuls). And
he has Spanish blood. In an exceptional debut - which started rather coldly,
but took fire with the Miller's Farucca solo - Martinez claimed the role.
His feet and body seized on de Falla's (and Colomer's) rhythms, stamped them
out crisp and bold. The outline of the dance was taut, ideal. Greater
dramatic passion will come with experience, but not since Massine's
performances have I seen a reading so acute in physical understanding, and
so true to the music.
Martinez was most happily paired with Clotilde Vayer as the Miller's wife.
The lovely curves of the dance as her body yields to it, the fluttering
hands, and the character's flirtatiousness were all warmly, touchingly
shown. Le Tricorne was once again a masterpiece in the theatre.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: ENO acquires the Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English National Opera has acquired the freehold of its London home, the
Coliseum, for Pounds 12.8m. The money comes mainly from the Government,
Pounds 10.8m, with the remaining Pounds 2m supplied by the Foundation for
Sport and the Arts.
For its part ENO will shortly launch a public appeal for around Pounds 17m
to raise the capital to refurbish its property. The money will be spent on
back stage and front of house improvements, and could involve a closure for
up to a year.
All the parties were in a congratulatory mood yesterday. The Minister for
the Arts, Tim Renton, was happy that his department had secured Pounds 10.8m
from the reserves on the last day of Parliament; Peter Jonas, entering his
last year as general director at the ENO, was pleased that a fast
approaching crisis in the affairs of the Coliseum - the ENO's current lease
expired in 1996 - was now permanently resolved; and the owners of the
property, Stoll Moss, was satisfied with what it described as a 'realistic'
price.
The recession in the property market, and the fact that the Coliseum is a
listed building, made the purchase price much lower than anticipated a few
years ago. The ENO will use its immediate annual saving in rent of Pounds
350,000 - it acquires the building on March 31  - to pay the legal fees of
all involved.
The co-operation of the Foundation for Sport and the Arts was vital. The
Government would have been reluctant to provide the whole sum. The
Foundation, financed by the football pools companies in an effort to ward
off a national lottery, is proving a good friend to the ENO.
The Pounds 2m grant is its largest donation to the arts and comes from the
Pounds 20m it has set aside this year for arts causes. Earlier this month it
gave the ENO Pounds 400,000 for a new computerised box office.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Management: Alarm bells ring for 999 calls - The public
sector is becoming more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revolution has been under way in British public services in the past 10
years. Managers are being forced to be ever more efficient and accountable
and they are borrowing heavily from the ways of the private sector.
In some cases, the impetus is provided by privatisation. In others, managers
are being Given greater responsibility for the services they deliver and are
encouraged to adopt a more businesslike approach by carefully defined
targets on financial performance and quality of service.
Government services, such as the payment of benefits, are now provided by
executive agencies under contract to government departments.
Even parts of the public services which cannot be privatised or hived off
into separate organisations are expected to be more accountable for costs
and service quality.
Within the Department of Trade and Industry, for example, managers are free
to buy in support services, such as legal advice and personnel management.
In local government, in-house teams must bid for work such as refuse
collection and property management against outside contractors.
This greater commercialisation requires new ways of working, especially if
public service organisations are to compete in open markets:
New accounting systems must be installed.
Internal and external charging systems must be set up, often in fields where
there is no comparable experience in the private sector.
Valuations are required for stocks, estates, and overheads.
Relationships with suppliers and customers - often formerly part of the same
administrative machine - have to be converted into contracts.
All of this must be done at the same time as the normal work of the
organisation.
This is not always easy as is shown by the experience of the former
Directorate of Telecommunications (DTels), a section of the Home Office.
DTels, which was targeted for reform almost 10 years ago and is a candidate
for privatisation, provides telecoms services for the police and fire
brigades. Seen by most of its customers as fairly competent, DTels was an
accountant's nightmare.
Management had no idea how much it cost to perform any task while contracts
with individual customers did not exist. According to Nigel Finlayson, head
of DTels, the directorate was dedicated to doing whatever was demanded of it
'irrespective of what it was or what it cost'.
Squadrons of financial advisers were called to prepare for a more
competitive environment. An accounting system was introduced under the
supervision of Touche Ross, which enabled management to allocate costs and
hours worked to individual cost centres.
'When we started to write things down and record them in a sensible way, we
discovered that we were our own biggest customer,' Finlayson recalls. It was
only when the accounting system was in place that management was able to
attack such problems.
Real savings, however, needed wholesale structural reform - but the process
of change was interrupted by a complex engineering project to redesign and
replace every item of radio equipment used by the UK emergency services.
Understandably this was accorded priority by successive home secretaries,
but this shows how political priorities can override the drive for greater
efficiency.
With that project nearly completed, DTels introduced direct charging for its
installation and maintenance services in April 1989. Previously, the
organisation had been financed centrally from a fund to which all police
forces contributed according to size.
This inevitably led, to a degree, to the larger metropolitan forces
subsidising the smaller ones. While the larger forces welcomed lower
charges, the smaller ones were not impressed by higher bills - and with
direct charging exposing DTels to competition from other suppliers, they
found it easy to shop around.
Officials now believe that the changes should have been phased in over a
longer period. For example, introducing direct charging before a management
accounting system had been properly assimilated forced a bout of
cost-cutting without sufficient information about where costs were falling.
'My mistake was to put in direct charging before we knew how competitive we
were,' says Gordon Wasserman, the Home Office civil servant responsible for
DTels.
A comprehensive review of individual customer contracts and stocks of
equipment was also launched in 1989. It is an indication of the chaotic
state of the records that this took two and a half years to complete.
One unexpected consequence was that customers found they had been making
annual payments on imaginary or unwanted equipment. For example, some
discovered they had been paying for the maintenance of 25p ear-pieces.
The result was that DTels' turnover fell, together with staff numbers - down
from 1,150 to 700, and further reductions are planned. Sites are being
closed to cut overheads.
Local cost-cutting targets have been imposed with rigour. 'Their incentive
is continued employment,' replies Wasserman when asked how area service
managers have been motivated to meet these performance targets.
DTels' officials now claim to have an organisation capable of competing with
the most efficient private-sector operators. Gerry Rodgers, a director of
Serco, one of the group's main competitors, agrees that DTels has become
more competitive in the last 12 months. The organisation no longer has to
rely as much as it used to on its standing as the dominant force in the
market, he says.
However, the body labours under some disadvantages. It is constrained by the
civil service salary code which makes it impossible to pay more than the
most perfunctory bonuses to its best employees.
For another, DTels can no longer act as a central procurement agency for the
emergency services. This puts it at a disadvantage against competitors who
can provide a one-stop service supplying equipment and information services.
Success - in the shape of making DTels fit for privatisation  - is still not
assured. Some 70 per cent of business with traditional customers has been
retained in free competition, but the organisation is running a trading
deficit of more than Pounds 4m a year.
Under a financial plan agreed with ministers, the organisation must almost
halve its trading deficit to Pounds 2.2m by the year ended March 1994 or
face possible closure. Despite all the changes which DTels has been through
in the last 10 years, it is still too soon to say that it can hold its own
in the open market.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Inheriting the earth - Western
investors moving to eastern Europe may face environmental liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago eastern Europe was a convenient dumping ground for western
Europe's toxic waste. That was partly because the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), or former Soviet Union, had few qualms in
accepting nuclear waste from eastern Europe.
Today a consortium of western companies bidding to expand nuclear power at
Paks, in south-west Hungary, has admitted that it needs a new solution to
the waste problem since the CIS has rejected its role as a dumping ground.
The disintegration of the Soviet Union, the assertion of the rights of the
new independent republics and the political sovereignty of the countries of
eastern Europe are just some of the reasons why western companies' nuclear,
chemical, or industrial waste is no longer welcome.
Another reason is that the debate about the environment in eastern Europe is
changing. On the one hand, it continues to focus on trying to clean up the
damage caused by 45 years of communist-style industrialisation. On the
other, it is beginning to concentrate on four issues which are likely to
influence the region's future environmental standards. These include:
Liability incurred by western companies investing in eastern Europe.
The role played by international financial institutions, particularly the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in
shaping a development policy for the region's infrastructure which will be
compatible with the environment.
How European Community environment legislation will influence corresponding
legislation in eastern Europe, as well as influencing environmental
standards by western companies investing, or trading, in the region.
What effect market reforms will have on the environment in eastern Europe.
Environmental issues first gained prominence in eastern Europe in the early
1980s when Charter 77, the Czechoslovak human rights movement, environmental
groups in Poland, Ecoglasnost in Bulgaria and Duna Kor in Hungary started to
flex their muscles against the communist regimes.
But since the collapse of the communist systems throughout Europe, much of
the energy and idealism of the environmental groups have been sucked into
the political system. 'As to the environment, one has to understand that its
development is connected to the economic situation. Results can be achieved
which are based only on a successful economy,' said Sandor Keresztes,
Hungary's environment minister.
In practice, however, the environment is beginning to play a greater role
among western companies thinking about investing in the region. This is
because advantages of cheap labour and a skilled workforce in the region
have to be offset by the disadvantages of possible liability costs.
'Western companies wishing to invest in eastern Europe must be aware that
they could be saddled with the cost of cleaning up the waste accumulated
over many years,' said Tassilo Metternich, a consultant at Environmental
Resources Limited.
ERL specialises in carrying out a wide range of activities, from individual
site audits to company-wide communications and training programmes related
to the environment. Its primary role is to identify what environmental
problems a western investor will inherit, and what liability that company
will incur.
'It is not an easy thing to do. Some western companies would naturally
resent the fact that they have to pay for the damage caused by the previous
owners - who were communist,' said Metternich.
'It is also very messy because we are working to laws that do not exist in
these countries. Moreover, companies wishing to invest in eastern Europe are
sometimes treated on a case-by-case basis. So you are not always sure where
you stand with the law. We tell our clients the pros and cons about the
sites they have chosen as a greenfield, or what problems they inherit in a
plant into which they are buying,' he added.
Metternich says he is not sure if liability acts as a deterrent to
attracting foreign investment into eastern Europe. 'Maybe, if it was said
that there would be no liability, more foreign investors would go into
eastern Europe. It is hard to say. The legislation is in flux,' he added.
John Mitchell, head of the east European division at ICI, one of the world's
largest chemical firms, is sanguine about the question of liability.
'We are more interested in obtaining licences than in acquiring sites at the
moment in eastern Europe,' explained Mitchell. ICI, which is expanding into
the region and which had sales worth Dollars 36m in Hungary last year,
appears to be motivated by one philosophy.
'When we obtain licences in eastern Europe, or anywhere else, we make sure
that that company conforms to the highest standards in quality with regard
to the product, the environment and service to the consumer,' he explained.
'Through training schemes, our partners in eastern Europe know what to
expect from standards in warehousing and distribution.'
Martin Houldin, an environmental expert at management consultants KPMG in
London, says EC legislation on the environment means that western firms
investing in eastern Europe will automatically have to meet EC standards.
'Even if legislation on the environment is absent in eastern Europe, those
governments which wish to apply for full membership to the EC will in any
case improve their standards over time,' he explained.
The need to improve standards partly explains why UK companies such as ICI
and Johnson Matthey are involved in training programmes and are working more
closely with environmental groups in the UK and eastern Europe.
Duncan Fisher is director of the East-West Environment Programme. Organised
under the umbrella of the London-based Ecological Studies Institute, the
forum brings together companies, banks, non-governmental organisations and
governments all involved in central and eastern Europe.
The forum has three aims:
To help members pursue activities and investment benefiting the environment
in eastern Europe.
To provide members with a forum in which to exchange ideas and information.
To offer members a framework for developing and implementing projects which
promote growth while protecting the environment in eastern Europe.
Fisher and Gordon Hughes, from London's Centre for Economic Research Policy,
believe one aspect of the environmental problem is coming to an end.
'Liberalisation of prices means that enterprises and the consumer will use
less energy,' said Fisher.
'The huge, mass emissions which we saw in eastern Europe over the past four
decades will be phased out as industry is modernised. Those kinds of
environmental problems will diminish,' he argued. But other problems will
persist and new ones will emerge.
Like the EBRD, Fisher is also aware that the economic reforms will bring new
problems for the environment. 'Household waste will consist of more plastic
packaging. The expanding tourist industry will also create more pressure on
the environment. Closure of environmentally-damaging, and obsolete
enterprises could meet resistance as the recession deepens,' explained
Fisher. 'Addressing these problems will not be easy. But they cannot be
ignored as eastern Europe attempts to integrate its economy with the west.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Down and out, but still on the
freeway - Urban air pollution / Louise Kehoe takes a drive to Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELCOME to 'Smog City', the place with the dirtiest air and more cars per
capita than any other city in the US. The yellowish grime that hangs over
California's largest metropolis for much of the year is grim testimony to
the fact that even the strictest air-quality regulations cannot resolve the
conflict between nature and the car.
To be without a car in Los Angeles is to be down and out. Even public
housing 'projects' for the poor have car parks. While cycling and walking
may be popular forms of exercise, they are no way to get around this
sprawling asphalt jungle, where a 100-mile commute to work is nothing out of
the ordinary.
Smog is the price that Los Angelenos pay for their automobile-centred
lifestyle. Climate and geography combine to exacerbate the problem. For
about 10 months of the year Los Angeles enjoys balmy sunshine. The city's
urban sprawl is centred in a natural basin that prevents its atmospheric
effluent from dissipating.
Los Angeles may have the most severe air-pollution in the US, but nowhere
else has the problem been attacked more vigorously. South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD) regulators, with responsibility for Los Angeles
and neighbouring Orange and Riverside counties, have set the pace by
instituting stringent controls over atmospheric emissions by industry and
individual residents.
Controls that are only beginning to take effect in many parts of the US and
elsewhere have long been standard in California. Catalytic converters, which
reduce car exhaust emissions have been mandatory in the state for almost 20
years. In one of its most unpopular moves, the SCAQMD last year banned the
use of lighter fluid in garden barbecues.
There are signs that the assault is beginning to pay off. According to state
statistics, Los Angeles had less low-level ozone pollution in 1991 than at
any time since measuring began 16 years ago. Analysis of last year's smog
season shows that the Southern California basin had a record low 129 days in
which lung-damaging ozone exceeded the federal standard of 0.12 parts per
million.
Maintaining the trend towards cleaner air will, however, require
increasingly drastic and expensive compromises. But weaning Californians
from the private sanctum of their automobiles may be impossible. According
to a recent study conducted by the California Institute of Energy
Efficiencies, most drivers would prefer to switch to alternative-fueled cars
rather than use car pools or mass transit.
Los Angeles air-quality regulators have launched an ambitious goal to
replace approximately 17 per cent of conventional petrol-burning cars in the
region, or more than 1m automobiles, with electric vehicles by the year
2010.
The city has also embarked upon plans to build what could become one of the
most extensive light rail, mass transit systems in the US.
While the pattern of pollution, with smog hanging over freeway corridors,
makes it all too obvious to Californians that the automobile is the prime
culprit, industry is also being required to clean up its act. After two
years of studying the pros and cons, SCAQMD recently voted to move ahead on
a revolutionary 'smog exchange' plan that would replace current regulations
on industrial air pollution with a trading market enabling companies to buy
or sell the right to emit pollutants.
The SCAQMD believes that the market system will provide incentives to
eliminate air pollution faster than its current regulatory system, while
also saving industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Implementation of the
system awaits final approval, but if the go-ahead is given as expected later
this month, trading by 2,000 industrial polluters could begin in 1994. These
industrial facilities are said to be responsible for 85 per cent of the
region's industrial hydrocarbon emissions.
Under the proposed system, each company would initially be issued a number
of smog exchange shares, based on past emissions. A single share would be
worth a pound of pollutant per month. Over the first 10 years, the
'pollution' value of each share would decline, thus forcing a clean-up.
In exchange for their participation in the market, businesses would no
longer be subject to air pollution rules that specify certain equipment or
methods to reduce pollutants. Companies could meet their emissions targets
in whatever way they chose. Those that found ways to reduce their emissions
beyond the clean-up target could sell their credits to another business that
was unable to meet its reduction target.
Los Angeles' efforts to overcome its severe smog problems, combined with the
city's concentration of industrial and environmental interest groups, have
made it a test-bed for environmental regulation with influence throughout
the US and even further afield.
The series will conclude next week in Bangkok.

<TEXT>
QUESTIONS ABOUT the recession dogged Mr John Major yesterday as he visited
two schools in his first day on the campaign trail, following an itinerary
designed to reinforce the party's education policy launch.
At his first stop, a primary school in the constituency of Grantham - Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's home town - the prime minister emphasised once more that
only electoral uncertainty was hindering the recovery.
'The impediment that lies between us and the people beginning to reinvest
and lift out of recession is the general election,' he said, after ruffing
the hair of some children waving at the press cameras outside the school.
'Once that is over, once we are back with a clear majority, I think people
will begin their reinvestment.'
Party aides said the All Saints County Primary School was a model of its
kind. But in spite of the Conservatives' emphasis on traditional teaching,
Mr Major saw children doing movement to music and modelling with Plasticine.
The prime minister then made a lightning stop at Nottingham's Djanogly
College, the first of the country's 13 city technology colleges. Though the
tour of the library, a language laboratory and the music room was brief, it
served its purpose of underlining Tory commitment to choice and diversity in
education.
Then it was time for the second of the 'Meet John Major' sessions with an
audience of hand-picked Nottingham Tories and some friends.
The city is made up of three constituencies - two marginal Tory and one
marginal Labour - and though the audience was selected the mood was less
relaxed than at the first session in Huntingdon on Sunday.
There was still applause for traditional Tory themes, particularly Mr
Major's suggestion of a need to be more severe in the condemnation of petty
crime, but four of the 12 questions were about the economy.
Though most were phrased loyally, they still dealt with difficult themes,
including the decline of manufacturing industry, the high level of VAT, and
the mistakes of the 1980s which had led to the spiral in house prices. Mr
Major dealt with the questions competently, and received routine standing
ovations at the start and the end. This time, in contrast to Huntingdon, his
jacket stayed on.

Highly paid City dealers are protecting themselves against a Labour victory.
Many have piled in to place straight bets on Labour. City bookmaker IG Index
said that yesterday was its busiest day yet, with 70 per cent of bets coming
from City institutions. The weight of money is for a hung parliament with
Labour the biggest party. But some City brains are more sophisticated. 'Bet
on the Tories to win and buy puts on the Footsie index and sterling,' is the
smart approach.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The inhabitants of Worcester Park have good reason to feel miffed at
tonight's Conservative party political broadcast. 'John Major. The Journey,'
concentrates on the prime minister's path from obscurity to 10 Downing
Street.
Though it lingers at length on the prime minister's Brixton boyhood, there
is no mention of leafy and well-heeled Worcester Park where young John also
spent many a formative year. Could it be that that cosy interlude just
failed to square with the story-line?

Terry Fields, who was expelled from the Labour party for his links with
Militant Tendency but is defending Liverpool Broadgreen as an independent,
has found a new way of achieving publicity.
Fields has diverted the permissible costs of producing election leaflets
into making a video, which will be premiered tomorrow evening. He has had
500 copies made - 100 for each of Broadgreen's municipal wards. Supporters
will lend copies overnight, but most will be seen through special showings
in people's homes, local pubs or shops.
His headquarters yesterday were crammed with full-time workers. 'They were
all made redundant by the city council last year, so they've got plenty of
time to help,' he explained.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Stretching it
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few political parties are daft enough to use fabricated statistics, but they
can massage the truth, as yesterday's Tory education document shows.
'We are making a great deal of progress,' the policy document claims. 'In
1979 only 46 per cent of 16-year-olds stayed on in full-time education. The
figure is now 75 per cent and rising.'
A recent government publication, Education Statistics 1991, puts the total
at just 50 per cent, but that statistic applied to 1989. In 1988 only a
little over 30 per cent of 18-year-olds in England and Wales were still in
full-time education - less than half the level in Japan, France and Germany.
So why should there have been such a boom since? The reason is the
recession. The unemployment rate for men aged between 18 and 19 rose from
13.8 per cent in October 1988 to 18.3 per cent last October. For those aged
16 to 17, who can no longer register as unemployed and claim benefit, the
current lack of jobs makes staying on at school an obvious alternative.
Even so, many will leave higher education with no qualifications. Only two
thirds of 17-year-olds and 50 per cent of 18-year-olds who stay on are
studying for courses leading to qualifications. Similarly, only 40 per cent
of Youth Trainees gain any qualifications at all.

All members are planning to register as candidates in the election, and the
party hopes to field a total of 651 covering every constituency. So far the

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Tories go slow in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a party which many say is on the verge of extinction, the Scottish
Conservatives appear remarkably relaxed. Since the election was called,
Labour has had Neil Kinnock in Edinburgh at its annual Scottish conference,
the SNP has launched its campaign with a cheery press conference and the
Liberals have presented a Scottish version of their manifesto.
The Tories, meanwhile, have held one rather limp press conference (and that,
apparently, at the urging of the broadcasters anxious to balance Kinnock).
Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has released two statements by fax, one on
Tory plans to ban the carrying of knives, and the other on expanding foreign
language teaching in schools. The party is even launching its manifesto in
Scotland a day later than in England, with the idea of getting two bites of
the cherry.
Still, there was a sign of life yesterday: Lord Sanderson, party chairman,
made a foray into Fife, and Lang challenged Donald Dewar, his Labour
opposite number, on taxation - by issuing a fax, of course.
'We're starting slowly and building up gradually,' says party headquarters.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Kinnock awayday runs on time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY began terribly, with the Red Rose Express pulling out of Paddington
Station two minutes early.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, who positively thrives on
late trains, did not look best-pleased.
He was left to wave disconsolately as Neil and Glenys Kinnock departed on
their awayday electioneering trip to Bristol, the first formal campaign
outing for a leader whose party promises, among quite a lot of other things,
to make the trains run on time.
The transport-secretary-in-waiting might have perked up a bit when Labour's
chartered train temporarily ground to a halt outside Temple Meads Station.
But it was to be the last hitch of the day.
If the party's 1987 campaign was the slickest failure in modern political
history, this one is hell bent on being an heroic, hectic success. With
every second and every picture made to count, the Kinnocks made straight for
Staple Hill Primary School in the Kingswood constituency of Mr Robert
Hayward, the Tory MP who has a fight on his hands to hold on to his 4,000
majority.
The sight of the leader of the Opposition, not to mention the promise of a
specially extended playtime, brought big cheers from the toddlers who
proudly showed off their school. Passing a live, pop-eyed stick insect,
curiously christened Gerald, the Kinnocks made straight for the library
where they read and sang with the children.
Neil, who explained that Glenys was a teacher 'in real life', was told by
Gary, aged 7, that his dad liked him best. Daisy, 6, threatened to blot her
copybook by confiding: 'I always thought that you were pretend.' This,
however, is deadly serious stuff.
On to the Downend Day Centre for the handicapped and a hall full of
painting, knitting, weaving Bristolians trying to rise above the media chaos
suddenly enveloping them.
Neil quickly waxed lyrical about old Archie Kinnock, his granddad. who came
from Bristol but went to live in south Wales when he missed the last boat to
America. 'I'm the result,' he chirped.
The entourage swept back past Gerald and on to the Red Rose Express for high
tea and a quick spin back to Ealing Broadway, conveniently round the corner
from chez Kinnock.
Watch out for Mr Prescott's InterCity, door-to-door weekly saver. It's a
certain vote-winner.

Machine, Labour / How the party plans to avoid a re-run of the 1987 race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOUR times, or was it five? The talking point among Labour's spin doctors
yesterday morning was how often broadcasters on Monday had referred to Mr
John Smith as the chancellor.
It is not difficult to see how the slips occured. Labour had teed up the
shadow Budget to emulate the real thing. A Budget box and a walk with a
borrowed dog in St James's Park were rejected as over the top. But it was
launched in the Edwardian sobriety of the Institution of Civil Engineers and
was intentionally free of the glitz, posters and slogans that characterise a
normal Labour press conference. Details such as the Red Book and even the
phrasing of Mr Smith's speech - 'I turn now to taxation . . . ' - were
mobilised to maximum effect.
The fruits emerged in Martyn Lewis's chancellor blunder to an audience of
more than 8m viewers on BBC's Nine O'Clock News.
How much does any of this matter? Labour's view is that, with the main
parties level, every trick helps. Its switch of its Budget launch to Monday,
for example, casually blasted Mr Ashdown's manifesto off the front pages and
down the schedules.
Buoyed by these successes, the campaign team makes some grander boasts. This
week it argued that it had tricked Mr Lamont into the 20p tax band by
hinting this was the course favoured by Labour. A 1p base-rate cut in the
Tory Budget would, they say, have been politically more counter-productive.
True? Who knows. But the claim seeks to feed the impression that the
Opposition is hungrier and smarter than its opponents.
The battle plan rests with a slimline inner team - the eight-strong campaign
management committee - that meets at dawn and dusk to direct operations.
These backroom generals will run the party as Mr Neil Kinnock zig-zags
across the country.
The publicly known faces are Mr Jack Cunningham, the affable, if sometimes
brittle, campaign co-ordinator and Mr Bryan Gould, the camera-friendly
shadow environment secretary, who headed the highly praised but unsuccessful
1987 effort.
Less-known, but at least as important, are Mr David Hill, sitting in Mr
Peter Mandelson's vacated chair as communications director, and Ms Patricia
Hewitt, a one-time Kinnock press officer, architect of the new
professionalism in 1987 and an author of the manifesto. They will have a
decisive role with Mr Neil Stewart, a close aide from the leader's inner
office, in selling any switch in strategy to Mr Kinnock.
Other team members include Mr Larry Whitty, Labour general secretary, and Mr
Philip Gould, chief of the ghostly Shadow Communications Agency that handles
Labour's advertising and image.
The group's strategy has long been mapped out. First, Labour confronted the
Tories' tax and spending plans head-on with the shadow Budget. Second, at
today's manifesto launch, it will tie its Budget proposals with its public
investment priorities in an upbeat tone of Euro-social democracy, contrasted
with a Toryism depicted as ideological, dry and out of touch.
The second week must build a bridge between the party's plans for the
economy and its offensive on its 'winning agenda' for the National Health
Service and schools. For the final days, the party will wrap the package up
with a big bow, inscribed: It's Time for Labour.
That is the theory. Yet the strategists know that life is not so smoothly
manipulable. They remember from 1987 that gaffes and the unexpected often
spell the difference between success and failure.
Mr Kinnock argues that it was lack of liaison over tax policy that undid the
triumphs of 'Kinnock - The Movie', the much-praised party election
broadcast, directed by Mr Hugh Hudson, and prevented the Tories being held
to a majority of half the actual outcome.
Elaborate precautions have been taken against a repetition; spokesmen are
under strict instruction to consult before they comment.
Unadorned with Vote Labour stickers, a nationwide team of assessors has been
set up. They will monitor the regional media and check the hospitals for
slip-ups or cutbacks to feed through to the grandly named Media Initiatives
Unit as raw material for news stories.
It sounds like something from a John le Carre novel. The team, originally
dubbed the 10 Last Days committee, hopes to learn from the Tories' wobbly
Thursday in 1987 when a panicked Mrs Thatcher stepped in to reorder the
Conservative campaign. The assessors will provide objective data to allow
headquarters an overview in case a different direction is needed as fatigue
sets in on the last lap.

I want to see all parents, not just those who can afford to pay school fees,
with a real choice of school for their children
John Major
I don't think, on the basis of the long-term record, the perpetual
experimentation in schools, the fall in reading standards, crumbling
buildings and oversized classes, he (John Major) can be taken very seriously
on the subject of children's education
Neil Kinnock
What is offered is fictional choice for parents, Conservative dogma and
limited opportunities for children
Doug McAvoy, general secretary, National Union of Teachers
I'm not sorry that I shall never be seeing some of it again. A great deal of
it is absolute deceit and hypocrisy
Sir Charles Irving, Tory MP for Cheltenham, on his retirement from the House
of Commons
This is just a starter; just the first offensive prawn cocktail from someone
who boasted about his prawn cocktail offensive. The disaster of a Labour
government would give us a main course and pudding of even higher taxes
Kenneth Baker, on John Smith's alternative Budget
It's now or never. Go for it
Sean Connery, urging Scots to support independence

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Smith takes the lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It is beginning to look as if it may all be going horribly sour. Last year
Mr John Major believed his own Treasury's forecasts of an end to the
recession before Christmas 1991. He should have known better. It is always
an error to believe the Treasury. The forecasts were wrong, and so was the
prime minister. He missed at least three good chances of calling an election
on dates favourable to the Conservatives. Then the Majorites convinced
themselves that they could face the voters in the middle of a prolonged
recession and get away with it. This morning it appears that they may have
been mistaken about that, too.
They believed that the Budget presented by Mr Norman Lamont last week would
set their campaign off to a flying start. It had no effect whatsoever. They
thought that a schoolboy lark of a tax reduction would catch the opposition
out. It did, for about two hours. Then the shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith,
showed his boss, Mr Neil Kinnock, how to spring free.
The Labour leads of 5 percentage points recorded in two opinion polls this
morning are all Mr Smith's work, or nearly all if you take into account the
assistance of Mr Norman Lamont. Mr Smith, who looks like a chancellor of the
Exchequer, easily outperforms the Conservatives' Mr Lamont, who does not. I
do not wish to be unfair to Mr Lamont, who has made the best of a difficult
brief, but politics is not his strong suit.
Nor is strategic thinking, unless you believe that the government's
20-per-cent-band Budget strategy was really Mr John Major's, or that of a
committee of himself and close colleagues. Either way, it flopped. Mr Smith
merely rejiggled the figures. He proposes to soak high earners in order to
finance a tax bribe that will put some change in the pockets of 80 per cent
of the electorate and increase pensions and child benefits for important
sub-sections of it. Not only did he offer money, he also offered increases
in expenditure on health and education to salve the consciences of the
recipients of the bribes - and all for a public sector borrowing requirement
not a penny larger than Mr Lamont's.
Mr Smith then showed superhuman capacity as a salesman. He spent an
indefatigable 24 hours appearing on every TV and radio spot,
always looking like the most amiable, the most trustworthy, the most
sagacious politician around. Mr Lamont assisted, by coming across as
lugubrious, tetchy, and out of touch with the details of his brief. Today's
polls are the pay-off.
The question is, will they last? Labour leads in six of the nine polls taken
since Mr Lamont's Budget, and in two of the three taken since Mr Smith's.
Yet the game is not over. There are still three weeks to go. The Labour lead
could melt away, to be replaced by a Tory advantage. It is hard to see what
will achieve this, but elections are choreographed by the unpredictable.
They are also choices of government teams. In previous elections differences
in ideology or class interest determined voting behaviour. Now the parties
are competing for a narrow stretch of middle ground. The outcome may well
boil down to which of two sets of politicians is the most trusted. On the
basis of the Budgets, Labour wins the first round. It may also be winning
the argument about the continuing recession, although until very recently
the public still trusted the Tories as the party best suited to get us out
of the mess they got us into.
This morning the two larger parties will publish their manifestos. This is a
round yet to be fought. Do not expect too much of it. British voters are not
intellectuals. Hardly any calculate the merits and demerits of every aspect
of politicians' published documents and speeches before deciding who to
support. That is why the parties are selling their best faces. The Tories
probably have a few high cards here, but they do not win in every important
department. Labour's Mrs Margaret Beckett is a more convincing chief
secretary to the Treasury than Mr David Mellor. Mr Gordon Brown is a
forceful Labour spokesman on industry. This knocks out his Tory opposite
number, Mr Peter Lilley.
The Conservatives have a huge asset in Mr Douglas Hurd, whose evident
suitability for the job of Foreign Secretary is magnified by comparison with
the negative image projected by his Labour shadow, Mr Gerald Kaufman. This
is bad luck. Mr Kaufman is an amiable fellow in private. He is a student of
musicals in general and Gene Kelly's show-stopping splash-dance in 'Singin'
in the Rain' in particular. Alas, he too often defeats his own purpose by
adopting a vituperative approach to political discourse.
In the end the Tory campaign centres around the personality of Mr John
Major. He chose the strategy. He is the strategy. He is effective in
tonight's broadcast. Watch. You may decide to ignore this morning's polls
and bet on him. It's your money.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Major backs school entrance tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY over whether state schools in England and Wales should be
allowed to set entrance tests for pupils dominated yesterday's campaigning.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, endorsed selection but insisted that it
would not become widespread, while opposition parties condemned any move
back towards a divided schools system.
The Tories' education policy, launched yesterday, puts encouragement for
opting-out at the top of the party's agenda for schools. It includes a
commitment that grant-maintained schools 'will be able to change their
character if that is what parents clearly want and the change fits in with
the wider needs of the local area'.
That implicit backing for a return to selection was attacked by Mr Neil
Kinnock, the Labour leader. 'It appears that the government is intent on
introducing secondary moderns and selection through the back door,' he said.
Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Tory plans
for education don't mean parents choosing schools; they mean schools
choosing children.'
At his first campaign press conference, Mr Major predicted that the number
of schools opting for grant-maintained status would rise sharply from its
current level of 200 once the government was re-elected. Predicting a
'revolution' in education, he sought to dismiss suggestions that many
schools would opt for 'grammar school' status. He hinted he would act to
prevent too many becoming selective.
Mr Major said: 'We are in favour of choice. This isn't going to open the
door to huge numbers of grammar schools right across the country replacing
the present comprehensive system. That isn't going to happen.'
Where schools wanted to become selective, 'the secretary of state would not
only look at the particular position of the school concerned', Mr Major
added. 'He will also look at the range of school and opportunity available
in the area. There may be some additional grammar schools. But it isn't
going to be a widespread switch from the comprehensive system to the grammar
school system.'
Mr Major, who defended the government's education record and blamed local
authorities for poor standards, said he expected an 'avalanche' of schools
to seek grant-maintained status after the election.
Questioned about the preference of most cabinet ministers for the private
sector, he said: 'We are the party that believes in choice. What I am
determined to do is to improve the quality of education in the state system
so that everybody may feel absolutely confident in sending their children to
the state system.'
The Conservative education manifesto - entitled The 39 Steps  - includes
only one new policy. Small schools will be able to opt out of local
authority control in groups, sharing management costs. Mr Kenneth Clarke,
education secretary, said this would be particularly attractive to small
primary schools.
The manifesto is silent on the organisation of schools should a large number
opt out. It is widely expected that the government would be forced to
appoint regional funding councils to manage them, but Mr Clarke refused to
confirm this.
Mr Clarke committed the Conservatives to 'uphold' - not expand  - the
controversial assisted places scheme, under which the fees of more than
30,000 pupils at private schools are paid by the government.
He also pledged to 'maintain the popular and well-respected A-level
examinations'. Labour and the Liberal Democrats propose to replace these
with a broader qualification.
'The next steps are to promote choice and diversity in our schools,' said Mr
Clarke. 'More grant-maintained schools and more schools with a technology
emphasis will mean a greater variety of schools. We will back the choice of
parents by ensuring that popular schools are given the resources to expand.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Broadcasters put themselves on the schedule -
Media Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a danger in all this media watching, but please read on. In
Monday's Guardian, Loughborough University's monitors unveiled a survey of
time devoted to election issues on TV and radio.
No surprise that in week one the two most covered themes were the economy
and Mr Major's trip to the palace. But in third place? None other than 'the
role of the media'.
Introspection of this kind leads to self-consciousness and we have already
seen some pretty self-conscious broadcasting.
Tonight's Dispatches on Channel 4 promises to warm over well-known grouses
about alleged political interference and 'self-censorship' on the BBC and
ITV in the 1987 election.
New life has been breathed into this topic by the BBC's foolish withdrawal
of a Panorama treatise on the economy and a spate of equally misjudged
attempts by politicians to dictate the terms on which they will appear on
programmes, the most recent being Paddy Ashdown's withdrawal from a Channel
4 News interview because his party's manifesto was not being given
lead-story status.
It is this daily jostling for tactical advantage which is the real stuff of
the broadcasters' political battles, not the systematic subversion imagined
by conspiracy theorists.
The BBC's Nine O'Clock news has made an impressive and influential start in
spite of opening with an inexplicable shot of the back of the newscaster's
head,
John Simpson's despatch from the prime minister's first 'meet the people'
session ruffled feathers by proclaiming the event a touch bland and
overstaged. Central Office would be wise to react by improving the event,
rather than complaining to the BBC.
On air, the mood has been anything but cantankerous. The politicians must
have been told to keep talking and avoid brawling. Chris Patten, the Tory
party chairman, began one reply the other morning with a sugary: 'If you
don't mind me being a little critical, that's complete drivel.' As a Daily
Mail cartoon put it: 'They never keep their promises - where's this really
dirty election we've been looking forward to?'
Part of the broadcaster's objective is to penetrate this wall of
self-control. From that point of view, Panorama's debate between Messrs
Lamont, Smith and Beith on the economy was a write-off. Although Mr Smith's
plain language easily outpointed Mr Lamont's City-ese, a lugubrious and
over-formal set quenched what passion arose.
By the way, don't take my word for that: Anthony Howard popped up on
Newsnight as soon as Panorama was off the air to dismiss his sister
programme's efforts as over-refereed.
In searching for its own way through the political radiation shield,
Newsnight has come up with the idea of having politicians from two parties
interrogate a third. I suspect this approach may yet draw blood, though not
with inquisitors as sweet as Labour's George Robertson and the
Conservatives' Virginia Bottomley, who were Monday night's questioners.
Many programmes, including an over-long ITV offering called Special Inquiry,
have brought floating voters face to face with politicians in TV studios.
These events invariably flop. Package Mr Ordinary inside a studio and he
usually becomes Mr Dull. Old-fashioned phone-ins, such as the BBC's Election
Call, work better; the fact that you can't see the caller is offset by the
sense that the interrogator can be more at ease than the politician.
But if you want dirt, abuse, outrageous deceit and absence of all scruple,
you will have to turn to your daily paper.
There are not many floating voters in Fleet Street and already The Sun,
Mail, Express, Telegraph and Times (combined daily sale 8.1m) have declared
for the Tories, with only the Mirror/Record (sale 3.6m) clearly in the
Labour camp.
If Mr Patten wants lessons in how to sharpen his message, he need only
consult the Mail, whose front page on Tuesday showed John Smith shaking cash
from the pockets of a terrified resident of middle England. The headline
read: 'If you make it, they'll take it,' and the summary of Labour's fiscal
policy was: 'Crush the rich, squeeze the middle classes and put the bite on
anyone with a private pension.'
All the Mirror had to offer by way of riposte was a 'Goodbye to all this'
headline alongside snaps of Mr Smith waving (surely some mistake?) and
sundry hard-up Britons; that and a page two story suggesting Mr Major has a
face like a fish. As a propaganda contest, it's the Bash Street Kids versus
The Terminator.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Executives close ranks behind Tories -
Business support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING business executives are closing ranks behind the Tories in an
unprecedented show of support at such an early stage of an election
campaign.
Industrialists say senior party figures such as Mr Chris Patten, the party
chairman, and Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, have played an
increasingly important role in galvanising business support in recent weeks.
However, in a letter to The Times today, 38 Labour-supporting business
people welcome the Opposition party's 'innovative and prudent' shadow Budget
unveiled this week. The group is led by Lord Hollick, managing director of
financial services group MAI.
Other signatories include Ms Carmen Callil, managing director of publisher
Chatto and Windus, Mr Paul Hamlyn, the publisher, and Mr Swraj Paul,
chairman of engineering group Caparo.
Conservative fundraising efforts among business people, led by its deputy
treasurers Lord Laing of Dunphail and Sir John Cope, have been stepped up in
recent months.
A senior political and public relations adviser to several large companies
that support the Tories said: 'After flirting with the Labour party, people
now realise the race is serious. Money has been pouring into the party over
the past few weeks.'
He said Mr Patten had recently moved to rebuild the party's relations with
businessmen closely associated with Mrs Thatcher, the former prime minister,
after initially taking a 'cavalier approach' to Thatcherite business
supporters following Mr Major's election as party leader.
Mr Bob Worcester of Mori, the polling organisation, said: 'Business is
playing a more assertive, more prominent role in this election because the
contest is so close. In 1983 and 1987 the Tory party went into the election
with a comfortable lead so it was less necessary for business to make its
position clear.'
The strength of business support for the Conservatives suggests that Labour
has largely failed in its attempts to woo industrialists.
Today's letter supporting Labour comes in response to a letter from 43
leading businessmen supporting the Conservative party published in The Times
yesterday.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, the
international foods, drinks and retailing group, who organised the earlier
Times letter, said he had circulated a draft of it to about a dozen friends
two weeks ago. Other industrialists volunteered to sign. Sir Allen said that
had the publication been delayed for a week, more than 100 executives would
have signed it.
He denied that Conservative central office had encouraged the group to write
the letter.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Ashdown campaign takes to the road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE six-year-old girl at Darrel Primary School in Richmond upon Thames
thought Mr Paddy Ashdown had a very special policy.
'An animal welfare commission - that's a very powerful commitment,' he said
during a stop-off on his whirl around London on the first day of his
campaign roadshow.
The Liberal Democrat leader's breakneck tour of seats where his party has
the best chances of success was about matching policy messages with photo
opportunities and the people he met with, well, more photo opportunities.
Mr Ashdown is confident of snatching Richmond and Barnes from Mr Jeremy
Hanley, the junior Northern Ireland Office minister who has a majority of
1,766. Dr Jenny Tonge, Lib Dem candidate, admitted the party was supposed to
win in 1983 and 1987 - but this time the Tory vote could prove much softer.
'This is the first time we have been on a high locally, with a huge majority
on the local council and an unpopular Tory government,' said Dr Tonge. Lib
Dem posters already flutter amid suburban, albeit recession-hit, prosperity.
Mr Ashdown focused on education. Hence his audience with children, not
councillors or canvassers. What is a politician, he was asked? 'A politician
is someone who lies for his party abroad,' he replied, adapting an adage
with perhaps reckless aplomb.
Earlier in Sutton and Cheam (Tory majority 15,718), Mr Graham Tope, who won
the constituency for the Liberals in 1972, said the Tory vote was 'soft and
crumbly'.
Mr Ashdown concentrated on the environment - and more children. Television
crews waded through a pond to film Mr Ashdown returning frog spawn with
toddlers.
In Southwark and Bermondsey (held by Mr Simon Hughes for the Liberal
Democrats with a 2,779 majority over Labour), the theme was health and
promises of job creation.
The Liberal Democrats would reduce the rate of basic income tax to offset
local taxes raised by regional assemblies, Baroness Seear, the party's
deputy leader in the House of Lords, said yesterday in Liverpool.
In the first of a series of regional manifesto launches she will make this
week in northern England, she said there would be a shift of spending from
central to regional government, with a corresponding shift in tax raising. A
regional assembly could raise more local money, in effect increasing the 26p
standard income tax rate in the region.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Red sweater and kippers v Elgar on the cliffs
 -No adventure in the Tory political broadcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'What you see is what you get' is the PR slogan we have grown used to as a
description for John Major. In John Schlesinger's campaign film for the
Conservatives, The Journey, what you see is what you quickly forget.
The film's unshowy style is merciful in one way. There are no shots of John
and Norma walking hand-in-hand along Elgar-haunted clifftops. But the hidden
message may be equally strident. The matter-of-fact footage of the PM in a
car revisiting his natal Brixton, interspersed with footage of him sitting
on a verandah recollecting his humble origins in tranquillity (he craftily
wears a red sweater), is so low-key it is almost hectoring.
The message is clear and loud: a man born poor need not grow up to be a
socialist. The manner is clearer and propagandistically louder: this is a
soft-spoken Mr Nice Guy and he might knock on your door for a cup of tea at
any moment.
The PM is filmed buying kippers and tomatoes in a street market. From his or
Mr Schlesinger's moving car he peers out at his childhood addresses, in awe
that the houses still survive. (he has not visited them since?) He points
down a street saying that that was where he used to put up soapboxes and
make speeches as a youth. 'Some people used to engage in badinage,' he
comments, a locution only Mr Major could produce.
Cunningly the man in the red sweater keeps chipping in, emphasising the
message behind all the childhood recall: that absolutely everything is safe
in Conservative hands. The economy, education, health, Britain, the world.
He shows us the very house in whose back garden he played cricket, he says,
for hour after hour. And he is shown putting those hands to good use in the
film's climactic montage (music, please, Mr Purcell) where he shakes his
manual extremities - I am trying to catch the Major style - with the likes
of Bush, Mandela and Yeltsin.
A statesman; for our times; a man for all seasons; a bloke from Brixton; a
safe pair of hands. The country is reassured, which is a small triumph for
Mr Schlesinger; but I am still worrying about what the Number 10 chef is
expected to cook with the tomatoes and kippers.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Labour gambles with the affluent - The
implications for marginal seats of John Smith's tax plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the biggest gamble of the campaign. As the details of Mr John Smith's
shadow Budget settled into the country's electoral landscape yesterday the
political judgment emerged from the complicated arithmetic of his proposed
tax and benefit changes.
In the battle for the marginal seats on which a Labour victory depends, the
shadow chancellor has decided to sacrifice the potential support of the
affluent in a drive to reassure the skilled working classes.
If last night's polls prove a reliable guide it will work. The survey taken
after Mr Smith's announcement pointed to a five-point Labour lead  - the
same result as a poll taken before plans were unveiled.
But the Conservatives, who have three weeks to 'unpick' the plans, claimed
the package was a bad miscalculation: that Labour had alienated too many of
the modestly well-off.
Their judgment was that the plan to abolish the Pounds 21,000 ceiling on
National Insurance contributions would swing back to the government many of
the 30 or so seats in London and the south-east which have been targeted by
the opposition.
The Labour leadership was equally adamant that it had kept the balance of
advantage. As Mr Smith put it, Labour is not chasing votes in the
stockbroker belt. It is the support of a much larger segment of the
electorate, the average taxpayer and average family, which it is after.
Mr Smith won independent backing for his claim that across the country eight
out of 10 taxpayers would be better off under his package and that of those
remaining only 10 per cent would be losers.
But it is not as simple as that. The distribution and present political
allegiance of those voters may turn out to be just as important as the
numbers.
In London, where Labour is hoping to win at least 20 seats, the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the number of losers rose to 18
per cent. In the south-east, where Labour may win another 10 seats, the
proportion worse off from the package was put at 14 per cent.
The Conservatives - who do not accept that the IFS has included all of the
'hidden' tax increases in the calculations - said that in constituencies
where the outcome depended on a few thousand votes or less the losers would
give them a decisive advantage.
Mr John Major reeled off a list of those who would have to pay the extra 9
per cent in every pound earned over Pounds 21,000 a year. They were not just
the rich: a primary school head teacher would pay an extra Pounds 560 a
year, a secondary school head Pounds 1,500, a senior hospital registrar
Pounds 517 and a GP Pounds 1,700. To that list his strategists attached the
names of marginal constituencies such as Slough and Basildon, Dulwich and
Battersea, Hampstead and Croydon North West. The message to those seats is
that Labour does not plan an extra tax on the rich but on those whose
incomes are not far above the male average of Pounds 18,000 a year.
One member of the cabinet said that Mr Smith, for all his presentational
skills, had forgotten the golden rule of politics. Gainers from tax changes
were rarely thankful but the losers always screamed. He has also failed to
appreciate that 'people do not think statistically'. Many of those who earn
less than Pounds 20,000 aspire to incomes above it.
There are other constituencies where concentrations of relatively affluent
voters might tilt the balance. Elmet in North Yorkshire, Birmingham Hall
Green, Southampton Test and Chester fall into that category.
Mr Smith recognised the risks but judged that it was one he had to take. The
careful package of increases in tax thresholds, the abolition of the
starting rate of NICs and the increases in child benefit and pensions had a
single objective: to persuade those earning between perhaps Pounds 10,000
and Pounds 20,000 a year that they have nothing to fear from Labour.
For Labour they are the swing voters whose crosses on the ballot paper will
decide the election. The party's research showed that the Conservatives had
been successful in persuading many of them, particularly in marginals, that
they faced substantial tax increases. Labour had to reassure them.
Mr Smith's assessment was that winning back their support was more important
than appealing to a smaller segment of the electorate which leans heavily
towards the Conservatives. The shadow chancellor, of course, would not admit
such cynical motives. As an aide said: 'This was an occasion when we could
be morally correct and politically wise.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Altruism and fear in the middle ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN, CHRIS TIGHE, JAMES BUXTON and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXTURE OF resignation, fear and altruism was expressed by middle-income
professionals yesterday facing the prospect of higher taxes under a Labour
government.
Mr David Land, an Edinburgh bank official earning between Pounds 30,000 and
Pounds 40,000 said: 'Labour's tax plans would make me more miserable. Most
of my money goes to looking after our family. I would like see John Major
returned by a whisker, but also to get constitutional change in Scotland.'
He plans to vote Liberal Democrat.
Less certain was Mr Keith Green, who is in the same earnings bracket. An
account director at a London marketing consultancy, he said that under
Labour he would pay more tax without any guarantee of improved public
transport or education. 'They seem to be taking money from a small group and
giving it to another,' he said. 'I'll vote either Tory or Liberal Democrat.'
The resolve to vote Conservative was as strong as ever for Mr Adam
Applegarth, 29, assistant general manager at Northern Rock building society
in Newcastle upon Tyne. He earns Pounds 45,000 a year. 'I don't believe John
Smith can hold the line against their spending ministers,' he said.
Mr Roderick Nicol, an Exeter management training consultant on Pounds
50,000, would be hit by Labour's proposals. 'I'm not sure I trust any of the
parties to spend money wisely,' he said. He planned to stick with the
Conservatives.

LABOUR has failed to explain whether its shadow Budget includes the Pounds
11bn of privatisation receipts expected by the government, the Liberal
Democrats said yesterday. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat treasury

ASLEF, the train drivers' union, yesterday postponed a campaign against rail
privatisation after legal advisers said that it should not go ahead during
the election campaign, Michael Smith writes.
The union was told that it could be open to a challenge that it was
providing hidden finance for the Labour party, which opposes privatisation.
The Trades Union Congress is also advising unions that local Labour party
agents must be consulted on anything that promotes the party and its
candidates. Aslef did not have time to contact them before today's scheduled

FT  18 MAR 92 / Wakeham move on power prices attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, to curb increases in
electricity bills for industrial users have been 'an abject failure,'
according to large power consumers including Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK
foods group, and Blue Circle, the cement and aggregates group.
The companies, which belong to the Major Energy Users' Council, a lobbying
group, yesterday wrote to Mr Wakeham saying his efforts to prevent increases
of 15 per cent or more in April electricity bills had not helped.
Earlier this month Mr Wakeham asked Nuclear Electric, the state-owned
operator of the nuclear stations in England and Wales, to sell cheaper power
to industry. Although Nuclear Electric dropped its price last week, the
council said it was still far too high.
'Nobody has taken up the offer as far as we are aware,' said Mr Neil
Tribick, vice-chairman of the council's electricity group.
Mr Tribick said Nuclear Electric's new price of 2.3p per unit plus an
inflation adjustment was still 15 per cent more than last year's average
price. The offer also came too late for many consumers, who had had to buy
more expensive power from National Power and PowerGen because they faced
deadlines to renew existing contracts, he said. 'We don't understand why
prices are increasing so much, and are asking the Department of Energy why.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Brokers protest at lack of cover for Names: Allegations of
inadequate backing for stop-loss protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has broken out at the Lloyd's of London insurance market over the
refusal of many leading underwriters to back schemes providing stop-loss
insurance - or personal reinsurance policies  - for Names, the individuals
whose assets provide the market's capital.
Brokers argue that the lack of realistically priced stop-loss insurance
could undermine the market's capital base by leading many Names to leave.
Last year 12,500 Names bought stop-loss insurance - which covers a band of
losses beyond an amount usually equivalent to between 10 per cent and 20 per
cent of the amount of premiums underwritten by a Name.
This year many underwriters have declined to back a scheme developed by two
brokers, Harrison Stuart and Holman Wade, which is intended to provide cover
for more than 8,000 Names.
Underwriters, who are wary of high-risk business in view of the losses
recently suffered by catastrophe syndicates, are demanding rate increases of
up to 100 per cent and reducing cover by as much as 50 per cent, which makes
stop-loss cover expensive and unattractive for Names. According to Mr John
Harrison, chairman of Harrison Stuart, the insurers' attitude that stop-loss
is 'not an underwriting proposition' is sending the 'worst possible signal'
to Names.
Mr Michael Wade, chairman of Holman Wade, wrote last November that in the
absence of stop-loss insurance as many as 8,000 Names might leave Lloyd's.
It said this would place the market under 'extreme and possibly
unsustainable, pressure'. Senior brokers last week visited Mr Richard
Hazell, a leading underwriter and deputy chairman of Lloyd's, to urge him to
back the Harrison Stuart/Holman Wade scheme.
Mr Jim Payne, a broker with EW Payne who is confident that the Holman
Wade/Harrison Stuart scheme will be placed, said yesterday: 'People must get
their act together.' Mr Harrison said: 'There is no doubt that the big
brokers have the ability to concentrate the market's mind.'
It emerged yesterday that syndicate 932, one of the biggest marine
syndicates at Lloyd's with 3,102 Names, is to leave its 1989 year open.
The syndicate, which is managed by Janson Green, has Been unable to assess
its liabilities arising from exposure to US legal cases involving pollution
and asbestosis with sufficient accuracy to be able to close its accounts.
Mr Richard Youell, underwriter, said that the number of notifications of
pollution claims rose by 10 per cent last year.
The claims have emerged on policies written between 1950 and 1985. Some US
courts have ruled recently in favour of insurers in pollution cases,
supporting arguments that the cost of cleaning up a polluted site cannot be
claimed on an insurance policy.
However many of these verdicts have been appealed against, and according to
Mr Youell there is still considerable uncertainty over the size of future
claims. A decision to close the syndicate's accounts would have involved the
establishment of large reserves and would have meant heavy losses for Names.
Investigations by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee into an insurance broker
are continuing. An employee allegedly 'skimmed' insurance premiums by
charging his client more than the real cost of the premiums and retaining
the difference.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Watchdog criticises car adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME car suppliers use advertising which could encourage dangerous driving
as well as making safety claims which could be misleading, the Advertising
Standards Authority ruled yesterday.
The authority says in its report for January that it upheld complaints over
an advertisement by VAG UK, the Volkswagen-Audi distributor, which claimed
that 'the Audi 100 is the safest luxury car ever tested'. The authority
found that the car had been tested only for frontal collisions. Its report
also states that an article supplied by VAG to support its safety claims
'did not conclude that the Audi had beaten the other models tested'.
The authority upheld complaints against Renault UK for focusing on the
alleged rapid acceleration and top speed of the Clio model, singling out the
use of 'blistering' and 'exhilarating' for criticism.
Nissan Europe is criticised for advertising the Nissan 300 ZX model in a way
manner 'capable of encouraging drivers to attempt overtaking manoeuvres in
tight situations'.
The report also criticises Citroen UK for an advertisement which might
'reinforce the widespread misconception concerning the use of lanes on a
motorway'.
A campaign by Vauxhall, which included the claim that the new Astra has a
'pedestrian-friendly front' and referred to the vehicle as 'thiefproof', is
also criticised.
The authority also upheld complaints against the environment and energy
departments. They concerned a campaign which linked global warming to the
storms of 1987, 1989 and 1990. The authority said any future advertising
should make clear that any connection was a matter of opinion.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Law jobs 'too costly for many graduates'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY half of the law graduates who failed to take up their places on this
year's finals course for solicitors dropped out because they could not
afford a career in the law, according to the College of Law.
An inquiry by the college, the largest training organisation for solicitors
in Europe, found that 244 of the 508 law students who cancelled places or
failed to register at the beginning of the 1991-92 academic year had
financial reasons for withdrawing.
More than 40 per cent of respondents to a more detailed questionnaire sent
to the 244 had upper second honours degrees, and 11 per cent had already
arranged training contracts with law firms.
Nineteen per cent of the respondents had managed to obtain a council grant,
although only 6 per cent managed to get both fees and a contribution to
maintenance; 9 per cent were offered a bank loan; and 6 per cent obtained
some sponsorship from employers or potential employers. Only 2 per cent
obtained grants from charities or other foundations.
Worst affected were students from ethnic minorities and married women
returning to work after having children.
Mr Richard Holbrook, chairman of the college's management board, said the
college was 'very concerned about the extent of initial student drop-out'.
The college would continue to campaign for mandatory grants to cover fees on
the finals course and look for help from business in establishing a bursary
scheme, he said.
Mrs Yve Schelaas, a married women with four children who obtained an upper
second degree from the University of Kent, approached 20 firms in the hope
of securing sponsorship for her finals course.
'It's such a waste of taxpayers' money to educate law graduates so far and
then not enable them to finish their qualifications,' she said.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Six are accused of pension fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX men appeared at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday accused of conspiring
to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the pension funds of Aveling
Barford, an engineering company based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, which is
now in liquidation.
They were alleged to have removed Pounds 5m from the Pounds 9.4m fund by a
deliberate fraud on the trustees, and to have used the money as capital for
the company and as commissions and payments to individuals.
The six defendants are Mr Robin Chapman, who was the company's solicitor; Mr
Mathieu Einhorn, a pension fund trustee; Mr David Carter, a financial
adviser and pensions expert; Mr Peter Murphy, a former executive director of
the company; and Mr Graham Severn and Mr Harold Hobson, both former
directors of Mildminster, an investment adviser.
All six denied conspiring to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the
hourly-paid employees' pension plan and the staff pension plan by failing to
disclose to them the true nature and value of an investment.
Mr Chapman and Mr Einhorn also deny conspiring to obtain Pounds 1m belonging
to the trustees and beneficiaries by making false representations. Mr Severn
and Mr Hobson also denied the theft of Pounds 880,252.
Mr Richard Latham QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said the
company had been sold by British Leyland to a company controlled by Dr Lee
Kin Tat, a Singapore businessman, and Mr Adrian Eschallier, a US lawyer, in
1983.
'The central allegation is that from the end of 1983 Dr Lee, Mr Eschallier
and other senior people both within and without the company had designs on
the pension fund,' he said. It was seen as a source of capital for Aveling
Barford and for personal commissions and payments to individuals, Mr Latham
added.
In 1986 Pounds 1m had been lent by the fund to the company by means of a
fraud on the honest trustees, from whom material information had been
deliberately witheld. In 1987-88 a further Pounds 4m had been dishonestly
removed from the fund and 'reinvested' through Mildminster, Mr Latham said.
The trial is expected to last four to five months.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Traders demand government compensation for Iraqi debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL companies are demanding compensation from the British government for
Pounds 150m of Iraqi debts for goods supplied before the invasion of Kuwait.
More than 30 British companies which traded with Iraq before the
introduction of sanctions in August 1990 face substantial unpaid bills which
have seriously affected their operations.
Many feel bitter that they were encouraged to trade with Iraq by the British
government in the 1980s, but that Whitehall has turned its back on them now
difficulties have arisen.
They are also angered by the knowledge that funds held by the Iraqi
government in UK banks are estimated to be worth Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 706m)
and still earning interest which on its own would now be enough to pay their
debts.
Mr Omeir Cotran, chairman and managing director of OMC Group, a
worsted-fabric manufacturer based in Huddersfield, says: 'We are in a very
bad position. We are just surviving, but I am not sure for how much longer.'
He has outstanding bills from Iraq for Dollars 1.2m, mainly from trade
during 1989 and 1990 up to the imposition of sanctions. Since then, he has
had to shed 30 of his 70 employees and close one of his two mills.
Late last year, his bank scrutinised the company's diminishing cashflows and
withdrew its overdraft facility.
OMC traded with private-sector customers. But Iraqi government regulations
during the 1980s required payments to be channelled through letters of
credit issued against the Rafidain and Rashid banks, both of which are
branches of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance.
The company used to underwrite its trade through the UK's Export Credit
Guarantee Department. When the ECGD stopped offering long-term cover to Iraq
during the Iran-Iraq war, OMC simply relied on the letters of credit.
'We thought this was very safe business,' says Mr Cotran. 'We thought there
was no way we would not get our money unless the government went bust.'
But while Iraqi customers paid money in advance to the banks which issued
the letters of credit, repayments slowed during the late 1980s and ceased as
a result of the worldwide freeze on Iraqi assets imposed when the UN imposed
sanctions against the Baghdad regime.
Mr Gregori Tchelbakian, founder of Apollo Fashions, a fashionwear company
with Dollars 2.5m in unpaid bills, says: 'It's very frustrating to know that
the Iraqi government owns money here accruing interest, while we are
suffering.'
Mr Saad Jadir, managing director of Dominion (England), an exporter of car
parts with Dollars 10m in Iraqi unpaid debts, estimates that there are at
least 60 companies with debts totalling Pounds 150m in a similar position.
He has managed to document Pounds 50m in detail so far.
He suggests two possible options. One is for the UK government to unfreeze
some Iraqi assets on condition that the debts are repaid. The other is for
interest on Iraqi deposits still frozen in the UK to be released to pay the
debts. He also offers a third approach: persuading the Bank of England to
underwrite lines of credit against the letters of credit issued. He has
already held discussions with UK institutions on supporting such an idea.
Appeals to the UK government so far have been frustrated by a ceaseless
merry-go-round of bureaucratic buck-passing, he says. 'These companies
should go to the Bank of England,' the Department of Trade and Industry said
yesterday. 'They hold the purse strings.'
It added that companies had to make their own commercial decisions about
insuring against risks of non-payment. It said that while officials and
ministers can sometimes 'put in a heavy word', no such diplomatic or
economic links currently exist with Iraq, making these tactics impossible.
The Bank of England has a unit created to consider the issue of Iraqi
sanctions.
A Bank official said, however: 'This is one for the Foreign Office. We are
an executive arm. Our unit has no discretion whatever.'
The Foreign Office, in turn, maintains that it merely implements the
UN-imposed asset freeze, and adds that there is little indication that the
attitude towards Iraq is softening. 'On the situation of British firms, you
should ask the DTI or the Bank of England,' it said yesterday.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Decline reported in engineering orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a third of engineering companies in the west Midlands saw orders
fall between November and last month, according to a business survey of the
Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands, issued yesterday.
The survey, covering 455 companies in the British region most dependent on
manufacturing, underpins national statistics which yesterday showed a 0.7
per cent fall in manufacturing between December and January.
The proportion of companies experiencing fewer orders fell compared with the
three months to November.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the EEF West Midlands, said: 'Whilst
more companies indicated a decrease in orders over the period than reported
an increase, the gap has narrowed. Thirty-four per cent of respondents
experienced an improvement whilst 37 per cent showed a decrease.' Mr
Botterill expects only 'a slow, selective and rather tentative recovery from
the present unacceptably low base'.
The severity of the recession for manufacturing was emphasised by a report
on business conditions by Staffordshire County Council, which said 46 per
cent of companies in the county worked below 80 per cent capacity in
December, compared with 39 per cent in September.

FT  18 MAR 92 / PSBR growth boosted by fall in tax revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC-SECTOR finances continued to deteriorate last month as big increases
in government spending and weaker tax revenues led to high borrowing.
The public sector borrowing requirement for February was Pounds 1bn,
including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.8bn. This compares with a net
repayment of Pounds 0.6bn in the same month last year.
Although the figure was high it came as little surprise to the markets. In
last week's Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, pointed towards heavy
government borrowing when he forecast a PSBR of Pounds 13.8bn for the fiscal
year ending on March 31.
February's figure, released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday,
brought the PSBR for the first 11 months of the fiscal year to Pounds 7.4bn,
compared with a surplus of Pounds 3.6bn in the same period last year. This
implies record borrowing for March of Pounds 6.4bn.
The Treasury said March was always a big month for borrowing as government
departments rushed to spend up to their cash limits before the end of the
year.
Overall, expenditure grew much faster than revenue in the first 11 months of
the fiscal year. Total government cash outlays were 10 per cent higher than
in the same period of 1990-91, while total cash receipts grew by only 2.5
per cent. Net departmental spending in February alone was 20 per cent higher
than a year ago.
Weak economic growth over the coming year, combined with high government
spending commitments and lower privatisation revenues mean the PSBR is
likely to worsen in the next two years.
In the Budget Mr Lamont forecast a PSBR of Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds
32bn in 1993-94.
The PSBR, excluding privatisation proceeds, was Pounds 15.2bn in the first
11 months of this financial year compared with a figure close to zero in the
same period in 1990-91.
Privatisation proceeds from the second instalment of the sale of the
electricity generating companies of Pounds 0.8bn helped to temper February's
PSBR. Further assistance came from local authorities paying back a
surprising Pounds 0.7m.
In the 11 months to February privatisation proceeds amounted to Pounds 7.8bn
 -Pounds 4bn more than proceeds in the same period last year.
Mr Simon Briscoe, senior UK economist at Greenwell Montagu said: 'February's
figure supports the view that public finances are continuing to deteriorate
and we can expect to see large borrowing in 1992-93.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Advantages seen in 'single-table' deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES which bargain with several unions separately are likely to pay
higher wages and perform less well financially than companies which deal
with just one union or several negotiating together, according to a study by
economists.
The economists also find that bargaining separately with several unions
makes companies more prone to strikes lasting a day or more.
The report was compiled by Mr Stephen Machin and Mr John Van Reenen of the
economics department at University College, London, and Mr Mark Stewart of
the economics department at Warwick University. It comes when many employers
are considering whether to simplify their industrial relations by cutting
the number of unions they deal with or introducing 'single-table' bargaining
arrange-ments. Under the 'single-table' approach, several unions, often
representing different groups of workers, bargain together.
The study says data drawn from the government-funded Workplace Industrial
Relations Survey of 1984 show that what matters 'is not the presence of
multiple recognition, but whether or not multiple unions bargain en masse or
as individual entities'.
The study suggests that skilled workers benefit more than semi-skilled and
unskilled workers from fragmented bargaining. It adds that the mark-up for
skilled workers in such arrangements over similar workers covered by single
bargaining procedures is 8.3 per cent. Semi-skilled and unskilled workers
benefit by 5 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively.
The economists say wages differ little between establishments where the
workers belong to multiple unions - but bargain jointly  - and those in
comparable units with a single union.
The evidence found by the economists about the effect of fragmented
bargaining on financial performance, measured by rising demand and the use
of plant, is less clear-cut.
They say, however, that the difference between fragmented and 'single-table'
bargaining is more noticeable among manufacturers than non-manufacturing
employers.
The study finds that bargaining arrangements have little effect on any type
of industrial action. For strikes lasting at least a day, however, a
'significant difference' is found between multiple and 'single-table'
bargaining. 'This supports the notion that workplace disputes may result
from inter-union competition in bargaining,' the economists say.
Multi-union bargaining arrangements in workplaces have long been considered
by many industrial relations experts to be a restraining force on industrial
effici-ency.
The 1968 Donovan Commission, set up by the then government, strongly
advocated moves to industrial unionism, based on single industry-wide
unions, on the grounds that inter-union competition was divisive.
Companies setting up plants almost all recognise just one union, if any.

FT  18 MAR 92 / ICI emissions were cut by 3.7% last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Indus-tries, the international chemicals group, published
its worldwide emission figures for the first time yesterday. The move is
part of its efforts to be more open about its environmental performance.
It said emissions to land, air and water fell 3.7 per cent from 8.6m tonnes
in 1990 to 8.3m last year. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said that although
there were some problems which would not be speedily resolved, the group had
made a good start towards its environmental goals. These include reducing
emissions by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1995.
Sir Denys said he regretted that the group had been prosecuted 26 times last
year for environmental offences, compared with 36 occasions in 1990. The
number of prosecutions decreased in every country ICI operates in except the
UK. Sir Denys said ICI recognised that it needed to do better.
Production of hazardous waste fell 30 per cent from 677.9 tonnes in 1990 to
475.9 tonnes last year. ICI said it aimed to eliminate all off-site disposal
of environmentally harmful waste. The amount of hazardous waste disposed of
at off-site landfills fell from 160 tonnes in 1990 to 151 tonnes last year.
Production of non-hazardous waste fell 1.5 per cent from 7.949bn tonnes in
1990 to 7.834bn tonnes last year.
However, the amount of non-hazardous waste disposed of through landfill
increased from 3,509 tonnes in 1990 to 3,565. ICI also increased the amount
of waste dumped in the North Sea from 150 tonnes to 170 tonnes. Its licence
to dump in the North Sea ends early next year.
The company said it was committed to reducing its energy consumption, which
had fallen by 15 per cent since the early 1970s. Carbon dioxide emissions
had also fallen by 15 per cent over the same period. Between 1990 and last
year group energy consumption fell by 6 per cent - helped by the group's
disposal of 20 businesses last year and a 4 per cent fall in sales. Capital
and current expenditure on environmental measures had increased by 10 per
cent to 15 per cent since 1987, said the company. The group spent more than
Pounds 100m on environmentally-related capital expenditure and more than
Pounds 200m on current expenditure last year.
ICI said it had asked its most significant manufacturing sites to provide
more detailed information about their environmental performance to employees
and local communities.
According to ICI's annual report, published yesterday, Sir Denys Henderson's
salary increased by 11.4 per cent last year from Pounds 448,000 in 1990 to
Pounds 499,000. He was not awarded a profit-related bonus in either year.
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian manufacturing group, are to
conduct annual environmental audits to assess the ecological impact of their
business activities, Andrew Jack writes. Norsk Hydro's plans involve adding
an environmental statement to the annual accounts of its UK subsidiary. The
developments follow a detailed report on the parent company's environmental
impact published in Norway three years ago. The document is now cited as an
example of best practice in 'green' reporting. BA is drafting the first of
what it hopes will be an annual environmental report to accompany its annual
accounts. It will contain a numerical assessment of the business under six
headings: noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement
in the community.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Unions seek end to Civil Service pay gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between the pay of senior civil servants and comparable white-collar
workers in the private sector is no longer justifiable, according to unions
basing their claims on a report on job security by Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Deloitte, the consultancy firm.
Senior civil servants have traditionally been paid less than their
private-sector counterparts, in part because they are less likely to lose
their jobs and face long periods of un-employment.
Their remuneration is now the subject of the most comprehensive review since
the mid 1980s. It is expected that the Top Salaries Review Body will
recommend significant increases when it reports later in the year. According
to Coopers, in a report commissioned by the FDA, NUCPS and IPMS unions,
there is ample evidence of a higher degree of turbulence and job-changing in
the private sector, and the recession is sharpening the difference.
The report says: 'However, it is important to recognise that not all
turbulence is synonymous with insecurity, and not all insecurity is
synonymous with hardship.'
Job changes, the report says, reflect a desire by private-sector managers
for wide experience and head-hunting by employers. 'Even in the midst of
recession the length of time on average between jobs does not seem to
outweigh the length of time over which financial support is available.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Friendly societies widen their scope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIENDLY societies, the institutions born out of the co-operative movement
to sell products such as insurance and investment schemes, have won the
right to extend the scope of their financial services.
Under the Friendly Societies Bill, which has passed through parliament, they
can opt for corporate status and form incorporated subsidiaries offering new
services.
The Act will establish a new regulatory framework, including a Friendly
Societies Commission. Friendly societies will also be brought within the
scope of the Policyholders Protection Act 1975.
The Registry of Friendly societies will have to change its regulations
before friendly societies can take advantage of the new legislation. That
process could take another year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO administrative units are to be built in Portsmouth for the Royal Navy
and Royal Marines under plans for rationalising senior staff structures.
The plans, yet to be officially announced, are expected to result in the
transfer of several hundred jobs.
The Navy's personnel department will move to Portsmouth from London and
merge with the home command headquarters in new premises in the naval base.
This change, due to take place by the spring of 1994, will involve combining
the jobs of Second Sea Lord, now held by Admiral Sir Michael Livesay, and of
Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, held by Admiral Sir John Kerr.
At the same time, Royal Marines headquarters oper-ations in London, Plymouth
and Poole are also to move to Portsmouth, where a building to be completed
in November 1994 is planned on Whale Island.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Go-ahead for power station
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES POWER has signed final contracts to build a Pounds 661m 1,000MW
gas-fired power station in Barking, East London.
The announcement yesterday came shortly after Mobil had said it would cancel
its plans for a 300MW station on Canvey Island, Essex.
Completion of the Barking project follows months of controversy which began
when both Thames Power and Mobil last March contested a decision by British
Gas to increase the price of gas to power stations by 35 per cent.
The disputes were settled in September when British Gas offered both
projects special deals, provoking charges of preferential treatment.
The Thames Power project, due to start generating electricity next year, is
one of only a few independent power station projects announced since the
privatisation of the electricity industry which is likely to start up before
1995.

The workforce will have the final say in a ballot next month but is expected

in car-plant industrial relations.
It will guarantee some workers jobs for life, scrap nearly all shop-floor
demarcation and open the way for flexible team working. It also promises
that there will be no more compulsory redundancies. The age-old ritual of

FT  18 MAR 92 / DTI attempt to recover Clowes millions absurd, court is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry's attempt to recover Pounds 19.8m from
Mr Peter Clowes, the jailed former head of the collapsed Barlow Clowes
investment empire, and his wife Pamela involved 'a degree of unreality
bordering on absurdity', defence counsel told a High Court judge yesterday.
The DTI was inviting the judge to shut his eyes against commercial reality,
Mr Philip Engelman, for Mr Clowes, said.
Mr Clowes, who is serving a 10-year sentence for theft and fraud, faces an
application for summary judgment - without a full hearing of the issues -
for the return of Pounds 19.8m of the money lost by investors. The DTI had
told vice-chancellor Sir Donald Nicholls that Mr Clowes and his wife were
jointly liable for the millions missing from Barlow Clowes and Partners.
The shortfall was discovered following the compulsory winding-up in July
1988 of Barlow Clowes Gilt Managers, which had taken over the management of
investors' funds in gilt-edged securities.
Mr Engelman said that nowhere had the DTI attempted to explain how the
shortfall came about. If the court looked at the matter there was no
shortfall in terms of the construction of the contracts with investors.
There were too many unexplained issues in the case. It was unsuitable for a
summary judgment and a full trial of the issues should be held, he said.
The DTI claim is one of many against Mr Clowes, who cheated thousands of
small investors of an estimated Pounds 113m by falsely promising to invest
in government gilt-edged securities. He spent the money on a yacht, an
executive jet, expensive cars and various business enterprises. Only Pounds
1.9m of a Pounds 115m investment fund was found to have been invested in
government stock.
The hearing continues today.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Manley, epitome of developing world's dilemma: 30 years of a
third world socialist faced with diminishing wealth to redistribute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK before he was returned to office in a general election in 1989, Mr
Michael Manley found himself facing a barrage of questions from incredulous
journalists about his reported change in political thinking.
After several attempts to explain his transition from socialism to an
advocate of the free market, Mr Manley looked at one of his interrogators
and asked: 'Is your outlook on everything the same as it was 10 years ago?'
Mr Manley, who announced at the weekend that he was resigning as Jamaica's
prime minister at the end of the month at the age of 67 because of poor
health, epitomised the change which has overtaken the politics of the
developing world in the past three decades.
Between 1972 and 1980, in his first two terms as prime minister of the
island of 2.5m people, Mr Manley put a leftward slant on the Fabian
socialist principles in which he had been schooled by his father, Mr Norman
Manley, founder of the People's National Party and one of Jamaica's national
heroes.
His administration then trumpeted the cause of Third World control over its
patrimony, advocated state control of the pillars of the economy, supported
changes in the patterns of international trade to encourage south-south
links and sought to restructure Jamaican society by redistributing elusive
wealth to close the yawning gap between the rich and the poor.
He antagonised even the more liberal elements in the corridors of influence
in Washington by developing close economic and political links with Cuba,
Jamaica's closest neighbour.
Yet although his detractors, including many in Jamaica, regarded him as
something of a closet communist, Mr Manley's place on the ideological
spectrum was closer to that of Tanzania's Julius Nyerere and Zambia's
Kenneth Kaunda, than it was to Fidel Castro.
noscenti in Jamaica, Mr Manley's political outlook puts him somewhere to the
right of Mr Neil Kinnock and the left of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. The
transition came after Jamaican electors overwhelmingly rejected Mr Manley's
socialism in 1980 in favour of more conservative policies of the Jamaica
Labour Party led by Mr Edward Seaga.
Mr Manley said that between then and 1989, when he was returned to office
with a handsome majority, he reflected on the need for a new strategy to
deal with Jamaica's problems.
Mr Manley's retirement has set off a contest for the leadership of the PNP
and for the prime ministership. Mr P J Patterson, the party's chairman, and
a former deputy prime minister and finance minister, and Miss Portia
Simpson, labour and welfare minister, have thrown their hats into the ring.
The PNP, which recent polls showed with roughly equal support to the
opposition Jamaican Labour Party, will meet on March 28 to choose a
successor.
Miss Simpson, a relatively inexperienced politician with strong popularity
ratings, has pledged her 'absolute commitment' to continuing Mr Manley's
free market-oriented policies.
Her relative inexperience has been seized upon by backers of Mr Patterson,
who announced his candidacy yesterday.
In January, Mr Patterson was replaced as deputy prime minister amid
allegations he approved a waiver of Dollars 1.47m of duties on unleaded
gasoline for Shell. The head of Shell in Jamaica, Mr Howard Hamilton, is a
member of the party's governing board.
The winner of the leadership contest will have more than a little difficulty
successfully continuing the economic process Mr Manley started. Having put
the PNP's hard left faction to the sword, Mr Manley did an ideological
volte-face, concluding that the private sector, not the state, should be
'the engine of growth' and that the government should play less of a role in
the economy.
Since his return to office three years ago, this has been reflected in a
programme to deregulate the island's economy and divesting state enterprises
to local and foreign investors.
'Getting the party in the 1980s to accept that this new path was the one
which should be pursued was a major task,' Mr Manley said at the weekend.
'It is getting this policy accepted which I regard as being among my most
significant achievements during my 40 years in politics.'
In an earlier interview he had said: 'We all learn new things and we all
change because we want to and because circumstances with which we deal have
changed.
'All over the Third World people have had to learn. The experience of
political independence, when one was full of optimism, is followed not by a
change of ideals, but by a period of learning what can be accomplished and
what cannot be.'
Mr Manley graduated from the London School of Economics after serving in the
Royal Canadian Air Force in the Second World War. He later worked as a
journalist with the BBC between 1949 and 1952, when he returned to Jamaica
to became an organiser of the National Workers Union, affiliated to the PNP
led by his father.
He entered politics in 1967 when he became a member of parliament, and has
been an MP since, except for five years in the 1980s when the PNP boycotted
a general election over a row about the state of the voters' register.
As he disengages, Mr Manley may conclude that those who follow him will have
an easier time. 'Politicians cannot run countries,' he once said. 'They only
set directions.' He did try to run Jamaica in the 1970s. His memoirs are
likely to suggest that he tried too hard.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY and US trade officials continue talks today aimed at
ending their long-running row over aircraft manufacturing subsidies,
following 'positive' discussions yesterday.
Negotiators for the two sides refused to comment last night on details of
the talks, but one US official said the mood was 'upbeat'; a Brussels
official said it was a good sign the talks had focused on technical issues.
'When both sides are discussing technicalities, it's because they have the
political consensus to go on.'
The US and EC are trying to find common ground before their self-imposed
deadline of the end of the month.
If they succeed, the agreement will form the core of a new Gatt code on
aircraft subsidies; but if they fail, the Gatt panel may have to rule on the
dispute.
The row revolves round American accusations that Airbus Industrie, the EC
manufacturing consortium, received subsidies from EC governments, and
Community counter-accusations that US manufacturers benefited from subsidies
disguised as space or defence research grants.
US negotiators are seeking EC pledges on cutting Airbus subsidies.
The meeting has been looking at a German scheme under which the German
partner, Deutsche Airbus, was protected from exchange rate fluctuations.
The Gatt disputes panel has already condemned the scheme on the grounds that
it constitutes an export subsidy.

Uruguay Round

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany flies to Washington on Friday for talks
with President George Bush, convinced that a last-minute breakthrough is
still possible in the long-stalled Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
The German Chancellor hopes he will be able to persuade Mr Bush to make a
key concession, by accepting a freeze on future US exports of cereals
substitutes to the European Community.
In return, he believes he can promise a European readiness to accept
quantity restrictions on EC farm exports, which until now has proved a
crucial sticking-point in the negotiations.
Failure by the US and EC to agree on farm trade has put in jeopardy the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks, launched by Gatt in 1986 to reform a
wide spectrum of world trade.
Mr Kohl believes he has the backing of the European Commission, UK premier
John Major and Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, along with, significantly,
President Francois Mitterrand of France for the concession. Mr Kohl will
meet Mr Bush at Camp David on Saturday.
'The proposed compromise makes clear again that here in Europe and Bonn
there is a firm will to conclude the Gatt Round in April,' an official said.
'(Chancellor Kohl) can tell Mr Bush that the French president, the European
Commission and the Portuguese presidency (of the European Council of
Ministers) all agree we want a conclusion, and that the Europeans are ready
for a sensible compromise.'
The German compromise would protect the European farm market from a flood of
US cereal substitutes, mainly corn gluten feed, citrus pellets and tapioca,
once EC agricultural reform starts to cut home-based production.
German officials believe that if the US compromises on that question, EC
resistance, above all in France, to quantity curbs on European exports would
fall away.
German officials have welcomed the intervention of Mr James Baker, US
secretary of state.
It is understood Mr Baker proposed last week a 'safe box' system to allow
future income support for EC farmers to be kept on over an extended period.

talks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, yesterday launched a fresh appeal
for an early and successful end to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Frances
Williams reports from Geneva. The delay in completing the talks, more than a
year over schedule, was worsening the international economic environment and
threatening the reform programmes of many developing and former communist
economies, he said.
Introducing his annual report to Gatt's governing council, Mr Dunkel said a
liberal and credible trading system played a pivotal role in promoting
development. Economic growth was being delayed by lack of confidence on the
part of producers, investors, traders and consumers. Only modest recovery
was in prospect in the years ahead.
'What we need, and urgently, is a significant boost to economic growth to
generate the investment flows, jobs and technology transfers and increased
earnings from trade without which the dramatic reform programmes under way
in many countries cannot be sustained,' Mr Dunkel said.
He urged Gatt members to seize the 'window of opportunity' to end the
Uruguay Round within weeks. The 108 countries taking part in the round aim
for a final package of accords by Easter, but this deadline seems unlikely
to be met. Mr Dunkel said the Round was crucial for Gatt's existing members
and more than 20 potential members.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to attract greater foreign participation in Brazil's privatisation
programme are being blocked by the central bank, which fears the move might
interfere with negotiations on the government's debt to foreign banks.
Both domestic and foreign debt can be used to pay the government for
companies being privatised, but under current rules the domestic debt is
swapped at face value while foreign debt carries a fixed 25 per cent
discount rate.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, co-ordinator of the privatisation programme, believes
this discount is the main reason for the lack of foreign participation so
far. Of the Dollars 1.72bn raised by the programme, only 1.9 per cent has
been paid in foreign debt paper. 'The discount is not attractive and it
seems like discrimination against foreigners,' Mr Modiano said. He wants to
replace this with an auction system to let the market set the value.
Mr Modiano fears that without access to the Dollars 45bn stock of MYDFA  -
the technical term for the bulk of Brazil's debt to foreign banks - the
programme will raise far less than originally planned. He said in an
interview yesterday: 'I have no doubt that if we had a smaller discount we
could achieve a higher price and attract a larger number of investors.'
The new rules were planned to be in place by mid-March. However the central
bank insists that any such changes must be reserved as bargaining chips in
Brazil's external debt negotiations which restarted in New York yesterday.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Bad-cheque affair bounces back at Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER WEEKS of accusing their Democratic opponents of bouncing cheques, the
Republicans are discovering that accusations, too, can bounce back.
The Republican administration has gleefully watched the Democrat-dominated
Congress tie itself into knots over the revelation that 355 present and
former congressmen wrote bad cheques on their accounts at the House of
Representatives' private bank.
Some members used the bank, which covered these cheques without charging any
fee, to provide what amounted to interest-free loans, and Republicans rubbed
their hands as they observed that most of the worst offenders were
Democrats.
Now, however, it has turned out that the list of those who overdrew their
accounts includes not only current Republican congressmen, but also three
former legislators who now sit in the Bush cabinet.
Mr Dick Cheney yesterday acknowledged writing at least 21 'problem cheques'
in 1988 and early 1989, before President George Bush named him defence
secretary, while Mr Edward Madigan, agriculture secretary, said 49 of his
cheques were held for payment by the House bank while he was a congressman.
Ms Lynn Martin, labour secretary, also said she had written 16 cheques with
insufficient funds in the 39-month period covered by a House investigation.
Although no taxpayers' money is at stake - in fact, the only losers were
other congressmen - the House bank scandal has fuelled irritation across the
US at the privileges of politicians.
Leading Republicans such as Congressman Newt Gingrich had sought to depict
the scandal as an indictment of the Democrats who have controlled the House
without interruption since 1954 and who have prevented President Bush from
passing legislation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNED article in a Chinese official newspaper said yesterday that
officials who blocked economic reform should be fired - a sign that a
current power struggle could lead to major personnel changes, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
'We must resolutely dismiss from their leading positions those officials who
lack the spirit of blazing new trails, who are incompetent and mediocre and
cannot make new developments,' the article in the Economic Daily said. 'By
dismissing one person we might be able to move a group.'
Almost nothing appears in China's press by accident. While signed articles
lack the authority of editorials they often represent the opening salvo of a
campaign, especially in a newspaper such as the Economic Daily, the official
organ of the State Council or cabinet.
An official at the newspaper said the author, Li Dawei, was a provincial
official involved in economic work.
'We believed his article was very well written but we didn't think much
about his background,' the newspaper official said.
Li's article, while unforgiving of opponents of reform, said proponents of
change should be forgiven their faults.
'We should not demand perfection of reformers and we certainly must not make
exaggerated criticisms of reformers' faults.'
Reformers were blamed for causing economic overheating in the late 1980s
which in turn led to widespread public unrest over runaway inflation and
corruption.

DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo - an early indicator of Japanese consumer
spending - declined in real terms in February for the third month running,
the Japan Department Stores Association said yesterday, writes Steven Butler
in Tokyo.
Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per
cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February
this year.
The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer
spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many
economists had hoped.
Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, household goods rose by 1.6
per cent while foodstuffs were 7 per cent up, while miscellaneous goods were
off by 5.3 per cent.

TOKYO share prices showed further weakness in opening trading early today,
after Japanese authorities gave no sign of following past practice and
intervening to revive the stricken market.
Finance Ministry officials indicated instead they would rely on general
monetary and economic policies to restore confidence eventually in the
market and in the economy.
'This is now a free market,' an official said. 'We are not going to try any
of the old tricks. They will not work.'
With institutional selling continuing to put pressure on prices today, the
Nikkei index finished the morning session down 317.67 points or 1.59 per
cent at 19,599.96.
Yesterday the index failed to regain the psychologically important 20,000
level, though it finished the day up 80.47 at 19,917.63. On Monday, the
index fell through the 20,000 level to its lowest close for five years.
The last time the index fell through this level in 1990 Mr Ryutaro
Hashimoto, the finance minister, relaxed regulations to encourage investors
to buy stock. This time, his successor, Mr Tsutomo Hata, has given no
indication of making a similar move.
The ministry's change of heart is a recognition that officials' power to
manage markets has been undermined by liberalisation in the 1980s, including
introduction of stock futures trading, admission of foreign companies and
interest rate deregulation.
It also a reflects a belief that even with support from stockbroking
companies the ministry lacks financial resources to shore up equities. In
the 1960s, the last bear market, officials encouraged broking companies to
club together to maintain prices.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S parliament voted yesterday to urge a semi-official organisation to
sign an investment guarantee agreement with China to protect thousands of
Taiwanese investors, AP reports from Taipei.
The motion said Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation should
negotiate an accord with its counterpart in Beijing to provide Taiwan
investors with fair treatment and protect their investments from
expropriation.
Taiwan's government cannot sign a pact with the rival Communist regime in
Beijing because both sides claim to be rulers of all China and ban official
contact. Taiwan's Nationalist government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing
a civil war on mainland China to Communist forces.
But Taiwan's parliament can ask semi-official organisations such as the
Straits Exchange Foundation to function as go-betweens for closer economic
ties with China.
Government statistics show Taiwan companies have invested Dollars 950m
(Pounds 554m) in China. Analysts believe the figure is higher and could
total Dollars 2.5bn as many Taiwanese do not report their investments to the
government.
Last year, Taiwan's indirect trade with China through Hong Kong totalled

FT  18 MAR 92 / Israel may target world Jewry for loan funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI ministers, apparently resigned to failing to secure Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.6bn) in loan guarantees from the US, said yesterday they would try
to raise funds elsewhere, mainly from world Jewry, to finance the absorption
of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
The government reacted bitterly to reports that the US administration had
turned down a Congressional compromise that would have advanced some
guarantees while talks continued on Washington's demand that Israel freeze
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
President George Bush last night told the two Congressmen behind the
compromise that their proposal did not give enough assurances that Israel
would not use the money to build settlements in occupied Arab lands.
'The president told them he would veto their bill on loan guarantees for
Israel,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
He said Mr Bush countered with a compromise proposal of his own that would
give the president more control over payment of the guarantees to Israel.
'We still want to negotiate it with Congress,' he said.
The dispute has caused a deep rift between Israel and Washington. The gulf
widened over the past week as the US alleged Israel had illegally sold US
weapons technology to China, South Africa and other countries in Asia,
Africa and South America.
Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister who is visiting Washington, said the US
was imposing 'impossible terms' on the loan guarantees. Israel had made the
guarantees a central part of its economic strategy for absorbing 1m
immigrants over the next five years. 'We will not crawl or beg for help,' he
told an audience of US Jews. Israel would turn to world Jewry to bridge the
gap.
Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, is understood to have visited
Geneva last week to canvass support from European Jewry as a step towards
substituting the US guarantees. Mr Moda'i suggested there was merit in the
US decision if it forced Israel to end its dependence on US aid of about
Dollars 3bn a year.
Finance Ministry officials said the lack of US guarantees would not have a
serious effect on the economy this year. A slowdown in immigration has eased
budgetary pressures and Israel's foreign reserves stand at more than Dollars
6bn.
But the damage lies in the difficulty Israel can expect to encounter in
raising loans on world markets, after what will be seen as a US vote of
no-confidence. Israel will also have to pay a higher price for the loans.
The country has scheduled more than Dollars 20bn in foreign borrowing over
the next few years to cope with immigration, a sum most officials say the
already heavily tapped Jewish diaspora cannot meet.
Meanwhile, a US team is to visit Israel to investigate the allegations that
Israel has re-exported weapons based on US technology contrary to strict
technology transfer agreements. The government, which has denied the
allegations, said it was happy to co-operate.
Israeli experts say systems with similar characteristics to US products,
such as the Python air-to-air missile and the Mapatz anti-tank missile, have
been sold to China and South Africa and other countries. Although
Israeli-made, their development often draws heavily on expertise gained from
foreign-supplied weapons.
The issue is likely to turn on the difficult question of what counts as a
straight - and thereby illegal  - copy of US technology and what qualifies
as a genuine new development.

FT  18 MAR 92 / US, UK and France agree Libya sanctions resolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France have agreed on a draft United Nations resolution
imposing sanctions on Libya, including a ban on all air links with the
country, for its alleged part in the bombing of civil airliners over
Scotland and Niger.
The draft text calls on all UN countries to deny all civil flights to and
from Libya, to halt the supply of arms and related materials to the country
and to downgrade the status and reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic
missions.
The resolution would also ban sales of aircraft or avionic spare parts to
Libya and all new insurance for Libyan civil airliners. It would prevent the
operations of Libyan Arab airline offices overseas.
The UK foreign office yesterday advised 5,500 Britons registered as resident
in Libya that they should 'consider carefully' leaving the country in view
of the possible flight ban.
The draft resolution was circulated yesterday among other Security Council
members.
Diplomats in New York suggested Russia would probably support the present
text, but China, Zimbabwe and Morocco could resist it. But officials from
the three drafting powers say they are reasonably confident the resolution
will pass.
If so, the sanctions would take effect within 24 hours of the vote.
The Security Council in January unanimously ordered Libya to surrender two
agents accused of masterminding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie in 1988 in which 270 people died. The French have also sought four
suspects thought to be behind the bombing of a UTA flight over Niger in 1989
in which 171 were killed.
In a sign that Col Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, is feeling under
pressure from western demands, Libya made a series of offers to resolve the
confrontation with Britain, the US and France after talks with a UN envoy in
Tripoli earlier this month. But these were considered by the three countries
to be confused and inadequate.
Col Gadaffi has separately opened an action against the US and Britain at
the World Court in The Hague, accusing them of breaking international law by
failing to hand over to Libya the evidence allegedly pointing to Libyan
complicity in the bombings. The Court is due to hold a preliminary hearing
on the action on March 26.
The US TV network ABC yesterday appealed to the High Court in London against
a police demand for all material relating to ABC interviews with the two
Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. Judgment was reserved.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday played down the likelihood of using force to
make Iraq comply with the United Nations' requirement that it eliminate its
weapons of mass destruction, but senior officials said they intended to
maintain diplomatic pressure through the UN on Iraq.
Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, said the US believed the Security
Council was 'the appropriate forum in which the matter ought to be pursued'.
'We are hopeful that the Iraqis will recognise, as they have previously,
that their only choice is to comply with the UN resolutions which they
agreed to, and that the matter can be resolved by diplomatic means through
the United Nations.'
Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs,
also told a congressional committee yesterday that the US wanted to
concentrate on stiffening UN inspections of Iraqi missile and weapons
plants.
'Our focal point right now is in the UN Security Council, to reinvigorate,
to invigorate, to make more intrusive the inspection regime in Iraq.'
US and UK ambassadors clashed angrily in the Security Council last week with
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, over charges that Iraq was
deliberately obstructing the efforts of UN inspectors to locate and destroy
the country's missile equipment.
Tension rose a notch with the announcement that a new US aircraft carrier
group had entered the Gulf, although Pentagon officials described the
movement as routine.
Mr Djerejian said the crux of the conflict was President Saddam Hussein's
determination not to implement the UN resolution which would allow Iraq to
sell some oil, on condition that the proceeds were placed under UN
supervision and used both to buy food and medical supplies for the Iraqi
population and to defray the costs of the UN inspection teams.
'The reason he is doing that is that he does not want Iraqi oil proceeds to
be funnelled through a UN mechanism. He simply wants a direct handle on all
oil proceeds so that he can spend the money as he sees fit,' Mr Djerejian
said.
'He has deliberately tried to weaken the will of the international
community, but the will of the international community has not been
weakened,' he added.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Call for renewed Soviet power fails to draw mass support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST serious efforts to resurrect the spirit and institutions of the
Soviet Union since its collapse at the end of last year passed yesterday in
an atmosphere of part farce, part bombast, part genuine emotion - but with
little sign that those now calling for a restoration of Soviet power have
widespread support, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
A meeting yesterday evening in Manezh Square in central Moscow attracted
some 25-30,000 people, a large demonstration by past standards of
Communist-dominated protests but much smaller than had been expected
following the organisers' intense efforts to turn out supporters in
strength.
Calls for 'unity' and 'fairness, patriotism and a national spirit,' and that
'the Soviet Union lives' were enthusiastically answered from thousands of
throats. But speeches were brief and many fell flat. Earlier, an
extraordinary session of the Sixth Congress of Peoples' Deputies of the
USSR, which had been formally dissolved last year, was held by the 200-odd
deputies who bothered to turn up in the Palace of Culture of the small
agricultural town of Voronovo, 60km south of Moscow. They had again been
unable to have the use (either they had been refused or simply had not
bothered to ask) of the council chamber of the nearby city of Podolsk or a
sports complex in the country.
The putative rulers of the Soviet Union, having found the Voronovo Palace of
Culture, then began a meeting of less than an hour by candlelight, having on
the way lost most of Moscow's domestic and foreign press corps, which had
been directed to the sports complex.
They elected a 15-person praesidium headed by Mrs Saji Umalatova, a deputy
from Chechen Ingushetia, and containing figures like Colonel Viktor Alksnis,
General Albert Makashov, a former contender for the Russian presidency, and
Mr Roy Medvedev, a one-time dissident who has remained attached to
socialism. Gen Makashov was proposed as a future USSR president.
They adopted a series of resolutions, many by acclamation at the evening
meeting. These affirmed the existence of the Soviet Union, described as
'unconstitutional' the agreement to create the Commonwealth of Independent
States, called for a moratorium on the division of the armed forces and
claimed that Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former USSR president, had not freed
himself of the responsibility for the disintegration of the country by his
resignation.
Col Alksnis said after the session that 'we have to employ moral pressure'.

FT  18 MAR 92 / FT World Pharmaceuticals Conference: Drugs pricing reforms
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING changes in European pricing and reimbursement policy for drugs was
proposed yesterday by Dr Armin Kessler, president of the European Federation
of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations.
Dr Kessler, speaking on the second and final day of the Financial Times
World Pharmaceuticals Conference in London, said the trends of
ever-increasing expenditure by pharmaceutical companies on research and
development and ever-greater expenditure on healthcare by governments were
unsustainable.
European countries were increasingly trying to reduce prices, even for
innovatory products, he said. The only alternative available to
pharmaceuticals groups was not to sell certain products in countries where
prices offered by the government were too low. This disadvantaged patients.
The process of price-setting for individual drugs by governments should be
disassociated from government reimbursement to patients and overall
budgetary constraints. In return for greater pricing freedom, European
countries should stop reimbursing patients for drugs which do not require a
prescription. Patients should also pay a larger part of medication obtained
on prescription, he argued.
Dr Kessler called for greater use of generic drugs in Europe. He said this
was necessary, even though it would adversely affect the research-based
pharmaceuticals groups. Not only would generics help keep down government
drugs budgets, but they would also act as a stimulus for the industry to
produce more innovative products.
Mr Peter Ladell, president of Marion Merrell Dow Europe, agreed that the
slower economic growth in the industrialised nations would continue to bring
pressure on drug prices. He argued that studies on the cost effectiveness of
pharma-ceuticals would form an increasingly critical part of pricing
negotiations with governments.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Local heart in Italy's body politic: The role of the regions
in April's general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE administrator of one of Milan's most famous charitable foundations
was found by police last month with L7m (Pounds 3,250) - alleged to be
bribery money - on his desk, few eyebrows were raised at what seemed like
another case of everyday petty corruption.
But the administrator, Mr Mario Chiesa, was a prominent member of the
Socialist party, which has run Milan almost uninterruptedly since 1945. As
the police investigation deepens, the cash hordes built up by Mr Chiesa, who
has run the city's venerable Pio Albergo Trivulzio old people's institution
for the past six years, are alleged to have ballooned to reach at L16bn at
the last count.
The Chiesa affair has proved acutely embarrassing for the Socialists, with
suggestions in political circles that the funds he is alleged to have raised
via commissions on contracts and complex property deals were eventually
destined for the party's coffers.
Having wasted no time in ejecting Mr Chiesa, now being held on corruption
charges, from their ranks, the Socialists are loudly protesting that the
case has been deliberately pumped up by their opponents in the run-up to
Italy's general election on April 5. But the Chiesa affair highlights the
unusually close connections between local and national politics in Italy.
Born out of the country's belated reunification and its strong regional
traditions, and nurtured by the country's proportional representation
electoral system which breeds multi-party local governments, urban politics
often have national impact.
The collapse late last year of long-standing councils in the big northern
cities of Milan and Brescia set the alarm bells ringing at many national
party headquarters.
The breach in Brescia, the second-biggest city in Lombardy and a Christian
Democrat stronghold for decades, stemmed from squabbling among local party
notables, whose failure to paper over their differences eventually triggered
an early poll.
Only a few weeks later, the Socialists took their turn in the spotlight when
the Milan council they dominated collapsed after teetering for months.
In both cases, national politicians immediately initiated attempts to
resolve the local differences. Prominent Christian Democrat leaders were
drafted into Brescia to patch up the local feud, while in Milan, Mr Bettino
Craxi, the Socialists' national leader, made it his mission to prevent the
rift leading to early polls, as required by law when a new council cannot be
formed within 60 days.
The importance with which local disputes are viewed by national leaders
stems partly from the new constellation of Italy's politics. The collapse of
Communism and reform of the former Communist Party (PCI) into the Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS) have loosened voters' allegiances and encouraged
regional autonomist movements such as Mr Umberto Bossi's Lombard League.
Brescia, one of Italy's richest cities, is a League stronghold, as evidenced
by the graffiti on walls and signposts and the large number of League
activists handing out leaflets in the town centre.
By playing on northern voters' antipathy towards the 'free-spending'
politicians in Rome, the party has also made strides in Milan.
The prospect of sharp gains for the League at early elections in both cities
was a powerful tonic for national politicians to take action late last year.
With general elections only months away, the bigger parties feared that a
local upset could prove nationally embarrassing.
In the event, the Christian Democrats failed to prevent local elections in
Brescia, and the League duly beat them into second place.
In neighbouring Milan, a new council was formed only days before the
deadline for elections expired.
Even before the rise of the Leagues, local politics had traditionally had
considerable impact on the national arena, argues Mr Vittorio (Bobo) Craxi,
the son of the Socialist chief, who heads the party's local organisation in
Milan.
'Local councils allow the parties to experiment with coalitions that might
not be possible nationally at the moment, ' he says. For example, 500
communes are run by coalitions between the Christian Democrats and the PDS.
Among them are provincial capitals such as Pavia to the south of Milan.
Local councils can also be part of the more elaborate system of political
horse-trading between the main governing parties at national level. With
only about 14 per cent of the vote in Rome and 19 per cent in Milan, it
would be virtually impossible for the Socialists to appoint the mayor in
both cities, as they have, without the acquiescence of the Christian
Democrats.
A weak showing by the Socialists in Milan or a poor performance by the
Christian Democrats in Brescia in the general elections, could quickly
trigger instability within the local council as opponents seek to exploit
differences within the coalition parties and alliances start to unravel.
For, while local politics play an unusually prominent role in Italy's
national political game, matters can, and often do, work the other way.

<TEXT>
GERMAN engineering employers have called up a new ally - a nonplussed
cartoon character armed with a saw - to fight against union pay demands.
Der Sagermann has appeared on billboards and in press advertisements all
over the country in the past few days, seemingly puzzled by the copywriter's
exhortation that Germany could lose its leading economic role in Europe if
he puts the saw to use.
The aim was to promote common sense among 'unreasonable' people,
Gesamtmetall, the employers' association funding the promotion said
yesterday. The cost of the ad campaign could be measured in 'thousandths of
1 per cent' of the 9.5 per cent wage demand the association is facing from
the IG Metall union.
The campaign slogan - 'Don't cut off the branch we're all sitting on' - is
accompanworkers in neighbouring countries have seen the economic light and
are prepared to help improve national competitiveness by exercising
moderation at the pay negotiating table. Italians have asked for less than
inflation - 4 per cent at most. Finns have foregone any increase in the
interests of national economic well-being. Britons, French and Belgians want
around 4 per cent, the advertisement says.
The soft-sell approach contrasts sharply with the hard line taken by Mr
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, head of Gesamt-metall, who has said pay this year
should rise in line with expected productivity increases of 2 per cent if
hundreds of thousands of job losses are to be avoided.
The campaign also represents an attempt to affect broad public opinion,
which has so far tended to favour the employers in this year's pay round.
A recent opinion poll showed that 56 per cent of west Germans think the
unions are asking for too much.

<TEXT>
POLAND has reached conditional agreement with the International Monetary
Fund to regain access to IMF loans, the finance minister, Mr Andrzej
Olechowski, said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Mr Olechowski said the IMF agreed that the Dollars 4.5bn deficit in the
budget the Polish government plans to submit to parliament this month was 'a
necessary one'. He said the projected deficit would meet the IMF demand that
it not exceed 5 per cent of the gross domestic product.
During a 36-hour visit to the US, Mr Olechowski met with officials at the
IMF, the World Bank, as well as with the US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas
Brady. He told a news conference at the Polish embassy that if the proposed
budget is approved, Poland would gain access to Dollars 1.5bn in IMF loans.
He said he also discussed a Dollars 1bn commitment from the World Bank.
Another Dollars 1bn will be sought from other countries.
Asked if he expected additional financial assistance from the US, he
replied, 'We remain confident we could always count on some support.' Mr
Olechowski said the IMF 'will be assisting us in seeking additional foreign
financing'. Poland was declared out of compliance with IMF guidelines last
summer.
Mr Olechowski went on to say that an IMF task force will visit Poland next
month. He said he expected the budget to be submitted to parliament on March
23 and that the debate should take one or two months.
The government of the prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, has sought to back
away from the strict market reforms he blames for rising unemployment and
economic decline.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Labour takes 5-point lead in two polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party last night claimed to have seized the initiative in the
opening general election battle over the economy and taxation after two
opinion polls gave it a five-point lead over the Conservatives.
Published on the eve of the launch of their election manifestos, the polls
contrasted with earlier surveys suggesting that the two main parties
remained neck-and-neck.
As Mr John Major prepared to restore the momentum of his campaign with the
launch of a manifesto setting out a distinctive Conservative agenda for the
1990s, senior ministers sought to brush aside the findings.
The ministers, who said that a shake-up in the Whitehall machine would be
among a series of new ideas in the Conservative manifesto, pointed to sharp
day-to-day fluctuations in the dozen or more surveys published since the
election was announced last week.
But after another day in which the economy and taxation dominated the
campaign, Mr Neil Kinnock claimed that the publication this week of Labour's
tax and benefit plans had given him a decisive advantage.
His optimism was reinforced by the first opinion poll taken after the
announcement of Mr John Smith's shadow Budget. The ICM poll for The Guardian
carried out yesterday put Labour on 43 per cent and the Conservatives on 38
per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 16 per cent. The same levels of
support are shown in a Mori poll for The Times carried out before the
unveiling of Labour's tax package.
These latest snapshots of opinion will boost Labour morale in the first
crucial phase of the campaign. They came after the financial markets had
closed in London, but in New York sterling remained firm against a weaker
dollar.
In his first full day of campaigning around the country, Mr Major repeatedly
attacked Labour for its 'vindictive' plans to increase sharply the tax
burden on those earning more than Pounds 22,000.
Mr Kinnock seized on official figures showing another fall in manufacturing
output to accuse the government of 'appalling' economic mismanagement. Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, joined the row with a warning
that the recession risked turning into a 'slump', but Mr Major said the
re-election of a Tory government would quickly trigger a recovery.
The ministers said today's Conservative manifesto would translate the change
in the party's rhetoric and style since Mr Major replaced Mrs Margaret
Thatcher into a new 'agenda' for the next five years. Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, signalled that among measures to emphasise a 'caring'
image would be a drive to regenerate the inner cities and a range of new
training initiatives. He promised rents-into-mortgages schemes for council
tenants to spread the benefits of ownership.
Alongside the plans to overhaul Whitehall - always resisted by Mrs Thatcher
 -Mr Major plans to give a commitment to a more open style of government.
The changes in the government machine involve creating a cabinet post to
oversee the implementation of the Citizen's Charter. The charter, launched
last year, will be at the centre of the government's programme to provide
better public services.
The reforms also involve a move to strengthen the Department of Trade and
Industry, which would take over most of the responsibilities of the Energy
Department. There was speculation last night that a second cabinet post
would be created to oversee a strengthened department covering the arts,
heritage and sports.
Labour's manifesto will have at its core a recovery package for industry and
jobs alongside a range of initiatives on education, health and crime.
The 10,000-word document, entitled 'Its Time To Get Britain Working Again',
combines the twin themes of the need for change and Labour's recent poster
campaign: 'Majorism Isn't Working' - itself lifted from the Tories'
successful 1979 attack on Labour.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Output falls 0.7% on month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MANUFACTURING output is continuing to fall, indicating that the recession
may be deepening, according to official statistics released yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office said seasonally-adjusted factory output
dropped 0.7 per cent in January compared with the previous month, after a
revised 0.4 per cent fall in December.
More bad economic news for the government came with the separate
announcement of a Pounds 1bn public sector borrowing requirement last month,
compared with a net repayment of Pounds 0.6bn in February 1991.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, called the industrial output
figures 'appalling' and said they were much worse than the City had
expected.
Mr John Major brushed aside the manufacturing figures and said the economy
was poised to come out of recession after the election.
The data had little effect on the London stock market. The FT-SE 100 index
of leading shares closed at 2,491.2, up 20.5. This ended the run of four
consecutive days in which the index had fallen largely as a result of
pre-election jitters.
Sterling firmed, closing in London up a quarter of a pfennig at DM2.86,
while it gained more than 1 1/2 cents to Dollars 1.7315. In New York, it
finished at DM2.8613 and Dollars 1.7355.
In the three months to January, factory production was down 0.9 per cent
compared with the previous three months. The CSO data indicate that
manufacturing output has dropped by about 2 per cent since mid-1991, when it
appeared the decline might have stopped.
On the basis of yesterday's figures, factory output is falling at an
underlying annual rate of about 3.5 per cent. The CSO's data for the two
previous months indicated in each case that the annual decline was about 3
per cent.
According to the CSO, factory output has fallen by 8 per cent from a peak in
the second quarter of 1990, at around the start of the recession.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong Bank to buy Midland: Deal would create world's
largest transcontinental bank with Pounds 8bn market value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and Our Asia Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank plans to take over Midland Bank in a deal to
create the world's largest transcontinental bank and one of the top 15 in
terms of assets.
The two banks said in a formal statement issued early yesterday that they
were planning to merge, but bankers said the deal would be in effect a
takeover of Midland.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, told his staff that 'although we
were not seeking a partner, we received an approach from Hongkong Bank'.
This approach was made after Midland announced its 1991 results on February
27.
Midland was the biggest bank in the world in the early 1950s but now ranks
only fourth by market value among English clearing banks, having incurred
after-tax losses for the past two years.
Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings which owns Hongkong Bank, is
expected to be chairman of the combined operations.
The takeover, which requires the approval of governments in the UK, Hong
Kong and China and of bank regulators, would create a bank with a market
value of about Pounds 8bn. Hongkong Bank is expected to offer one HSBC share
for every share in Midland.
The deal would involve the first takeover of an English clearing bank by an
organisation which to all intents and purposes is not British, although its
holding company is domiciled in the UK.
Mr Purves said he had kept the Chinese government informed 'at a high level'
of the plans and was hopeful that it would not object to the takeover.
Hongkong Bank cannot ignore the Chinese view because it earns the bulk of
its profits in the colony, which will revert to the control of the Chinese
in 1997.
The Bank of England, which said it had been kept in the picture about the
plans, is understood to be unlikely to ciple. But it is setting two
conditions. It wants to put a 'ring fence' round the Hong Kong operations,
to prevent deposits at Midland from being used for loans in the colony. The
Bank wants to make sure that Midland's depositors are not harmed in the
event of an economic crisis in Hong Kong after China regains control.
The Bank also wants to have the lead role for regulating the new
international bank.
Early today an HSBC official in Hong Kong said the Bank of England and the
colony's banking commissioner, Mr David Carse, were discussing where the
merged group would be regulated and where it would be based.
Officials said yesterday they did not expect the UK government to attempt to
block the deal. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, said her
prime concern was that the combined operation should be regulated properly.
Bankers said a formal offer for Midland would probably be made in the next
couple of weeks, after the two banks have had the opportunity to scrutinise
each other's balance sheets and form a view of the respective value of the
two organisations.
Midland and Hongkong issued their statement of intent yesterday because they
feared plans would leak. They said the offer would be at a 'significant
premium' to the 253p price at which Midland's shares closed on Monday.
Yesterday, Midland's share price rose 76p to 329p, valuing the bank at
Pounds 2.58bn.
In Hong Kong early today HBSC shares were down HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars
41.75 as the stock market opened sharply lower on news of the merger plan.
The Hang Seng index initially fell more than 2 per cent but was later
trading around 1 per cent down.
Yesterday Mr Pearse said that 'independence (for Midland) remains an option'
but that 'the board considers the commercial case for joining forces to be a
clear one'. But he stressed that in the UK, Midland would continue to trade
under its own name.
Mr Purves confirmed that 'Midland will continue to have its own board'.
Mr Pearse also made it clear that the combined organisation would have a
strong British identity. 'In concept (the takeover) would lead to the
creation of a UK-based banking group with unparalleled global capabilities
and regional banking strength in the UK/Europe, Asia Pacific and North
America.'
The implication, which will be controversial in Hong Kong, is that senior
directors of HSBC will move to the UK. However, any transfer of Hongkong
Bank's management is unlikely until next year, when Mr Purves is expected to
resign from the chairmanship of his group's main banking subsidiary to
devote his time to being chairman of HSBC.
Hongkong Bank has for years wanted to acquire a European bank to reduce its
dependence on its earnings from the colony. However, it stresses that it
will retain a significant presence there.
It acquired a 14.9 per cent stake in Midland in December 1987. At the time
it expected that a full merger would take place after three years. However,
the financial performance of both banks deteriorated sharply in 1990 and the
merger plans were shelved.
Our Asia staff writes: It is understood that the contact with China was
possibly through Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao affairs in the
Beijing government.
These contacts emerged as authorities in the colony sought to play down
suggestions that Hongkong Bank was insuring itself against the uncertainty
surrounding the return of Hong Kong to China.
China is sensitive to developments affecting the territory's financial
health. There were fears in Hong Kong that the news could provoke a Chinese
verbal onslaught if Beijing saw the merger as a desertion of the colony. But
initial indications were that China would not seriously question the
proposal.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Appointments: Maher's global post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hill Samuel Investment Management, part of the TSB group, has hired John
Maher to take up the new post of global marketing director. An American,
Maher joins after 17 years at Citicorp.
There is currently an active trade in personnel between HSIM and Citi - with
Neville Bowen, formerly chief executive of HSIM Group, which also includes
the US and Irish fund management operations, now to head Citibank's
worldwide fund management activities.
'We are currently 2:1 up,' says HSIM managing director Philip Beaven,
referring to the fact that its group compliance officer also recently
arrived from Citi.
Maher, 41, gathered a wide range of marketing experience at Citi, mostly
from New York, but since January 1990 he has been in London as UK business
director, latterly with responsibility for the rest of Europe, too. He joins
at a time when HSIM, which is manager and adviser to some Pounds 11bn of
funds, is seeking to capitalise on institutional investors' growing
readiness to place more money outside their domestic markets. 'Maher brings
with him a breadth of experience, including in areas where we would
particularly like to expand,' says Beaven, mentioning fixed interest funds
for specialist insurance companies.
HSIM lost its UK marketing director Jennie Paterson to Barr Rosenberg
European Management last August. Maher's job will encompass hers, while
adding the 'global' dimension.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Appointments: Black network co-ordinator for UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new UK network co-ordinator of the Texas-based International Black
Network Exchange is David Wint Flint, former insurance broker now with his
own insurance-to-property interests group WFJ Enterprise, who believes
strongly in raising the profile of black business in Britain.
IBNE, which is largely financed by its 70,000 members but also receives some
US State Department funding, is designed to put black businessmen and
professionals around the world in touch with each other.
Founder Patricia Roper Saunders, who worked on a similar venture,
Transatlantic Link, before IBNE was formed last year, will soon be in
Britain to launch the UK service and expound on the benefits of networking.
Wint Flint, who is 31, says his role is to help foreign companies find
suitable partners in the UK, preferably within the black community but not
exclusively so. While he collects no salary from IBNE, he expects to earn
fees for his services from the companies.
Britain's ethnic population may, as a group, be a significant consumer
force, but not enough spending is put the way of black business. 'You don't
see too many black millionaires around.' Wint Flint, whose dream is to have
done sufficiently well to be able to retire before he is 40, also runs his
own networking service, the African Caribbean Directors Institute Centre,
which has a different mission in so far as it 'networks between other
business and professional networks'. Before setting up his own business, he
spent five years at Lowndes Lambert as a senior broker.
So does WFJ Enterprise Group, which has a staff of 8, transact business
principally within the black community? 'No I don't. Unfortunately there are
not enough black people in this country to sustain the business.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG cash market combined with good performances in the gilt and short
sterling markets held the FT-SE futures up, although they later drifted back
in quiet trading, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE contract was marked up to 2,490 and quickly squeezed higher
by sentiment from several sources to reach its best level of the day at
2,496. These included a good opinion poll for the Conservative party, the
news on Midland Bank, a rally in gilts and a strong showing in short
sterling. However, the tight trading range saw March stay around the 2,490
mark for most of the day.
Wall Street had little effect, although in the last half-hour of trading
March perked up on rumours that an opinion poll would today give the
Conservatives a four-point lead. The contract closed at 2,489, up 27 from
the previous session and at a discount of around 6 points to its four-point
fair value premium and a discount to the underlying market. Turnover was
4,597 lots.
In the LTOM, volume was down 10,000 from the previous day's 33,000
contracts. Midland was the most heavily traded stock option with more than
3,500 lots dealt, followed by British Gas and Forte.

FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lack of incident leaves
bourses improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LACK of incident on the global market scene, after Monday's travails in
Tokyo, left most bourses tentatively better on the Continent yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had no story for the market as a whole to trade upon, and so
dealers reverted to stocks which suited a thin day - big names, but less
liquid and second line, said Mr Patrick Shields of Nikko Europe.
AMB in insurers, AEG in electricals and Asko in retailing all put up useful
gains, of DM20 to DM895, DM4.80 to DM220.50 and DM12 to DM745 respectively,
but only Asko had a story: in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung its chief
executive, Mr Klaus Wiegandt, was quoted as saying that the company would
more than triple its operating profit to DM600m in 1995, after DM190m in
1990.
In engineering, Linde moved upon performance achieved, rising DM14.50 to
DM819.50 on this week's 10 per cent rise in profits. Meanwhile, the FAZ
index was 1.57 higher at 702.27 in midsession and the DAX closed 5.27 better
at 1,730.07 as German stock market turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.4bn.
ZURICH was led higher by Nestle, which rose sharply after Monday's Paris
court ruling which appeared to have improved the chances that Nestle and
Exor, competing bidders for Perrier, will reach an agreement giving Nestle
control of the water group and averting a bidding battle.
Nestle bearers rose SFr140 to SFr9,470 and the SPI index by 9.5 to 1,130.5.
Brown Boveri bearers rose SFr30 to SFr3,570 ahead of results tomorrow, on
speculation that BBC will split its shares, and that it could abolish its
certificates.
MILAN carried over its recent weakness into the new account. Rumours of
forced selling by a local financial services company weighed on the market.
The Comit index fell 1.99 to 503.28 in turnover estimated at L70bn-80bn,
down from Monday's L108bn.
Dealers said that Agnelli shares did not fall as heavily as feared following
news on Monday of the group's setback in the takeover battle for the French
mineral water company, Perrier. Fiat fell L80 to L4,790 and the holding
company Ifi dropped L110 to L12,300. James Capel yesterday issued a sell
note on Fiat, saying that there was no short-term solution to its malaise
and that its fortunes would not improve until 1993.
Other industrials were weak with Montedison down L14 to L1,316, but Pirelli
rose for the second day, adding L5 to L1,190, on reports of London buying.
PARIS rebounded on reasonable UK buying interest. The CAC-40 index rose
14.37 to 1,943.59 but turnover remained modest at FFr2bn.
Recent favourites moved up, with Euro Disney adding FFr2.50 to FFr162.50 and
Alcatel adding FFr11 to FFr605. Pechiney investment certificates put on
FFr15.50 or 4.9 per cent to FFr333 on UK demand.
Perrier bucked the trend, losing FFr42 or 2.6 per cent to FFr1,608, as hopes
of a bidding war in the current takeover struggle receded. There was also
speculation that Nestle and the Agnelli group might reach a deal behind the
scenes.
AMSTERDAM rose with strong foreign interest in Heineken. The brewer closed
at a record high, up Fl 5.1, or 2.8 per cent, at Fl 182.0. Grolsch, however,
was hit by profit-taking and closed down Fl 1.8 at Fl 2.6.0.
The CBS Tendency Index gained 0.9 to 125.6 in turnover of Fl 577.6m.
Publishers were active, with Wolters Kluwer rising Fl 1.3 to Fl 70.10 and
Elsevier, which reports 1991 results on Friday, gaining 2 per cent to close
at a record high, up Fl 2.4 at Fl 117.5. Analysts said that Wolters Kluwer's
results on Monday, which showed a 24 per cent rise in profits, had had a
positive effect on other stocks in the sector.
Hunter Douglas continued to move ahead after falling sharply last week
following publication of disappointing results: the building materials group
closed up Fl 1.3 or 2 per cent at Fl 65.3.
STOCKHOLM saw Hennes and Mauritz reach an all-time high of SKr740, up SKr25,
on its strong growth potential as the Affarsvarlden general index closed at
988.7, up 2.1, in moderate turnover of SKr500m.
COPENHAGEN eased as a leadership contest in the opposition Social Democratic
Party had a negative influence on the market, writes Hilary Barnes. The CSE
index fell by a further 1.62 to 338.50. ISS, which published a
better-than-expected 1991 result, was up DKr11 at DKr880.
HELSINKI fell ahead of today's government measures to support Finnish banks,
the Hex index closing 7.0 lower at 853.0.
ISTANBUL closed lower, the 75-share index finishing down 8.68 at 3,771.10 in
turnover of TL195.4bn.

FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying fails
to lift Nikkei above 20,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average failed to recover to above the critical 20,000 level in
spite of arbitrage-related activity which pushed up share prices late in the
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 80.47 better at 19,917.63 after a day's high of
19,990.68 and low of 19,687.94. Selling by companies and investment trusts
initially depressed the market, but arbitrage-related buying and bargain
hunting lifted the index in the afternoon.
Volume picked up to 350m shares from 200m on active cross-trading ahead of
the March year-end book closing.
In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other statistics reflected the market's
continued bearishness. Declines led advances by 728 to 271, with 121 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.99 to
1,433.87, extending its fall to 11 consecutive trading days, the first time
in 35 years. A total of 337 issues set new lows since the beginning of last
year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was just 0.62 easier at 1,101.05.
Traders said the improvement in the Nikkei was supported by gains in
illiquid component stocks. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented:
'The Nikkei is not really a benchmark any more, since most blue chips are
losing very heavily.'
Many analysts have attributed the fall in equities to the weakness in the
economy. However, hopes that the Bank of Japan will respond to the decline
in confidence by cutting the official discount rate have been dashed by
recent central bank comments that the economy was stable. Mr Minoru Nagaoka,
chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, yesterday called for fiscal and
monetary measures to stimulate the economy and help the stock market.
Large-capital issues such as steel makers lost ground, with Nippon Steel
ending Y7 down at Y302 and NKK Y9 off at Y281. Exporters also fell, with
Hitachi slipping Y9 to Y756 and Toshiba Y6 to Y564. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone weakened for the 14th consecutive trading day, losing Y9,000 to
Y642,000.
Sanrio, the novelty goods maker, fell Y120 to Y1,260 on reports that it may
not pay a dividend. The company is renowned for its extensive financial
investments, and faces mounting losses due to the fall in share prices.
Financial issues were lower on profit-taking ahead of the year-end.
Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y20 to Y2,520 and Sumitomo Bank dipped Y20
to Y1,730.
Foreigners were seen bargain hunting in blue chip exporters. Matsushita
Electric Industrial put on Y20 to Y1,260 and Kyocera added Y60 at Y4,030.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 250.77 to 21,337.87 in volume of 441.4m
shares. Activity surged on trading by companies realising profits ahead of
the March book-closing.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets continued to be pulled lower by the weakness in Tokyo.
HONG KONG retreated moderately, with the news that HSBC is in merger talks
with Midland Bank, of the UK, coming after the market had closed. The Hang
Seng index finished 15 points off at 5,044.86 in turnover of HKDollars
2.2bn.
Analysts expect the market to shed over 100 points today as investors react
negatively to the merger talks. HSBC closed 25 cents down at HKDollars
45.25.
MANILA's fall continued on uncertainty about the tender price to be set for
the additional share offering in Philippine National Bank, down 11 pesos at
249 pesos. The composite index ended 23.60 lower at 1,083.01 in turnover of
132.7m pesos.
The weakness in the US of Philippine Long Distance Telephone also depressed
general sentiment and the stock closed 20 pesos down at 855 pesos.
TAIWAN dropped nearly 150 points before rallying modestly to end a net
122.64, or 2.5 per cent, off at 4,890.32. Turnover came to TDollars 29.3bn,
against TDollars 26.4bn. The market remained burdened by political
uncertainty over democratic reform proposals.
SEOUL drew comfort from a government announcement that it would provide
loans totalling Won250bn to both small and medium-sized companies. The
composite index rose 6.83 to 615.19 in turnover of Won209.8bn.
SINGAPORE remained dull in low volume. The Straits Times Industrial index
lost 4.30 to 1,445.36 in turnover of 19.73m shares, down from 30.56m.
NatSteel, which has announced that it is cutting steel bar prices by 4 per
cent, put on 6 cents to SDollars 4.02.
KUALA LUMPUR improved slightly in thin trade, the composite index closing
2.75 up at 594.49 in volume of 27m shares.
BANGKOK edged forward, helped by gains in the property and finance sectors.
The SET index firmed 3.47 to 795.76 in turnover of Bt4.67bn.
BOMBAY weakened as state-owned investment houses sold shares. The BSE index
fell 51.42 to 3,198.78.
AUSTRALIA took little encouragement from data which showed an upturn in the
economy during the December quarter. The All Ordinaries index finished 7.9
easier at 1,578.9.
NEW ZEALAND turned downwards, the NZSE-40 index dipping 3.74 to 1,454.45 in
turnover of some NZDollars 17m.

FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Plague of bad news leaves Oslo volatile
 -There are a number of reasons why Norway has been vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatility, and vulnerability, in the Oslo stock market has carried over
from last year into 1992. Equities are plagued by bad news in Norway's
banking sector, weaker 1991 earnings by blue chip industrials, low tanker
rates suffered by shipping companies and confusion over takeover battles in
the insurance sector.
Since the close of 1991, the Oslo All-Share index has dipped by 0.30 per
cent; but it has dropped by 13.7 per cent in the 12 months to the end of
February. The market fell 9.4 per cent in 1991.
Oslo's problems are not just psychological jitters caused by last year's
near-collapse of the country's ailing banking industry; they are also
related to the volatility of the crude oil market, from which Norway's
economy needs a minimum price of Dollars 18 per barrel.
In addition, Norway's big export industries, represented by blue chip stocks
outside the oil sector, are suffering from a downturn in the world economy.
This became distinctly apparent in February as 1991 profit and loss accounts
began to flow.
Norsk Hydro, the big blue chip which weighs heavily not only on the
All-Share, but also on the industry sub-index, has seen its share price
weaken 24.7 per cent in the last 12 months to end-February.
Hydro's decline reflects the company's reversal in fortunes between 1990 to
1991, with its earnings hit hard by major write-offs in its agriculture and
magnesium divisions. Last year the company slid into a net loss of NKr498m
(Dollars 76.6m) from a profit in 1990 of NKr2.9bn, and was forced to pass
its dividend. It also took a non-recurring NKr2.9bn charge for restructuring
of the two divisions, compared with a NKr200m restructuring charge in 1990.
The company's weak performance was reflected in a 6.6 per cent decline in
the industry sub-index in January this year, although the fall since the
start of the year has now been reduced to just 0.35 per cent.
The banks sub-index, which last year saw the delisting of Norway's two
biggest banks after they were nationalised in a state-backed rescue plan,
plunged 71.4 per cent in the last 12 months to end-February. It fell 16.3
per cent in the first two months of this year, and by 14.7 per cent in
January alone.
The horrors of the sector's near demise almost destroyed investor confidence
in the market as a whole. Analysts believe that sentiment is likely to
continue to suffer but that several undervalued stocks will give a
medium-term lift to the market, which will also be led by trends on Wall
Street.
Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest bank, was barely saved from
insolvency last December by a state-backed rescue package which included a
takeover of Realkreditt, the ailing mortgage group.
DnB's 'A' shares fell 92.9 per cent from end-February 1991, when they were
NKr90, to end-February this year when they stood at NKr6.40. However, as
part of the state rescue plan the bank announced a NKr2.38bn preference
share issue yesterday, to help it meet equity capital requirements by the
end of the year.
The shipping sub-index, in which Bergesen weighs heavily, has dropped 23.6
per cent in the last 12 months. In January, shipping issues fell 11.3 per
cent but there was some recovery implicit in a two-month decline of 3.5 per
cent since the start of the year to the end of last month.
For its part, Bergesen's share price dropped 17.6 per cent in the 12 months
to February on fears that tanker prices will continue to decline this year,
and worries over where financing will be raised to renew the company's
ageing fleet. Bergesen has a fleet of 18 tankers and warned that 1992
operating profit for that sector of business will be lower. Last year 54 per
cent of Bergesen's NKr812m operating profit was derived from tanker
operations.
On a positive note, DnB Securities believes demand for oil tanker tonnage
will increase by 2 to 7 per cent in 1992, with the supply side expected to
grow by 5 per cent.
The 12-month fall in insurance shares is 37.7 per cent. Uni Storebrand, the
heavyweight of insurance stocks, has seen its share price tumble 44.2 per
cent over the same period.
The market is not convinced of the logic in Uni's NKr4.7bn investment in
Skandia, the Swedish insurer, or how Uni will get around Skandia's voting
limitation of 30 votes per individual shareholder if it is indeed seeking to
take over the company.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Trading slows again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING was very quiet on the UK money market yesterday, although the mood
was improved by a newspaper opinion poll giving the Conservative party a
three-point lead.
Rates were little changed, with dealers waiting to see if the improvement in
Conservative support is reflected in three more polls due out today. A
better performance by sterling also reassured the market, which largely
ignored disappointing PSBR and industrial production figures which showed
the economy was still in the depths of recession.
'No economic figures are likely to be good news at the moment,' said one
trader. 'We are much more interested in the opinion polls.'
Interbank rates stood at 10 3/4 -10 5/8 per cent from one week through to
five months, and 10 13/16 -10 per cent from six months to one year, although
the one-year had opened  1/8 per cent higher.
June sterling futures opened up at 89.27, and dropped slightly in the
morning to 89.25 before firming to 89.29.
Funding proved more difficult than expected after the Bank of England
initially forecast a moderate shortage of around Pounds 550m. The main
factors drawing funds from the system were Pounds 726m treasury bills and
maturing assistance, and Pounds 317m bills for repurchase by the market,
partly offset by exchequer transactions totalling Pounds 355m.
The Bank, however, did not operate in the morning, purchasing only Pounds
300m of band 1 and 2 bank bills, and Pounds 1m band 1 treasury bills, at 10
3/8 per cent in the afternoon. It provided late assistance of Pounds 125m,
bringing the day's total to only Pounds 426m.
Overnight rates eased to around 10 5/8 -10 1/2 after the moderate shortage
forecast, but in the afternoon reached 13 per cent, reflecting the difficult
funding situation.
German call money was still stuck at the relatively high level of 9.55/9.65
per cent ahead of the Bundesbank's weekly securities repo today.
Dealers said rates would remain high and possibly edge higher until pressure
from this month's heavy tax deadline was over.
The Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the US banking system
through overnight system repurchase agreements. Federal funds were trading
at around 4 1/8 per cent at the Fed's operations time, above the presumed
target of 4 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC likely to roll over farm
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAY MacSharry, the European Community's agricultural commissioner, is
today expected to announce a simple roll-over of existing farm prices for
1992-93.
The only proposed cuts likely to emerge from today's commission meeting on
the price-fixing are those resulting automatically from the stabiliser
system agreed in 1988.
Last year's harvest totalled 169m tonnes (180m, if eastern Germany is
counted), well in excess of the set threshold of 160m, and will therefore
trigger a 3 per cent price cut, plus an extra 3 per cent on top of the
existing 5 per cent co-responsibiity levy.
Officials say cereal stocks are up from 10m tonnes last year to 18m tonnes
and could reach 30m by 1993. There are also more than 500,000 tonnes each of
beef and dairy produce in EC storage. With such surpluses, Mr McSharry
thinks he would be justified in seeking cuts in guaranteed farm prices. But
he would prefer to concentrate attention on farm policy reform, made urgent
by the Gatt negotiations.
Meanwhile, a Gatt panel this week issued a preliminary ruling on the US
complaint about EC support for soyabeans. The EC has already changed its
soya support system once, in 1989 following a Gatt decision on a similar US
complaint. Gatt is keeping its latest decision confidential, allowing both
parties time to respond.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is negotiating with Azerineft, Azerbaijan's state oil
company, to develop a major offshore oilfield in the Caspian Sea, Mr
Ali-Zade Sanan, Azerineft's president said.
Mr Ali-Zade said the two companies could reach an agreement on
production-sharing by the end of the year. The field is believed to be the
Capaz field close to the Turkmenian part of the Caspian Sea.
BP said it was currently pursuing a number of opportunities in the region,
but that it was too early to comment on any of them.
The company is involved with a consortium headed by Amoco, the US oil major,
which has been awarded a feasibility study for the Azeri field in the
Caspian Sea. Mr Ali-Zade said the other field over which BP was in
discussions had similar potential to the Azeri development which could cost
between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 5bn.
Mr Ali-Zade said that the Azeri field was still on course for development in
spite of political disturbances. The Azeri project is a joint venture, but
Mr Ali-Zade said BP's new discussions are centred on production-sharing
arrangements.
A month ago, Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, became the first western
oil firm to sign a production-sharing arrangement with the Russian
government. The company followed it with a similar agreement with the
government of Kazakhstan.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Breaking the ice over Canada's
frozen assets - Plans to develop a rich zinc-copper deposit in the Northwest
Territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVAILABILITY OF Russian ice-breaking ships, the biggest in the world, able
to force their way through ice a metre thick and topped with 40 centimetres
of snow, has changed the outlook for Izok Lake, one of the largest
undeveloped base metals deposits in North America.
No other known zinc-copper deposit in the world has better grades (metal per
tonne of ore) than Izok Lake, according to Mr Klaus Zeitler, president of
Metall Mining, a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of Germany. But its
location, in the frozen wastes of the Artic circle in Canada's Northwest
Territories, has held back development for about 20 years.
There seemed to be no economic way of transporting Izok Lake concentrates
(an intermediate material) to smelters at least 3,000 miles away in more
salubrious climates.
The Russian ice-breaking ships, more than 15 of them built in the former
East Germany or Finland, could solve the problem because they could move
concentrates from the Artic for two or three months a year, says Mr Zeitler.
Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union the Russians have been very
interested in doing business.
His company is paying CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.3m) to acquire a 40 per cent
interest in Izok Lake from Minnova, a mining company ultimately owned by the
Noranda, Canada's biggest natural resources group.
Last November Minnova paid USDollars 20m and a royalty to Falconbridge for
Izok Lake and two other properties in the Northwest Territories.
Falconbridge sold because it wanted to focus on its nickel projects l
expenditure on those.
Mr David Watkins, Minnova's president, reckons that Izok Lake would cost
CDollars 300m to develop.
Metall Mining's Mr Zeitler says that Izok Lake has up to 20m tonnes or ore
containing 14.4 per cent zinc and 3.2 per cent copper. There is also some
lead and silver.
He suggests that, although the expected tonnage from an open pit mine would
not be huge - about 400,000 tonnes a year, or half that of the Red Dog
zinc-lead mine in Alaska - the grades would ensure production of
concentrates containing 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes of zinc a year and 30,000
tonnes of copper.
Mr Zeitler recalls that 15 years ago Metall's first Canadian project was the
Nanisivik zinc mine on Baffin Island. 'At the time the big Canadian
companies shied away from involvement in the Artic because of the perceived
transportation difficulties. But Nanisivik has been a full technical,
logistical and financial success,' he says.
Izok Lake is 90 km (56 miles) away from Lupin, an underground gold mine
owned by Echo Bay Mines. Mr Zeitler suggests Lupin may benefit if Izok Lake
is developed. Echo Bay, one of North America's biggest gold producers,
delivers essential supplies to Lupin over a 500 km ice road from
Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories. This road is available
only three months a year. If Lupin was to share the same infrastructure as
Izok Lake it could build its ice road northwards for 300 km and have it open
for five months, Mr Zeitler suggests.
He says: 'Over the past 20 years the mining industry has gained a great deal
of knowledge about the Artic. Based on this expertise and today's
technology, I believe that Izok Lake's time for development has come'.

MOBIL, the second largest US oil company, is threatening to sue the US
government for preventing it from drilling for oil on tracts of land in
Florida and North Carolina for environmental reasons, writes Deborah
Hargreaves.
The company said it could lead a whole pack of lawsuits by the US oil
industry where companies have paid over Dollars 1bn for drilling acreage,
only to have any activity blocked by the administration.
'The basis of our suit would be that we paid good money for this land and at
the very least, the government owes us that money back, plus interest,' said
Mr Allen Murray, Mobil Corporation's chairman. He said the company could
also push for compensation for the value it could have gained from oil
drilling on the land.
The US government is refusing to open up many sensitive environmental areas
for oil exploration under pressure from a strong green lobby. The policy has
pushed all the US majors to expand exploration overseas.

SILVER futures were lower at midday on Comex and analysts were predicting
further falls. They said that high supplies had undermined sentiment. Comex
warehouse silver stocks have reached a record 283,725,234 ounces, besting
the peak set on March 6. Nymex PLATINUM futures remained lower at midsession
amid expectations that South Africa's whites would approve the referendum on
political reform, analysts said. That would greatly decrease chances of
civil strife and a disruption of output and exports from South Africa, the
major platinum producer. Market perceptions of slackening Japanese demand
for platinum also weighed on sentiment. On the LME three-month COPPER
bounced off downside support around Dollars 2,220 a tonne again, and pushed
up in afternoon trading, albeit in thin volume, to challenge the highs of
the current trading band. News that February US housing starts rose by 9.3
per cent was particularly supportive. Three-month copper traded last at
Dollars 2,239. LEAD was aided by news that Nuova Samin's Porto Vesme lead
smelter will be closed for 25 days for routine maintainance. TIN closed
higher despite talk of fresh arrivals of quality Brazilian metal.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia caves in on aluminium
duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS braced themselves for another wave of exports from
Russia after it became clear yesterday that the Russian government had caved
in completely to demands from its domestic industry.
Russian aluminium producers, who brought in well over Dollars 1bn of
desperately-needed foreign currency in 1991, had threatened to shut down
some capacity unless changes were made to export duties and other
regulations imposed at the begining of this year.
The Interfax news agency reported from Moscow yesterday that the Russian
government had ordered 615,000 tonnes of primary aluminium 'to be set aside
for export in 1992'. Aluminium exports were freed from all duty and
producers no longer had to sell part of their hard currency income to the
Russian central bank.
This news was greeted with dismay by the western industry, particularly
European producers who, through the European Commission, have been
attempting to work out a formula to cut exports without damaging the Russian
industry. These efforts followed last year's jump in exports from the former
Soviet Union to the west to between 800,000 tonnes and 1m tonnes,
effectively adding about 10 per cent to supply.
Yesterday's news was 'an indication that the flood gates are about to open
again', said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven
Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Although the market had been
expecting something of the sort - Billiton had estimated Russian exports
would be 600,000 tonnes this year - 'it shows we are in for a prolonged
period of low aluminium prices when many producers will be suffering
losses'.
Mr MacMillan added: 'Russia will be a large net exporter of aluminium for
some years'.
Russia imposed a duty of 500 Ecus (Pounds 355) a tonne on aluminium exports
in January but cut it four times before removing it entirely. Aluminium
producers were also previously obliged to sell to the central bank 40 per
cent of their hard currency earnings. Interfax said the aluminium exports
would help Russia buy raw materials from the west.
A barter deal with Ukraine has rescued a financially troubled, 25,000
tonnes-a-year Hungarian aluminium plant from closure, according to the
MTI-Econews agency, reports Reuter from Budapest. Primary aluminium will be
delivered in return for electricity at a 30 per cent discount.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price slide continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD'S PRICE plunged again yesterday to the lowest level for nearly six
years, wilting under steady selling pressure for the second successive day
in a market with few buyers.
'Someone had to raise dollars for gold and was taking little account of the
condition of the gold market. It wasn't a large amount of gold but in these
quiet markets the selling had a disproportionate impact,' said Mr Andy
Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland. The effect was compounded
by the behaviour of computer-driven US funds.
Gold tumbled to Dollars 336.75 a troy ounce in early afternoon trading in
London yesterday, its lowest since June, 1986. It closed at Dollars 339.40,
down Dollars 3.80. Since Monday morning gold had therefore lost 2 per cent
of its value.
On the New York Commodity Exchange the most-active April contract saw gold
at Dollars 337.30 at the opening and back up to Dollars 339.40 by midday.
Dealers guessed the selling might have been by an east European central bank
outside the former Soviet Union or by a South African producer ahead of its
financial quarterly results and amid the nervousness associated with that
country's referendum.
Demand for gold is usually subdued at this time of year during the Islamic
holy month of Ramadan, which in 1992 runs between March 6 and April 6, and
when the market has emerged from the periods of peak consumption: Christmas
in the west and the Chinese New Year.
Mr Smith said US funds had sold a good deal of gold short (sold metal they
did not have in the expectation that they could buy it later at a lower
price) and would want to lock in their profit of about Dollars 10 an ounce.
This would result in a short-term price recovery.
If there was also a 'no' vote in the referendum in South Africa, the world's
biggest gold producer, raising the possibility of civil unrest, 'then watch
the price take off', Mr Smith added.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec needs to cut output
further, analysts say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES could remain stuck at current low levels or even slide further
without more decisive action by members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, many market observers believe.
Traders felt that Opec's decision at its February meeting to cut just over
1m barrels a day from production was not sufficient to lend much strength to
prices during the second quarter.
Now those output cuts are beginning to feed through to the market and
volumes for sale show that not all countries are sticking by the agreement.
So far the modest production cuts have not been enough to raise prices, but
just enough to keep them in a steady range.
'Opec countries would all like to see prices Dollars 1 to Dollars 2 higher
but the key players are not prepared to take further action to achieve
that,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw, industry consultant at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates in Paris.
North Sea Brent crude oil has shown some strength in the last couple of days
as traders have seen Saudi Arabia making a clear effort to cut its
deliveries. But at Dollars 17.80 a barrel, Brent for May delivery is only 30
cents higher than its level following February's Opec meeting, when it lost
almost Dollars 1 a barrel.
Crude buyers say that they have seen Saudi Arabia cutting back on any extra
oil sales this month and restricting customers to existing contract levels.
Most observers believe that the kingdom has cut production by some 400,000
b/d to 500,000 b/d down to a level of 8m b/d  - just above its allocation
under the Opec agreement.
The kingdom has been joined by Abu Dhabi which is reported to have cut by
some 200,000 b/d and belatedly, by Nigeria where officials are trimming
output for April.
This has led to a production decline for Opec of about 750,000 b/d - still
slightly short of the organisation's target of just over 1m b/d.
Iran has been forced to reduce its deliveries by bad weather at the Kharg
Island terminal - its main loading point - where tankers are reported to be
backed up. This has led to a drop in Iranian oil in the market for April,
but many observers expect that, once the weather improves, Tehran will
return to full production.
Mr Stanislaw believes that, for prices to rise, Opec will have to slash its
output by at least another 1m b/d. But oil ministers are currently unwilling
to give up that much volume.
Since Opec's new production regime is based more on capacity than historical
quotas, countries could be resisting cuts now in order to gain higher
production allocations in future agreements.
'If you assume Iraq will be out of the market until after the US election,
you have a couple of months of pain and then it all comes back for them,'
said one market observer. Demand for Opec oil will begin to pick up later in
the year, as buyers begin to build stocks in advance of the western winter.
But the organisation could still face some tense negotiating at its meeting
on April 24 when Saudi Arabia will resist calls from smaller producers to
cut below 8m b/d. The kingdom is unwilling to shoulder the burden of
production cutbacks without at least some token action by all other
producers.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bank float attracts
strong demand
</HEADLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN investors defied a lacklustre stock market and pre-election blues to
turn the country's biggest initial public share offering - for 20 per cent
of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the leading Italian bank - into a
roaring success, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The deal, launched on Monday, was closed early yesterday on account of
strong demand. Demand in Italy alone at the end of the first day exceeded
the 125m shares on offer, while foreign investors bid for over L550bn of
shares, equivalent to 36 per cent of the deal, according to preliminary
figures from Mediobanca, the lead manager.
Under Italy's new rules on public share offerings, the issue had to be kept
open for at least two days.
Some 67,000 applications were received in Italy alone by the end of the
first day, reflecting the strong retail interest in the deal, while around
800 institutional investors applied from outside Italy.
San Paolo's own clients were among the keenest buyers. Demand from customers
exceeded 30 per cent of the overall value of the deal, meaning that other
allocations would have to be scaled down to fulfil a pledge that customers
would be allocated at least 30 per cent of the shares.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Bonds: SmithKline Beecham taps Euromarket for
first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the drugs company, made its debut Eurobond offering
yesterday, three years after SmithKline Beckman of the US merged with
Beecham of the UK.
The company tapped the bond market in order to diversify its sources of
funding and extend the maturity profile of its debt, according to Mr Stephen
Crompton, director of treasury operations.
Most of the company's funding has been concentrated in the US commercial
paper market, where its Dollars 1.5bn programme is used actively.
The CDollars 125m, five-year deal, arranged by Merrill Lynch, was swapped
into floating-rate US dollars at a level below the London interbank offered
rate.
The deal was launched late in the day to gauge the extent of retail demand.
Dealers said the 9 1/2 per cent coupon would be attractive to some retail
investors but that demand remained subdued.
Merrill Lynch underwrote the whole deal, assembling only a selling group.
The deal was bid at 100.05, above the fixed reoffer level of 99.75, against
a rallying Canadian government bond market.
Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs raised funds for its derivatives trading
subsidiary, GS Financial Products, using an unusual asset-backed structure.
The Y30bn issue, backed by securities and options, was over-collateralised
in order to achieve a triple-A rating.
The structure of the deal - placed mainly in Asia - allows Goldman to remove
assets from its balance sheet and reduce the amount of capital which it has
to hold.
In the equity-linked sector, Onward Kashiyama, the Japanese clothing
manufacturer, launched a Dollars 200m four-year deal which was bid at 98 1/2
, below its par issue price but well within 2 1/4 point fees.
Conditions in the equity warrants market have been further depressed this
week by the fall in the Nikkei stock index below 20,000 points. Many
warrants were already trading so far out of the money that the decline had
little further effect on depressed prices.
Volume in the secondary markets has sunk to an extremely low level, and the
calendar for new issues is thin. However, any improvements in market
conditions would boost the flow of new paper, since many Japanese companies
would welcome the chance to refinance equity-linked deals.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) announced yesterday it would distribute
Y1.6bn to member-brokerages due to a surplus in revenues.
The OSE projects a surplus for the year to end-March due to a rise in
commission revenue from active trading in the Nikkei stock index futures and
options. The surplus contrasts with a Y9.2bn deficit for the Tokyo Stock
Exchange (TSE), which has been hit by faltering trading volume on the cash
stock market.
The differences in revenue may increase pressure on the OSE to implement
stricter rules on derivatives trading. Heavy activity on the OSE's
derivative markets, which are based on the TSE's cash stock average, has
been blamed for creating price volatility on underlying cash shares.
The worried TSE raised margins on arbitrage trading between the futures and
cash stock markets three times last year, and the OSE also announced plans
to double commissions on futures and options trading.
The OSE said it would refund members by reducing fixed-rate membership fees
for cash stocks, and index futures and options trading by 25 per cent. For
the current year, revenues are projected at Y20bn against expenses of
Y19.9bn.

DEN norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest, yesterday revealed details of a
planned NKr2.38bn (Dollars 364m) issue of preference shares, to be launched
between May 22 and June 5, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. It is designed to
boost capital adequacy to meet new Bank for International Settlements
domestic requirements by the end of the year.
The share capital increase is part of a NKr5.9bn rescue package organised in
December by the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund, which also agreed to
guarantee full subscription.
The issue is to carry pre-emptive subscription rights for existing
shareholders, at par value of NKr10 per share.
After the issue, non-restricted shares will represent about 12 per cent of
capital, while the restricted shares will be about 88 per cent.

<TEXT>
ABACUS, south-east Asia's largest airline computer reservation system,
yesterday extended its presence in the Asia-Pacific region by taking All
Nippon Airlines (ANA), Japan's second largest carrier, as a partner.
The move is the latest international tie-up in the fast-growing business of
computerised ticket distribution. It comes less than two weeks after the
Dollars 1.5bn transatlantic merger of the Galileo and Apollo computer
reservation systems in Europe and the US respectively.
The deal also strikes a blow in ANA's battle with Japan Airlines (JAL), its
rival. ANA is stronger in the Japanese domestic market, but earns only 13
per cent of its sales from international passenger traffic. More than half
JAL's sales are to international passengers, and JAL has its own computer
reservation system.
ANA is paying Dollars 18.2m for a 13.48 per cent stake in Singapore-based
Abacus Distribution Systems. The two companies had already linked their
reservation computers, but now ANA gains a holding equal to those of Cathy
Pacific Airways, China Airlines of Taiwan, Malaysian Airline Systems, Royal
Brunei Airlines and Singapore Airlines.
Abacus also has a 5 per cent cross-holding with Worldspan, the third biggest
US computer reservation system. Worldspan is owned by Delta Airlines,
Northwest Airlines, and Trans World Airlines, all of the US.
ANA said yesterday: 'We have a close relationship with Worldspan and we
wanted a closer relationship with Abacus.' It said the recession had
increased Abacus' need for a capital injection.
Japan Air Lines will cut all executive salaries by between 5 and 15 per cent
for an unspecified period from April, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The move
follows poor results in the year to March.
In February, JAL forecast a parent company pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars
61.5m) for 1991-92, against profits of Y24.85bn.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: UK power stations draw Pounds
3bn financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE proposals to build gas-fired power stations are due to be finalised by
the middle of next month, bringing to as much as Pounds 3bn (Dollars 5.28bn)
the total raised to finance such projects in the UK.
The power stations, operated independently from the two recently-privatised
UK power generators, Powergen and National Power, together amount to one of
the biggest project financing programmes undertaken in the UK.
The biggest single project to date - the Pounds 700m Barking Power scheme,
to build a 1,000MW plant on the banks of the Thames - was completed at the
end of last week. It has received facilities of Pounds 200m from the
European Investment Bank. It is the first time the bank has backed such a
project from the outset rather than becoming involved at a later stage,
according to advisers to the transaction.
The Barking Power deal brings to six the number of independent gas-fired
stations to have been financed in the past 18 months, following the move to
privatise the UK electricity supply industry at the end of the 1980s.
Three further projects to build stations are in the pipeline: at Medway,
Kent; Keadby, Yorkshire; and Derwent, in the Midlands. Each has until April
14 to be completed, the target date set by British Gas six months ago when
it agreed supply contracts with the promoters of the projects.
On top of these nine stations - total financing for which amounts to nearly
Pounds 3bn - Powergen and National Power have themselves started development
of gas-fuelled power stations. Unlike the independent projects, these are
understood to have been financed as straight corporate loans, with the full
backing of the balance sheets of the two power generators.
As such, they would have benefited from lower financing costs. In general,
project financing currently attracts an extra margin of between 0.5 and 0.75
percentage points above normal corporate lending rates, according to Mr
George Wadia, a director of Schroders, the merchant bank which advised on
the Barking Power deal.
Barking Power itself would pay a margin of 1.15 per cent over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) in its construction phase, he said.
For banks that have financed the power station deals, the projects have
provided an enhanced margin while at the same time giving some degree of
protection to the future cashflow of the projects. In each case, one or more
of the UK's privatised regional electricity distribution companies has
agreed to buy the stations' output at a pre-arranged rate, providing a hedge
against future fluctuations in price.
In Barking's case, three companies - Southern Electric, Eastern Electricity
and London Electricity - have provided 15-year hedging arrangements. At the
same time, they have taken a total of 49 per cent of the equity.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Foster's seeks boardroom balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing, the world's fourth largest beer-maker, is to have three
deputy chairmen in an attempt to balance the competing factions on its
board, Mr Nobby Clark, chairman, said yesterday.
Mr Clark said Mr John Elliott, deputy chairman since 1990, would be joined
by Mr Koichiro Iwaki, representing Asahi Breweries of Japan, and Professor
Fred Hilmer, an independent director.
Mr Clark also said a board committee set up last year to discuss strategic
options would be attended by Mr Ted Kunkel, who will take over in May as
Foster's chief executive.
Mr Kunkel, who is presently chairman of Molson Breweries of Canada, in which
Foster's has a 50 per cent interest, was appointed last week to replace Mr
Peter Bartels, who resigned after losing a boardroom struggle over dividend
policy.
The announcements reflect the increasing influence on the Foster's board of
Asahi, which has a 19.9 per cent shareholding. They also confirm that the
departure of Mr Bartels was not an unqualified victory for Mr Elliott, who
had earlier sought his dismissal.
The board's decision to appoint Mr Kunkel to the strategy committee means
the management of Foster's will have more influence over the company's
direction than under Mr Bartels, who was not a member of the committee.
That could reduce Mr Elliott's chances of persuading the committee to speed
up the disposal of about ADollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) in non-brewing
assets which Foster's has said it wants to sell.
Mr Elliott's private company, International Brewing Holdings (IBH), which
owns 38 per cent of Foster's, has until May to present proposals to its
bankers for the reduction of more than ADollars 2.5bn in debt.
Mr Elliott and two other IBH directors have argued strongly for a rapid
disposal of assets, possibly leading to a capital return to shareholders
which would allow IBH to repay its debts.
The IBH proposals were resisted by Mr Bartels and Foster's independent
directors.

CAVENDISH International, the property-to-energy subsidiary of Mr Li
Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa, announced a 5 per cent drop in net profits, to
HKDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 162m) for 1991, compared with HKDollars 1.32bn
in 1990.
However, the results included a HKDollars 462m provision for the diminution
in value of the oil and gas reserves of 24.5 per cent-owned Canadian
associate Husky Oil.
The company saw a significant increase in contributions from 34 per
cent-owned Hong Kong Electric Holdings. Profits there climbed to HKDollars
2.34bn in 1991, from HKDollars 1.93bn.
However, the Husky provision held the contribution from associate companies
to Dollars 1.27bn, only Dollars 1m higher.
Cavendish saw significant profits from the sale in 1991 of residential
blocks in the Belvedere Gardens and South Horizons property developments.
However, the 100 per cent-owned Hong Kong Hilton Hotel suffered a reduction
in profits because of global recession and the impact of the increased
supply of luxury hotel rooms on Hong Kong island.
Mr Simon Murray, chairman, warned of 1992 that 'overall results could be
adversely affected by the performance of Husky Oil and in particular the
future trend of oil and natural gas prices'.
However, analysts do not rule out another privatisation offer for Cavendish
this year, as a result of its discount to net asset value and the potential
recovery of its Canadian energy interests.
Cavendish recommended a final dividend of 14 cents, making a total 1991
payout of 21 cents.

<TEXT>
DOW EUROPE, European arm of the second biggest US chemicals group, is to be
chosen over Elf Aquitaine of France by the Czech government to acquire a 36
per cent stake in a Czech chemical business, Chemicke Zavody Sokolov.
In what amounts to the largest US investment in Czechoslovakia so far, Dow
is paying Dollars 25m for its share stake and has pledged to invest a
further Dollars 154m in the joint venture over the next seven years. Of
this, Dollars 79m will be spent in the first three years.
Dow will also retain the right to increase its ownership to 94 per cent of
the Czech company for a total of Dollars 100m. The shares will in the
meantime stay in the hands of the Czech National Property Fund.
According to Mr Mark Bakal, head of the USAID team of advisers at the Czech
Ministry of Privatisation, Dow will agree to operate the Czech company at
full capacity and make it the European acrylic centre of the Dow group. The
company may also develop its hydrogen-peroxide and chlorate business in
Czechoslovakia, depending on future market studies.
Unlike Elf Aquitaine, which offered a substantial competing bid for the
Czech company, this will be Dow's only plant in Europe which implies
significant potential for future growth, said Mr Bakal. Dow and Sokolov also
have a 15-year long relationship, with management openly in favour of the
American group.
Kmart, the US department stores company, is poised to make the first large
foreign investment in retail trade in Czechoslovakia, buying six stores in
main cities.
It will buy 67 per cent of Maj, a large department store in central Prague,
for Dollars 9.7m and 97 per cent of five Prior stores in key locations in
the country, for Dollars 27.8m.
The US company will invest a further Dollars 8.3m to revamp both stores and
upgrade the products sold there.
This is the second largest US investment in Czechoslovakia after Dow. Last
year, Proctor &amp; Gamble acquired a detergent factory for Dollars 20m.
Kmart intends to create the first department stores chain in Czechoslovakia
selling products with western standards. It also estimates that Dollars 15m
worth of Czechoslovak products could be exported back to Kmart stores in the
US in the first year of the joint venture.
Department stores in Czechoslovakia have been hard hit by the recession
since the start of the economic reforms two years ago. The stores Kmart is
buying have registered minimal profits following a 31.7 per cent drop in
sales for 1991.

<TEXT>
KUGELFISCHER, the German bearings company, made a loss of about DM80m
(Dollars 48m) in 1991 after a profits slump the previous year, and is
continuing to cut its labour force in an attempt to lower costs and return
to the black.
It said renewed profits could not be expected this year while only 80 per
cent capacity was being utilised.
The company, which also makes sewing machine systems, hydraulic brake parts,
and other industrial products, said its turnover fell by 3 per cent to
DM3.9bn (Dollars 2.4bn). Excluding acquisitions in east Germany and the US,
however, there was a drop of 9 per cent.
After cutting its labour force by 5,600 people last year (including a 3,450
reduction at DKFL, the east German bearings subsidiary), it plans to shed a
further 2,700 in 1992. Of these, around 1,400 jobs will be lost at the
parent company, which comprises the west German bearings plants. The
worldwide labour force was around 35,000 at the year-end.
Kugelfischer said losses totalled about 2 per cent of turnover; this is
roughly DM80m, though it gave no figure. In 1990, net profits fell by 42 per
cent to DM59m. Not only did it suffer from the impact of recession abroad
and reduced demand from the engineering sector for bearings, but the
company's sewing machine operation was also hit by problems in the textile
industry.
Last year's fall in group orders left Kugelfischer with a backlog of 5.7
months' work, two months less than the year before. However, it expected
turnover to stabilise in 1992 now customers seemed to have stopped reducing
stocks. Short-time working, affecting about a quarter of the domestic
workforce, would continue.

FINMECCANICA, the principal industrial group of IRI, Italy's state holding
company, acquired its 6.02 per cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft

yesterday.
The secret acquisition of the stake, worth Fl 71.5m (Dollars 38.1m) at
Fokker's current share price, only came to light on Monday as a result of a
new law last month, requiring shareholders to disclose stakes of 5 per cent
or more in stock market-listed Dutch companies.
Finmeccanica has so far declined to comment on the reasons behind the
purchase or why it has kept quiet about the deal.
However, when questioned by journalists yesterday, Mr Nobili said: '(The
purchase) was not recent but something which dates back more than a year.'
The disclosure comes just a few days after Fokker announced discussions with
Deutsche Aerospace aimed at expanding collaboration in regional jets,
including the German group's participation in the development of a smaller
version of the Fokker 100.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann buys 47% stake in car
parts group

<TEXT>
SOGEFI, the stock market quoted auto components group controlled by Mr Carlo
De Benedetti's Cir holding company, has sold its 47.97 per cent stake in
Boge, the German car parts group, to Mannesmann for L120bn (Dollars 95.79m).
Sogefi, which is 60 per cent owned by Cir, bought an initial 25 per cent
stake in Boge in 1989 and subsequently raised its holding in stages to the
present level. Boge, which has sales of about DM750m, specialises in shock
absorbers and suspension systems for vehicles, and is a European leader in
research into electronic suspensions.
The sale, which will give Sogefi an extraordinary gain of about L19bn, means
Mannesmann now owns virtually all the shares in Boge, having bought out VDO
and Commerzbank, the two main German shareholders, last August. Mannesmann
subsequently went on to buy VDO, an auto electronics group, last October.
Mannesmann's arrival on the scene put an end to any ambitions Sogefi may
have cherished of eventually gaining control of Boge, some members of whose
management had voiced misgivings about its intentions. Sogefi is already
active in shock absorber production through Rejna, an Italian company it
bought in 1986. Shortly afterwards, it consolidated its European position by
buying shock absorber makers in France and Belgium.
A Cir official denied yesterday that Sogefi had ever nursed plans to take
over Boge, on the grounds that such a move would have been blocked by the
German cartel authorities. Sogefi, which has grown rapidly in recent years
through a string of acquisitions, specialises in auto filters and suspension
systems.
Sogefi said the sale to Mannesmann could be followed by co-operation in
distributing spare parts for cars in Europe and in developing integrated
sub-systems. Sales for Sogefi group rose by almost 9 per cent to L620bn
while net profits amounted to L22.6bn in 1990, the last year for which
figures are available.

ISS, the Danish cleaning services group, yesterday reported an increase in
operating profits of 41 per cent to DKr582m (Dollars 90m) on turnover up by
23 per cent at DKr11.8bn.
Profits after financial items and goodwill write-offs rose by 24 per cent to
DKr329m and net profits were 19 per cent higher at DKr244m.
Earnings per share increased to DKr56 from DKr55. The company is paying an
unchanged DKr10 per share dividend on increased capital.
The acquisition of Electrolux's Swedish cleaning services company, ABAB,
last year added DKr1.3bn to sales. However, there was an increase of 21 per
cent in sales in the European (excluding Scandinavia) division of which
almost none was explained by acquisitions.
In the UK, Mediclean, the hospital cleaning services company, has doubled
turnover to about DKr500m since ISS acquired the company three years ago.
Earnings were also satisfactory, said Mr Poul Andreassen, group chief
executive. No major acquisitions are planned for this year.

VALEO, the French maker of car components, yesterday reported a 10 per cent
decline in 1991 net profits.
Net income after minority interests fell to FFr545m (Dollars 96m) last year
from FFr603m in 1990, on turnover down 1.6 per cent to FFr19.87bn from
FFr20.18bn. Earnings fell to FFr44.2 per share from FFr49.3 over the same
period.
Valeo, headed by Noel Goutard, warned that the automotive market remained
weak and said it would continue to concentrate on increasing sales, cutting
production costs and reducing borrowings.
Net debt fell to FFr2.95bn by the end of last year, from FFr3.5bn at the end
of 1990.
Valeo's operating income rose by 30 per cent to FFr878m from FFr676m last
year, but the gain was wiped out at the net level by the fact that Valeo had
no capital gains from asset sales last year, as against FFr154m of capital
gains from divestments in 1990. Including the income due to Valeo before the
asset sales took place, Valeo had FFr193m of total revenues from divested
operations in 1990.
Turnover started to recover in the second half, by 3.9 per cent over the
comparable period in the previous year, after having slipped 6.1 per cent in
the first six months of 1991.

VALMET, the Finnish state-owned paper machinery and engineering group,
yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of FM692m (Dollars 152m) against a deficit
of FM290m in 1990, on sales 24 per cent lower at FM7.6bn.
No dividend will be distributed this year. However, Valmet predicts that
profitability will improve both in 1992 and 1993 due to restructuring
measures.
Last year's operating loss was FM471m. This included a deficit for the
tractor division of FM221m due to economic problems in Brazil.
Logging had a loss of FM165m, reflecting the recession in the forestry
industry while the paper machinery division, which accounts for 52 per cent
of group sales at FM4.1bn, made an operating profit of FM68m.
Effjohn, the shipping line, yesterday reported a profit after financial
items of FM4m against earnings of FM30m in 1990 following heavy investments
in several passenger vessels. The dividend is being cut to FM1.20 a share
from FM1.50.
The construction of two ferries for its Silja Line service in the Baltic and
the building of two cruise ships for the US market increased net financial
costs to FM172m from FM60m in 1990.
Turnover rose by 17 per cent to FM3.4bn due to increased passenger traffic.
The company predicts that the 1992 operating result will be better than the
1991 result of FM363m as the new ships enter service.
However, it gave no forecast for earnings after financial items due to the
recession in Finland and the introduction of a new travel tax there.

<TEXT>
CBR, the Belgian cement group, yesterday reported a 12.4 per cent drop in
1991 profits to BFr3.63bn (Dollars 105m), but in the light of expansion in
North America and Europe announced a BFr20 per share increase in dividend to
BFr270.
Profits followed the downturn in Europe and recession in North America, the
company explained. However, the volume of its business held up, and because
it bought several US companies making ready-mixed concrete and building
aggregates, overall group turnover rose last year by 7.2 per cent to
BFr46.33bn.
There was, however, a sizeable drop in net profits for Cimenteries CBR, the
Belgian parent company, to BFr1.95bn last year compared with BFr4.26bn in
1990, when the company recorded some extraordinary profits from leading
subsidiaries.
Cash-flow expanded as the group increased investment in the Tehchapi cement
plant in California and expanded its Tilbury plant in British Columbia. It
further strengthened its west coast presence by buying ready-mixed concrete
and aggregate companies in California, Washington state and Alberta, as well
as closer to home in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.
Early this year, it took a stake in Mokra, a leading southern Czech cement
producer, of which it will gain majority control by the end of 1994.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a tough time all round in Toytown, but especially for Bluebird
Toys, maker of the microscopic Polly Pocket doll and the Big Red Fun Bus.
Pre-tax losses at this USM-quoted group deepened from Pounds 856,000 to
Pounds 3.55m over 1991.
Virtually all of the deficit was attributable to exceptional charges of
Pounds 3.46m taken during the first six months for a wide-ranging
restructuring programme.
Profits in the second half totalled Pounds 924,000, compared with Pounds
40,000 for the comparable period of 1990.
Mr Torquil Norman, founder and chairman, said the restructuring programme
was now complete and the company expected to make a profit in the coming
year.
'We are now back on track . . . Trying to restructure in the recession was
like trying to turn a supertanker round in a force 10 gale,' he said.
Two factories had been closed in the last 18 months with the subsequent loss
of 450 jobs.
Head office staffing had been reduced and various product ranges combined
under a single sales force.
Stocks had been cut by 50 per cent to Pounds 4.4m, and a significant amount
of work was being sourced from the Far East. He denied that this would
affect the quality of products offered.
Turnover fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 42.6m. Margins came under pressure
due to the greater proportion of overseas sales which rose by 50 per cent to
Pounds 11m.
Mr Norman said the group remained well within its banking facilities. Net
gearing - excluding the 20-year convertible loan stock - was 75 per cent.
Losses per share jumped from 10.8p to 35.8p.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Broker concerned about Lonrho's debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN over Lonrho's disposal programme will be highlighted today with the
publication of a note by UBS Phillips and Drew, its stockbroker, predicting
that the group's net debt for the year end will remain as high as Pounds
1bn.
In spite of reports by the international conglomerate that it plans to
reduce its net debt from Pounds 1.1bn to about Pounds 600m, its brokers fear
that without sizeable international disposals Lonrho's borrowings will not
fall significantly.
The report, entitled Dependent on Disposals, says Lonrho's problems are
compounded by structural problems.
Because less than 10 per cent of its pre-tax profits are generated in the UK
it is vulnerable on the tax front with unrelieved advance corporation tax.
The group needs more cash in the UK to pay interest and dividends.
In a further blow to the group Phillips and Drew believes that Western
Platinum, located in South Africa, is worth only half the Pounds 1bn
valuation put on it by Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, in the
1990 annual report. Lonrho has a 75 per cent stake in the mine.
The broker has also downgraded its profit forecast for 1992 to Pounds 150m,
with earnings per share of 10p compared to 14.2p for the year to
end-September 1991.
Since Lonrho's results were published in January, with pre-tax profits
falling by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m (Pounds 273m), the group has announced
a disposals programme to significantly reduce its debt.
Yet to date it has only announced two disposals, which include the sale of
its UK Man truck importing business for Pounds 20m and Scottish and
Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity International Holdings.
Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said:
'Lonrho is not taking what the City is saying seriously enough: its debt is
too high. And a Pounds 45m sale will not make a blind bit of difference.'
Lonrho reported the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the
German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m) hours before its
results.
Phillips and Drew believe there has been too much concentration on the
possible disposal of UK assets and not enough about possible disposals
abroad.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P sees US newspapers
recovering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US newspaper industry is showing signs of recovery, with prospects for a
strengthening of profitability toward the second half of 1992, according to
a report from Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency.
A survey by the agency of nine publicly-quoted newspaper groups concluded
that earnings in the last quarter of 1991, while mixed, were generally
encouraging.
Advertising lineage figures for the month of January, meanwhile, pointed to
a near halt to the decline in advertising demand.
S&amp;P said ratings on most newspaper companies would not be downgraded this
year, although the rating outlook for several group - including Dow Jones,
Knight-Ridder and Times Mirror - remained negative because of concern that
the recession may last longer than expected.
Mr Robert Nelson, a senior vice-president at S&amp;P, said it appeared that most
of the newspaper groups examined were beginning to emerge from what he
called the industry's worst ever downturn.
Most newspapers had taken what S&amp;P termed 'prudent measures' to bolster
creditworthiness. These measures included a more cautious investment
profile, cuts in operating costs and the lowering of debt burdens.
S&amp;P noted that Dow Jones - whose flagship paper The Wall Street Journal is
dependent upon national and financial advertising - had a stronger fourth
quarter last year, with advertising lineage at The Journal down by only 0.7
per cent and advertising revenues 3.3 per cent higher.
Mr Nelson said recessionary pressures on US newspaper companies would abate
slowly during the first half of 1992, with more rapid strengthening likely
in the closing months of the year.
The well-diversified groups, such as Gannett and Knight-Ridder, might show
better results sooner than companies such as the Times Mirror group, which
relies on the harder hit north-east and southern California regions.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw limits fall as new car sales
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A declining market for new cars last year, Evans Halshaw, the motor
dealer, limited its pre-tax profit fall to 6 per cent, from Pounds 4.11m to
Pounds 3.86m.
The share price rose 9p to close at 285p, its highest level since 1989.
The profit decline for the year to December 31 was much less steep than in
1990, when the group was hit by losses in parts distribution, which it has
sold, and the cost of reorganising contract hire.
The group also announced plans to open two multi-franchise outlets in the
Midlands.
This decision was made against a background of relaxation in manufacturers'
restrictions related to a recently published Monopolies and Mergers
Commission report.
Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the first outlet, in Birmingham, would
combine the sale of new Honda, Nissan and Mazda cars with used cars and
service. It would cost just over Pounds 3m and open by August.
The second, in Solihull, would include Vauxhall, Rover, which relaxed its
exclusivity requirements in January, and Toyota. It would cost a similar
amount and open next year.
The concept involves a cluster of independent showrooms rather the new makes
being mixed in together.
Mr Dale said that when the developments were complete the company would have
45 dealerships covering 18 different franchises.
Operating profit fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 8.62m) on
turnover of Pounds 340m (Pounds 383m). Part of the fall followed a business
disposal. Ongoing activities were down 7 per cent. Mr Dale blamed the
downturn in the UK new car market - last year total sales fell by 21 per
cent to 1.59m units.
The share of Evans Halshaw's operating profit attributable to car sales fell
from 32 per cent to 19 per cent.
Three quarters of profit came from servicing and parts, compared with 62 per
cent in 1990.
At the pre-tax level, there was an Pounds 800,000 turnround in contract hire
and the growing fleet management business, which gives computerised analysis
of fleet costs.
This helped the interest line, where charges fell from Pounds 4.52m to
Pounds 3.24m. The business disposal and cost control also played a part.
Net debt went up slightly to Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m), all but Pounds 2m
related to contract hire, giving gearing of about 37 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped from 12.3p to 11.7p. A maintained final dividend
of 7.65p makes an unchanged 11.25p total.

HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food processing group, is buying Holco, a Dutch
mushroom and asparagus canning and bottling business, in a move which will
make it one of the largest mushroom processors in Europe.
The seller is Albert Fisher, the fresh produce distributor. Hillsdown is
paying Fl 37.5m (Pounds 11.7m) cash - a price thought to be at about asset
value.
Hillsdown has emphasised its strategy of making small acquisitions which fit
easily with its main business, and Holco will be combined with its Jeco
Conserven Horst mushroom and asparagus business.
Mr John Jackson, deputy chairman of Hillsdown, said Holco had a modern
facility which was working at about 70 per cent capacity. Jeco's management
would run the combined operation and its retail packing side would be moved
to Holco while Jeco's plant concentrated on catering packs.
Mr Jackson said the European mushroom market had been hit in 1991 by an
influx of cheap mushrooms from Poland, but now that some producers had left
the market profitability was improving.
Hillsdown shares rose 2p to 176p, and Albert Fisher's shares were unchanged
at 67p.

UNISYS, the struggling US computer manufacturer, said it expected to be
profitable in the current first quarter in spite of continuing market
weakness and tough competition.
After several years of heavy losses, Unisys returned to profitability in the
fourth quarter of 1991.
The company now expects 'a small profit in the seasonally weak first
quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 98m, or 79 cents a share, in the
first quarter last year', said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive.
'Clearly, we consider a first quarter profit another significant milestone
in our recovery. Given the environment, a profit was not a sure thing. We
remain very cautious about global economic conditions, particularly in the
first half. But we have not altered our view of 1992 as a profitable, though
difficult year,' Mr Unruh said.
Outlining Unisys' strategy, he said the company aimed to lower its costs in
order to maintain profitability in spite of weak business conditions.
With 'our continually improving cost structure, any incremental revenue we
can generate will have a positive impact on the bottom line,' he said.
Mr Unruh said Unisys planned to continue to reduce its Dollars 3bn debt and
the company expected to generate more than Dollars 700m in cash flow from
operations in 1992.
'We believe we were early among our computer systems competitors to reshape
our business to the new realities of our industry. There is no easy or rapid
way to solve today's challenges. But we have indeed made a new start and
will begin in 1992 to reap the benefits.'
Dell Computer said Xerox would market Dell's personal computers in 19
countries in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, AP-DJ reports
from Austin, Texas.
Dell said it would continue its relationships with other resellers in Latin
America, which had distributed its products on a limited basis.
The countries do not include Brazil, which has barred personal computers
imports since 1975, and Mexico, where Xerox does not market PCs.

<TEXT>
CANADA'S Four Seasons Hotels will become the world's largest operator of
luxury hotels under an agreement with the Japanese parent of the Regent
International chain.
EIE International, the financially-troubled Japanese developer, will
transfer management of five Regent hotels, including those in New York and
Milan, to Four Seasons.
The two groups also plan to set up a property partnership to which each will
contribute its interests in 10 hotels, all but two of them in North America.
EIE will also contribute its interest in Regent.
EIE will have an 80 per cent stake in the joint venture, with Four Seasons
owning the remaining 20 per cent. Four Seasons will also contribute Dollars
102m in equity.
Four Seasons, whose 23 existing properties include The Pierre in New York
and London's Inn on the Park, said yesterday the deal accelerated its
planned expansion in the Far East by five to 10 years without increasing its
exposure to the real estate market.
Regent manages 10 hotels, expects to negotiate contracts for five others,
and has several projects under development. Four Seasons said it would
provide advisory services for various properties still managed by the
Japanese group.
Separately, EIE International has resort and golf club interests in Asia and
the Pacific, and also owns a floating hotel moored at Ho Chi Minh City in
Vietnam.
Mr Yoichi Shibata, EIE's managing director, said 'the value of our property
holdings will be increased by the Four Seasons link because the company is
one of the world's most powerful hotel operators'.
The Japanese company plans to reduce estimated debts of Y630bn (Dollars
4.7bn) through strategic sales of property holdings over the next two years
or so.
The Long-Term Credit Bank, the main bank of EIE, and four other Japanese
institutions have sent managers to restructure the company, which has
already sold off a hotel in Saipan and part of its share in a Hong Kong
office complex.

<TEXT>
A HAND-HELD, battery- operated analyser that reduces the time needed to
perform a blood test to 90 seconds has been launched by i-STAT, a
Princeton-based medical diagnostics company.
The system - a portable clinical analyser with a disposable biosensor
cartridge - will initially be marketed in the US. It is intended to replace
laboratory blood tests that can take an hour or more to perform.
Mr William Moffitt, president of i-STAT, said the company would target the
acute care units of 2,000 US hospitals and hopes to sell between 10 and 20
per hospital, at Dollars 3,000 per analyser.
The analyser, which looks like a remote control for a television set,
accepts a tiny cartridge containing two drops of blood and produces test
results for sodium, potassium chloride, glucose, urea nitrogen and
hematocrit.
The company, which employs 115 people and has its manufacturing plant in
Canada, recently raised Dollars 51m through a share issue on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
The Japanese launch of the analyser, which Mr Moffitt said was the only
product of its kind, will take place later this year.

FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Federal Express to sell French
domestic service to TNT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday announced an ADollars 80m
(USDollars 60.1m) deal with Federal Express, the US express mail carrier, to
buy the Chronoservice domestic express business in France and deliver
inbound international shipments for FedEx in several European countries.
The deal follows the decision by FedEx to pull out of the highly competitive
market for express services between European countries, and to end domestic
services in France, Germany, Italy and the UK.
Sir Peter Abeles, TNT chief executive, said the agreements, subject to
approval from European regulatory authorities, would 'further demonstrate
the leading position we have built in Europe.'
The deal represents a significant expansion by TNT, which will become a
strong competitor in the French domestic market, where it operates only
international services.
Chronoservice is one of France's leading express mail companies, with a
network of 12 depots, about 450 employees and 235 trucks, mostly located in
the west of the country.
TNT claims to be Europe's leading operator of domestic express mail
businesses, with strong and highly profitable operations in Italy, Germany,
Spain and the UK.
The second element of the deal stipulates that FedEx will appoint TNT's
Express Worldwide subsidiary as its sub-contractor to handle inbound
deliveries to 10 European countries.
The effect will be to remove a strong competitor from the inbound
international market, and increase the volume of packages being handled by
TNT's road and air delivery network.
TNT said the deal was supported by GD Net, the Dutch-based consortium of
five European and North American post offices which last year agreed to form
a joint venture to pool express mail shipments.
The agreement did not affect TNT shares, which have strengthened
considerably after falling below ADollars 1 last year as worries mounted
about liquidity. The shares closed unchanged at ADollars 1.96 on the
Australian Stock Exchange.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO privatised Chilean power companies have won the bidding for the first
Buenos Aires electricity generator to come on the market as part of
Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme.
A consortium comprising Chilgener and Chilectra offered Dollars 92.2m in
cash for a 60 per cent stake in Central Nuevo, a company created to manage
two Buenos Aires power stations. The company was carved out of SEGBA, the
state-owned electricity monopoly that serves greater Buenos Aires.
The Chilean companies outbid Spanish, French, US and Chilean rivals. The
second-placed bidder, France's state-owned Electricite de France acting with
a local partner, offered Dollars 84.3m.
Argentina hopes to net over Dollars 6bn by selling seven utilities,
including the entire electricity and gas industries and part of state-owned
oil company YPF.
It plans to create an electricity market in which generation, transport and
distribution are handled by competing companies.
Ten per cent of Central Nuevo's stock will be held in trust for the
employees, while the government will retain a 30 per cent share. It plans to
sell its shareholding in a stock market flotation at a later date.
Stockbrokers in Buenos Aires reported strong demand for shares in Telecom
Argentina on Monday. This was the first day for offers to buy the
government's remaining 30 per cent stake in the country's second largest
telephone company which was privatised in 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Children's Medical Charity Investment Trust has agreed to call an
extraordinary meeting to consider winding up the trust and has decided to
immediately realise its assets.
The decision followed an offer of 55p per share made on behalf of Mr Andrew
Perloff, a director, to acquire all the outstanding shares of the trust. Mr
Perloff said that he and those deemed to be acting with him had recently
increased their stake to 400,000 shares (39.9 per cent) necessitating the
offer.
However, directors argued that as the net asset value was 80p per share the
interests of shareholders would be best served by the voluntary winding up
of the company.
Mr Perloff said he would vote against the winding up motion and it would
therefore not be passed as a 75 per cent majority was needed. He added that
the proposed immediate realisation of investments was not in the company's
best interests.

BOARD CHANGES were announced yesterday at Eurocopy, the photocopier
distributor which was recently the target of an Office of Fair Trading
inquiry into the selling practices of some subsidiaries.
The company, which was allowed to retain its consumer credit licences after
a four-month OFT inquiry, said yesterday that Mr John Bedford, the company
secretary, Mr Robin Gilmore, group treasurer, and Mr Hugh Wilson, managing
director of Purdie and Kirkpatrick, Eurocopy's Scottish subsidiary, would be
leaving the company with immediate effect.
Purdie and Kirkpatrick, acquired in 1989, had been singled out by Sir Gordon
Borrie, director general of the OFT, for special criticism in the inquiry.
However, he acknowledged that Eurocopy had taken steps to reform selling
practices at the subsidiary before the inquiry began.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recovery under way as Savage makes Pounds
676,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Savage Group, the shelving manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
676,000 for the half year to December 31 compared to a loss of Pounds
300,000 from continuing businesses in the equivalent period of 1990, and a
total deficit in that period of Pounds 816,000.
The result included a loss of Pounds 198,000 for discontinued operations in
Belgium and the Netherlands.
There were extraordinary costs of Pounds 2.58m relating primarily to the
group's departure from some of its Benelux operations.
The disposals meant that interim turnover was down from Pounds 62.5m to
Pounds 37.8m and net assets were down to Pounds 15.3m against Pounds 17.4m
at June 30, the reduction being primarily due to the Belgian closure.
Borrowings fell to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 7.8m), taking gearing down to 38 per
cent. Operating margins improved from 2.2 per cent to 3.8 per cent.
Losses per share amounted to 0.3p (3.7p). There is no interim dividend but
directors anticipated a payment later this year.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Decline in naira checks Paterson Zochonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in the Nigerian naira held back profits of Paterson Zochonis,
the manufacturer of Cussons Imperial Leather soap, which yesterday reported
a small advance in interim profits from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.6m.
Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said a 40 per cent decline in the value
of the naira in recent weeks had sliced more than Pounds 1m from pre-tax
profits for the six months to November 30.
Profits were further depressed by a 10 per cent decline in investment income
to Pounds 7.4m, due to lower interest rates.
Mr Whittaker said that in spite of the lower investment income, and barring
further falls in the naira, he expected the group to report full-year
profits in line with 1990's Pounds 25.4m.
The interim profits were struck on turnover up from Pounds 108.5m to Pounds
113.9m. Operating profits rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 6.03m, boosted by an
improved contribution from the edible oils business in Greece and the
closure of loss-making businesses in Senegal and the Ivory Coast.
Africa accounts for about 25 per cent of the group's business, and Mr
Whittaker said Paterson had improved there in both volume and local currency
profits. However, when the return was translated at recent exchange rates,
profits had suffered.
Trading in the UK continued to be difficult, with severe pressure on both
sales and margins. 'It is as hard as ever as far as we are concerned,' said
Mr Whittaker. Nevertheless, the UK division had maintained profits.
The group ended the first half with Pounds 140m in cash and soft currency
bank overdrafts of Pounds 40m.
Mr Whittaker said the group continued to look for appropriate acquisition
opportunities in the soap and personal care sector.
'The problem has been that prices have been high with a high goodwill
content,' he said. Paterson was meanwhile concentrating on developing its
existing businesses.
Earnings per share rose from 13.76p to 14.22p. The interim dividend raised
from 2.15p to 2.25p.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Watmoughs slides to Pounds 8.1m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATMOUGHS, one of the UK's largest printers, yesterday reported a 30 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 8.1m, for 1991.
The decline was blamed on the lower volume of advertising revenues, mail
order and retail sales, all of which were adversely affected by the
recession.
However, the company said the decline occurred in the first half, when
profits dropped to Pounds 2.6m compared with Pounds 5m last time.
A recovery was experienced in the second half, when profits reached Pounds
5.5m.
The second half figures were also lifted by the group regaining the printing
contract for the Saturday Times Review after losing it temporarily in the
first half.
Sales improved from Pounds 102m to Pounds 107m.
Earnings per share fell to 21.34p (32.45p) and a final dividend of 8p is
recommended making a total for the year of 10.5p (10.25p).
The Pounds 22.3m rights issue in March was taken up by 89.8 per cent of
share- holders with the balance placed with institutions. The shares
yesterday rose 5p to 420p.
The cash was used for a new gravure printing facility in Spain as part of
the group's expansion on in continental Europe.
Mr Patrick Walker, chairman, predicted that within three years 30 per cent
of the group's sales would come from Spain, Hungary and exports from the UK.
Exports for 1991 totalled Pounds 3.7m compared with Pounds 1.6m in 1990.
Capital expend- iture increased to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 13.5m).
Gearing at the year end was 30 per cent (borrowings of Pounds 19m) against
28 per cent last time.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker venture unravelled - Agreement
with Power, but other 'knotty' problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily-indebted leisure group, and Power Corporation, the
Irish property company, have finally unravelled their property joint
ventures which include the Trocadero in central London.
The deal was a condition of Brent Walker's Pounds 1.6bn financial
restructuring, which is due to be completed by the end of this month. Bond
holder and shareholder resolutions passed last December approving the plan
expire on March 31. Bankers feel that if it became necessary to go back to
investors it would be difficult to hold the restructuring together.
Brent Walker must also come to an agreement with Grand Metropolitan over the
disputed purchase price of the William Hill betting shop chain and a Pounds
50m payment due to GrandMet. There are also other smaller but 'knotty'
difficulties to sort out, advisers said.
The effect of the deal for Brent Walker is to replace a liability to Lloyds
Bank of Pounds 60m plus interest and potential development costs by debts of
Pounds 13m and remove an asset valued at Pounds 11.2m from its balance
sheet. Brent Walker shares fell  1/2 p to 12 1/2 p.
Under the arrangement, Power will take full control of Walker Power
Corporation (WPCL) which owns the Trocadero Centre, the shopping and leisure
complex in Piccadilly, and adjoining Island Site, and of Walker Power
Blackpool which owns the Tower Shopping Centre in Blackpool. Power will also
have a 60 per cent stake in Wilshire Centre Partners, which owns 80 per cent
of Trump Wilshire Associates, which owns the Ambassador Hotel site in Los
Angeles.
Brent Walker had written down the value of its Power joint ventures to
Pounds 11.2m in its December 1990 accounts. The two companies have been
discussing an untying of the relationship for over a year.
Power will take on Pounds 18m of Brent Walker's debt. Brent Walker will
assume a Pounds 9.5m debt to Lloyds Bank, and will repay Pounds 3.5m to WPCL
in February 1993. Brent Walker is also released from its obligations to
contribute to the development costs of the properties.
Power intends to find a new joint venture partner to replace Brent Walker.
It will continue to hold its 50 per cent stake in the two Walker Power
ventures as long-term investments and equity account the profits. The other
50 per cent stakes will be held under current assets in the balance sheet as
at March 31 1992.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Peek falls 37% to Pounds 6.1m and sells
loss-making Greenpar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEEK, the traffic control and field data systems group, saw pre-tax profit
fall by 37 per cent, from Pounds 9.66m to Pounds 6.06m, last year.
The group is selling its loss-making Greenpar connectors business to M/A-COM
of the US.
The Pounds 2m payment, plus the relief of Pounds 5m debt, is expected to
leave Peek with net cash of up to Pounds 9m by the end of this month. The
business has been up for sale for three years.
Mr Ken Maud, chairman, said the money would be spent on acquisitions to
build up the core businesses, which include Husky portable computers and the
monitoring of water and gas.
The group had already made one acquisition this year and was looking to
build up turnover to Pounds 100m.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 84.2m (Pounds 70.7m), with traffic and field
data contributing about 41 per cent each and the rest coming from
connectors. Operating profit fell 29 per cent to Pounds 6.13m (Pounds
8.59m), with field data contributing more than traffic.
The figures included a Pounds 500,000 loss from connectors, compared with
Pounds 500,000 profit in 1990.
Apart from shedding Greenpar, Peek has also withdrawn from leisure marine
equipment and a health and fitness side-line of its Computer Instruments
subsidiary in the US. Extraordinary costs totalled Pounds 3.3m.
Year-end cash slipped from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 4.7m, and a small amount of
interest was paid compared with about Pounds 1m received. Mr Maud said this
was affected by acquisitions from Ferranti and Philips, and by the placing
of a payment on deposit, with the interest to be taken later.
Earnings per share fell to 3.6p (6.4p). Mr Maud said the group was
maintaining its barely covered dividend of 3.4p, after a 2.35p final,
because of confidence in the future and strong liquidity.
Peek's share price gained 3p to close at 62p.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions provide impetus for 33%
advance at Graseby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRASEBY, the medical products and controls group formerly known as Cambridge
Electronic Industries, yesterday reported annual profits up a third,
reflecting contributions from Tace and Goring Kerr, both acquired during the
year.
Pre-tax profits for 1991 rose from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 10.3m on sales 10
per cent lower at Pounds 107.3m.
Some Pounds 3m of the Pounds 13.2m trading profits came from the five months
contributions of Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and Goring
Kerr, the instruments business.
Earnings per share, after exceptional costs for the rationalisation of
defence businesses, were up 0.1p at 16.1p.
The final dividend is maintained at 7.6p for a same-again total of 10.9p.
Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said the acquisitions had lived up to
expectations and enabled earnings per share to be marginally increased.
The group also made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.56m to write off
trade investments and cover the cost of closing and selling two businesses.
Shareholders' funds fell by Pounds 13.3m as a result of a Pounds 2.3m
deficit for the year after dividend payments and an Pounds 11m write-off of
goodwill on the acquisition of Tace and Goring Kerr. As a result gearing
rose to 67 per cent.
On the trading side, the medical businesses were hit by lower NHS spending.
Sales rose only 4 per cent and profits were held at about Pounds 2.8m.
Environmental and defence businesses were boosted by Gulf war related sales
of chemical agent monitors which helped profits more than double from Pounds
3.07m to Pounds 6.85m on sales up 80 per cent at Pounds 40.5m.
Research and development spending rose from just over 3 per cent to 5.2 per
cent of sales, or Pounds 5.6m, in addition to which the group received
Pounds 2.4m of external R&amp;D funding from the US Defense Department and the
UK Ministry of Defence.
COMMENT
Rather than being dilutive as some had feared during the takeover last year,
the integration of Tace and Goring Kerr has been greatly earnings enhancing.
It was a good thing too. The medical division, the old group's star
performer, suffered in the second half from lower NHS spending. Further
growth here in the absence of new products will be more difficult as Graseby
already has such a large share of its NHS markets. The company can similarly
not rely on benefiting from large one-off orders of detection instruments
made during the Gulf war, although the US army could soon place another
sizeable order. This year is therefore likely to be at best flat, possibly
bleaker. The company will benefit from a lower tax charge this year, but it
is still unlikely to make profits above Pounds 12m which would give earnings
of 13.9p and a prospective multiple of 15.

FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Decline in property markets behind losses
at Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP recessions in UK and US property markets were the main reason for
Wimpey's decline into the red last year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said
trading conditions in both countries were the worst in 'living memory.'
Group operating profit, before exceptional write-downs of Pounds 46.4m
mainly on US and UK housing land, tumbled from Pounds 97.6m to Pounds 59.4m.
Interest charges, however, fell from Pounds 41.5m to Pounds 29.1m reflecting
the group's efforts to reduce borrowings through disposals. A divisional
breakdown of Wimpey's performance in 1991 showed:
Contracting: This was the only division to record an improvement, with
profits rising from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 11.2m. This was after a Pounds 12m
provision to cover its share of potential losses on the Channel tunnel
construction contract.
Mr Dwyer said that he still expected to make a profit on the contract which
would enable the provision to be clawed back.
Contracting profits last year were helped by a strong performance by the
offshore oil and gas fabrication businesses before they were sold to a
subsidiary of Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction, mining and engineering
group.
At the end of last year the construction order book stood at Pounds 700m
compared with Pounds 1.15bn at the end of 1990.
Homes: Housebuilding, mostly in the UK and US, saw profits almost halve from
Pounds 51.7m in 1990 to Pounds 26.2m last year. House sales in the UK rose
from 6,263 to 6,380. Averfrom Pounds 67,200 to Pounds 65,500 as margins
continued to be squeezed. Sales of homes, worldwide, fell from 8,747 to
8,061.
However, Mr Dwyer said that housing markets in the UK and in northern
California and Florida had recently shown signs of improving. The group,
following recent land purchases, owned 14,720 plots with planning permission
in the UK, equivalent to about 2 1/2 years' supply at current rates of
production
Minerals: Profits from minerals fell from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 17.4m.
Aggregate sales in the UK held up well, although prices and margins had come
under pressure. US operations had suffered from the general recession in
construction and also from moratoria which had been placed on infrastructure
spending in a number of states.
Property: Sales of properties helped to generate profits of Pounds 4.5m
compared with Pounds 18m. More important was the impact of sales on
cashflow, which was Pounds 107m to the positive last year after disposals.
This enabled the company to reduce net debt by Pounds 99m to Pounds 206.4m.
Still to come this year is the cash from the sale for Pounds 110m of the 50
per cent stake of the Little Britain office development in central London
and from the Pounds 45m sale of St Alphage House, also in central London.
The group has written down the value of its investment properties by Pounds
28m. This has been more than offset by a revaluation surplus of Pounds 45m
on operational properties occupied by the group.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: City delays verdict
after its initial surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland Bank took London by surprise. Only a
few City voices had any inkling that ideas of a merger had been revived.
Fewer still had a clear sense of how it will turn out in practice.
The initial reaction of fund managers and ratings agencies was to remain
cautious until more details emerge.
IBCA, the London-based international bank rating agency, said that it had
put both banks on credit watch.
'We want to know more details before we make up our minds about this. We
need to see the financing of the merger and how they propose to structure
it,' said one agency's banking analyst yesterday.
He agreed with fund managers who said that the two fundamental facts about
the merger were that Midland has staged a fairly convincing recovery and
does not need to be taken over, while there is no doubt that Hongkong bank
does need to diversify out of Hong Kong ahead of the transfer of its
government to China in 1997.
'Midland Bank was probably the best-geared recovery situation in the
sector,' said the fund manager.
One international banker said Hongkong Bank is in a much stronger position
now than in 1987 when a merger was first mooted and can expect less
resistance when imposing its will on Midland.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: Few changes planned
for the top personnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ANGUS FOSTER

<TEXT>
MIDLAND and Hongkong are no strangers, write David Barchard and Angus
Foster.
After Hongkong Bank took its original 14.9 per cent stake in Midland in 1987
 -amid talk of an eventual merger - some of Midland's operations passed to
Hongkong, while others, for example some leasing and trade finance
operations, have been run jointly.
For much of the late 1980s there was a quiet contest among senior officials
in the two banks over how operations and territory would be shared out after
a merger.
Yesterday Hongkong Bank indicated that it intended to keep Midland as a
'stand alone' operation, making few changes to its top personnel and
retaining its outward presence in the high street largely unchanged.
Mr Brian Pearse, previously finance director at Barclays, will be retained
as chief executive. Unlike his immediate predecessor, Sir Kit McMahon, Mr
Pearse is able to communicate easily with the rank and file of the bank's
branches and his departure now would probably throw branch morale even
further into the doldrums.
There seems little doubt that Midland is in for a culture shock.
Hongkong will make sweeping changes inside Midland in the medium and longer
term, and operations will be combined where possible, though since they
overlap in only a few areas there seems to be little scope for speeding up
Midland's drive to cut costs in the UK.
With a stronger capital base, Midland will be better placed to compete with
the other three large high street banks than it has been for several years.
Its executives enjoy one main asset. They are steeped in the business of
UK-style retail and small company banking, an area in which Hongkong Bank
has little previous experience
Indeed, to compete in the rapidly-changing banking markets of late 20th
century Britain, Hongkong Bank must make some fairly drastic adaptations of
its own.
Despite its international ambitions it remains at heart a paternalistic, and
very colonial, institution. Junior employees are not allowed to marry before
25, and curry is served for lunch every Thursday. Most of the senior
management are British, especially Scottish, and the bank only recently
started recruiting grad-uates.
The chairman of 'the Bank', as it is known in Hong Kong, is always invited
to sit on the Hong Kong Governor's elite Executive Council, the most
powerful decision making body in the colony.
Mr William Purves, chairman since 1986, is a Scot who has continued the
international expansion initiated by his predecessor, Sir Michael Sandberg.
Mr Purves is due to retire in the next two years, and he now has the chance
to complete the final part of the jigsaw, by giving Hongkong Bank a
meaningful European presence through the Midland merger.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Band/Midland Bank: Not easy to combine
investment sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKING SENSE of the combined treasury and investment banking activities of
Midland and Hongkong Bank will not be easy. Each bank has recently taken
steps to rationalise its own operations in these areas, with different
results.
Hongkong Bank, for instance, has moved its fixed income business out of
James Capel and into the parent bank to sit alongside the treasury
activities. Midland, on the other hand, maintains both businesses in Midland
Montagu - though it has recently moved most of its corporate banking
business out of its investment banking subsidiary into the parent bank, in
part as a result of the effect on Midland Montagu's balance sheet of its
deteriorating loan book.
These activities are likely to be combined globally, either within a merged
parent or at one step removed, as at Midland Montagu.
The banks maintain between them a litter of different brand names,
reflecting their piecemeal move into investment banking and their failure to
integrate their respective businesses in this area - Midland Montagu, Samuel
Montagu and Greenwell on the Midland side, for instance, and James Capel and
Wardley on the Hongkong Bank side.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: Proposed deal fuels
speculation on further mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE deal goes through it will bring about the greatest change to the
structure of UK banking since the merger wave 25 years ago. But will it have
a knock-on effect, either by triggering further mergers, or by forcing the
banking industry to come to terms with a much strengthened competitor?
Midland's transformation from the perennial banking weakling to a member of
a muscular financial group would be bound to have an effect on other banks.
Midland would be able to lend more, and invest more heavily in improved
services. But the City expects Midland to proceed cautiously, particularly
with the UK banking market in its current ravaged state.
Mr Peter Toeman, banking analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he had not
downgraded his profit forecasts for the other clearing banks in light of the
proposed merger. If anything, he said, the prospect of the merger would put
even greater pressure on other banks to reduce their costs and expand their
profit margins.
Ironically, the merger could even reduce competitive pressures. Desperate as
it has been to regain its market position, Midland has been one of the most
aggressive banks recently, and has often been a leader on the price-cutting
front. It might not need to push so hard knowing that it had the Hongkong
Bank behind it.
As for the prospect of further mergers, banking stocks leapt ahead yesterday
on speculation about more bids. But these seem unlikely, at least among the
large clearers. The recent row over alleged overpricing and bully-boy
tactics by banks in the small business market, and constant rumbles of
discontent over their treatment of the private customer have not endeared
them to the fair trading authorities. Any proposed bank merger would be
guaranteed a monopolies referral.
Speculation about mergers is probably more apt for smaller banks, the
Trustee Savings Bank and the Abbey National.
Although the Midland-Hongkong deal has yet to obtain Bank of England
approval, the fact that it has even got this far reinforces the message that
UK clearing banks are available to overseas bidders. Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Governor of the Bank of England, has said he thinks
that 'core banks' should remain under British control. But his policy
statement is now five years old, and under the EC single market rules, he
could not stop an EC clearer buying a UK clearer purely on the grounds of
nationality.
News of the deal could provoke a counterbid, though analysts said yesterday
that it was hard to identify any banks that would have the means to top any
offer from the Hongkong.
Meanwhile, the Bank of England will want to ensure that any deal safeguards
Midland from 'contagion' from the Hongkong group should, for example, Hong
Kong undergo some China-related crisis.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank/Midland Bank: Local bank with
overseas growth ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Bank's proposed merger with Midland casts another shadow over the
Hong Kong unit's long term future at a time when the outlook for its other
overseas acquisitions has started to improve.
Despite the bank's international ambitions, it remains closely linked to
Hong Kong. Founded by merchants to finance trade on the South China Sea, the
bank still earns the bulk of its income from the colony, where it and its
Hang Seng Bank subsidiary control more than 30 per cent of the mortgage
market and benefit from guaranteed profitable spreads from the colony's
interest rate cartel.
Last week HSBC Holdings, the London holding company for the bank's worldwide
assets, announced a 83 per cent increase in profits after tax to HKDollars
5.66bn (Pounds 424m) for 1991. Most of the increase was due to lower losses
in its US and Australian operations, which added more than Dollars 2.2bn.
Although the bank does not disclose earnings from Hong Kong, analysts
suspect as much as Dollars 5bn of total group profits of Dollars 6.8bn
stemmed from the colony.
In the 1980s the bank used its strong Hong Kong earnings to finance
expansion into the industrialised world. It bought Marine Midland in the US
and started the Hongkong Bank of Australia. Partly because of unfortunate
timing, but mainly due to insufficient management, these overseas arms
performed disastrously in 1990 and 1991. Last year Marine Midland lost
Dollars 189.9m (Pounds 108m) despite two years of cost cutting and reduced
loan portfolios. More damaging still, Hongkong Bank was forced to pump in
Dollars 200m of extra capital to preserve Marine Midland's capital ratios in
1990.
Hongkong Bank's problems with its overseas ventures stemmed from the style
and structure of its management. Like many other Hong Kong companies, it
lacks depth in management and prefers a lean head office. Overseas
subsidiaries were initially given considerable autonomy.
The result was that when the overseas businesses ran into trouble with
recession and bad loans, the bank lacked the spare senior management
necessary. One indirect consequence was the calling off in December 1990 of
merger talks with Midland.
Analysts believe the worst is over. Mr John Mulcahy, director of research at
Peregrine Securities, estimates Marine Midland will return to profit this
year and make about Dollars 70m. Before the Midland announcement, he
estimated the whole Hongkong Bank group would make about HKDollars 9.4bn
pre-tax this year, an increase of 38 per cent.
Despite all its foreign troubles, the bank is still believed to hold about
HKDollars 20bn in inner reserves. These will probably be revealed in the
Midland offer document and could provide a crucial push to Hongkong Bank's
share price.
Although Hongkong Bank has had plenty of time to size up Midland, it has not
yet decided how it will manage it. The most difficult decision will be
whether to risk allowing Midland considerable autonomy, as with Marine
Midland.
But even if Hongkong Bank did want to take closer control, it lacks the
management. Mr William Purves, chairman, is to retire within the next two
years and Mr John Gray, chief executive, is 57 and likely to retire soon.
Finally, there is the question of culture clash. The momentum for the
initial link up was largely maintained due to the friendship between two
individuals, Mr Purves and Sir Kit McMahon, the former Midland chairman.
Otherwise, there is no evidence as yet that Midland will take kindly to
Hongkong Bank's essentially colonial view of the world.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Uncovered dividend retains its attraction: One of the more
contentious trends in the current company results season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision of George Wimpey, the UK construction group, to maintain its
final dividend without the earnings to pay for it, has confirmed one of the
more contentious trends of this results season.
T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, epitomised the dogged mood
of companies last week by holding its uncovered dividend, even though the
stock market was until recently braced for a cut.
Mr Colin Hope, its chairman and chief executive, said that to do other than
maintain 'would have been totally incorrect'. Shareholders deserved to be
rewarded for their loyalty.
In paying an uncovered dividend, T&amp;N was following in the footsteps of
several other engineering concerns - Glynwed, Rolls-Royce, GKN and BICC.
And yet before the results season started, the case for dividend cuts was
stronger than at any time in the past decade. Falling earnings had left
average cover at less than two, lower than in the last recession. Balance
sheets had been stretched, cash conservation was a priority and there was no
economic upturn to back up a message of confidence.
Companies could have cited exhortations to be prudent from many analysts and
commentators, not to mention the governor of the Bank of England. Even Mr
Paddy Linaker, chief executive of the M&amp;G fund management group, often
depicted as a hard-line advocate of dividend maintenance, had softened his
stance. In a recession that 'has been worse than most of us thought likely,
we are not suggesting that companies should irresponsibly maintain their
distribution'.
Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management, has said that
the long-term interests of shareholders are not served 'if maintaining the
dividend starves the company of important investment'.
But in spite of all the sympathetic noises, the market has with very few
exceptions applauded dividend maintenance and decried cuts.
On this basis, the decisions to maintain have been right, at least in the
short term, and individual companies have not been short of explanations.
First of all, as Mr Hope said, there is the obligation to shareholders. M&amp;G
is one of T&amp;N's shareholders and, in spite of the softer tone, its
fundamental line is that the importance of dividend income to investors is
'blindingly obvious'.
None of the companies mentioned has raised its dividend significantly since
the 1989 payment, so there has already been a real fall. To try investor
patience further would risk souring a possible source of funds for the
recovery.
A second important factor in the dividend equation is that the actual amount
paid is comparatively small.
Take GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services group: the total
bill of Pounds 51.8m is minuscule compared with turnover of Pounds 2.43bn.
The Pounds 14.9m knocked off reserves reduced shareholders' funds by less
than 2 per cent and is only a 10th of the amount transferred the other way
in the happy years of 1987-89.
Third and probably most important, the company needs to have the cash
available to make the payment.
At GKN, a cash inflow helped to reduce net debt by Pounds 45m to Pounds 175m
and gearing fell to a 15-year low of 26.4 per cent. Bulges in spending on
capital equipment and reorganisation were largely over. Those two items cost
GKN about Pounds 110m less last year than in 1990. In other words, it could
afford to pay.
T&amp;N had strengthened its position with the help of a rights issue (leaving
aside questions about paying shareholders with money raised from them, in a
tax-inefficient way). Wimpey had reduced debt by disposals.
While institutional wishes and affordability explain many of the one-off
decisions to maintain, there is also a longer-term theme that ought to
justify companies' actions. In the good years, the theory goes, dividends
need not be increased in line with earnings; in the bad years, they need not
track them into the abyss.
The yield then provides a nice support when the share price is hit by poor
results. All the companies in the chart have underperformed the market since
the October 1987 crash.
But it is on the point of ironing out the peaks and troughs that some of the
arguments begin to unravel. The chart shows the smoothing out process at
work in previous recessions. Cushions had been created through dividend
rises failing to keep pace with earnings.
But after 1982, dividends kept tracking earnings upwards, as well as
outstripping inflation. The failure of dividends to respond to the fall-off
in earnings since 1989 is pronounced.
With the market yielding more than the inflation rate and the gap between
its yield and that of gilt-edged stock historically narrow, the question is:
are dividends too high?
The answer is yes in some cases. Mr Myners, at GIM, says that some companies
have become locked into an excessive level of distribution and should reduce
the payment to a level from which it can grow.
An additional problem is that the absence of a recovery has made it
difficult for companies to point to prompt restoration of dividend cover.
Rolls-Royce was an exception in stating that the decision reflected the
company's confidence in its future, backed up by civil aero-engine orders.
And the background for resumed earnings growth may be less propitious than
after the last recession. Mr Nick Knight, at Nomura Securities, said: 'Post
ERM, companies will have less currency depreciation and less price inflation
to push up earnings,' while increases in interest rates could truncate
growth.
But whatever the rate of recovery, the fundamental ingredient in the
dividend equation - cash - could be in shorter supply on the way out of
recession.
Cuts in capital spending and work in progress have helped to fund uncovered
dividends, but working capital will come under strain as demand picks up.
With banks in cautious mood, companies' internal resources will become all
the more important.
This will put uncovered, or thinly-covered, dividends under pressure for
some time to come. Even if maintenance retains its hold, the date for
renewed dividend growth could be pushed back into 1994, or later.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Isosceles plans US, Ulster disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the Gateway food retail group formed through a Pounds 2bn
leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday said it would float Wellworth, its
Northern Ireland supermarket chain, on the stock market, and sell Herman's,
its US sporting goods chain, this year.
The two disposals would help prepare Isosceles for a stock market flotation
which would allow its shareholders to realise their investment.
Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, chief executive, said Isosceles would
concentrate on expanding the mainland UK food business, particularly two new
formats, Somerfield and Food Giant.
Analysts suggested that the announcement reflected the poor financial
position of Isosceles. Mr Mitchell-Innes said the next repayment of debt was
not until April 1993, when Pounds 100m was due, and Isosceles was 'not
desperate for cash'.
Isosceles, which has debt of around Pounds 1.3bn, had hoped to sell assets
earlier to pay down the debt. But recession and the slump in values of
retail businesses meant that disposals could not be made at sufficiently
high prices.
In 1990 Isosceles refinanced its debt to take account of its inability to
sell assets, notably Herman's. Last year, Mr David Smith, who masterminded
the buy-out, and Ms Elizabeth Hignell, the finance director, left Isosceles.
Herman's, which has been losing money, has been shown as an asset held for
disposal in Isosceles' accounts and its value was written down in the last
balance sheet to Pounds 194m. Mr Mitchell-Innes said although Herman's had
been for sale for some time, the group would now actively market it.
He said there were some signs of a pick-up in the US retail market but he
could not say whether Herman's would fetch its book value.
Wellworth is regarded as a successful business and made operating profits in
Isosceles' last financial year, to end April 1991, of Pounds 17.7m. Analysts
said it could be valued at up to Pounds 150m on a flotation, although
yesterday's announcement might flush out a trade buyer.
Advisers to the disposals are SG Warburg, the UK merchantbank, and
Wasserstein Perella, the US buy-out specialists. Wasserstein, originally a
rival bidder to Isosceles for Gateway, is now a 40 per cent shareholder in
Isosceles.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Hongkong Bank kept China informed about deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese authorities were kept abreast of the secret talks to merge
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank with Midland Bank.
These contacts emerged yesterday as authorities in the colony sought to play
down suggestions that Hongkong Bank was insuring itself against the
uncertainty surrounding the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, said in an interview that he had
kept the Chinese authorities informed. It was understood that the contact
had been at a high level, possibly through Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong
and Macao affairs in the Beijing government.
China, which assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in five years' time, is very
sensitive to developments affecting the territory's financial health and
business climate. There were fears in Hong Kong that the news could provoke
a Chinese verbal onslaught if Beijing saw the merger as a desertion of the
colony in the run-up to 1997.
The initial indications, however, were that China's communist government
would not seriously question the proposed deal. The Chinese embassy in
London, though it admitted yesterday it did not have up-to-date information
about the proposals, said the discussions between Hongkong Bank and Midland
were between two British banks.
Hongkong Bank performs some of the functions of a central bank in the colony
and its chairman sits on the governor's most important decision-making body,
the Executive Council.
In 1990, Hongkong Bank defused the impact of the decision to move the
domicile of its holding company to London by informing China's premier, Li
Peng, in advance. Beijing appeared to give tacit approval, and it has not
complained about foreign acquisitions by other big Hong Kong companies.
However, China is thought to be upset that some British companies, like
Jardine Matheson, have sought to distance themselves from Hong Kong before
1997. China believes these companies are threatening Hong Kong's stability
after enjoying the benefits of Britain's colonial rule for many years.
Mr Hamish MacLeod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, placed the merger
proposals in the context of Hongkong Bank's long-term strategy of
internationalisation. He said: 'Hongkong Bank will continue to play its
important role within Hong Kong's financial system.'

Sir, Dominic Lawson underestimates the incidence of the HIV virus ('Sex and

and 0.016 per cent is 1 in 6,250 (not 1 in 16,000). By Mr Lawson's maths the
more precision in the percentage the less the likelihood. A few more decimal
places would make the HlV virus a mere curiosity.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Security that money schemes cannot buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr V J CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Chappell ('Time to unmask a pensions charade', March 13)
correctly points out that money purchase pension schemes (of which personal
pensions are an expensive variant) can produce splendid pensions - but only
with luck. That is the fundamental weakness - the amount of pension depends
on the investment returns over decades (unforecastable) and on interest
rates at the very date of retirement (anybody's guess). Money purchase
schemes produce princes and paupers, but the individual cannot know which he
will be until he retires, by which time it will be too late to do anything
about it.
Final salary schemes have strengths and weaknesses. The latter can be
removed if the next government acts in the spirit of the social security
select committee's recent report. Those people fortunate enough to be
members of final salary schemes can plan their retirement knowing what at
least part of their retirement income will be in relation to prices at the
time, ie what it will be in 'real terms'. That is something money purchase
schemes cannot do.
Money purchase schemes have already been discredited once as the result of
inflation from the 1960s onwards. Does society have to learn that lesson all
over again?

FT  18 MAR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Foreign aid as vote winner - The UK general
election has put overseas development back on the agenda of all political
parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I was thinking,' I said to the lady in the Conservative party's research
department, 'of writing something about the different parties' policies on
overseas development - sort of, on the margin of the election campaign, as
it were . . .'
She bridled. 'I don't think it'll be on the margin. There's going to be
quite a substantial passage in our manifesto.'
This is interesting. Concern for the Third World, after all, is hardly a
central feature of the Conservatives' brand image. One of the first things
you learn, on opening the new Labour policy document on the subject1, is
that 'since 1979 the Conservatives have cut the aid budget by 17 per cent in
real terms - and by nearly half as a proportion of our national wealth, from
0.51 per cent to its present 0.27 per cent, its lowest ever on record'.
These figures do not seem to be disputed by the Conservative party but the
interesting thing is that it is not proud of them. What the party's research
department wishes you to know is that 'Britain's aid programme is the
sixth-largest among western donors - and growing2'. Both parties assume, in
other words, that British voters, unlike their American cousins, like the
idea of their money being spent on foreign aid.
I need hardly tell you that the same assumption is made by the Liberal
Democrats. Like Labour, they propose 'an increase in UK official development
assistance to 0.7 per cent over five years' (a target set by the UN, which
the government 'accepts in principle' although 'like its predecessors, it
has no set timetable to achieve it'3). But the Lib Dems go further,
recommending a further increase to 1 per cent over the succeeding five years
(something stated by Labour as an 'aim' in 1987, but now dropped).
The Green party takes the same position, while the Scottish National party,
belying national stereotypes, is even more generous with the money of
putative Scottish taxpayers: 'Scotland will accept as an immediate target
for the aid budget the UN figure of 0.7 per cent of gross national product,
but would aim at 1 per cent of GNP by the fifth year after independence.'
Plaid Cymru, more prudently, confines itself to the statement: 'It is only
when this minimum target (0.7 per cent of GNP) is achieved that we can show
our real commitment to genuine development'4.
These figures are inevitably quoted, because they are the simplest
quantitative indicator of how much importance a country (or a party)
attaches to overseas development. But all parties are quick to point out
that such a crude total means little by itself.
Aid nowadays is judged by its 'quality' as much as its quantity, and there
are various ways that quality can be assessed. Does the aid reach the people
who need it most, and does it address their 'basic needs'? Does it help to
promote human rights, democracy or, more broadly, 'good government'? Does it
promote development that is 'sustainable', in the sense of not wrecking the
environment or consuming irreplaceable resources? Does it help people to
become self-supporting, rather than turn them into permanent basket-cases?
All those objectives are accepted by all parties as desirable, but they do
not necessarily all point in the same direction. Giving priority to the
poorest countries does not automatically benefit the poorest people, and
targeting the poorest people will not always be the most effective way of
stimulating development.
'Good government' may indeed be good for development, but bad government is
often at least as much an effect as a cause of under-development, so that to
withhold development aid from a country which has a bad government may
simply help to perpetuate the vicious circle. It is often very difficult to
know whether the potential benefit of a given project or programme outweighs
the harm it may do by strengthening an oppressive government, or not. Such
decisions need to be based on expert knowledge and detailed information,
which implies a relatively large staff, possibly absorbing too large a share
of the total aid programme.
The present government has put 'good government' at the top of its list of
priorities, while in the Labour document 'democracy and development' come
second, after 'putting the poor first'. In the words of Mr Ed Mayo, head of
campaigns at the World Development Movement, a cross-party pressure group:
'Although both parties do paint these two issues into their policy strategy,
with their own emphases, the contrast is still strong enough for one to
caricature what is on offer to voters as a choice between less poverty
(Labour) and less tyranny (Conservative).'
Labour perhaps strains credulity by promising to put 'development at the
heart of government', but backs it up with a pledge to create a department
of state, the Department of International Development, to be headed by a
cabinet minister. The idea is to give development interests a direct voice
in the cabinet, and help them to resist the distorting pressures of the
Treasury, the Foreign Office (to which the present Overseas Development
Administration is subordinate) and the Department of Trade and Industry.
It has to be said, however, that the record of previous Labour governments
is not encouraging. In 1964 and 1974 the development minister started off
with cabinet status, only to lose it within three years as public spending
came under heavier pressure. Moreover, while Labour is critical of the
Conservatives for using the 'Aid-Trade Provision' to support British
companies competing for contracts overseas, 'with virtually no meaningful
attempt to impose development criteria', it no longer promises, as in 1987,
to replace this provision with a Trade and Development Fund outside the aid
budget. Instead, it merely says the option of transferring responsibility
for it to the DTI 'will be considered'.
Labour agrees with the Conservatives that 'trade has a bigger impact on
developing countries than aid ever could or should have'. Yet it still
leaves discussion of trade issues till last. Indeed the Tories themselves
persist in using 'overseas aid' as the overall heading for their development
policies.
The arrangement of the Liberal Democrat green paper is more logical,
starting with a discussion of the notion of sustainable development;
discussing in more detail the environmental dimension, the people dimension
(population, education, health, refugees) and development strategies; then a
long section on trade policies and a shorter one on debt before it gets
round to aid.
No party seems to dissent from the view, expressed by the prime minister at
the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Harare last October, that
'there is little point in the developed countries providing aid for economic
development if the developed countries then deny access to our markets for
those very same countries'. The trouble is that, for all too many products,
that is precisely what the developed countries do.
The European Community is one of the worst offenders, and the chances that a
Labour government will succeed in changing that, whatever the outcome of the
Uruguay Round, seem fairly slim.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Deliberate use of consensus system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT WANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I commend your editorial 'Overkill in Japan' (March 12) on the risks to
the global financial community posed by Japan's mounting financial problems.
Yours is one of the few publications to treat the issue with the gravity it
deserves.
Yet I beg to differ with your analysis of the consequences of the recent
scandals, which instead of threatening Japan's consensus system may be its
salvation.
In fact, these scandals may have been the product of a deliberate decision
of the 'consensus system' to vitiate the obligations of the securities
houses to pay loss guarantees and to fulfil other questionable promises that
they could not satisfy in a free-falling market. By deliberately provoking a
public controversy, the consensus system could relieve the brokerages of
financial obligations they could not meet and, thereby, avoid disaster.
The lawsuits filed by some of the investment funds suggest that the
brokerages may have miscalculated the effectiveness of this ploy.
Nevertheless, these kinds of dispute may be merely signs of self-correction,
to be resolved through the consensus mechanism.
I hope your prognostications come true. Reform of Japan's finance is
critical not only to Japan, but also the world. The scandals of 1991-92,
which would have sent a western financial system to its knees, in the
Japanese context appear only to be a conscious venting of the economic steam
engine, while the train roars onward.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: Lessons about property costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN FORDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Jack's letter (March 10) on the unlevel playing field between
domestic and business property costs such as rent levels does not draw the
most important lessons. Business will always drive out residential use. Only
planning procedures can prevent this. In central Paris, free residential
rents are half office rent levels.
There is, too, the vital need for a vigorous free domestic rental sector
which British governments have refused to recognise for decades. The
Englishman's obsession with ownership of his castle is not shared by other
countries' citizens. Renting is often the cheaper option, and promotes
labour mobility.
Mortgage tax relief is an iniquitous favour to the non-poor, and should be
abolished. Subsidies to the poor should be per family, not designated to a
particular dwelling.
If we want to alter the power balance for property use allocation between
business and residential, by all means tax business via VAT on all outgoings
for property, plus payroll while we're at it, provided that - very important
 -tax on profits is reduced. This would be a leveraged incentive to managers
to perform better. Martin Forde,

FT  18 MAR 92 / Tightening the noose: The offensives by Burma's military
government against ethnic minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE BOLDERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RANGOON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
On Burma's western border, Moslem refugees fleeing persecution are streaming
into Bangladesh at the rate of 5,000 a day. On the eastern border, Thai
forces are on alert and another refugee exodus is feared. In Rangoon, the
capital, one of the world's most authoritarian regimes is relentlessly
tightening its hold on power.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, prime minister of Bangladesh, is this week visiting the US
to ask President George Bush and the United Nations Security Council to
intervene in the refugee crisis.
At least 200,000 Moslems, known as Rohingyas, from Burma's western Arakan
state, are living in makeshift camps in Bangladesh. They have fled the
Burmese army which, according to their detailed and consistent accounts, has
unleashed a terrifying campaign of rape, torture, killing and forced
evictions to make them leave.
Close to the border with Thailand, Burmese forces are engaged in another
fierce offensive against ethnic minorities, as Karen rebels, who have been
joined by other opposition groups, grimly defend their base at Manerplaw.
Thai fighter pilots have been ordered to attack Burmese aircraft which enter
Thailand's air space in pursuit of the rebels, and at the weekend Thai
artillery opened fire on Burmese troops which had crossed the border to
attack the Karen base from the rear.
The attacks on ethnic minorities are part of a drive by Burma's ruling State
Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) to establish its grip on all walks
of life. The military junta took power in 1988 as pro-democracy
demonstrations were sweeping the country. It held elections in 1990, but has
ignored their result. It has kept the 1991 Nobel peace prize winner, Aung
San Suu Kyi - leader of the opposition party which won a landslide victory
in the poll - under house arrest since July 1989.
To try to squash numerous ethnic rebellions on the borders, the military is
undergoing a rapid expansion. When the Slorc came to power in 1988 the
military was about 180,000-strong. Now it is believed to have more than
250,000 men and that the number will double to some 500,000 by the end of
the century.
The intention, Burma-watchers say, is to enmesh the army so deeply in the
bureaucracy and state institutions that it can never be removed, even if it
does one day allow civilians some measure of participation in the political
process.
Burmese people offer little comment on what the government is doing against
the Moslems and Karens. For them the campaigns are just another example of
the extremes to which the army is prepared to go to establish total control
over the whole of the country.
The military government in Rangoon denies allegations of ill-treatment of
Moslems and, through the tightly controlled media, accuses foreign news
organisations of attacking the country with 'fabricated reports'. It says
the Rohingyas are not one of Burma's native ethnic groups, and that the
refugees are illegal immigrants or ignorant locals who have been lured away
by Rohingya 'terrorists'.
Foreign residents in Rangoon say that a big immigration check has been under
way in Arakan state and that the military has been expanding its barracks
and roads in the area. They say the government has been concerned that
members of the Karen ethnic group, which is fighting for its own homeland in
south-eastern Burma, have been trying to infiltrate western parts of the
country. They fear the possibility of the Karens giving support to
separatists there.
On the streets of Burma's slowly decaying cities, few soldiers are visible -
an indication, says a foreigner in Rangoon, 'of just how confident they (the
military) are'. There are, however, said to be soldiers hidden in many
buildings and stationed on the outskirts of the bigger cities, where they
can be quickly called on if needed. There are thousands of military
informers scattered throughout the population and even the most innocent of
conversations is reported. 'The government controls everything,' says the
young driver of a pedal taxi.
Nearly two years after the election, the Slorc shows no intention of giving
up power. 'Political activity is on hold,' says one diplomat. 'They've got
the place very, very tightly sewn up.'
Of more than 200 political parties which registered for the May 1990
election, just 32 remain. All are monitored by the authorities; none is
allowed to organise, or even discuss, anti-government activity. Universities
are closed and university teachers have been sent on political re-education
courses. Many former pro-democracy politicians and student activists have
fled the country, and many others are in prison.
Amnesty International has identified 1,500 political prisoners by name, and
the US State Department has estimated the full number to be about 2,000.
Reports of torture and ill-treatment are common.
The government, aware that it is not popular at home, sometimes explains
through the newspapers or giant red billboards in the streets that life will
get easier as stability returns. The army 'will never betray the national
cause', one such board reads.
It is also aware that it is vulnerable to growing economic discontent, and
is seeking to do something about the chaotic economy. Sources in Rangoon say
it has drawn up a four-year economic plan. The main aims are to revive
exports, increase agricultural productivity and boost efficiency of state
enterprises. Shortages of inputs such as fertiliser and electricity will
make that difficult.
The Slorc is believed to want to encourage joint ventures with foreign
companies. However, Burma's poor international standing and the publicity
attracted by persecution of ethnic minorities may make this increasingly
difficult.
The Slorc ended 26 years of the 'Burmese road to socialism' when it took
power, and announced that there would be an open economy. A foreign
investment law was passed, prompting a flurry of activity. Thai companies
are involved in logging Burma's forests; Singapore, Japan and South Korea
have significant involvement in the country; PepsiCo of the US set up a
bottling plant, while Amoco and Unocal of the US, BHP of Australia, Japan's
Idemitsu and Shell are among 10 foreign oil companies which signed contracts
to work in Burma. However, repatriation of profits requires cabinet
approval, bureaucracy is a nightmare and corruption is endemic.
Foreign trade has increased substantially, though much of what is available
on the streets is the result of rampant smuggling. Not long ago it was
impossible to buy a light bulb or a tube of toothpaste, but today shops are
full of Chinese, Japanese and western-made goods. Almost anything can be
bought at Rangoon's night markets, and foreign films are popular.
Some Burmese have done well out of the new economic openness. 'They are very
rich but we don't know where they get it from,' says a young restaurant
worker who, like most people, is struggling to make a living. Inflation is
high - rice prices rose by more than 60 per cent last year - and there is a
shortage of petrol at the government pumps while on the black market the
price per gallon is six times higher. As a result, transport is scarce.
Economic sanctions by foreign countries, say Burmese dissidents living in
exile, may be the only way to bring the Slorc down. But though the US and
European countries have taken measures to isolate Burma, a full-scale
embargo seems a long way away. Telling pressure could be exerted by
south-east Asian neighbours. Most have made individual protests, but they
have refused to take a united stand. In the absence of strong external
pressure and with domestic opposition kept in check, the Slorc seems set to
continue its repression.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Leading Article: From here to Hongkong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-BORDER bank mergers are notoriously difficult to pull off. Indeed, the
recent histories of both Midland Bank and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation offer a perfect illustration of the hazards and pitfalls.
Midland's disastrous acquisition of Crocker in California in the early 1980s
provided business schools across the world with a classic case study in how
not to conduct an overseas acquisition. Hongkong and Shanghai's losses at
Marine Midland in New York state were on a smaller scale than Midland's but
point to the same question. Would a takeover of Midland by the British-based
parent of the Hong Kong bank have any remote chance of success?
In all bank mergers there are regulatory obstacles to be overcome at the
outset and in the present case they are compounded because of the
sensitivities of the People's Republic of China before the formal hand-over
of power in Hong Kong in 1997. But it would be surprising if the Bank of
England attempted to block the proposal, as it did with the Hong Kong bank's
bid for Royal Bank of Scotland in 1981.
In the earlier case, the Bank of England was piqued that the Hong Kong
bankers had attempted a bid for a British clearing bank without its fiat.
Its officials claimed before the Monopolies Commission that the transfer of
control overseas of a significant part of the British clearing bank system
would be detrimental to the public interest because of an inherent conflict
of interest. The Hong Kong bank's primary loyalty was, they suggested, to
the people and territory of Hong Kong.
Thin argument
The argument looked thin at the time; and while the approach of 1997 may
lend it more force, it is hard to believe that adequate arrangements to
protect Midland's depositors from financial crises in Hong Kong could not be
made. More to the point, the Hong Kong bank is an exceptionally well
capitalised institution. It is doing the Bank of England a favour by
offering a solution to the weakest link in the British clearing bank chain.
The Bank of England conceded in its evidence to the Monopolies Commission a
decade ago that cases might arise where 'a United Kingdom bank might be so
clearly in need of fresh blood and impetus that a bid from outside would on
balance be preferable to the status quo'. That is manifestly the case with
Midland. It would be absurd for the Bank of England, weighed down as it is
by the general consequences of lax monetary control and more specific
questions over prudential supervision at BCCI and elsewhere, to suggest
otherwise.
Competition policy
There are no problems here for competition policy. By bringing its strong
balance sheet backing to Midland, Hongkong and Shanghai will, if anything,
intensify competition in British banking. No doubt some bankers will argue
that this is unfortunate, in that Britain is overbanked. But the case is
scarcely persuasive when the immediate threat to the economy is that capital
constraints in banking could hold back credit growth, thereby threatening
recovery.
The really difficult question here is for the shareholders in the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The bank's greatest merit has been to be
in the right place at the right time to play host to some of China's most
dynamic entrepreneurs as they fled from communist China. That is how it came
to be transformed from a sleepy provider of trade credit to the Asian
economy to a regional banking giant. Its attempt to move to global status,
meantime, has met with singularly mixed fortunes.
It would be hard to argue with the timing of the bid. Many of Midland's
skeletons have been cleared out and the profits stand to benefit
disproportionately, relative to the other clearing banks, from recovery. Yet
the move into Midland means that the Hongkong and Shanghai shareholders'
stake in one of the world's most dynamic economies could be significantly
diluted. Admittedly the China factor muddies the argument. But why not, in
view of the unhappy experience of past acquisitions, leave it to
shareholders to take out their own insurance?

FT  18 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Education by opt out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative education manifesto contains measures to promote parental
choice and schemes to suppress local democratic control. Selection,
managerial autonomy and state-funded places in private schools will be - or
stay - in. But the local education authority will disappear in its current
form, as all schools are encouraged to opt out of local authority control -
including primary schools, which are to be allowed to opt out in groups.
It is an unwholesome combination. If implemented, it could inflict severe
harm on the education system.
The plight of Stratford School, east London, ought to have put paid to the
policy of opting out. Stratford, a grant-maintained secondary school with a
substantial Asian intake, gained independence from its local education
authority last year. Its governors, a majority of whom are claimed as
supporters by the London Collective of Black Governors, are currently
attempting to dismiss the head teacher. The school is in turmoil;
accusations of racism and intimidation abound; the case is in the courts;
and the only recourse is to Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, who has
so far had to intervene three times in the governing body's deliberations.
Ultimate control
The moral is clear: if local education authorities wither through the
Conservative distrust of local government, they will have to be recreated.
It is not an issue of day-to-day intervention, but of ultimate control and
funding. Mr Clarke could not conceivably act as the court of appeal for
25,000 schools; nor could the education department itself monitor and
allocate funds to so many institutions. If many more schools opt out, it
will need regional councils for the purpose. We will end up with education
quangos akin to the regional health authorities.
Such centralisation by the back door will affect more than the health of
local democracy: it could lead to the widespread return of selection for
entry to secondary schools. For Mr Clarke has indicated that he will treat
sympathetically applications by grant-maintained schools to reintroduce
formal entry tests. At present, a mere 159 grammar schools survive in
England; they could soon be reappearing across the country by a haphazard
process of governor initiatives. And where grammar schools appear, secondary
moderns must inevitably follow for their rejects.
Prepared experiments
This is no way to proceed. The comprehensive school is not universally
admired; there is a good case for allowing schools to specialise and provide
for particular needs. But it should be argued nationally, with carefully
prepared experiments to test options. Elected local authorities could play a
part in this. Reform should not be the result of random selection by school
governors, with no democratic check other than the sanction of a remote
minister in London.
Opting out is not to be confused with autonomy: under the local management
of schools initiative, supported by both opposition parties, institutions
are rapidly gaining freedom to manage their own budgets, appoint their own
staff and organise their own priorities, within the context of the national
curriculum and entry policies determined for them.
This is as it should be. It has an important side-effect: in tandem with
other policies - like the national curriculum and reforms to teacher
training - it is helping to blur the division between the state and
independent sectors. State schools are gaining much of the self-control -
and with it the self-respect - that independent schools rightly value, while
the private sector is coming increasingly to share a single curriculum,
professional and regulatory structure.
The dialogue between the two sectors needs strengthening. That, perhaps, is
the strongest reason for continuing the Conservatives'assisted places
scheme, which pays all or part of the fees of more than 30,000 children
attending private schools. It is not a question of privilege, but of
extending choice and quality - and facilitating the process of mutual
learning between the two sectors without which both will be impoverished.

If, like me, you find the incidence of kissing, expectoration, and feigned
injury in soccer too much to take, you are going to have to hunt around for
something to watch tonight since BBC1 devotes two hours to Liverpool In
Europe (7.00, they play Genoa) and ITV spends equal time on The European
Match (Spurs v. Feyenoord 8.00). And if, like most of us, you have also had
enough of party political bickering to last you a lifetime, matters will be
even more problematical.
Perhaps you enjoy programmes about racism; judging from their frequency the
broadcasters think we do. Trouble Behind (8.05 BBC2) visits Corbin in
America's Deep South 'to expose and confront the racism that exists even
today'. Vying with racism as the broadcasters' pet topic is New Age
airy-fairyism. QED also takes a trip to the US to report on 'a miracle
cure-all wonder drug', a herbal elixir promoted by a Swiss gentleman from a
caravan in the Arizona desert. Thank goodness the BBC has the funds for
these vital investigations.
If you want to laugh even harder, tonight's funniest programme will be a
repeat of Drop The Dead Donkey (11.00), C4's excellent comedy about a
television newsroom.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Young composers - Barbican Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC's 'Young Musician of the Year' competition has been running for a
long time now, but this year Lloyds Bank has been inspired to extend its
sponsorship to a 'Young Composer Award' as well. Splendid idea; but not,
this first time, ideally well handled by the BBC, for the three-and-a-half
hours it took.
On Monday we heard pieces by the 12 composer-finalists, interspersed with
mostly dim performances of irrelevant music by former Young Musicians of
their Years, and with laborious relocations of music-stands and microphones,
chummy commentary by a female compere and much intrusive noise from the BBC
crew - rumbling mobile cameras, audible instructions from their earphones,
bangs and crashes from the booths at the back of the stalls.
Much more serious, for a competition that wears a public face, was that we
never knew when we were hearing the vital evidence. Each contestant among
the original 69 (their ages ranged from 15 to 21, and all the finalists were
male) had submitted a 'portfolio' of four pieces, as varied as possible -
with express encouragement to venture into popular territory, though nothing
we heard suggested any such ambition. For performance in this concert,
however, only works playable by the faithful Nash Ensemble or by soloists
could be exhibited; and yet we were told repeatedly that the jury would take
equal account of the unheard pieces too. Quite right: but where does that
leave the live audience?
It was made clear that two or more of the composers had dressed up earlier
'exercises' as small-ensemble pieces. Presumably they took bolder flights in
their full-orchestra stuff, or perhaps in soloistic flights that would
require rehearsal-time beyond the budget - but we were not to know that. The
eventual joint winners were the 18-year-old James Webb, a Charterhouse
chorister whose processional carol 'Huic Magi' testified to a sensuous
modern ear for twining chapel voices, and Philip Howard (15) with a slight
but elegantly shaped flute-and-piano piece, and a colouristic,
under-propelled study called The Rains.
We were not to know how much of Halli Cauthery's range was contained in his
three icy, unappetising songs on homicidal Icelandic poems (delivered by
Peter Hall with faultless commitment), nor whether Craig Grosvenor's coolly
serial guitar-piece Noir or Elliott Tucker's bright but disjointed
Aladinsane - title after David Bowie - represented their best work. Richard
Whalley's Phoenix, striving innocently to match an empurpled DH Lawrence
exhortation, might or might not have been his best effort.
At the very least, the candidates next time should be told firmly that a
Nash-sized piece will have to be their public exhibit if they make the
finals - with a bigger piece on tap for a later BBC concert, should they
win. The Leeds piano competition is not a good comparison: there too the
semi-finals (and more) are taken into account, but aficionados can hear
them, whereas the essential workings of this 'Young Composer' contest were
reserved to the private ears and eyes of the jury. There must be better ways
of arranging it.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: Into a world of 'voter meters' and 'media monitoring'
 -Television / Election overkill is enough to drive us all to satellite
dishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Predicting the outcome of the election campaign is a doddle:
1. Broadcasters will spend more money, time, resources, and manpower than on
any previous election.
2. When Parliamentary candidates ask people on their doorsteps 'Do you have
any complaints?' the commonest response will be 'Yes, too much election on
television'. (This is not a joke; ask people who do a lot of doorstepping
and they will tell you.)
3. The outcome of the poll (no doubt there will be a post election survey
this time as there was in 1987) will be that be tween 70 and 80 per cent of
voters will say there has been far too much coverage.
4. Whatever politicians and broadcasters may claim, points 1, 2 and 3 will
apply again at the next election.
It seems absurd that while everyone recognises that television nowadays
delivers far too much on elections, nobody does a thing about it. However,
the reasons are surely pretty clear. First, politicians and news journalists
(actually news and current affairs journalists) have much in common: they
are fascinated by politics, revel in the campaign, and love the sound of
their own voices. The overkill is a sort of conspiracy between them and
against the public.
Secondly, the campaign gives broadcasters a wonderful opportunity to test
all their latest technology, from 'bi-media work stations' (the BBC's new
Westminster news room is fully 'bi-media', meaning that each journalist can
work for both television and radio) to mobile satellite links. The only
other event which allows a test as wide and as rigorous is a proper shooting
war, and those do not occur often enough.
Thirdly, once any major news event is under way, many broadcasters spend
nine-tenths of their time thinking about the opposition and only one tenth
thinking about the viewer: 'Who's covering the breakfast conference for
ITN?' and 'How is the BBC organising its exit poll?' become far more
important than 'Won't Auntie Ethel already be bored to tears?' Moreover, so
much attention is devoted to the pressing problems of the nearby trees -
resisting pressure from the party machines, and ensuring fair representation
of the parties - that the wood disappears from view. Speak to individual
broadcasters and they will concede all this, yet, unsurprisingly, not one of
them will go on to say 'So I'm volunteering for my programme to stay out of
the election scramble'.
One other prediction is less of a certainty but should still be made: 'media
monitoring' (analysing the coverage rather than the politics) is already a
major growth area. So much so that before long somebody will surely begin to
do a regular survey of media monitoring, whereupon the wheels within the
wheels will become so complicated that our heads will start to spin. Outside
the walls of university sociology departments, media monitoring first began
to appear in the late 1960s, used by journalists as a sort of defence
mechanism against the image builders employed by political parties and
leaders. The seminal work was Joe McGinniss's The Selling Of The President
which, in 1969, described the way in which television was used to 'sell'
Richard Nixon to the Americans.
Today's political salesmen are called 'spin doctors' and an increasing
amount of air time is devoted to examining their efforts. Previously this
was included in more laid-back series such as Newsnight and Channel 4's late
lamented After Dark, but now we are beginning to get programmes which do
nothing else. The Vote Race on BBC1 on Sunday nights for the next three
weeks promises to investigate 'the hidden strategies of the campaign
managers'. In this week's opening programme we saw a panel using 'voter
meters' to indicate, phrase by phrase, viewers' responses to a politician's
speech.
You might have thought that, for the sake of the public, it would be better
if the broadcasters told the parties and all their sorcerers that henceforth
they would behave like independent journalists, serving the best interests
of the public, choosing the news for themselves, not operating even vaguely
hand-in-glove with the politicians to achieve stopwatch parity between the
parties, and that any attempt at 'spin' would be routinely revealed if it
merited revelation, wherever it might be found.
That said, the most interesting item so far is a programme that did not
appear: the edition of Panorama in which Peter Jay was due to consider the
origins of the recession. Predictably enough, Samir Shah, head of current
affairs at BBC television, was accused on Biteback, BBC1's inadequate
monthly 'feedback' programme, of running scared and surrendering to
Government pressure. Yet those who have read the transcripts of the
programme published in several of the Sunday papers (edited transcripts, and
not identical, but several thousand words long, enough to convey a fair
idea) may have reached other conclusions.
Of course a printed transcript is not the same as a television programme
which would incorporate talking heads, graphics, and 'wallpaper' scenery.
But even allowing for that, this appeared to be a classic result of belief
in the Birt-Jay thesis, an argument developed in the late 1970s by John Birt
and Peter Jay when they worked on ITV's Weekend World. Broadly they said
there was a bias against understanding in television journalism because news
and current affairs programmes concentrated on the 'what' at the expense of
the 'why'. They wanted more analysis.
Today John Birt is the BBC's Director-General in waiting and Peter Jay is
the corporation's Economics Editor, so it is hardly surprising to find the
attitude of that thesis applied to Panorama when Jay is exploring the
reasons for the recession: it is an archetypal Birt-Jay thesis subject. But
if I were in charge of BBC current affairs and read that script prior to
transmission I would be struck first by the seemingly historical nature of
the piece, which was commissioned for the BBC's flagship current (not
ancient) affairs programme; and then I would have a vivid vision of viewers
in their hundreds of thousands zapping away to find something more
congenial. Television should certainly do such analytical pieces, but
Panorama may not be the best place for them.
There is one more prediction that seems a sure bet: one effect of the
election overkill will be to increase even further the amount of time
devoted to watching World Cup cricket on Sky Sports. Since most of this is
transmitted in the early hours of the morning, the drill, assuming you have
a video recorder, is to load a four-hour cassette on long-play and tape the
entire match. Then, when the terrestrial broadcasters offer you politicians,
politicians, politicians or politicians of an evening, you settle back to
watch the cricket. Furthermore with this system you can zap out the
pestiferous commercials which they insert at the end of virtually every
over.
Aside from the cricket, there is still a vast amount of dross coming off the
Astra satellite. Flicking through the channels on several evenings last week
I came across long promotional sequences for anti-wrinkle cream and a sponge
rubber painting system which I have seen so many times before that I can
practically recite the lines with the presenters. There was speedway on ice
and American all-in wrestling, too, and every night two entire channels are
devoted exclusively to rock videos. But some viewers will regard that as a
big attraction. It is precisely the fact that you can always watch the news,
or sport, or rock videos whenever you want to that is the system's greatest
advantage.
In a period when you are going to be able to watch politicians on all
terrestrial channels at all times, whether or not you want to, a dish
suddenly seems a far more attractive proposition.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Jobs: How Europe's bosses fare for company cars - Survey
shows UK third to Ireland and Portugal in league for four-wheeled perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Daniel Goeudevert happens to be reading today, the Jobs column hopes
he'll realise it has nothing personal against him. Even more so, it hopes he
will accept that it has no bias in favour of Ferdinand Piech. The survey
whose findings are about to be reported was made independently by a highly
reputed organisation: the management consultancy arm of the worldwide Wyatt
company.
Before describing the findings, however, I'd better tell anyone else who may
be reading the reasons for all the above pussy-footing. They are threefold.
The Volkswagen group's management-board chairman Carl Hahn is due to retire,
and the two gentlemen aforementioned are believed to be running
wheel-to-wheel for the succession, which is expected to be decided on April
10.
The part of the group currently headed by Daniel Goeudevert is the VW
marque, whereas Ferdinand Piech is responsible for Audi.
The survey in question focuses on the provision of company cars in 17
countries in Europe. It shows that Audi's 100 series of models continues to
lead the European popularity league for management chariots - as it has done
since at least 1988 - with the VW marque relatively nowhere.
Even so, let's leave leadership contests aside for the moment and consider
the survey, which Wyatt carries out every two years from its office in
Brussels. The 1991-92 version is based on data from some 1,700 employers.
The biggest national sample was Belgium's 277, and the smallest Finland's
53, the United Kingdom having 147.
To anyone like the Jobs column - who having no company car, has only an
onlooker's interest in same - the information in the study seems almost
stupefyingly detailed. It includes, for instance, the pro-portions of
companies in each land providing different sorts of staff with a variety of
optional extras (given Britain's weather, its employers appear unduly
generous if not lavish with sunroofs).
But readers curious about such refinements will need to obtain the full
report, priced Pounds 510, from Don McClune of Wyatt UK at 21 Tothill St,
London SW1H 9LL; telephone 071-222 8033, fax 071-222 9182. My extracts are
far more limited, the first being the table alongside.
It shows the percentages of chief executives, various types of other
directors, and two kinds of middle managers who enjoy a company car in each
of the 17 countries. The ranking is based on the average provision across
the whole lot, and by that measure the UK has fallen to third place from top
in 1989-90.
Whether its overall leadership will be restored by the latest budget in
combination with the result of the impending election, we can only wait and
see. But despite the increased taxation of recent years, Britain remains
well ahead in one category. It is shown in the last column of the table: the
award of four-wheeled perks to middle managers other than those in sales and
marketing where a car is far more often a necessity of the job.
Unlike the table's figures, the popularity ranking of types of car does not
appear in the survey. I compile it from the companies' listings of their
preferred models, giving four points to the type most often named, two to
the second most frequent, and one to the third. Where each type stands in
the league depends on the percentage of the total points it scores.
In doing so, however, I take no account of detailed variants. My focus is
solely on series such as Audi 100s, all of which are lumped together
regardless of variances in engine, plushiness of trimmings and the like. In
all, 50 series were mentioned in the latest survey compared with 61 two
years before.
To start at the top, the five most popular chief executives' cars were:
 -----------------------------------
Make &amp; series of car   % of points
 -----------------------------------
BMW 5                      19.3
Audi 100                   15.1
Volvo 700                   8.4
Mercedes 200                7.5
Saab 9000                   7.5
 -----------------------------------
Moving down a notch to other directors, we find the top five were:
 -----------------------------------
Audi 100                   12.5
Ford Scorpio/Granada       10.4
BMW 5                       8.5
Renault 25                  7.8
Opel Omega                  7.5
 -----------------------------------
The middle managers' list was:
 -----------------------------------
Peugeot 405                 9.2
Audi 100                    8.0
Ford Sierra                 8.0
Renault 21                  7.1
Opel Vectra                 6.7
 -----------------------------------
(Opel Omegas and Vectras are equivalent to Vauxhall Carltons and Cavaliers.)
For all management levels taken together, the top 10 were:
 -----------------------------------
Audi 100                   11.9
Ford Scorpio/Granada        9.3
BMW 5                       8.2
Renault 25                  6.8
Opel Omega                  6.2
Volvo 700                   5.3
Mercedes 200                4.5
Peugeot 405                 4.1
Renault 21                  3.4
Ford Sierra                 3.2
 -----------------------------------
Alas for Daniel Goeudevert, Volkswagen's best series was the Passat, ranked
28th with 0.7 per cent of the available points.

Is Siemens going 'transnational'? Germany's electronics and electrical
engineering giant has created quite a stir among organisation experts by
deciding to locate the headquarters of its air traffic management (ATM)
business in Britain, instead of its home country.
On the face of it, the move might seem to place Siemens for the first time
in the company of organisational pioneers such as ABB, IBM and Unilever.
These have become transnationals (as distinct from mere multinationals) by
transferring the base of at least one international product division away
from their home base (or, in Unilever's case, its twin bases).
But how big a break from Siemens' past practice really is the ATM decision?
Unlike IBM, Siemens has not yet transferred the HQs of any of its global
business groups outside its home base; it has 13 such entities, almost
double IBM's number. What is less well-known is that at least six of the
many business units beneath those groups in its structure have been
dispersed abroad, mainly following acquisitions there.
So in one sense the ATM decision is merely the latest in a growing list:
Siemens talks openly of its intention to shift units' HQs to wherever the
market or technology is most advanced (or demanding), and to the company's
most obvious centre of competence.
This was clearly the case for Siemens with ATM. The 'new' HQ location,
Chessington in Surrey, was the existing home of Plessey Radar. Siemens
bought it as part of its 1989 carve-up of Plessey with GEC, and it accounts
for about 80 per cent of the ATM unit's revenues of about Pounds 100m. But
in several senses the move is an important one. Siemens' ATM is the fastest
growing unit within the group's defence electronics business group.
It also now includes German-based research, development and manufacturing
operations which have been specially carved out of three other parts of
Siemens.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Management: How to make friends with Lady Luck - Chance
plays only a small role on the road to success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN-LOUIS BARSOUX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When asked the secret of success in their companies, managers often say that
luck is as important as anything.
It is not just an excuse offered by those passed by in the promotion stakes.
Even those in executive suites often concede to having been in the right
place at the right time.
The problem with the concept of luck as an explanation for success is that
it is too vague to be of practical use. Luck becomes a catch-all for
everything we do not understand about the managerial advancement process.
When pushed to explain how luck has impinged on their careers, successful
executives point to two factors: recognising it and acting on it. Luck is
seen as something that happens to all of us from time to time, but the
people who move on are those who can spot the openings and exploit them.
This assumes that managers can only influence luck from the time it
manifests itself. But can't you make preparations in advance to grasp it?
Whether consciously or not, successful managers have ways of thinking and
behaving which leave them prone to the intervention of luck.
Managers can increase their exposure to luck in a variety of ways. In
practical terms, they can establish networks which will help to keep them
informed of career threats and opportunities; and by reading the trade
press, and visiting customers and suppliers, they can keep abreast of what
is going on in and around the industry.
Those who consistently seem to benefit from luck, are also able to 'read the
game'. They can imagine how a change of circumstances might represent an
opportunity. They are good at envisaging future scenarios and are alert to
making the most out of a crisis.
They also combine directness with flexibility. They show a readiness to
improvise, to cut their losses if necessary.
There is a random element in all human success. But many of the career
breaks ascribed to luck are obliquely attributable to the efforts of the
individual. The random shape and timing of the windfall need not mean that
it was unplanned. One is reminded of Gary Player's golfing aphorism: 'The
more I practise the luckier I get'.
The reason we fail to see this is that we do not take the trouble to retrace
or reflect upon the circumstances which generated the piece of luck. It is a
cliche that 'you make your own luck', but what about engineering your own
misfortune?
Luck goes unrecorded and undiagnosed, and we fail to learn from it or about
it. Retrospective accounts of managerial success are presented as the
culmination of a deliberate decision-making process. Certain events are cast
in leading parts while the role of luck is edited out.
Yet an awareness of luck can inform managerial thinking. Luck represents a
force in favour of alertness, imagination, opportunism and action - and
these are as vital to the success of individual managers as they are to the
success of their companies.
Unless we acknowledge the part played by luck, we will never understand it
any better and we will have to continue to rely on our intuition and
experience to predict when and where it may arise. Luck visits those who
court it.

FT  18 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Operable letter of credit completes North Sea
oil rig transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVY OFFSHORE LTD v EMERALD FIELD CONTRACTING LTD
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Fox, Lord Justice Staughton and Lord Justice
Beldam):
March 6 1992
TITLE TO North Sea oil equipment under a supply contract which provides for
completion on payment by letter of credit presented with proper documents by
the supplier to the bank, passes when the buyer provides the supplier with
the documents required to operate the letter of credit.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendant,
Emerald Field Contracting Ltd, from Mr Justice Hobhouse's decision (FT,
January 28 1992) giving judgment for the plaintiff supplier, Davy Offshore
Ltd, on a claim under a sub-contract for the supply of oil field equipment.
LORD JUSTICE STAUGHTON said that by a contract dated November 30 1992
between Emerald and Davy, Davy was to supply a platform called a floating
production facility (FPF) and other works.
All items were to be installed and commissioned by Davy. The price was to be
Pounds 127.8m.
Davy was concerned that title to the goods and works might pass to Emerald
before it had been paid the greater part of the contract price, and without
its receiving some of the documents necessary to operate a letter of credit
opened in its favour.
It asked the court to determine when and in what circumstances title would
pass.
The bank was obliged to pay within five business days of presentation of
proper documents.
Mr Justice Hobhouse concluded that the property was to pass upon acceptance
by the bank of the documents. He did not mean on receipt of the documents,
but rather at the time when the bank decided that they complied with the
requirements of the credit.
By clause 18.1(a) of the contract, title to the work and facilities were to
be transferred to Emerald 'immediately upon completion and payment of the
amount due from (Emerald) at completion as referred to in clause 17.2'.
Clause 17.2 provided that on completion Emerald should pay Davy 95 per cent
of the contract price. The 5 per cent balance was to be paid three months
and five banking days after completion.
Clause 17.5 provided that Emerald's obligation to pay under clause 17.2 was
to be satisfied by Davy drawing under a letter of credit.
By clause 18.1(b) Davy warranted that at time of transfer and vesting of
title, the work and facilities would be free of all mortgages, liens or
other encumbrances. By clause 18.1(c) it agreed that at time of transfer it
would deliver to Emerald a duly executed bill of sale in British form in
respect of the FPF, reflecting the warranty.
Clause 36.3.1 provided that, subject to satisfactory completion of work and
receipt of specified documents including the bill of sale, 'completion shall
occur', and Emerald would issue a completion certificate and procure the
provision of a certificate from the secretary of state for trade and
industry confirming that conditions under section 10 of the Industry Act
1972 had been satisfied. Emerald was then to return all the documents to
Davy, which would then present them to the bank under the terms of the
letter of credit.
Emerald's principal argument was that the first instalment payable by the
bank under the letter of credit, was not due from Emerald at completion
under clause 18.1(a). It was due from the bank, and it was due after
completion.
Clause 18.1(a) provided for payment of the amount due from Emerald at
completion 'as referred to in clause 17.2'.
Clause 17.2 expressly required Emerald to pay 95 per cent of the contract
price on completion. Emerald's obligation to pay Davy on completion
'pursuant to clause 17.2' was repeated in clause 17.3. Clause 17.5 provided
that that obligation should be satisfied by Davy's drawing under all letters
of credit.
Those provisions made it clear that 'payment of the amount due' from Emerald
in clause 18.1(a) did include Davy's drawing under the letter of credit, or
at least being placed by Emerald in a position to do so.
Business sense supported that construction. One would not expect the parties
to provide that passing of title should be deferred until trivial amounts
were paid, but not until Davy was in a position to draw the largest
proportion under a letter of credit.
There were other arguments.
First, Emerald said the contract required Davy to hand over a duly executed
bill of sale when work was complete, and since a bill of sale was an
instrument which transferred property in a ship, title must then pass.
The basic rule was that property passed under a contract when it was
intended to pass (section 17(1), Sale of Goods Act 1979). Since the bill of
sale was to be handed back by Emerald under 36.3.1, and Davy was to use it
for presentation under the letter of credit, it could not have been intended
that property should pass when it was first handed to Emerald,so as to
override 18.1(a).
There was a second argument on clause 18.1(c) which provided that 'at the
time of transfer to and vesting of title pursuant to sub-clause (a) above'
Davy should deliver to Emerald a duly executed legal bill of sale. That
suggested that when the bill of sale was delivered to Emerald, title did
pass.
The provision made no sense in the light of the other terms of the contract.
Provisions of a contract might be rejected if they could not be reconciled
with the remainder (Glyn v Margetson &amp; Co (1893) AC 351,357). An alternative
solution, which was very plausible, was that the parties contemplated terms
as to payment, delivery of documents and completion, operating at the same
or substantially the same time.
A third argument was based on a 'first qualifying certificate' required to
be presented by Davy to the bank, stating that it waived all possessory
liens in respect of the work and the facilities. How, it was asked, could
Davy have any liens to waive if title did not pass until the bank had
examined the documents?
The first answer was that title passed either when Davy was equipped to
operate the letter of credit, or when it presented the documents to the
bank. But if that was wrong, there was no reason why a property-owner should
not waive possessory liens for the future, against the time when he ceased
to be owner.
The property did not pass until Davy was provided by Emerald with the
documents required to operate the letter of credit. The appeal would
therefore be dismissed on that issue.
By a settlement agreement, dated June 27 1991 between Emerald and Davy,
clause 17(a) provided that 'subject to the provisions of sub-clause (b)
hereof' Davy agreed that payment of outstanding sums under the prime
contract should be deferred. Clause 17(b) provided that 'the provisions of
sub-clause (a) above shall not apply to any letter of credit' issued to Davy
in relation to the prime contract.
By clause 19(a) Davy and Emerald confirmed that, save as agreed in the
settlement agreement, 'the prime contract shall continue in full force and
effect'.
It was argued for Emerald that clause 17(a) provided for 'any sum
outstanding at completion' to be deferred. Therefore, it was said, clause
18.1(a) of the prime contract, where it referred to 'payment of the amount
due from (Emerald)at completion' no longer had any content - no sum was due
from Emerald at completion.
That argument was defeated by clause 17(b) of the settlement agreement, to
which clause 17(a) was expressly made subject. Clause 17(a) was not to apply
to any letter of credit.
The originating summons asked the court to declare, among other things, that
(c) the obligation under clause 36.3.1 to provide a section 10 certificate
was a condition of the prime contract and arose at completion.
The judge made a declaration that the obligation to provide a section 10
certificate arose at completion, and was a condition of Davy's obligation to
pass title. He did not decide it was a condition breach of which would
amount to a repudiation. He merely held that title did not pass until the
certificate was delivered. That conclusion was correct.
The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed
For Davy: Lord Irvine QC, Edwin Glasgow QC, Richard Wilmot-Smith, and Stuart
Catchpole (Ashurst Morris Crisp).
For Emerald: John Dyson QC and Mark Templeman (Watson, Farley &amp; Williams).

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock attacks PM over jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's handling of the
economy and claimed that its own Budget measures would lead to falling
unemployment in 1993.
On the eve of the publication of his party's manifesto, Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, criticised Mr John Major for doing nothing to end the
recession and for accepting that unemployment would continue to rise for the
rest of this year.
Speaking at a press conference in London, Mr Kinnock said ministers had no
positive plans to pull Britain out of recession. 'In the face of a collapse
in investment, skills shortages, rising unemployment, record business
failures and rock-bottom confidence, they do nothing. They have not a single
useful initiative to offer.'
At the same press conference Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry
secretary, said a further 500,000 jobs were at risk during the remainder of
this year if present policies continued. He also released figures showing
that business failures early this year were running at a rate 25 per cent
higher than in the last two months of 1991.
Mr Kinnock said his party's Budget would prove far more effective in helping
bring the recession to an end. He said Labour's proposals were more
'responsibly reflationary' than those of the government. Although the Budget
was fiscally neutral, the party's decision to increase incomes for people
earning up to Pounds 21,000 a year, at the expense of top earners, would
raise personal spending on necessities rather than more expensive goods.
As a result, the party's economic strategy was less prone to being
undermined by significant increases in imports. Labour's 'job rich' Budget
would therefore be more likely to create more jobs in Britain.
Mr Kinnock said Labour would not mislead the nation into believing that 'a
switch could be thrown' to move the economy from recession to immediate
recovery.
But he and Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said that Labour's
proposals would begin to take effect as soon as they were implemented.
Mr Smith said that his measures would see the rise in unemployment start to
slow down late this year, with the number of jobless falling in 1993.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Trying to claw back Lib Dem voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE no babies to hand as Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Scottish
Conservative party, posed for the cameras in Crail, the picturesque Scottish
harbour.
He had to make do with a lobster and an elderly fisherman. The lobster's
claws were taped together, making it perhaps a safer prop than most babies.
Lord Sanderson was on the road to launch the Scottish Conservative attack on
the Liberal Democrats - it believes it has a better chance of winning votes
from them than from the other parties.
Crail, a fishing village popular with tourists and weekending professionals
from Edinburgh, is in a former Liberal stronghold - Herbert Asquith's old
constituency of Fife North-East. It turned Tory for a while, but was
re-captured by Mr Menzies Campbell for the Liberal Democrats in 1987. Mr
Campbell's majority is 1,447, so the seat is a key target for the
Conservatives.
Lord Sanderson later warned the party faithful, gathered in the British
Legion hall, about the dangers of voting Liberal Democrat.
A vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for Neil Kinnock, he said,
pointing to the Liberal Democrat record of voting with Labour against
Conservative bills. He reserved his greatest venom for something close to
the grey-haired audience's hearts.
'Did you know that they have opposed Conservative plans to exempt thousands
of family firms, including farms, from inheritance tax?' he asked. The
audience did, and did not approve; the constituency is largely agricultural.
One ray of hope for the Tories is the prospect - reported in the local
press, but not yet confirmed - that a Liberal Unionist candidate, Mr David
Senior, might stand against Mr Campbell on an anti-devolution platform.
Local Conservatives described Mr Senior approvingly as 'an old-fashioned
Liberal Unionist', recalling the party which was known for being more Tory
than the Tories.
One member of the audience helpfully raised the possibility of a split
Liberal Democrat vote. 'One would hope so - right down the middle,' agreed
the Conservative candidate, spotting an improved chance of a seat at
Westminster. But some Tories privately admitted that a Liberal Unionist
could take votes from the Conservatives as well.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Journey to the centre of the stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT DOES not brook comparison with the Odyssey or the Quest for the Holy
Grail.
But tonight's Conservative party political broadcast, entitled 'John Major.
The Journey', puts the prime minister at the centre of his party's campaign
for a fourth consecutive term.
The journey in question is Mr Major's epic quest, outlined in his conference
speech last autumn, from the back streets of Brixton, south London, to the
corridors of power.
The film's sub-text is that Conservative policies allow a gnome-maker's son
to aspire to high office.
It is designed also to exploit Mr Major's strong image rating and to
emphasise his personal commitment to the National Health Service and other
core trappings of the welfare state.
The broadcast consists largely of a tour around the inner-city streets of
the prime minister's youth, during which Mr Major consistently exudes an air
of boyish enthusiasm.
'Every time I go in it, I still get a thrill,' he says on arriving finally
at the Houses of Parliament. The film concludes with the prime minister
entering Number Ten to the strains of Henry Purcell's Conserv-ative campaign
theme music. The journey takes in Brixton market, the church where he was
married and the front doors of two of the houses in which he used to live.
Lambeth town hall, the shrine of the 'loony left', is described as the place
where Mr Major 'practically lived for three years' as a councillor.
One passage in the broadcast, which was directed by the Oscar-winning film
director John Schlesinger, intercuts footage of Mr Major meeting world
leaders with film of banter with stallholders and ordinary electors.
The use of a big name director and the relentless focus on the party leader
make comparisons with Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Kinnock' broadcast, which
significantly improved the Labour leader's personal ratings in the 1987
campaign, inevitable.
The comparison is partly misleading: the Tories will tonight seek to
capitalise on a perceived strength, rather than rectify a perceived
weakness.
But one measure of the film's success would be if the Tories decide to
rebroadcast it later in the campaign, as Labour did five years ago.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Altruism and fear in middle ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MIXTURE OF resignation, fear and altruism was expressed by middle-income
professionals yesterday facing the prospect of higher taxes under a Labour
government.
Mr David Land, a bank official in Edinburgh earning between Pounds 30,000
and 40,000 said: 'Labour's tax plans would make me more miserable, most of
my money goes to looking after our family. I would like see John Major
returned by a whisker, but also to get constitutional change in Scotland.'
He plans to vote Liberal Democrat.
Less certain about his voting intentions was Mr Keith Green, who is in the
same earnings bracket. He is single and an account director at a London
marketing consultancy. He said that under Labour he would pay more tax
without any guarantee of improved public transport or education. 'They seem
to be taking money from a small group and giving it to another,' he said.
'I'll vote either Tory or Liberal Democrat.'
Ms Sara Ramsden, a single London television producer in the same earnings
bracket, said: 'I am concerned about what might happen with personal
pensions, but the difference between Labour and Tory on my take-home pay
would be around Pounds 500 a year. I am happy that money should go to
support education and health.'
Mr Charles Stafford, a single building engineer in London also earning
Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000, said he would be happy to pay more in taxes
and plans to vote Labour. 'If you look at the lack of funding in education
more money has to be raised from the population.'
The resolve to vote Conservative was a strong as ever for Mr Adam
Applegarth, 29, assistant general manager at Northern Rock building society
in Newcastle upon Tyne. He earns Pounds 45,000 a year, has a wife, who is
not earning, and two children under six. 'I don't believe John Smith can
hold the line against their spending ministers,' he said.
Mr Roderick Nicol, an Exeter management training consultant on Pounds
50,000, would be hit by Labour's proposals. 'I'm not sure I trust any of the
parties to spend money wisely,' he said. He planned to stick with the
Conservatives.
Some hardened Conservative voters were reluctant to comment publicly on
their circumstances. One London corporate financier, single, aged 34 and
earning between Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 50,000, said Labour's budget
confirmed his intention to vote Tory.
But a high income was no guarantee of Tory support. One publishing director,
single, aged 27 and earning more than Pounds 60,000 a year, said she would
vote Liberal Democrat. 'I feel guilty about the money I earn.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Leading business figures backing the Tories
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ALISTAIR GRANT joined supermarkets group Argyll in 1977, and has been
chief executive since 1986. Group pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 64.6m in
the year to March 1986 to Pounds 290.8m last year. Argyll's annual report
puts Sir Alistair's remumeration at Pounds 518,000; under Labour his extra
tax burden would be about Pounds 92,000 a year, or Pounds 1,770 per week.
SIR ALLEN SHEPPARD joined GrandMet in 1975 and became chief executive in
1986. Pre-tax profits of the group have grown under his leadership from
Pounds 368m in the year to September 30 1986 to Pounds 963m last year. His
1991 emoluments are put at Pounds 713,391 (excluding pension benefits); the
rough cost to him of Labour's proposals would be Pounds 129,450 a year, or
Pounds 2,490 a week.
LORD KING OF WARTNABY has been chairman of British Airways since 1981. Since
the company was privatised in 1987, profits have risen from Pounds 162m in
that year to Pounds 285m in the first nine months of the current financial
year. BA's last report and accounts show Lord King's emoluments as Pounds
407,650 a year so Labour could cost him Pounds 71,358 a year, or Pounds
1,372 a week.
PETER DAVIS joined Reed International from J Sainsbury in 1986, becoming
chief executive later that year. The publishing group's profits have risen
from Pounds 188m in the year to March 31 1987 to Pounds 222m last year. His
emoluments (excluding pension contributions) are put at Pounds 310,569. On
that basis, Labour could cost him Pounds 52,900 a year, or Pounds 1,010 a
week.
STANLEY KALMS is chairman of Dixons, the electrical goods retailer, which he
joined in 1948. Pre-tax profits have been damaged by the recession, falling
from Pounds 102.6m in the 1986-87 financial year to Pounds 81.7m in 1990-91.
The Dixons report shows his annual remuneration at Pounds 566,132; the cost
to him of Labour would be Pounds 101,450 a year, or Pounds 1,950 a week.
Figures are based on earnings in annual report. They assume that figures
shown taken as salary (rather than other taxable benefits); they do not take
into account the proposed change in child benefit

FT  18 MAR 92 / Tailor stitched up by the recession: John Thornhill finds
price-cutting in an unexpected area of retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EYEBROWS may rise today along Savile Row, home of the gentleman's wardrobe,
at the news that one of Britain's most famous tailors has been obliged to
make the unkindest cut of all - a cut in prices.
Bernard Weatherill, the sporting tailor which supplies hunting clothes to
the Queen, has reduced prices by up to 30 per cent for suits, coats and
shooting jackets in a move intended to stimulate sales.
A three-piece gentleman's suit can now be had for Pounds 1,150 plus value
added tax, while hunt coats have been reduced to Pounds 725 - representing a
saving of Pounds 275. Mr Hugh Holland, managing director, said the move had
been prompted by the recession, in which sales had fallen by more than 60
per cent. Tough trading conditions had been worsened by uncertainty about
the future of hunting, he added.
'We have built a client base of English country gentlemen, but they will not
order their hunt coats and affiliated items if they feel the sport is going
to be banned,' he explained. 'Some of our customers feel that is inevitable
if the Labour party wins the election. Those that can vote will certainly
vote Conservative.'
The organisation was formerly the family company of Mr Bernard Weatherill,
the retiring speaker of the Commons. In the past, it has discreetly cut
prices for those brazen enough to ask for reductions. 'But we thought it was
wrong to offer discounts to the one-off punter when we were not offering
them to our most valued long-standing customers,' Mr Holland said. 'I
therefore sent a letter to our 4,500 customers announcing these price cuts.'
However, all is not desperation on Savile Row. Bernard Weatherill's sister
company Kilgour, French &amp; Stanbury, which relies heavily on overseas
customers, has continued to enjoy strong sales. 'As far as the Americans are
concerned, the customers we deal with are recession-proof,' Mr Holland said.
'They are still ordering half a dozen suits at a time. Thankfully that type
of business is not diminishing.'

THE PAY gap between senior civil servants and comparable private sector
white collar workers is no longer justifiable, according to a
union-commissioned report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the consultancy
firm.
Senior civil servants have traditionally received less pay than private
sector counterparts because their jobs are more secure. The report says
there is ample evidence of a higher turbulence and job changing in the
private sector.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Water company applies for drought order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE VALLEYS Water, which serves 2.3m people to the north and east of
London, has applied for a government drought order to combat the growing
risk of severe water shortage in parts of south-east England.
Water industry experts predict that unless there is heavy and sustained
rainfall throughout the south and south-eastern parts of Britain in the next
few weeks, many more areas will be affected by restrictions. Around 4.5m
consumers are already subject to hosepipe or sprinkler bans. Supplies within
the Three Valleys area, which covers parts of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire and Essex, are at their lowest since 1903 after four years
of record low rainfall.
Mr Jim McGowan, managing director, said it was a precautionary measure and
customers should not panic. 'But we have been badly hit by four consecutive
winters of low rainfall, particularly as 75 per cent of our supply comes
from natural underground sources. Even heavy rainfall now will not change
the overall situation much because the sources are recharged mainly during
winter.'
The National Rivers Authority, responsible for water supplies in England and
Wales, said some areas were experiencing their worst drought for 100 years,
and 20 inches of rain was needed to recharge underground supplies. 'Given
that the average rainfall is two inches a month, this is simply not going to
happen.'
A drought order would give the water company powers to extend the present
hosepipe ban to restrictions on car washes, fountains, watering municipal
parks and golf courses and non-essential industrial uses such as window
cleaning. The washing of aircraft at Heathrow Airport would also cease.
The Meteorological Office said that in the five months from October to
February the Thames region had received 54 per cent of the rainfall it would
normally expect. Southern had 52 per cent and Anglian 63 per cent.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Plan for 'green' audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian manufacturing group, are to
conduct annual environmental audits to assess the ecological impact of their
business activities.
Norsk Hydro's plans, among the first announced in the UK, involve adding an
environmental statement to the annual accounts of its UK subsidiary,
starting from the current financial year.
The energy, metals and chemicals group, which is Norway's largest quoted
company, is also considering repeating an environmental assessment of its UK
activities which it produced in October 1990 and which was audited by
Lloyd's register, a consultancy firm.
The developments follow a detailed report on the parent company's
environmental impact published in Norway three years ago.
British Airways is drafting the first of what it hopes will become an annual
environmental report to accompany the annual accounts, which will be
published this summer.
It will contain a numerical assessment of the business under six headings:
noise, emissions, congestion, waste, tourism and staff involvement in the

The work will build on an environmental review produced by the company last
year, which examined the impact of its activities at Heathrow Airport,
including trends in aircraft noise exposure, fuel consumption and emissions.

<TEXT>
MEXICO City's ozone level has hit an all-time high, recording 398 points on
the Imeca air quality scale on Monday. This is four times higher than the
maximum one-hour exposure per year recommended by the World Health
Organisation.
This level, described by the government as 'very dangerous', sparked off an
emergency action plan under which all schools were closed. The programme
which prevents cars from circulating for one day a week was extended to two
days, and 194 of the city's largest industries had to cut production by
between 50 and 75 per cent.
Ozone is a secondary pollutant formed when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides
mix in sunlight. High levels of the pollutant restrict breathing, irritate
the eyes and can cause headaches. In the longer run it may exacerbate lung
diseases.
Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexico City's mayor, said he would announce
measures next week to improve the city's air quality. The government has
recently closed scores of factories for not complying with tougher emission
standards and ordered taxis and minibuses to use cleaner fuels.

BEIJING has given the go-ahead for a Hong Kong-led consortium to develop a
special free port zone on Hainan Island, off the south China coast, to
create a 'second Hong Kong'. Development costs over 15 years are estimated
at Dollars HK18bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
The news is further affirmation of China's commitment to rapid economic
reform. Although the new Yangpu Development Zone will remain under China's
sovereignty, the land use will be controlled by the group of overseas
investors under a 70-year lease.
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the Japanese
construction giant, will combine with a group of investors to provide a
basic infrastructure for the Yangpu Zone, building a power station, roads
and sewage works. The group will then sell land for development by local or
foreign investors.
The zone will be segregated from the rest of Hainan by a customs frontier,
and aim to concentrate on developing export-oriented industries, making use
of a deep-sea port. Enterprises in the zone will receive tax benefits above
those current in the existing Special Economic Zones, including Hainan
Island itself. No external policy will be laid down on the level of
recruitment or wages in the zone.
Development will be in three phases, phase one requiring investment of
Dollars HK2.5bn and providing services for a 75,000 population. But Kumagai
aims for a population of 250,000 and employment for a further 150,000
temporary residents, at the end of 15 years.
Kumagai has paid a Dollars HK40m deposit for the land and will pay out a
total of Dollars HK140m for the site. Kumagai has been negotiating to set up
the Zone for more than four years. The final line-up of the Yangpu
consortium has yet to be finalised, but analysts believe Kumagai will be the
main shareholder, with possible support from its parent company.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Housing starts boost hopes of US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration's hopes of economic recovery were boosted yesterday
by evidence of a revival in both house construction and industry.
A strong advance in housing starts, coupled with a more modest increase in
industrial production, provided two more of the 'robins on the lawn' that Mr
Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, has cited as indicators that an
economic springtime is on the way.
The strongest sign of a recovery was a 10 per cent surge in housing starts
in February. The Commerce Department said 1.3m privately owned homes were
started in February, 29 per cent higher than a year earlier.
Single-family homes provided the greatest strength, with 1.15 starts in
February - up 15 per cent from January, and 43 per cent higher than in
February 1991. The heavily overbuilt apartment sector remained weak,
however, with starts dropping to 128,000 units, 21 per cent down from
January and 24 per cent lower than a year ago.
Industrial output rose 0.6 per cent in February, but this was still not
enough to reverse the sharp drop in production in January.
The US Federal Reserve said a rebound in production of motor vehicles and
parts accounted for around half of February's gain, adding that overall
industrial production stood 1.4 per cent above its level a year earlier.
At the same time, the consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3
per cent last month, lifting the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.8 per
cent, from 2.6 per cent in January, according to Labor Department
statistics.
But core inflation - excluding the volatile food and energy components of
the price index - showed a slight decline to 3.8 per cent year on year.
The new statistics appeared to set the stage for an economic revival which,
while less exuberant than the recoveries from previous recessions, could,
nevertheless, prove more robust than many economists had predicted until
recently.
'Inventories are declining, so industry is set up for a recovery. The key is
whether there is full follow-through on employment,' said Mr James
O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.
Some economists are concerned that the most recent indications of recovery
may have been fuelled by some short-lived injections of cash into consumers'
wallets, such as the annual arrival of tax refund cheques from the Internal
Revenue Service. They would feel more comfortable about the durability of
the recovery if companies showed signs of hiring new workers.
Strong export growth and an influx of cash contributions from US allies in
the Gulf war helped cut the US external deficit sharply last year, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The deficit in the current account of the US balance of payments shrank to
Dollars 8.62bn, compared with Dollars 92.1bn in 1990. While the deficit in
merchandise trade fell by 32 per cent to Dollars 73.6bn, the US surplus in
trade in services increased by 36 per cent to Dollars 35.9bn.

FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Gatt disquiet at slower world trade growth
 -Frances Williams on a report showing the smallest volume increase for
nearly a decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWTH of world trade in goods slowed to 3 per cent last year from 5 per
cent in 1990, the smallest volume increase for nearly a decade, according to
estimates published today by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Though there are signs a modest recovery may be under way, the world trade
body expects growth to remain depressed in 1992, with volume rising by
perhaps 4 per cent.
The meagre 1.5 per cent rise in the value of world merchandise exports to a
new peak of Dollars 3,530bn in 1991, after a 13.5 per cent jump in 1990, was
because of weaker volume growth, the dollar's rise against European
currencies and lower commodity prices, Gatt says.
But trade in commercial services - transport, telecommunications, tourism,
financial and professional services - has proved more resilient. 'Very
preliminary estimates' for 1991 suggest growth by value of 5 per cent,
compared with 17 per cent in 1990, to a record Dollars 850bn. This, Gatt
cautions, is likely to be an underestimate.
Surging merchandise exports, against the general trend, enabled the US to
regain from Germany the top slot in the world export rankings last year. The
value of US exports rose by 7.5 per cent, while German exports slipped by
4.5 per cent in dollar terms. The US and Germany have alternated in first
place since 1986, followed last year by Japan in third place, France and
Britain.
Even more impressive was the trade performance of the six leading Asian
developing country exporters (Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan
and Thailand) which in 1991 increased the value of their exports by between
10 and 20 per cent and imports by between 8 and 30 per cent.
This 'was by far the most dynamic element in world trade last year', Gatt
says, more than offsetting a slowdown in exports from Japan. Asia, already
North America's main trading partner, became western Europe's principal
export market last year, as well as its biggest supplier.
By contrast, Gatt's economists estimate that the former eastern-bloc
countries may have suffered a 20 per cent fall in the value of exports and a
25 per cent drop in imports, with imports into the former Soviet Union
slumping by 42 per cent.
Last year marked the third consecutive year of declining growth in the
volume of world output and trade, Gatt notes, as recession gripped North
America and much of Europe. Trade growth of 3 per cent, down from 8.5 per
cent in 1988, was the lowest since 1983, though it continued to outstrip
world production.
Commenting on these developments, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general,
said a successful conclusion to the stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks
would 'make a tangible contribution to an improved economic outlook for the
world economy' by providing predictable and stable trading rules for
investment decisions.
In his accompanying review of developments in the international trading
system last year, Mr Dunkel notes several disquieting trends.
They include: a near-doubling of notified anti-dumping actions to 175 from
96 the year before, led by the US and Australia; a proliferation of 'grey
area' measures such as 'voluntary' export restraints and other
discriminatory trade barriers that bypass Gatt rules; and a growing
reluctance of countries, notably the major traders, to abide by Gatt dispute
panel decisions.
Mr Dunkel's report also highlights Gatt anxieties over a growing interest in
regional trading arrangements. These are permitted by Gatt as long as they
do not raise trade barriers to outsiders. Yet the working party on the
US/Canada free trade agreement that reported last year was just the latest
in a series of more than 50 working parties which have been unable to decide
whether such arrangements are Gatt-compatible. While the increased
involvement of countries in various types of regional initiatives 'is to be
welcomed', regional agreements need to be firmly anchored in Gatt, Mr Dunkel
says.
On the plus side, 11 countries have joined Gatt since the launch of the
Uruguay Round in 1986, bringing the total to 103, and another eight are in
various stages of joining. The three Baltic states, Ecuador, Syria, Taiwan,
Vietnam and some members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have
expressed interest in eventual membership.
In addition, 16 more countries announced unilateral trade liberalisation
measures last year, bringing the total since 1986 to 63 of which 51 are
developing and transition economies. At the same time, the increased
competition and structural change resulting from market opening and greater
economic interdependence 'make it urgent to conclude the Uruguay Round,' Mr
Dunkel concludes.

The UAE aimed to legislate a copyright and trade mark and patents protection
law ahead of an announcement by the US trade representative's office, they
added.
In the UAE, which so far lacks laws to protect copyright and trade marks, US

TELCO, India's biggest vehicle maker and a Tata group subsidiary, is to
manufacture truck engines and components for Mercedes-Benz, in a move making
it part of the German company's international production chain.
Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company
(Telco) and Tata group head, said his company would make engines for use by
the German company, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial concern.
Mercedes' decision to buy components from the Indian company is part of its
strategy of widening its supply source to cut costs when world competition
is growing. Mr Helmut Werner, a Mercedes director, said recently Mercedes
intended to 'put new life' into its co-operation with Tata.
Mercedes will use the parts supplied by Telco for its truck production in
south-east Asia. Telco will make Mercedes engines for trucks exported under
its own name to the Middle East. It will also make gear boxes, clutches,
front and rear axles for the German company. This week, Telco widens its
product range in India with the launch of its first car, the Tata estate
car.
Ariane Genillard reports from Prague: AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, is
poised to take a stake in CKD, Czechoslovakia's biggest transport and
engineering company, for a joint venture making transport vehicles. AEG
intends to diversify CKD's production capacity of 1,200 tramcars and 550
locomotives a year, focusing on making subway cars and suburban trains.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEVELOPMENT bank should be set up to ensure potential benefits are
realised from the proposed North American Free Trade Area between the US,
Canada and Mexico, a group of academics say.
Led by Prof Albert Fishlow of the University of California (Berkeley), they
suggest the bank would soften the impact in those areas of the US and Canada
hit by job losses. While overall, jobs would be created, jobs would be lost
and a need to facilitate new skills arise, Prof Fishlow says in Developing
Country Investment Review, published by the London-based Chartered WestLB.
The bank would also help meet the need for physical infrastructure, to
finance environmental improvement projects and support expansion of social
infrastructure, such as education and health care in Mexico. Mexico should
benefit most from the resources of the bank, which would be similar in
concept to the European Regional Development Fund. The bank should be funded
through an issue to member governments of partly-paid shares, such as those
issued by the World Bank.

Round
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, yesterday launched a fresh appeal
for an early and successful end to the Uruguay Round of trade talks. The
delay in completing the talks, more than a year over schedule, was worsening
the international economic environment and threatening the reform programmes
of many developing and former communist economies, he said.
Introducing his annual report to Gatt's governing council on developments in
world trade and the international trading system, Mr Dunkel said an open,
liberal and credible trading system played a pivotal role in promoting
growth and development. Economic growth was being held back by uncertainty
and lack of confidence in government policy on the part of producers,
investors, traders and consumers. Only modest recovery was in prospect in
the years ahead.
'What we need, and urgently, is a significant boost to economic growth to
generate the investment flows, jobs and technology transfers and increased
earnings from trade without which the dramatic reform programmes under way
in many countries cannot be sustained,' Mr Dunkel said.
He urged Gatt members to seize the present 'window of opportunity' to end
the Uruguay Round in the weeks ahead. The 108 countries taking part in the
round aim for a final package of Uruguay Round accords by Easter, but this
deadline seems unlikely to be met. Failure of the US and the EC to settle
differences over farm subsidies has brought detailed negotiations on
barriers to trade in goods, and pledges to liberalise services, to
near-standstill.
Mr Dunkel said the Round was crucial for Gatt's existing members and more
than 20 potential members. The Baltic states and members of the Commonwealth
of Independent States are expected to apply for observer status soon - a
first step to joining Gatt.

<TEXT>
THE Japanese authorities yesterday showed no sign of following past practice
and intervening to revive the country's stricken stock market.
Instead, Finance Ministry officials indicated they would rely on general
monetary and economic policies eventually to restore confidence in both the
market and in the economy.
A finance ministry official said: 'This is now a free market. We are not
going to try any of the old tricks. They will not work.' He was speaking
soon after the market closed yesterday after the Nikkei index failed to
regain the psychologically important 20,000 level and finished up 80.47 at
19,917.63. On Monday, the index had fallen to its lowest level for five
years.
The last time the Nikkei index fell through the 20,000 level was in October
1990 when Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, relaxed regulations to
encourage investors to buy stock. This time, his successor, Mr Tsutomo Hata,
has given no indication of making a similar move.
The ministry change of heart is a recognition that officials' power to
manage the markets has been undermined by the financial liberalisation in
the 1980s, including the introduction of stock futures trading, the
admission of foreign companies and interest rate deregulation.
It also a reflects a belief that even with the support of stockbroking
companies the ministry may lack the financial resources to shore up
equities. In the 1960s, the last prolonged bear market in Japan, officials
encouraged broking companies to club together to buy stocks to maintain
prices. But this time the volume of stock bought at inflated prices is so
great that officials believe such a fund would be swamped.
Stockbroking company executives have made the odd discreet call for
intervention. But most seem resigned to waiting for a change in sentiment.
As Mr Atsushi Saito, a managing director of Nomura Securities, the Japanese
broking group, said in a recent interview: 'The cause of the weakness of the
market is the weak economy.'
The brokers also recognise they have contributed to their misfortunes by
their involvements in stock scandals, including recent cases of helping
investment clients to window dress accounts. So the industry is in a poor
position to plead for a rescue.
At a press conference yesterday, Mr Minoru Nagaoka, chairman of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, made no calls for Finance Ministry market support, as his
predecessors might have done. Instead he asked for fiscal and monetary
measures (meaning more government spending and lower interest rates) to
boost the economy.' This is now a free market. We are not going to try any
of the old tricks. They will not work.'

FT  18 MAR 92 / S Africa runs out of budget options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Barend du Plessis, South Africa's finance minister, today delivers his
government's budget against a background of a weakening economy and
escalating demands on stretched revenues.
Mr du Plessis has little room for manoeuvre, with significant sweeteners for
the taxpayer unlikely. Instead, the budget is likely to consolidate the
trend towards equalising social spending between the different racial
groups, with individual taxpayers again being hard hit by the effects of
fiscal drag, as pay rises to compensate for inflation suck them into higher
tax bands.
The key factor limiting the finance minister's options is the state of the
economy, which has been in recession for three years. Economists are
forecasting growth of little more than 1 per cent this year and the outlook
for revenue growth is poor. Total revenue for the 1991/2 tax year is likely
to be about R2.5bn below the original estimate of R76.65bn (Pounds 15.5bn).
Raising taxes is also not much of an option. South Africans are already
fairly heavily taxed, with government spending nearly 29 per cent of gross
domestic product. It is also unlikely the minister will raise Value Added
Tax, currently at 10 per cent, given the political uproar that accompanied
its introduction last September.
The consensus among economists is that the work of attracting more revenue
will be left to fiscal drag, which has the effect of reducing real incomes.
Scope for borrowing is limited. In the 1991/2 year, the deficit before
borrowing is estimated to have reached about R13bn, or 4.5 per cent of GDP,
compared with the R10.1bn, or 3.4 per cent, deficit forecast by the
government. Some economists argue that the larger deficit had more to do
with revenue shortfalls than spending overruns, although they agree such a
large deficit is unsustainable.
The size of the public debt has risen sharply in recent years, from 33.9 per
cent of GDP in 1990 to over 37 per cent in the second and third quarters of
1991.
Given the lack of flexibility on the revenue side, a large part of any shift
towards equalising social spending - on pensions, for example - will have to
come from spending cuts elsewhere. President FW de Klerk said as much when
he opened parliament in February. He spoke of the need for 'relatively
drastic structural changes ..especially in respect of current expenditure.'
The government has already announced reforms to the white school system
which could save about R400m and their appears to be greater resolve than in
the past to curb civil servant salaries which consume about 35 per cent of
the budget.
Today's budget is likely to be the last by a Nationalist government - if the
reform process stays on track, next year's budget will be the product of
multi-party deliberations in an interim government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo - an early indicator of Japanese consumer
spending - declined in real terms in February for the third month running,
the Japan Department Stores Association said yesterday.
Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per
cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February
this year.
The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer
spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many
economists had hoped.
Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, while household goods sales
rose by 1.6 per cent. Foodstuffs sales were 7 per cent higher, while
miscellaneous goods were off by 5.3 per cent. Sales of highly-priced items
such as paintings were depressed.
February steel production fell below 8m tonnes for the first time in four
years, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. Output fell by 11.7 per
cent to 7.8m tonnes as weak demand forced companies to reduce inventories.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also revised upward earlier
estimates of inventories in January, which are now reported as 12.2 per cent
higher than a year ago. Industrial production fell by 4 per cent compared
with a year ago. The net operation rate of industrial facilities was 6 per
cent lower.

FT  18 MAR 92 / No queues form outside Syria's newly opened door: In spite
of appearances, the fundamentals of the Assad regime remain the same
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LAST November Syria took what was, for it, quite an unusual step: it
inserted a four-page advertising supplement in The New York Times extolling
the virtues of a new 'open door' policy.
Syria, readers were informed, was open for business. Foreign investors were
welcome, the tourism industry was 'ready, willing - and waiting', and water
from the new Euphrates dam was helping to turn the desert green.
Why did Syria, which does not have all that much foreign currency to throw
around, choose to advertise its wares in such a way, at such a time, and in
a paper that it has tended to regard as hostile over the years?
The answer lies partly in Syria's desire to 'clean up its image in the
West', as one Damascus-based western official put it, and partly in
Damascus's almost certainly mistaken belief that the very limited economic
reforms it has undertaken will indeed prove a magnet for investment.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the pre-eminence of the US in regional
affairs, and Syria's need for assistance to modernise its crumbling
infrastructure, are all factors that pushed Damascus towards a reappraisal
of its place in the world.
Syria's participation in the US-sponsored Middle East peace process is one
consequence of this 're-positioning'; so, too, was its decision in 1989 to
normalise relations with Egypt and subsequently its active involvement in
the anti-Iraq alliance. But for all the appearance of change, there are
certain fundamentals that remain much the same.
In spite of the sweeping liberalisation in eastern Europe, there is precious
little sign of a political thaw. President Hafez al-Assad's reaffirmation in
a referendum last December in which he secured an improbable 99.8 per cent
of the vote struck an oddly discordant note, even among Syrians used to such
sham exercises in democracy.
Indeed the referendum, accompanied by 'spontaneous' street demonstrations
involving, among others, the local Jewish community, has spawned an
underground black humour in Damascus. In one joke, Syrians were given two
choices in the ballot: either vote 'yes' or 'inform next-of-kin'. Local
observers saw all the fuss over Mr Assad's reaffirmation as a sign not of
strength but of insecurity.
'In spite of all his apparatus of repression, he still feels he needs to
fake that degree of support,' said one such observer.
Signs that Mr Assad may be seeking publicly to advance prospects for his
son, Basil, an army major, are also viewed with some bemusement locally,
since the young Assad does not strike people as a man 'likely to succeed'.
One of the more curious postscripts to the leadership referendum were the
posters that appeared in Damascus congratulating Mr Assad with the words
Mabrook, Abu Basil - Congratulations Father of Basil.
Syria's apparently contradictory impulses - it is talking peace with Israel
while acquiring more sophisticated intermediate range missiles in
collaboration with Iran - are entirely consistent with Mr Assad's approach
over the years of seeking to keep open as many options as possible. It also
almost certainly accords with his scepticism about a successful outcome to
the present round of peace talks.
Thus the Syrian leader, while seeking to improve his country's standing in
the west by joining peace efforts and siding with Egypt and Saudi Arabia
against Iraq, clings at the same time to what one western official in
Damascus described as 'his dog-eared cards': his enhanced relationship with
Iran; his backing of militant Palestinian groups; his tactical thaw with the
mainstream Palestinians of Mr Yassir Arafat; his support for the Kurdish
Worker's Party, the PKK, which is allowed bases in the Syrian-controlled
Bekaa valley in Lebanon (this support infuriates Turkey which is battling
Kurdish separatists in its south-east); and also his links with Iraqi
opposition groups which are given the run of Damascus, but are not taken
very seriously.
Syrian officials say they are intensely disappointed over the lukewarm
international response to their efforts to deal with misgivings about its
support for terrorism, and its dismal human rights record. They point to the
fact that since the 1986 Hindawi affair, in which Syrian intelligence was
accused of masterminding an attempt to smuggle a bomb on an El Al flight
from London, no serious terrorist incident has been linked to groups
operating from Syria.
They also complain that the west and the US in particular, which continues
to place Syria on the list of countries supporting terrorism, thus denying
it American aid, has not given Damascus credit for the release last year of
some 3,000 political prisoners (international human rights groups note
10,000 remain in custody).
The officials say they were especially disappointed by the decision of the
European parliament late last year to block much-needed EC assistance in
protest at Syria's human rights record.
Syria, whose population numbers about 15m, is burdened by a 3.7 per cent
rate of population increase, one of the world's highest, and is in need of
all the assistance it can get.
Damascus is closely watching domestic developments in Israel where an
election is due on June 23. While Syrian officials say that as far as they
are concerned there is little to choose between Mr Yitzhak Shamir and his
challenger, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, this does not mean they are not interested in
the outcome.
On the contrary: officials have been consulting western embassies in
Damascus on whether the suspension of peace talks pending the election would
help or harm Mr Shamir. The clear implication is that Syria would like to
give encouragement to an alternative who might be more flexible on the 'land
for peace issue', although Mr Rabin has not in any way encouraged a belief
that he might be willing to yield the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in
the 1967 war.
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak yesterday pressed his Syrian counterpart,
Hafez al-Assad to stay the course in Middle East peace talks, writes Tony
Walker in Cairo.
The two leaders met in Cairo to review regional developments and to discuss
Arab tactics towards the talks with Israel launched amid much fanfare in
Madrid last October. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with
Israel, is most anxious that negotiations should continue between the Jewish
state and delegations representing Syria, Lebanon and a
Jordanian-Palestinian team.
Mr Assad and Mr Mubarak seem likely to have focused on whether peace talks
should resume before Israeli elections in June. The fourth round concluded
in Washington earlier this month without agrement on the time or venue for
the next session.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Australians unsure over recession
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA may have limped out of recession in the three months to December,
but the economy remains fragile and recovery is likely to be weak, figures
published yesterday suggest.
The picture of the economy revealed by the quarterly national accounts was
more confused than usual because of the introduction of a new statistical
definition of changes in gross domestic product.
A new measurement, GDP(A), showed growth of 0.3 per cent in the three months
to December, following growth of 0.1 per cent in the September quarter.
GDP(A) measures the average of the three traditional definitions of GDP,
based on income, expenditure and production measurements.
GDP(I), the income based measurement which is the government statisticians'
preferred index, rose by 0.4 per cent in the three months to December, but
fell 0.1 per cent in the September quarter.
The contrast between the two raises doubts over whether the economy has
fulfilled the technical definition of recovery, which requires growth over
two successive quarters.
The government statistics bureau also said the trend estimate, which
smoothes out quarterly fluctuations in the figures, remained subdued. On
this basis, GDP(A) was flat, following six successive quarterly
contractions.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the figures showed that a ADollars
2.3bn (Pounds 980m) public spending package announced last month was 'about
right'. He said the government was 'entitled to be confident that the
economy is on the turn'.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Portugal may have crucial lessons to learn after revolt in
the classrooms: The crisis that led to the departure of the Portuguese
education minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DIAMANTINO Durao, Portugal's education minister who was sacked on Monday,
paid the political price for failing to stem growing discontent among
students, teachers, and parents over an enduring crisis in Portuguese
education.
The reason for the minister's dismissal - officially described as a
resignation - was the recent wave of student protests against the PGA, an
unpopular and idiosyncratic exam allowing entry into higher education. The
scale of the protests, with large demonstrations up and down the country,
took the government by surprise. Widespread public sympathy for the
students, made it imperative for the social democratic administration of the
prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, to respond.
By replacing the embattled and unpopular Mr Durao, who had spent only 138
days as minister, the government hopes to dampen the protests and give a new
impetus to educational reforms. His replacement is Mr Antonio Couto dos
Santos, 42, a former deputy minister for youth, who has played a discreet
but politically important role as parliamentary affairs minister.
He inherits one of the government's most politically sensitive jobs. He
faces three pressing challenges:
What to do with the PGA.
How to modernise the educational system with insufficient resources, while
winning public acceptance for a substantial rise in university fees.
How to implement structural reforms to improve efficiency and cut back on an
unwieldy bureaucracy.
For decades, Portuguese education has suffered from lack of resources - a
legacy of former dictator Antonio Salazar who thought too much education
gave people the wrong ideas. After the 1974 revolution, the pendulum swung
180 degrees under popular pressure for equal education for all, putting
immense strains on resources.
Despite government efforts, Portuguese education, except in a few
universities, remains the poor relation among its European partners, and
lags 20 years behind the European average, according to officials.
Pre-school education reaches only 40 per cent of children. The schooling
record is bleak with failures or drop-out rates of above 40 per cent.
Illiteracy is among the highest in Europe, at around 20 per cent, reaching
close to 40 per cent of the population in some rural areas. Illegal child
labour contributes to low school attendances. Officials say around 15,000
children are engaged in work, but international organisations and trade
unions say the figure is four or six times higher.
The use of child labour is most widespread in the north in textile
factories, but it is evident in other parts of the country. Children can be
seen working on building sites, in the service industry and on farms. Most
work only part-time or outside school hours, but many give up school
altogether.
The government has tried to clamp down on unscrupulous employers by imposing
fines and banning guilty employers from state contract. The practice
nevertheless endures, partly helped by the complicity of financially pressed
parents, tradition, and a lack of child supervision.
The government has made education a priority, but the task is immense. This
year, it raised its budget for education by 19 per cent compared with 1991
to Esc643.9bn (Pounds 2.9bn), and it receives aid from EC programmes worth
some Esc200bn for 1990-93. Money alone, however, will not solve all
problems, though it should help to improve working conditions, provide
better facilities and equipment and raise the low pay levels of teachers,
making teaching more attractive.
But more reforms are urgently needed. The PGA, which focuses on broad
cultural questions rather than specific school subjects, is regarded as
favouring better-off students. Mr Couto dos Santos will have to decide soon
whether to replace it. His predecessor said dissatisfied students could sit
it again in May, but this does not meet demands for its abolition.
The government wants to raise state university fees from the paltry Esc1,200
a year - which dates back to the 1940s - to a more viable level. The
outgoing minister planned to raise fees to Esc60,000. This will be
unpopular. Reform of career structures and cutting back on the estimated
400,000 people employed by the Education Ministry, is likely to meet
resistance. No one mourned Mr Durao's departure save parents who appreciated
his commitment to improve deteriorating security in and around schools. The
new minister will have his work cut out if he is even to attempt to deal
with the rest of Portugal's education headache.

FT  18 MAR 92 / EC proposes airline 'open skies' next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN airlines could be free to set their own fares from the beginning of
next year, according to proposals under consideration by European Community
governments.
Mr Karel van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, said yesterday in London
there were growing signs that a majority of EC governments favoured
accelerating the process of liberalisation of European air transport. This
included giving airlines freedom to fix air fares and introducing cabotage,
enabling an airline from one EC country to operate domestic flights in
another member state.
EC transport ministers will consider the third stage in the Community's air
transport liberalisation programme at a meeting in Brussels next week.
That meeting would not take a final decision on the third package of
liberalisation measures but a final agreement is expected in June, Mr van
Miert said. This would clear the way for 'open skies' in Europe from the
start of next year.
Mr van Miert said he had been pleasantly surprised by the progress and
degree of consensus emerging among EC governments on the latest air
transport package. 'Work has progressed well and goes beyond what we
originally felt was possible,' he said.
Agreement to allow airlines freedom to fix their fares would represent an
important breakthrough. But the Commission would retain powers to ensure
airlines did not abuse any dominant position or attempted to drive out
weaker competitors through predatory pricing and dumping.
Under the current system, scheduled air fares in Europe are governed by the
'double disapproval' system whereby an airline can be stopped introducing a
new fare between two EC countries if the governments of both countries
oppose it.
Mr van Miert suggested a system of 'consecutive cabotage' as a first step
towards full cabotage could start as early as next year. 'This would enable
an airline like British Airways to fly from London to Paris and then on to
Nice or some other place in France,' he explained. Agreement also appears to
have been reached on the criteria of licencing airlines in Europe. An
airline could be established anywhere in the Community as long as it was 51
per cent owned by EC citizens.
But Mr van Miert acknowledged the larger EC carriers were unhappy with the
Commission's proposals to set up a system of allocating 'slots' at busy
European airports to new entrants and smaller airlines.
There were also difficulties in reaching the necessary balance on a policy
for airline mergers and partnerships to ensure European airlines could
expand to compete against large foreign carriers by forging cross-border
links at the same time as not undermining competition rules.
Transport ministers from 28 European countries yesterday agreed to help east
European states upgrade their air traffic control systems and improve air
links with western Europe. This is part of the effort to harmonise and
integrate Europe's fragmented and inefficient air traffic control network.

FT  18 MAR 92 / Brittan seeks to impose fines over French Eurocheque deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR LEON Brittan, the European Community's competition commissioner, is
trying to win approval from his colleagues for the Commission's first fining
of banks as punishment for an allegedly anti-competitive deal struck by
French banks and Eurocheque International, the European cheque guarantee and
cashcard organisation.
However, any fine is unlikely to be heavy, since it would relate to a
first-time offence in the banking sector and because the Eurocheque
agreement expired last year.
The issue was supposed to have been discussed by the Commission today but
was postponed to its meeting next Wednesday, partly because of the potential
sensitivity of such a ruling for French commissioners. Some of Sir Leon's
colleagues also remain unconvinced about the seriousness of the
infringement, arguing that the deal may have in fact helped Eurocheque
expand in France.
The Commission's competition authorities are worried that the 1983 agreement
between Eurocheque, itself operated by a group of European banks, and the
French banks may have discriminated against the use of Eurocheques in
France. Commission officials believe this may have been part of a general
policy on the part of the French banks to encourage the use of cards rather
than cheques.
The Commission does allow under competition rules for EC banks to levy a fee
on Eurocheque customers' accounts each time they use a cheque, which can be
written in any EC currency. But according to Commission officials,
Eurocheque agreed separately with Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which
operates the Visa and Eurocard plastic card networks in France, that the
banks could also earn a fee from traders who accepted Eurocheques in
payment.
Commission officials believe that the agreement might have led French
traders to penalise all customers by marking up prices to cover the fees. At
the same time, officials say that the relatively low penetration of
Eurocheques indicated that French banks were making it difficult for French
clients to use or acquire the cheques.
Dunlop Slazenger International, the UK-based sports goods manufacturer, is
almost certain to be fined by the European Commission today for trying to
prevent its squash and tennis balls being sold cheaply outside Britain.
Brussels says the group has been abusing EC competition rules since 1977.
Newitt, a British sports equipment wholesaler, complained to the Commission
that Dunlop Slazenger, a subsidiary of BTR, the UK holding company, was
restricting continental European sales other than through its own
distributors.
According to the Commission, Dunlop Slazenger refused to sell tennis and
squash balls to wholesalers, or tried to price other exporters out of the
market. In the Netherlands, the Commission alleges that some Dunlop
Slazenger distributors agreed with the British group that they would buy up
cheap exports and sell them at the higher continental price.
The Commission said yesterday it might start to fine 28 Dutch builders'
associations up to Ecu28,000 (Pounds 20,000) a day if they do not wind up an
alleged cartel immediately.
The Commission last month imposed fines of Ecu22.5m on the cartel, which it
said had dominated the Dutch construction industry for the last 12 years. It
also began legal proceedings against the Dutch authorities, which Brussels
believes condoned the restrictive practices.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders are unlikely to finalise spending plans for the
next five years when they meet in Lisbon in June, the president of the
European Parliament said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Mr Egon Klepsch said the parliament would achieve a unified position on the
so-called Delors Two package of budget reforms for 1993 to 1997 by June 'to
give a push to the negotiations.'
'But I am convinced it will be difficult for the council in June to have the
same result as the European Parliament,' he told a news conference at the
end of a two-day visit to Portugal, his first since taking office in
January.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, has proposed a one-third
annual budget increase by 1997, with more spending on foreign aid,
industrial policy and help for the EC's poorest states.
Britain and Germany say the package is unacceptable and France, Belgium and
Italy have reservations.
Portugal has already expressed doubts about being able to complete budget
reforms before Britain takes over the EC presidency in July.
Mr Klepsch, who held talks with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, Foreign
Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro and President Mario Soares, said the
Community had no choice but to agree on a new spending package by its
Edinburgh summit in December.
'On the last day of December the present financial structure of the
Community is finished,' he said.
The European Commission tomorrow launches a new environmental action plan
designed to give the Community a world lead in the move towards sustainable,
or environmentally sound, economic development, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The programme aims to reverse what the EC executive calls a 'slow but
relentless deterioration of the general state of the environment' in the
12-nation bloc that continues despite the adoption of over 200 environmental
laws in the last 20 years.
The strategy, which governments will be asked to endorse but not to approve
in detail, is intended as a key step towards the goal of achieving
sustainable development.

<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION of a large part of the east German shipbuilding industry was
given the green light yesterday by the Treuhand, the government agency
selling off the former communist country's state industry.
The managing board approved an 'international solution': the sale of the
Warnow shipyard and, subject to an improved offer, the Neptun shipyard to
the Kvaerner group in Norway. The MTW shipyard in Wismar and the DMR diesel
engine plant in Rostock is to go to Bremer Vulkan of Germany.
The deal, announced earlier this month, caused a serious political row in
the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the shipbuilding industry is
located. Mr Alfred Gomolka, the Christian Democratic state leader, was
forced to resign this week after originally backing the sale of all three
shipyards to Bremer Vulkan with state financial participation.
Shipbuilding workers demonstrated against the sale outside the headquarters
of the Treuhand. 'A whole region is being unscrupulously wrecked and we will
be forced to leave' Mr Eckhard Reschke, a member of the Works Council at DMR
said angrily.
Shipyard workers favoured the sale of all the shipbuilders to Bremer Vulkan
which had previously saved thousands of shipbuilding jobs in Bremen with the
help of generous state subsidies.
Seven thousand of the present 10,000 jobs in the east German shipbuilding
companies are to be retained until 1995 with stiff fines imposed on the
buyer for violations.
The Treuhand said yesterday that the sale, subject to the expected approval
of the European Commission, would involve a 'considerable' financial
contribution by the agency and the state.
The agency is expected to assume previous debts by the shipbuilding
companies, losses stemming from new orders as well as making investments to
improve productivity totalling up to DM3bn (Pounds 1bn).

holds counter-demonstration after federal court upholds march ban

<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S Mayor David Dinkins threw political caution to the wind yesterday
when he decided to boycott the city's annual St Patrick's Day parade
yesterday because the event's Irish-American organisers had banned an Irish
lesbian and gay organisation from joining the ceremony.
The mayor's decision, which could alienate New York's many Irish voters as
well as other ethnic groups who are Catholic, came in the wake of a federal
court ruling that used a technicality to uphold the banning of gay marchers.
On Monday night, Judge Pierre Leval ruled that the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organisation was too low on the waiting list of groups wishing to join the
parade to be admitted by its sponsors  - the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
Mr Dinkins, who became the first New York City mayor to snub the parade in
38 years, said he would have preferred to have taken up his traditional
position at the head of the parade, but could not do so in good conscience.
'It is a sad day in our city,' he said.
Other leading Democrats who joined the mayor in boycotting the Irish event
included Mr Andrew Stein, the city council president, who plans to challenge
Mr Dinkins for the mayoral nomination next year.
Governor Mario Cuomo, who had not planned to attend, issued a statement in
which he expressed his solidarity with the lesbian and gay group.
Traffic in midtown Manhattan was blocked near the two-mile-long Fifth Avenue
parade route, as an estimated 150,000 marchers danced, sang, played music
and chanted.
Just before the parade began, the Irish gay marchers staged a brief
counter-parade and demonstration near the Plaza Hotel at the south-eastern
corner of Central Park.
An aide to Mr Dinkins said he hoped the decision to boycott the parade would
not cost the mayor votes.
But the political backlash could extend beyond Irish-Americans, especially
since a major supporter of the traditional Irish and Catholic communities is
Cardinal John O'Connor, the outspoken and ultra-conservative archbishop of
New York.
Mr Cornelius Doolan, a 58-year-old native of Cork who served yesterday as
grand marshal of the parade, was said to be sympathetic to the request by
Irish gays to join the march, but Mr Doolan told one local tabloid it was
not his 'function' to get involved in the debate that has gripped the city.
His only comment on the eve of yesterday's parade was: 'You can bet there
will be a parade, darlin''.

MEXICO City's ozone level has hit an all-time high, recording 398 points on
the Imeca air quality scale on Monday. This is four times higher than the
maximum one-hour exposure per year recommended by the World Health
Organisation.
This level, described by the government as 'very dangerous', sparked off an
emergency action plan under which all schools were closed. The programme
which prevents cars from circulating for one day a week was extended to two
days, and 194 of the city's largest industries had to cut production by
between 50 and 75 per cent.
Ozone is a secondary pollutant formed when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides
mix in sunlight. High levels of the pollutant restrict breathing, irritate
the eyes and can cause headaches. In the longer run it may exacerbate lung
diseases.
Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexico City's mayor, said he would announce
measures next week to improve the city's air quality. The government has
recently closed scores of factories for not complying with tougher emission
standards and ordered taxis and minibuses to use cleaner fuels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) was thrown into disarray
yesterday when its deputy chairman, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, mounted a
challenge to the leadership of party chairman Svend Auken.
Mr Auken, 48, has led the party since 1987, but under his leadership the
party, which holds 69 of the 179 seats in the Folketing, has been plagued by
personal conflicts.
More importantly, the small centre parties in the eight-party parliament do
not have confidence in Mr Auken, and, without the support of the centre
parties, the SDP cannot hope to end a 10-year spell in opposition.
Unless Mr Auken withdraws, it is expected the leadership fight will be
settled at an extraordinary party congress in April.
Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, 48, formely the chief economist at the Confederation of
Danish Trade Unions, is a moderate, a strong pro-European, and is respected
in business circles.
His challenge has emerged because the SDP believes the Conservative-Liberal
minority government may run into such serious trouble next autumn that an
election will be called.
With Mr Nyrup Rasmussen at the helm, the party's chances of returning to
office are considered to be greater.
However, Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said yesterday he expects his
government to remain in office until when the next general election would
normally be held, in two-and-a-half-years' time. 'With the problems the
Social Democrats have, I can't see them forcing an election,' he said.

FT  18 MAR 92 / ICL stays in EC research project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, the UK-based computer group, 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu of Japan, is
to work with Bull of France and Siemens-Nixdorf Informations Systems of
Germany on the next stage of an European Community-funded research and
development project called Sesame.
In the aftermath of its acquisition in 1990 ICL was excluded by its European
partners from three other semiconductor research projects under the Joint
European Submicron Silicon Initiative programme.
The EC said yesterday ICL would participate in the three-year second stage
of project Sesame (Secure European System for Applications in a Multivendor
Environment).
The three partners completed the first stage of Sesame last year.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Shares in MTM see-saw as inquiry deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in MTM, the speciality chemicals company, swung wildly yesterday as
the stock exchange investigated circumstances surrounding the company's two
recent profits warnings within six trading days.
As stock exchange officials interviewed analysts about announcements and
briefings made to them by Mr Richard Lines, the company's chairman who
resigned last week, the exchange refused to suspend MTM's shares.
It is understood that Robert Fleming, MTM's advisers, did not give the stock
exchange adequate reason why the shares should be suspended.
MTM's shares closed up 14p at 84p, after falling to 55p, barely a fifth of
their level before Mr Lines's warning on March 2 that disagreement with the
auditors over accounting policy meant profits would be substantially lower
than City expectations.
Fleming asked the exchange for the shares to be suspended before a second
warning on March 9.
In this announcement, MTM admitted that there was a problem with trading
profits and a disagreement over accounting.
MTM's non-executive directors said yesterday that final results, already
postponed, might not be available as anticipated on March 31 because the
auditor, Binder Hamlyn, was investigating the share price fall.
As MTM entered its third week of uncertainty, it emerged that Mr Lines knew
nine months ago about the differences of opinion with his auditors.
Binder Hamlyn wrote to him about the matter in June last year.
Sources close to the company also said that last year MTM was involved
certain questionable transactions that now are receiving closer examination.
The accounting problem revolves around MTM's capitalisation of interest and
development during the start-up and construction of capital projects.
MTM could eventually report trading profits up to 40 per cent lower than the
Pounds 23m pre-tax figure which the City had forecast just before the
profits warning.
The stock exchange is reluctant to suspend a company's shares unless there
are severe financial problems that threaten an orderly market in the shares
or unless it is told that a Department of Trade and Industry or Serious
Fraud Office investigation is to take place.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Appointments: Promotion at Norwich Union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ascendance of a younger generation of management at Norwich Union, the
mutually-owned insurer, was signalled yesterday by the appointment of
38-year-old Philip Scott as general manager (finance). Scott, who will also
become group actuary, is currently senior investment manager responsible for
global securities. He joined Norwich in 1973, has worked within the group's
life and pensions operations and has also had a spell abroad with Norwich's
New Zealand subsidiary, the State Insurance Office.
He replaces Hugh Scurfield, who has been with Norwich since 1959; he was
appointed general manager and actuary in 1983 and has played a leading role
in championing the interests of life policy-holders. He is currently
president of the Institute of Actuaries and will coincidentally retire at
the end of his term of office. Three new assistant general managers have
also been appointed. David Williams takes over responsibility for general
insurance, Geoff Loades takes on a new position as assistant general manager
(customer services) and Patrick Smith assistant general manager (personal
insurances).
Miller flies out
Bill Miller who, with his brother Eric founded Prestwick Holdings, the
printed circuit-board manufacturer based at Ayr in Scotland, is stepping
down from the chairmanship. He is succeeded by Hugh Laughland, a
non-executive director of BTR and chairman of Stoddard Sekers, the
carpet-makers.
The Miller brothers set up Prestwick in 1969 and Bill Miller was involved in
its management until 1990 when, in view of its disappointing performance
since flotation in 1985, he brought in Wayne Osman as ceo and became
non-executive chairman.
Bill Miller and his wife still own about 13 per cent of Prest-wick's shares
and overall the Miller family accounts for about 20 per cent of the equity.
Miller is to pursue his other interests which include the chairmanship of
PIK Ltd, a company set up to run Prest-wick airport which BAA is selling.
Prestwick says Laughland, who was formerly joint ceo of BTR's European
region, will be useful for his experience of international markets as the
company expands.

FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unable to sustain early rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market tried hard to rally yesterday after the weekend round of
public opinions polls proved less negative towards the Conservative
government than Friday afternoon's rumours had suggested. But lack of
genuine investment interest left share prices again vulnerable to
developments in stock index futures, and the FT-SE Index shed a further five
points in its fourth downward session since Budget Day.
International factors were largely brushed aside by London traders, whose
attention is now fixed on the UK general election to be held early next
month. The stock market, which now fears a 'hung' parliament, made little
immediate response yesterday to the first reports of the shadow Budget from
the Labour opposition.
The fall of 619 points in the Nikkei average, bringing the Japanese stock
market to a five-year low, made little immediate impact in London, although
some optimists sugg-ested that increased pressure for a reduction in
Japanese discount rate might enhance the chances of a cut in UK base rates
before the general election. However, neither sterling nor London money
rates gave much encouragement to any lingering base rate optimism.
The stock market this week faces important economic data on the UK economy
which could have significant effect on the voting intentions of the UK
electorate. These will in turn be scrutinised by the opinion pollsters.
Publication of important opinion polls is expected today and tomorrow, while
on Thursday two opinion poll results will coincide with the latest UK
unemployment statistics, to be followed on Friday by the retail price index
(RPI) for February. A satisfactory RPI number could offer the final
opportunity for a pre-election base rate cut.
Against this backcloth, the investment institutions were inclined to stay on
the sidelines. One leading dealer commented that, while unwilling to buy,
fund managers are afraid to sell because they fear that they will be unable
to 'buy the stock back again if the market takes off after the election'.
While most marketmaking firms kept trading books level ahead of the Budget,
some erred on the bullish tack and have suffered losses as they have tried
to reposition themselves through the stock index futures.
Share prices opened higher on relief that the opinion polls had proved less
alarming than feared on Friday, but an early gain of 8.9 on the Footsie was
quickly reversed when the futures market opened. The March contract moved to
a discount, and the underlying blue chip stocks were marked down, often in
minimal trading.
At the day's low point, the Footsie was down 18.3 at 2,457.7, leaving the
2,450 mark unchallenged. As the March future steadied and Wall Street came
in with a gain of 15 points on the Dow in UK hours, the London market
rallied in listless trading.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was a net 5.3 down at 2,470.7. Seaq volume
fell to 363.5m shares from the 555.7m registered in the previous session;
retail, or customer, volume remained high last week, and was worth just over
Pounds 1bn on Friday.
Oil shares provided one of the few firm sectors among the internationals. UK
retail and consumer stocks lacked support, reflecting the fading of base
rate hopes.

FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous day for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in Glaxo was nervous, with early strength eroded by expectations of
bearish developments ahead of a briefing by French government health
officials. The officials were concerned with the pre-launch promotion in
France of Glaxo's migraine drug, Imigran, seen as a potential blockbuster,
but yet to gain approval there.
It had been feared that the French officials might make an announcement on
Glaxo's drug pricing policies. Two weeks ago, the UK pharmaceuticals group
was challenged over its European drug pricing strategy by the Danish Office
of Fair Trading, which made a complaint to the European Commission.
Observers said the combination of an EC inquiry and a government complaint
against a drug still in such early stages of a launch was unheard of. The
shares were off 9 at one stage and closed a net 3 down at 783p.
Lonrho down again
Reports that Lonrho, the international conglomerate, has attracted
institutional criticism of its management methods, together with
confirmation that the group's stockbroker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has reduced
its current-year profits forecast, triggered yet another slide in the
shares.
Dealers said the market was worried that Lonrho might lose its place in the
FT-SE 100-share index. At the close of business yesterday, the stock had
dropped another 10 to 85p, the lowest level since 1985.
Last week Lonrho stock ran into heavy selling as markets reacted to news
that Moody's, the US debt rating agency, had lowered its credit rating on
Dollars 360m-worth of Lonrho Eurobonds.
Moody's rating shift accompanied hints of the UBS downgrading and
suggestions of bearish comments from other broking houses.
Setback for WPP
Advertising group WPP dropped 15 to 80p after reporting a steep fall in
profits and stating that it was continuing talks with its banks about
refinancing. Analysts had forecast profits of Pounds 43m to Pounds 50m, and
WPP managed Pounds 56.1m. However, that figure was boosted by a Pounds 17.7m
exceptional item, a release of provisions.
A number of securities houses were last night adjusting profits forecasts
for the company. BZW, already at the bottom of the analysts' range, cut back
its 1992 estimate by a further Pounds 10m to Pounds 47m after talking to the
company. James Capel lowered its estimate by Pounds 19m to Pounds 42m, with
the agency broker feeling that 'they were terrible figures and it is really
not looking good for this year'.
Fears that events in the Gulf might take a turn for the worse, and even
culminate in military action against Iraqi weapons installations, attracted
a burst of domestic and overseas buying of oil shares.
Dealers said there was evidence of further big switching activity between BP
and Shell, as well as between Shell and Royal Dutch.
The switching business, out of BP and into Shell, still left BP 3 1/2 ahead
at 266 1/2 p on 7.5m, while Shell settled 4 better at 450p on 2.9m.
A note published by BZW was said to have been responsible for boosting
Enterprise Oil, which settled 9 firmer at 371p. The BZW oil team, comparing
Enterprise with Lasmo, said Lasmo's acquisition of Ultramar had placed it
alongside Enterprise and Oryx with reserves in the region of 1bn barrels of
oil equivalents.
BZW said the acquisition has created severe short-term problems and rated
Lasmo shares a sell. But BZW is bullish on Enterprise, saying: 'The
company's potential for dividend growth makes it a buy.' BZW said it saw
fair value for Enterprise as 430p to 500p a share and fair value for Lasmo
as 150p to 180p.
The utilities areas of the market showed further signs of extreme
nervousness, in spite of the more reassuring opinion polls that appeared
over the weekend. In the electricity stocks, Eastern declined 6 to 231p and
East Midland 7 to 241p, while the Electricity Package lost 38 to Pounds
2600.
Northern based brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle slipped 13 to 443p on news that
the Department of Trade and Industry has cleared its deal to take over
wholesale distribution of Whitbread products to free houses in Scotland. S &amp;
N will acquire 215 accounts in Scotland, taking on loans to more than 100.
Whitbread 'A' gained 2 to 424p.
Allied-Lyons put on 4 to 623p, awaiting the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission ruling on its planned brewing venture with Carlsberg. Bass rose 3
to 542p on hopes of an improvement by its Holiday Inn subsidiary.
Guinness continued to suffer from profit-taking ahead of Thursday's figures,
which are expected to produce 1991 profits slightly under Pounds 1bn. The
shares lost 8 to 559p.
Lack of further developments involving the possible take-over of Dalepak
knocked 5 off the shares to 379p, while lines of stock on offer pushed
Associated British Foods down 5 to 415p. United Biscuits firmed a penny to
408p as Smith New Court described the shares as a safe, rather than dynamic,
investment longer term.
Positive market comments boosted Tesco, ahead of the company's results
expected early next month. In heavy turnover of 5.3m, the shares rose 4 to
247p. J. Sainsbury was also active but slipped 4 to 376p on turnover of 3.3m
after mixed reaction from a series of meetings with brokers that resulted in
several analysts downgrading their forecasts.
Political worries and disappointment with last week's Budget weighed on some
leading stores, with Dixons falling 6 to 218p. On the other hand,
nervousness about the implications of a DIY price war appeared to fade.
Kingfisher lost only a penny to 483p and WH Smith 'A' 2 to 454p.
Lloyds Chemists was a firm spot, climbing 3 to 343p on hopes of a successful
acquisition of Macarthy, to reinforce the company's earnings potential
following recent well received interim figures.
Interest in the property sector on Friday proved short-lived as investors
steered clear of the shares, sentiment being affected by declining hopes of
a cut in domestic interest rates. However, MEPC continued to benefit from
Friday's buy recommendation from Smith New Court, edging forward 2 to 332p.
Slough Estates, which stood at 240p two months ago, may have found a floor
after its recent dramatic decline, the shares improving 2 to 178p.
Hotel group Forte's recent good run held out in the wake of broker UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew turning a buyer of the shares on Friday. The stock gained 3
to 232p in volume of 1.4m.
With under a month to the opening of its Paris theme park, Euro Disney was
again the subject of profit-taking after its recent surge which followed
news that it is to join the CAC 40 index in Paris. The shares relinquished
17 to 1638p.
There was further weakness in Thorn-EMI, which lost 6 to 762p in thin
trading. Some in the market believe that the initial positive reception for
its Virgin Music purchase has now receded in the knowledge that the benefits
to the group will be strictly long term.
Speciality chemicals group MTM was erratic as more news emerged from the
company. However, early selling was seen as overdone and the stock shot up
to end 14 higher on the day at 84p.
Laporte shed 12 to 579p ahead of Solvay's placing of 9 per cent of Laporte's
shares and on recent negative comments from analysts. Solvay is placing the
shares to finance the disposal of Interox, the Belgian group's joint venture
with Laporte, and will cancel 16 per cent of Laporte's shares as part of the
deal.
Medeva, which said it was buying the rights to two Hepatitis B products from
Epitec and GA Investments for SFr24m, put on 9 to 278p.
Engineering group Renold jumped 9 1/2 to 55 1/2 p after announcing that TT
Group, the industrial holding company, had acquired a 2.9 per cent stake.
Auction house Christies International was down 12 at 115p after announcing a
dividend cut with its 1991 results.

FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NERVOUS futures market fell away in volatile trading as investors acted
cautiously in the wake of little concrete news to drive sentiment, writes
Christopher Price.
The March contract opened at 2,482 and initially edged ahead as a small
number of buyers came into the market, squeezing it higher.
However, many traders were keen to unwind their positions in a jittery
session and sellers soon moved into the fray compounded by independent
traders being caught short. By 9.30am March was down to 2,455.
Support was found from the cash market and a recovery began, March moving up
to 2,473 by midday. With Wall Street opening weak, however, March came under
renewed pressure, and although it held ground most of the afternoon, a late
selling spree saw the contract close at 2,462, down 5 from the previous
session and at a discount of nearly 11 to its four-point fair value premium
to cash. Turnover came to 7,319 contracts.
In traded options, nearly half of the 33,000 contracts dealt were in the
FT-SE 100 or Euro FT-SE. Asda was the top traded equity contract, followed
by Barclays - the March 360 puts were particularly in demand - and Glaxo.

early decline

Wall Street
US EQUITIES shrugged off the drop in Tokyo yesterday and moved modestly in a
session dominated by programme trading, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a marginal 0.45 up on balance at
3,236.36 after having fallen more than 24 points by midsession. Volume was
exceptionally thin, with only 155.9m shares changing hands. On the big
board, declining issues still outscored advances by 928 to 771. On Friday,
the Dow gained 27.28 at 3,235.91.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost just 0.55 on the day at 406.39 and in the
secondary market the Nasdaq composite was finally a mere 0.68 off at 617.94.
Motor companies dominated trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday
after Chrysler named Mr Robert Eaton to succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as chairman.
Mr Eaton, previously chairman of General Motors Europe, will initially join
Chrysler as vice-chairman and chief operating officer before taking over at
the end of the year.
Ford led the big three automakers in terms of volume, adding Dollars 1 1/8
at Dollars 37 3/4 . Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/4 and
General Motors held steady at Dollars 37 1/8 .
Among other active issues, Weyerhaeuser, the forest products company,
climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham
increased its first-quarter earnings estimate for the company.
Eastman Kodak fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 after the photographic
equipment concern said that it does not expect its business to rebound in
the first quarter. However, Kodak added that it expects to post good gains
for the year.
Pfizer, the big pharmaceutical group, weakened a further Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 70 1/2 . The stock started to tumble on Friday amid concern that
risks associated with the company's Shiley heart valves might be greater
than had been previously thought.
Sports shoe maker Nike dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 after posting
third-quarter profits of Dollars 1.08 a share, against 93 cents a year ago.
Shares in the group's competitor, Reebok, were unmoved at Dollars 32 5/8 ,
while LA Gear eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 1/4 .
Unisys was one of the strongest big board issues yesterday, climbing Dollars
 7/8 to Dollars 10. Mr James Unruh, the company's chairman and chief
executive, predicted first-quarter profits in spite of continued weakness in
the US economy and very competitive conditions in the computer industry.
Unisys had a loss of Dollars 98m, or 79 cents a share, in the 1991 first
quarter.
In over-the-counter trading, Good Guys tumbled Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 18
3/4 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its recommended list. Canada
RISING interest rates helped to spark a broad-based sell-off on the Toronto
market in solid turnover.
The composite index dropped 31.6 to 3,444.1, while declining issues outpaced
advances by 415 to 165 after volume of 30.7m shares.
Every sub-group except pipelines posted a loss. Golds showed the largest
decline, ending down 2.06 per cent. Spot gold was quoted at USDollars 343.75
an ounce, down USDollars 3, in New York. Transportation lost 2.03 per cent
and financial services fell 1.49 per cent.
Investors are worried about rising interest rates, a sagging Canadian
dollar, flat corporate earnings and Canada's constitutional problems,
commented an analyst.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts lifted by failure of Labour to
advance in polls

UK GOVERNMENT bond prices ended yesterday slightly higher than at their
Friday close, helped by weaker-than-expected showings for the opposition
Labour party in weekend opinion polls.
The Liffe gilt futures contract, which closed at 94.19 on Friday, opened at
94.29 after opinion polls at the weekend failed to show a large Labour lead
in the UK general election campaign. The market had fallen back on Friday on
expectations that Labour would show a six-point lead in the weekend polls.
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell to a low of 94.10 before picking up
again to trade at 94.25 by late afternoon on a volume of about 22,500.
Traders said gilts slipped back after the Labour party announced its
alternative budget proposals, but the US Treasury bond market helped to lift
gilt prices as it picked up slightly later in the day.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 112 23/32 and
slipped back to trade at 112 5/8 by late afternoon to yield 9.82 per cent.
US TREASURIES marked time yesterday in thin, range-bound trading as the
market waited for a slew of economic statistics for February slated for
release today.
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was quoted  1/8 lower at 99 3/32 ,
yielding 8.07 per cent after posting slim gains in morning trading.
Shorter-dated maturities were unchanged to narrowly higher, with the
three-year note unchanged on the day to yield 5.84 per cent.
The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system by arranging
three-day system repurchase agreements. Fed funds - the rate at which banks
lend to each other - were trading at 4 1/8 per cent when the Fed entered the
market. The Fed's operation was widely expected. The perceived target for
Fed Funds is 4 per cent.
Although the long bond received some attention in Tokyo as investors turned
their sights to bonds amid a falling stock market, there was little to move
the US Treasury market yesterday.
For the most part, participants were waiting for today's release of the
February consumer price index, housing starts and industrial production
figures.
GERMAN government bonds drifted lower in dull trade as many dealers and
investors continue to wait for further developments on the wage front. The
bund futures contract was trading at around 87.97 by late afternoon,
compared with 88.04 on Friday afternoon.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday that it was inviting banks to tender for
an issue of medium-term Treasury notes on March 24. The notes are being
launched for the Unity Fund, which was set up after the reunification of
Germany.
THE fall in the Nikkei stock index yesterday to below the psychologically
important 20,000 level - its lowest level in five years - helped to push up
Japanese government bonds, although bond prices ended either unchanged or
only slightly firmer after profit-taking.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.435 per cent,
traded in a range of 5.405 per cent to 5.44 per cent and ended the day at
5.425 per cent.
The futures contract rose from its opening of 102.31 to a high of 102.51
before closing at 102.34.
Traders said the Bank of Japan remained neutral in its money market
operations, giving no indication of an easing in interest rates. However,
the market is hoping the Bank of Japan will soon cut the official discount
rate.

NIKE, the US sport shoes group, yesterday reported strong international
sales growth and an advance in profits for the third quarter, Reuter reports
from Seattle.
The company said worldwide orders for its athletic footwear and apparel
scheduled for delivery between March and July 1992 was about Dollars 1.4bn,
up 15 per cent over the same period a year earlier.
In the third quarter, the group lifted net earnings to Dollars 82.5m from
Dollars 70.7m the previous year which took earnings per share for the period
to Dollars 1.08, against 93 cents. Revenues advanced to Dollars 867m from
Dollars 802.2m.
Nike said it expected to achieve higher earnings in its fourth fiscal
quarter ending May 31. In the same period of 1991, the group earned 76 cents
a share, down from 89 cents.
Mr Philip Knight, chairman, said the company's strong international growth
was highlighted in Germany, where it posted a 59 per cent rise in sales.
He added that the boost in sales in Germany had moved it to the number two
sales spot in that country for the first time, ahead of Puma, and gaining
ground on its rival, Adidas.
'In the US, where we have maintained our 31 per cent market share, future
orders indicate renewed domestic growth will occur in the next quarter,' he
added.

<TEXT>
UNISYS, the struggling US computer manufacturer, said that it expects to be
profitable in the current first quarter in spite of continuing market
weakness and a tough competitive environment.
After several years of heavy losses, Unisys returned to profitability in the
fourth quarter of 1991. The company now expects 'a small profit in the
seasonally weak first quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 98m, or 79
cents a share, in the first quarter last year', said Mr James Unruh, Unisys
chairman and chief executive.
'Clearly, we consider a first quarter profit another significant milestone
in our recovery. Given the environment, a profit was not a sure thing. We
remain very cautious about global economic conditions, particularly in the
first half. But we have not altered our view of 1992 as a profitable, though
difficult year,' Mr Unruh told Wall Street analysts yesterday.
Outlining Unisys' strategy, he said that the company aims to lower its costs
in order to maintain profitability in spite of weak business conditions.
With 'our continually improving cost structure, any incremental revenue we
can generate will have a positive impact on the bottom line,' he said.
Mr Unruh said that Unisys plans to continue to reduce its Dollars 3bn debt
and that the company expects to generate more than Dollars 700m in cash flow
from operations in 1992.
'We believe we were early among our computer systems competitors to reshape
our business to the new realities of our industry. There is no easy or rapid
way to solve today's challenges. But we have indeed made a new start and
will begin in 1992 to reap the benefits."

<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the US photographics group, said it did not expect a recovery
in business during the first quarter of this year, Reuter reports from New
York.
In the annual report, Mr Kay Whitmore, company chairman, said the first
quarter 'will be a difficult one for the company'.
He said any improvement in the US economy and in Europe would not be
perceptible until the second half of 1992.
The company said sales in its imaging division during January and February
were slightly lower than in the comparable period a year ago. Sales in the
information division were down on last year while those in chemicals were
level with those posted in the early months of last year.
In the health division, good sales gains had been recorded, the company
said.
For the year as a whole, Kodak said it saw 'moderately higher sales and good
gains' in earnings.
Mr Whitmore said that recovery in the company results would be more gradual
than abrupt.
'Beyond this year, recovery in our business results should be more
pronounced,' he said, with rates of return 'superior to those of our peers'.
Kodak recently announced a new group of improved Kodak Gold Plus colour
negative film for consumers, and plans to launch a new Photo CD system this
summer.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Tenneco creates position of
chief operating officer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENNECO, the US conglom-erate in the throes of a restructuring, yesterday
named Mr Dana Mead, 56, as chief operating officer, a new position at the
company.
Mr Mead, formerly executive vice-president and director of International
Paper, will have primary responsibility for Tenneco's operating divisions.
He will be named president in addition to chief operating officer in May,
when Mr Michael Walsh, the group's recently-appointed chief executive,
becomes Tenneco's chairman.
Mr Walsh said Mr Mead 'will play an important role in moving Tenneco towards
our goal of consistent profitability and growth'.
In addition to his 14 years at International Paper, Mr Mead was a professor
of social sciences at West Point, the US military academy, from 1974 to
1978. From 1972 to 1974 he was deputy director of domestic council in Mr
Richard Nixon's administration.
Mr Mead's appointment is part of a programme of change at the company since
Mr Walsh took the helm last autumn.
There is considerable pressure on Mr Walsh to turn round Tenneco's
lacklustre performance of the past few years - including severe losses at
its J. I. Case agricultural and construction equipment business.

<TEXT>
WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, said net profit rose 24 per cent to Fl
214m (Dollars 114m) in 1991. It forecast increases in profit and turnover
for 1992.
The company, one of the Netherlands' Big Three publishers, said yesterday it
would raise its 1991 dividend to Fl 1.16 a share from Fl 1.00 in 1990.
Operating profit in 1991 increased by nearly 30 per cent to Fl 362m, on
turnover up 17 per cent at Fl 2.38bn. The company said two core business
activities in particular - legal and medical publishing  - saw the biggest
gains in operating results.
Wolters Kluwer, which is also active in business, scientific and educational
publishing, operates mainly in Europe and the US.
The 1991 results include Fl 6m in after-tax extraordinary charges for
reorganisations being carried out in the UK and the Netherlands. In 1990,
Wolters Kluwer incurred net extraordinary charges of Fl 3m.
Wolters Kluwer repeated its previous medium-range forecast that turnover
would reach Fl 2.7bn in 1994, and that it would see at least 17 per cent
annual growth in fully-diluted profit per share between now and then.
In 1991, net profit per share rose by 17 per cent to Fl 3.46.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nestle wins crucial case in
battle for Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, won a crucial round in its fight for control
of the Perrier mineral water group when a French court yesterday invalidated
the purchase of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French
sugar company.
Saint Louis is allied to Italy's Agnelli family, Nestle's opponents in its
FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.41bn) bid for Perrier.
This is the second big court case Nestle has won in the battle. Ten days
ago, another French court froze the voting rights on part of the Perrier
shares owned by Exor, the property group that controls Perrier for which the
Agnellis are in the throes of an agreed FFr5.6bn offer.
These cases will be critical in determining Nestle's chance of winning
Perrier. The Agnelli camp, which controlled almost 49 per cent of the voting
shares, could have blocked the Swiss group's bid, but this stake is now
reduced to 31 per cent, increasing Nestle's room for manoeuvre.
Yesterday's case hinged on whether Perrier had sold the block of new shares
to Saint Louis as part of a concert party to block Nestle's bid.
However Nestle, which joined with Indosuez, the French bank, in bidding for
Perrier, will almost certainly have to raise its offer because Exor recently
mounted a counter-bid for the rest of the mineral water company's shares at
FFr1,475, the same price as Nestle.
Perrier's shares rose FFr14 to FFr1,650 in Paris yesterday on expectation of
a counter-bid. Analysts agreed Nestle would not have to bid much above the
market price to win control unless the Agnellis, who stand to make a profit
on their Perrier shares, launch another counter-bid.
Conversely the Agnellis, who have been pitted against their old ally, BSN,
the French food group which has aligned itself with Nestle by mounting a
FFr6bn counter-bid for Exor, could decide to negotiate a settlement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYERISCHE Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank) plans to raise around
DM910m (Dollars 545m) in the next few months, through a one-for-six rights
issue, to help finance its expansion.
Like other German banks, the Munich-based institution experienced a big jump
in profits last year. In the first 10 months, operating profits rose 24 per
cent to DM1.1bn. Partial operating profits, which exclude trading on the
bank's own account, were 11 per cent higher at DM972m.
The bank said the new shares would be offered at DM330 each, probably from
the end of April, and would rank for the full 1992 dividend. Yesterday,
Hypo-Bank's shares closed at DM343, down DM2.
Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executive, hinted in December that a capital
increase might be implemented this year in line with the growth of the
bank's business.
Hypo-Bank has been expanding in east Germany, where it has 27 branches, and
has just opened a subsidiary in Prague.
Part of last year's higher earnings are being used to increase the bank's
provisions against uninsured Soviet debt. Cover is being raised from a
quarter of its exposure of nearly DM600m to more than two-thirds. It is
keeping the dividend unchanged at DM13 a share.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: The soft seller forced to make the hardest
sell - The options facing WPP in its struggle to reduce borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS fortunate that Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, appears to
relish a challenge. He clearly has an enormous one on his hands.
On top of yesterday's announcement that pre-tax profits had fallen by 38 per
cent in 1991, leaving underlying trading profits of just Pounds 38.4m, it
now seems that WPP is about to try to raise up to Dollars 200m (Pounds
113.6m) from disposals to reduce its heavy debt burden.
With world advertising revenues unlikely to grow by more than 1 per cent
this year, it is hardly the best time to be making fire-sales.
Nevertheless, Mr Sorrell may have little real choice. He confirmed yesterday
that he has plans to re-organise WPP, which has two of the world's best
advertising brand names, J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
The long-promised sale of the US agency Scali McCabe Sloves, which WPP
acquired in May 1989, will steam ahead. In November 1990 Scali lost the
Dollars 40m Volvo account when it was revealed that a Volvo commercial
featuring the safety aspects of the brand had been rigged.
Yesterday Mr Sorrell said he had a 'moral obligation' to sell the agency; in
February this year Scali gained renewed confidence - and probably increased
value - when it won Mercedes' Dollars 115m North American account.
Disposal of all or part of WPP's market research subsidiaries - Millward
Brown International, MRG Group and Research International - is another
likely move. Flotation on the Tokyo stock exchange of a minority stake in
its Far Eastern advertising interests is also on the cards.
Mr Sorrell said that such moves would, on a 'conservative' estimate, result
in proceeds of some Dollars 200m; he estimated that the group had a
'short-term cash need over the next year' of some Dollars 100m. The
timetable for all three actions was 'the sooner the better', though
certainly before the end of 1992.
The imperative behind the decision to make disposals and attempt flotations
clearly comes from WPP's banks rather than from Mr Sorrell, who described
the relationship with the co-ordinating committee - formed by Bankers Trust,
JP Morgan, Citibank and Barclays' - of his 25 bankers as 'constructive and
productive'.
The albatross round the neck of WPP is its heavy debt burden incurred
through big acquisitions made in the 1980s.
At the end of 1990, WPP became concerned that it was likely to breach
covenants on its medium-term loans. It renegotiated its borrowings, putting
in place a new medium-term facility of Dollars 400m, to be repaid or
refinanced by June 1993. In addition, a Dollars 604.5m term loan is to be
repaid in semi-annual instalments over four years from June 1993.
It has not drawn fully on those facilities but its debt still averaged
Pounds 472m last year against Pounds 432m in 1990. It ended 1991 at Pounds
334m against Pounds 297m at December 1990.
According to one analyst, without the release of some Pounds 17.8m of
exceptional items to boost 1991's pre-tax profits to Pounds 56.1m, WPP would
have breached its banking covenants.
Even if Mr Sorrell manages to raise as much as Dollars 200m from the
re-organisations he has in mind, that will probably not be enough; 'even
with disposals, no way are they going to meet their banking covenants' is
the view of one analyst.
Another analyst, Mr Richard Dale of Smith New Court, said that 1991's
performance 'was worse than expected; in the current year we expect revenues
to be at best flat, and pre-tax profits to be about around Pounds 40m,
giving interest rate cover of 1.8 times, below that required by banks. It is
therefore not surprising that they are now talking to the banks again.'
Moreover, it is increasingly unlikely that WPP will be able to meet its debt
repayment obligations for 1993.
One solution - which Mr Sorrell continues to disparage  - might be the sale
of one of his two world-leading international advertising agency networks.
But even without Mr Sorrell's well-known opposition to such a notion, with
the slump in advertising the price that could be obtained for either would
hardly match the sort of figures Mr Sorrell paid for them - Dollars 566m for
JWT in 1987 and Dollars 864m for O&amp;M in 1989.
Mr Sorrell therefore needs to maintain a productive relationship with his
bankers.
The view of another analyst is that 'it is not in the banks' interest to put
WPP into receivership', since the core value of the group's business is in
people and property, neither of which can be easily valued, least of all
given 1991's 3 per cent collapse (in real terms) in international
advertising revenue and a property slump.
Not for the first time, bankers may find themselves over a barrel with
little choice but to come to the aid of an ailing company, in the hope that
it will all come right.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Eaton to take over at Chrysler: Iacocca's successor to come
from General Motors Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running search for a new head of Chrysler, the third biggest US
carmaker, ended yesterday when Mr Robert Eaton, the president of General
Motors Europe, was named to succeed Mr Lee Iacocca as Chrysler's chairman
and chief executive.
Mr Eaton, 52, takes over when Mr Iacocca steps down on December 31, but will
take office immediately as Chrysler's vice-chairman and chief operating
officer.
The naming of Mr Eaton followed a weekend of activity at the company. Mr
Eaton flew to New York, where he met Mr Iacocca and a group of Chrysler
directors for a meeting that lasted until midnight on Saturday. Mr Iacocca
said yesterday the board had considered a dozen candidates over the past six
months.
The man seen as the main victim of Mr Eaton's appointment is Mr Robert Lutz,
the former head of Ford Europe who joined Chrysler in 1986. Mr Lutz said
yesterday he would continue as Chrysler president, reporting to a revived
Office of the Chairman that will consist of Mr Iacocca and Mr Eaton.
Mr Lutz, whose strengths lie in inspiring distinctively designed and
engineered cars, was perceived by many as heir apparent. His position seemed
to be strengthened last month after the abrupt departure of another
candidate for the top job, Mr Robert Miller, the vice-chairman who helped Mr
Iacocca to bring Chrysler back from the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago.
Mr Eaton will face significant managerial and financial challenges.
Chrysler, in common with other US carmakers, is suffering from weak US
consumer demand, and strong competition from Japanese and European car
imports.
One of the key issues for Mr Eaton is whether to seek a merger or joint
development venture with a non-US vehicles company. In 1990 Chrysler broke
off alliance talks with Fiat of Italy. Chrysler, with around 90 per cent of
its revenues in the US, has the smallest overseas presence of the Big Three
of Detroit.
Mr Lutz is said to have angered Mr Iacocca last summer when he was quoted in
a Detroit newspaper comparing Chrysler to a 'dying woman who wasn't getting
any marriage proposals'. Mr Iacocca said yesterday that Chrysler had enough
products to compete without needing a merger for at least five years.
After the news, Chrysler's shares edged Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 17.

<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company,
yesterday announced measures designed to show investors that its management
was 'locked in' to the company for the foreseeable future after its proposed
flotation in June.
The flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.7bn), will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in New
York, London, and Tokyo. The group made a preliminary filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington on Friday.
The Shannon-based group is to split the roles of chairman and chief
executive which have been held by its founder, Dr Tony Ryan, since 1985.
Mr Maurice Foley, president, who had planned to retire from his executive
duties in October, is to become chief executive where he will remain for at
least two years. Dr Ryan, whose contract expires in March 1994, has agreed
to stay on as chairman until mid-1996. In light of the UK's sensitivity to
corporate governance Sir John Harvey-Jones, joint deputy chairman, said: 'It
is particularly appropriate with a public listing in view to split the roles
of chief executive and chairman.'
The rest of the senior management has agreed to stay on for at least two
years after the float.
Advisers to the group have not yet agreed with the company how many shares,
if any, the directors should be allowed to sell during the flotation. The
advisers are keen that the management should be seen to have full confidence
in the group.
Dr Ryan owns around 8 per cent of the stock which could be worth around
Dollars 200m. The rest of the management owns around 5 per cent of the
shares.
There is unlikely to be any selling by the management for a period of six to
12 months after the sale to help create a stable aftermarket.
Advisers to the group are keen to simplify the complex share structure of
the group. Dr Ryan's shareholding is held in A ordinary shares, which pay
out his remuneration in dividends linked to the group's profits.
This is likely to be converted into ordinary shares. However, the advisers
cannot unilaterally end the arrangement, which has tax advantages, and are
negotiating a lump sum with Dr Ryan as compensation for converting his stock
into ordinary shares.

FT  17 MAR 92 / WPP falls 38% and pays no dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, yesterday reported a 38
per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991; they fell from Pounds 90m to
Pounds 56.1m, although without exceptional items, pre-tax profits were
Pounds 38.36m.
Group revenues fell by nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 1.26bn), on
turnover down 7 per cent to Pounds 5.08bn (Pounds 5.46bn). Earnings per
share fell 64 per cent, from 78.1p to 27.9p and, as in 1990, no dividend is
to be paid.
The results were slightly worse than expected by analysts and WPP blamed
falling advertising expenditure for its profits' collapse. 1991 was the
first year since 1983 when the group's profitability did not improve.
The group shed 8 per cent of its staff during the year (from 22,308 to
20,514), but salary costs shrank only 2.3 per cent. Staff costs amount to 55
per cent of group revenues. WPP also has 10 per cent of its worldwide office
space surplus to requirements, costing about Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.7m)
annually.
The group sector revenues most badly affected were non-media advertising
(such as sales promotion and design), down 13 per cent; and public
relations, down 11 per cent. Hill and Knowlton, WPP's public relations
branch, recorded a loss.
However, strategic marketing services' revenues grew 8 per cent, and the
group gained net new accounts worth Pounds 995m during the year, equivalent
to more than Pounds 149m of net new revenues.
Revenues fell 8.8 per cent in the US and 5.5 per cent in the UK but rose 1.4
per cent elsewhere.
Operating margins fell to 7 per cent from 10.5 per cent; WPP's interest bill
was Pounds 45.8m in 1991 against Pounds 42.9 in 1990.
By the end of the year, net debt increased to Pounds 334m against Pounds
297m at the end of 1990, although the group traded within its banking
covenants during 1991. WPP warned that, as little prospect of economic
recovery was in sight for 1992, debt repayments scheduled for 1993 might
need renegotiation. Last April, WPP completed a financial restructuring
package; consolidating Dollars 270m of working capital facilities, a Dollars
604m medium-term loan and Dollars 100m of uncommitted facilities into a
committed medium-term facility. The Dollars 604m loan must be repaid over
four years from June 1993. The rest is to be repaid or refinanced by June
1993.
WPP's banks are now likely to push for asset disposals in the US -
particularly the advertising agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves - and in Asia to
smooth debt renegotiations.
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 55m and Pounds
75m for 1992. Lex, Page 22; Soft seller, Page 25; Market, Page 42

FT  17 MAR 92 / Detroit's wheel of fate spins once more
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
History seemed to repeat itself yesterday for Mr Lee Iacocca, the flamboyant
boss of Chrysler, in the corporate politics surrounding the naming of Mr
Robert Eaton as his successor.
In the late 1970s Mr Iacocca was the brash second-in-command at Ford,
champing at the bit for Mr Henry Ford to step aside so that he could take
over. In 1978, when Mr Ford demurred, Mr Iacocca left Ford for Chrysler.
Mr Iacocca, now a slightly tarnished hero of 1980s corporate America, has
lately found himself in the same role that Mr Ford was playing.
Mr Robert Lutz, the Swiss-born Chrysler president hired by Mr Iacocca in
1986 from a languishing career in the senior ranks of Ford, seemed to many
to be Mr Iacocca's heir apparent. But he has been at odds with Mr Iacocca
for months, making no secret of his desire to succeed him.
Mr Iacocca's reputation as the American folk hero who led Chrysler back from
the brink a decade ago has been compromised by the company's renewed losses.
That has not stopped him playing the same trick on Mr Lutz that Mr Ford had
played on him back in 1978, however.
The question now is whether Mr Lutz, effectively demoted, will stay on under
Mr Eaton. Mr Lutz admitted he was 'disappointed' yesterday, but pledged to
stay on. And Mr Iacocca, with characteristic hyperbole, called reports of a
rift between him and Mr Lutz 'crap with a capital C'.
A second issue is whether Mr Iacocca, 67, will be able to restrain himself
when he retires at the end of this year. He will stay on as a board member
and chairman of the executive committee, giving him a platform from which to
keep an eye on his successor - and continue his trenchant criticism of
Japan.
Yesterday, Mr Iacocca promised he would not be 'a big force' after he hands
over to Mr Eaton. It was noticeable, however, that at yesterday's press
conference Mr Eaton embraced Mr Iacocca's protectionist views. He said he
used to favour free trade, but now supports Mr Iacocca.
Dealing with his predecessor is only one of Mr Eaton's problems. Chrysler
lost Dollars 795m (Pounds 452m) last year, compared with 1990 earnings of
Dollars 68m.
By comparison with the Dollars 4.5bn lost by General Motors in 1991, this
seems small. But it will not be easy for Chrysler to improve its financial
health quickly. Much of this year's hopes are pinned on two new product
launches: the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the LH series of mid-sized saloons.
Mr Iacocca made clear last month that Chrysler expects to suffer a
significantly larger first quarter 1992 pre-tax loss than the Dollars 74m
deficit of the last quarter of 1991.
The company's credit rating has been lowered to junk bond status. Its
Chrysler Financial consumer credit subsidiary needs to refinance Dollars
2.9bn of maturing debt this year and a further Dollars 1bn in the first half
of 1993.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Two more Blue Arrow trials sought: Serious Fraud Office
intends to prosecute four remaining defendants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office intends to mount two further trials against the
four remaining defendants in the Blue Arrow scandal, it emerged yesterday.
No formal announcement has yet been made by the SFO. However, it is clear
that in spite of the mixed result of the first trial, the SFO intends to
proceed against all four individuals still charged with conspiracy to
defraud the markets over the result of the 1987 rights issue.
At a court hearing to be held on April 6, the SFO will ask the judge, Mr
Justice McKinnon, to split the proceedings and hold two trials.
If he agrees, the first trial is expected to be against Mr Paul Smallwood
and Mr Timothy Brown. Both men were equity sales directors for UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew Securities and were present at the crucial meeting on September 28
1987 when the advisers to the issue agreed to buy their secret holdings in
Blue Arrow.
Both men are still employed by P&amp;D although neither has been involved in the
conduct of investment work since the publication of the Department of Trade
and Industry report on the rights issue in 1989.
The second trial is expected to be against Mr Charles Villiers, the former
chairman of County NatWest, and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, the merchant bank's
former compliance director.
Although both are still charged with conspiracy to defraud, some close to
the trial believe the charges against Mr Villiers and Ms Brimelow could be
altered following the outcome of the first trial.
Before delivering his summing up in the first trial which ended last month,
Mr Justice McKinnon dramatically cut the indictment and told the jury to
consider only the late buying of shares on the night of September 28.
Neither Mr Villiers nor Ms Brimelow was present at the meeting when the
decision was taken to buy shares late to increase the take-up level
presented to other investors from 38 per cent to 49 per cent.
The court hearing on April 6 will also consider the timetabling of future
proceedings. The first Blue Arrow trial - which resulted in the conviction
of only four of the original 10 defendants - prompted widespread criticism
for its length. Mr Justice McKinnon himself said it had imposed an
unacceptable burden on all concerned.
Those close to the case agree that further trials would be considerably
shorter than Blue Arrow One which lasted a year and four days.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Security services accused by MPs over 'supergun'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH intelligence was yesterday accused of misleading parliament over the
Iraqi 'supergun' affair by three Labour members of a House of Commons select
committee.
However, a trade and industry committee report stopped short of censuring
the security services.
The committee's two-year investigation into the saga blamed inadequate
procedures and misjudgments by civil servants, rather than ministers or the
intelligence services, for failing to prevent the manufacture and export of
supergun components by British companies.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, accused the government
of an 'attempted whitewash' before the general election and pledged to
launch an independent inquiry into the affair if Labour wins.
'It is now clear the British government knew of plans for a supergun long
before the official admission in April 1990,' he said. 'I want to know from
the prime minister who knew what and when, and which ministers were
involved.'
The committee's report concludes that 'knowledge within the government of
the project was like a number of people all holding pieces of a jigsaw
without realising that they were the pieces of the same jigsaw'.
Both the Ministry of Defence and Department of Trade and Industry are
censured for taking decisions on the basis of telephone conversations with
no written record, or reference to management and ministers.
The report also criticises the DTI for not requesting more documents when
Sheffield Forgemasters and Walter Somers, the British companies which made
barrel sections for the project, applied for export licences in summer 1988;
for failing to link the two orders and to keep them under continued
scrutiny; and for not checking its records and connecting the contracts with
information about the Iraqi project circulated to government departments in
late 1989.
In spite of claims during the committee's hearings that British intelligence
was kept fully briefed about the project by the supergun's designer, Dr
Gerald Bull, an amendment specifically censuring the security services was
not included in the report.
It concludes that 'the long-range gun affair raises serious and important
questions about the accountability of the intelligence services both to
ministers and to parliament'.
The attack against the intelligence services came from the Labour MPs, Mr
Doug Hoyle, Mr Jim Cousins and Mr Stan Crowther. At a sometimes heated news
conference yesterday, Mr Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, said he found it
'almost impossible to imagine' that British and other foreign intelligence
services were not aware of the project from its inception.
Mr Cousins, MP for Newcastle Central, said he was in 'absolutely no doubt
that parliament was deceived about this matter. Either the intelligence
services knew about this from the beginning or they are grossly incompetent
and ought to be sacked'.
Mr Keith Hampson, Conservative MP for Leeds North-West, wanted the report's
publication delayed after documents relating to the affair came to light
last week.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Appeal to voters on eve of S African reform poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BLACK and white leaders warned white South Africans yesterday that turmoil
and destruction lay ahead if they failed to endorse President FW de Klerk's
reform strategy in today's referendum.
'The referendum is a date with destiny,' Mr de Klerk said in a final appeal
to voters as township tensions heightened in advance of today's poll of
South Africa's 3.3m whites.
The death toll since the referendum campaign began three weeks ago yesterday
rose to more than 270 as further violence broke out in townships around
Johannesburg and Durban. Street battles erupted in Soweto and Alexandra near
Johannesburg, where dusk-to-dawn curfews have been imposed. At least 14
people have died in the two townships since Sunday.
Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, urged whites
to vote yes. A no vote would be a 'tragic mistake' which would 'give rise to
a great deal of turmoil, perhaps unprecedented', Mr Mandela told a local
radio station.
Any attempt by the rightwing Conservative party to re-introduce apartheid
would 'be resisted with all the power at our command,' he said.
Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister, in one of the bluntest speeches the
campaign, painted a bleak picture of the consequences of voting against the
reform process. 'On one hand, you can vote for your own destruction . . . on
the other hand, you can vote for the continuation of the negotiation
process,' he said.
Mr Botha told a lunchtime meeting in Johannesburg's City Hall: 'I predict
not a single government in the world would recognise a government based on
the policies of the Conservative party.'
Dr Zach de Beer, leader of the liberal Democratic party, echoing Mr Botha
warned that a no vote would 'cause immediate large scale internal conflict'.
Dr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative party, used the last day
of campaigning to stress one of the right wing's most effective points:
voters were being asked to endorse negotiations which would lead to a new
constitution, but would not be given a chance to decide whether they
approved it. His party has tried to persuade undecided voters that a yes
vote gives the government a blank cheque.
'I urge the white nation to say 'no' - and opt for a second chance to vote.
An election will give you the opportunity to examine each party's policy in
detail.'
Results of the referendum will be released tomorrow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two explanations for the admission by Christies International that
its reduced dividend will form the basis for future payments. Either it is
bravely doing what many other companies should do and admitting to long
delays before profits recover. Or it simply cannot disguise the dire state
of the art business.
There is not much chance of a rescue from Japan, whose once lavish spenders
have now turned sellers. With the shares on an exorbitant forward multiple
of around 35, the market will probably extract a price for candour, whatever
its motivation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Source Perrier looks to have swung decisively in favour of
Nestle thanks to yesterday's court decision to cancel a 13.8 per cent stake
in the French water company previously controlled by the rival Agnelli camp.
Combined with an earlier ruling, the effect is to reduce the Agnellis'
voting stake from 49 per cent to 32 per cent, just below what is needed for
a blocking minority.
If the market is right and the heavyweight Swiss group wins the subsequent
auction, minority shareholders will hardly complain. The current saga
admittedly began with an attempt at creeping control, while the legal
obstacle course facing the two sides has hardly proved to be good publicity
outside France. On the other hand, the final price offered for Societe
Generale de Belgique in 1988 demonstrated that on the rare occasions when
bidding wars do develop on the continent minorities can be the winners.

FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one thing not paying a dividend. It is quite another publishing a
profit and loss account drawn up to a specification laid down by your banks.
That at any rate seems to be the reality of yesterday's decision by WPP to
release Pounds 44m of property provisions and other excess liabilities as
exceptional items, thereby enabling the heavily indebted group to comply
with its interest rate covenants for last year.
The question is whether the lenders will be so easily satisfied in 1992.
Notwithstanding a slightly disappointing dip in WPP's 1991 revenues, they
can at least derive some encouragement from operating margins which were
better than Saatchi's and from the recent new business success. On current
trading assumptions, however, the probability is that they will shortly be
confronted with a request for new cash. Asset disposals may be part of the
price for continuing support, with Scali, McCabe; market research; and the
Far Eastern advertising operations the three favourite candidates. While
Tokyo's fall is hardly helpful in this regard, a more significant worry is
whether the drop in interest charges which would result from such sales
would not be largely offset by a loss of cash flow.
The risk for ordinary shareholders remains a Saatchi style capital
reconstruction which would hugely dilute their interest. Without it, the
shares might be cheap. But the fact that the combination of WPP's fully
diluted market capitalisation, average net debt, and payment obligations to
senior staff represents 55 per cent of gross revenues - as opposed to 65 per
cent in Saatchi's case - reflects the market's continuing unease.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei's drop below 20,000 makes it all the harder to justify buying
Japanese equities. The fresh scandal at Daiwa Securities and the weakness of
the yen have reduced the scope for the authorities to implement effective
rescue measures for the market. Perhaps that explains why some investors
were clutching at straws in pointing out that, whereas the Nikkei fell 3 per
cent yesterday, the broadly-based Topix index fell only 1.3 per cent. That
went against the recent trend for the Topix. Equally, selling pressure by
corporate investment 'tokkin' funds approaching their year-end was not
strong enough to explain the slide in equities.
At least the calm reaction in London and New York to the Nikkei's fall
suggests that concern over the broader impact on world markets has been
exaggerated. A few months ago the international community was worried about
the impact on Japanese bank capital adequacy ratios. Now it appears resigned
to the withdrawal of Japanese banks from the lending scene. The main anxiety
is the domestic economy.
Japanese institutions have been heavy buyers of US bonds which yield 2.6 per
cent more than the home-grown variety. The resulting capital outflow has
weakened the yen to a point which appears to rule out the sort of interest
rate cut needed to stabilise the equity market. Only the bravest contrarians
will want to buy shares.

FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Labour turns on the charm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FT-SE Index: 2,470.7 (-5.3)
There is an aura of the counterfeit about Mr John Smith's budget red book.
It is the same colour and shape as the official Treasury one. It has the
same PSBR for 1992-3 and the same commitment to the present central rate in
the ERM. As with most counterfeits, however, what you see is not quite what
you get.
Labour's PSBR assumes the full benefit of the Pounds 8bn of privatisation
receipts that the Tories have pencilled in for 1992-3. It is difficult to
track down more than Pounds 6bn of receipts that are already in the bag. So,
Mr Smith already looks in danger of missing the target before he has even
started. He is also strangely silent about the cost of the increased capital
allowance, which is conveniently deferred to 1993-4. Even yesterday's
programme thus appears to point to further slippage in government finances.
That might matter less if the Labour budget contained some clever ruse for
boosting growth. The increased capital allowance is unlikely to produce much
additional investment when many companies are paying no corporation tax
anyway, but it will have a large deadweight cost. The transfer of spending
power to the lower paid might provide a boost at the margin, not least by
slowing the rate of repossessions which have been concentrated at the lower
end of the housing market. The point, however, is as moot as the attempt to
redistribute spending power must appear draconian to affluent voters in
marginal seats. Perhaps that is why the markets were not particularly
bothered.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: UK's share of world trade in manufacturing is
queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AUSTIN MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan tells us in his comments on the Budget ('Modestly in the
wrong direction', March 11) that the UK share of 'world trade in
manufacturing, after decades of falling, has levelled off, or even slightly
risen in the last nine years or so', and that 'UK price and cost
competitiveness, after a couple of years of deterioration, have now
recovered to the mid-1980s level'.
Table E1 of the February issue of the Monthly Review of External Trade
Statistics shows that in the latest quarter for which volume figures are
available, the UK share had fallen to an all-time low of 7.3 per cent, 11
per cent less than in 1982 and 8 per cent less than in 1983.
Table F8 shows that in the same quarter our trade-weighted relative export
unit values were a disastrous 11 per cent higher than the average for
1984-86, despite the huge reduction in profit margins and the very
substantial reduction in the relative living standards of manual workers in
the import-competing and export industries, manifest in the continuing
inability of industry to retain skilled labour.
The postwar decline in the UK share of exports of manufactures was reversed
in 1971, following the realignments of 1967-69. It resumed after the
Smithsonian agreement, but that was reversed again in 1975 and in 1977
following the devaluations of 1973-4 and 1976.
During the whole period an increase in relative export prices has, not
surprisingly, been consistently followed by a reduction in market share, and
vice versa. The monetary and exchange rate policies of successive
governments and their unwillingness to impose selective and penal controls
in credit, ensured that sterling was less competitive when we joined the ERM
even than in 1980-1981.
Relative export unit values were then 22 per cent higher than in
October-December 1976, 14 per cent higher than in April-June 1979 and 36 per
cent higher than in July-December 1973. Corresponding falls in market share
have been 27 per cent, 19 per cent and 30 per cent.
There will, and indeed can, be no recovery while sterling remains overvalued
within the ERM. No system of fixed exchange rates can allocate resources
efficiently in accordance with the law of comparative costs in international
trade. Pricing our goods out of home and overseas markets does reduce the
RPI, but, as we have seen in the Budget, that advantage has to be paid for
many times over by higher taxation and/or borrowing.
Sadly, we are now entering an election campaign in which these real issues
and problems can't be mentioned. Perhaps only the crisis which ensues
afterwards will force overvaluation and unnecessarily high interests to the
forefront and force an incoming government to act. If it doesn't, deflation
will become a way of life.

FT  17 MAR 92 / A first shot in the parade ground: The creation of a Russian
army poses difficult challenges for the CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is again to have an army. Leaving aside this century's Soviet
interruption, it will lay claim to a tradition reckoned in military and
patriotic circles as glorious, with centuries of imperial expansion and
victories across much of Europe emblazoned on its standards.
Through its army Russia was made into a vast multinational territory (the
consequences of which are still returning to haunt the former imperialists):
because of the army's defeats and virtual disintegration against the Germans
in the first world war, the Bolsheviks seized and held power.
Little that is glorious from the past remains today, and the future holds
(it is to be hoped) few glorious prospects. The Soviet army - already de
facto a Russian army, as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the Russian deputy prime
minister, noted yesterday, - is clearing out of the Caucasus under fire,
leaving two wars behind it. It is still trooping back from eastern Europe,
is soon due to leave the Baltics, and is in danger of being dragged into a
further war in Moldova.
This is in part the motivation for the creation of a Russian military: to
haul out Russian soldiers from areas of conflict over which their country
can exercise no influence short of a massive intervention, which it will not
undertake. The decree signed yesterday by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president on return from his holiday on the Black Sea has the virtue of
bringing some clarity into the tangled military affairs of the Soviet Union,
and hopefully begins a process of definition of military policy. However, it
leaves many questions unanswered.
On the credit side, the formation of a Ministry of Defence with Mr Yeltsin
at its head (his third job after those of president and prime minister)
gives the Russian military a country to which to belong: the fiction of
being an army for the Commonwealth of Independent States, when the CIS is
clearly incapable of doing anything other than falling apart, was wearing
thin.
Further, by putting himself at its head, Mr Yeltsin has established a
civilian command of the military. It was stressed yesterday that this was
temporary, and the longer-term dispute over civilian or military control of
the army is only postponed. Certainly, the main civilian contender for the
post, Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy head of the USA Canada Institute, a Moscow
think tank, still believes that his candidature remains active. He has
gathered a team reckoned as impressive, including General Alexander
Vladimirov, thought to be one of the foremost military strategists. But in
the transitional period under presidential command, it is a good idea that
the head of state supervises the difficult process of creation because of
his popularity and authority.
Finally, the Russian parliament will at last have a say in military matters,
since the draft law setting up the defence ministry will soon come before
the Russian deputies. The deputies have complained with increasing
bitterness that while they pay the army's bills, they have no say in
military dispositions. Now they can exercise their right of speech.
Yet, there has been no official word on the size of the force - though
Colonel Alexei Tsaryov, head of the defence sub-committee of the Russian
parliament, said recently that he thought 1.5m would be adequate. Will it be
professional? Probably, though not immediately: Colonel Tsaryov's estimate
was that it would take several years.
The timing of the announcement predates the meeting, in Kiev on Friday, of
the CIS heads of state, at which the issue of the division of military
forces and hardware will again be on the agenda. This is a bitter matter,
especially as regards the Black Sea fleet - part of the former Soviet navy,
but based largely in Ukrainian ports. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov,
commander-in-chief of the CIS armed forces, said in a TV interview yesterday
that the fleet should stay under CIS command: while the Ukrainian government
continues to insist that a sizeable part, perhaps as much as a third, be
assigned to Ukraine.
It is not just Russia and the Ukraine which are at odds. Russia's
relationship with the CIS is confused, and the announcement yesterday did
not make it much clearer. Mr Shakhrai insisted that the creation of the
defence ministry did not mean Russia was withdrawing from the CIS military
structure: but if Russia is to form its own army, then it could reduce the
CIS command to a formal organisation, with no effective command over anyone.
Can Russia, and the other states which wish to retain some form of unified
command, develop a Nato-type structure? So far they have not shown that they
can.
One of the few, so-far unchallenged, assumptions of post-Soviet military
life is that Russia will, over the next two years, inherit all the the
Soviet strategic nuclear weapons. In the absence of a doctrine, however,
there is as yet no agreement about whom the nuclear shield protects, and at
whom the missiles are aimed. Further, the announcement comes as a new
dispute arises between Russia and Ukraine over tactical weapons. Ukraine
refuses to send any more back to Russia because it fears 'instability' in
the latter republic.
The stated aim of the Yeltsin government is to create a 'normal' democratic
republic from the ruins of the union: within that, to develop a military
policy capable of defence but without aggressive designs on any other state
or people. Russian, and Soviet, history is not replete with periods in which
such intentions were carried through: now it might be possible, but only
with vast changes, most of all in the psychology of a people more
comprehensively militarised than any other on earth.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Uneasy calm amid a gathering storm: The implications of
Tokyo's quiet stock market crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago, the thought of the Nikkei stock index dropping through
the 20,000 level prompted panic among investors and emergency revisions to
stock market rules by the Japanese authorities.
But yesterday an eerie silence met the Nikkei's return to its lowest level
since February 1987. Investors had been expecting the bad news for so long
that there was barely a ripple of reaction when it finally arrived.
Nevertheless, yesterday's event highlights a crucial change of sentiment in
the Tokyo financial markets. Until the end of last year, there was
considerable hope that the bear market in equities, which started in early
1990, might soon be ending.
Foreign investors certainly thought so - they bought record amounts of
Japanese stocks last year, hoping to steal a march on cash-strapped Japanese
institutions.
They were buoyed partly by a hope that all postwar Japanese bear markets,
bar one, have lasted less than two years. The one exception was the 1960s
stock market crisis, when the markets had to be bailed out by the
government.
However, since the beginning of 1992, many investors have given up hope that
the current bear market will follow the normal postwar pattern. They have
battened down the hatches for a long 1960s-style recession. As Mr Shiomichi
Kawamoto, a fund manager at an investment management affiliate of Sumitomo
Life, the life insurer, said yesterday: 'The Nikkei may rebound above
20,000, but the overall downward trend is unchanged. Who will buy stocks
from securities companies which are about to collapse?'
Such profound gloom has several causes. The immediate explanations include
the aftermath of the financial explosion of the late 1980s,
confidence-sapping political and financial scandals and the slowdown in the
economy. Other causes lie just below the surface, among them the cumulative
effect of financial deregulation on Japan's capital markets.
The deep gloom in the market will not lift overnight, nor, probably even in
a month or two. Yet, it is worth remembering that Japanese equities are
shares in some of the world's most dynamic companies. Even as the country's
markets labour in the darkness of recession, its laboratories and factories
are busy laying the foundations for recovery from the current economic
slowdown.
For now, however, there is an enormous overhang of overpriced assets bought
during the bull market of the 1980s. In the stock market alone, the Nikkei
index's 50 per cent plunge from its peak has wiped about Y250,000bn (Pounds
1,100bn) off asset values. Much more wealth has evaporated in the property
market, where prices have fallen by up to 40 per cent in Tokyo and Osaka.
Some of the holders of these assets are under no pressure to sell - they and
their bankers can afford to wait. But others will take advantage of even a
modest rally to dump unwanted land and stocks.
The effect on securities brokers has been immediate. The slump in prices has
depressed turnover and sparked disputes with clients. In the most recent
example, Mr Masahiro Dozen, President of Daiwa Securities, last week
resigned after disclosing a forecast Y43bn net loss for the year to March 31
following the settlement of arguments with investment clients. Nomura
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, the other big broking
groups, are this week expected to announce gloomy results forecasts.
The Big Four's reserves were bolstered by the bumper profits of the 1980s.
But even they can withstand only a limited number of disputes of the kind
suffered by Daiwa, which is writing off Y72bn in extraordinary items.
Smaller companies are much worse off; some have already closed or been
swallowed by larger groups.
However, Japan can afford to lose some of its 250-odd broking companies
without suffering serious damage to its capital markets.
The impact of the financial recession on banks is more serious. Banks are
suffering because they count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital
for the purposes of capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for
International Settlements. With the Nikkei below 20,000, about half of the
top 11 banks' ratios are below 8 per cent - the BIS's standard which comes
into effect in 1993.
Moreover, banks have an extra burden in the form of bad and doubtful debts,
mainly related to property loans of the late 1980s. The most problematic of
these were routed through finance companies. Teikoku Databank, a credit
research agency, estimates that about half of Y70,000bn-Y80,000bn lent by
finance companies for property investment could be bad.
Banks can minimise the eventual loss by selling land held as collateral. But
this could take years. In the meantime, the loans stay on the books, eroding
profits.
As Mr Reese Harasawa, a senior financial manager at Mitsubishi Bank,
explains, banks can respond by cutting asset growth, such as new loans, and
raising profitability by increasing lending margins. The big institutions
will doubtless survive. The problems come with smaller lenders which can
have their reserves eliminated by a single disaster.
Even if a few small banks go bust - and none has failed yet  - bankers see
little risk of failure in the banking system as a whole. But would-be
borrowers are facing credit shortages as banks husband their resources.
This squeeze on credit is the main direct effect of the financial recession
on the rest of the economy. Companies, which in the 1980s could raise
equity-related capital at a net cost of below 1 per cent a year, and loan
funds at below 4 per cent, now find equity-linked capital impossible to
obtain and must pay 7 per cent and more for borrowed money.
How much this will constrain economic growth is difficult to judge. With
companies now running down inventories and postponing investments it could
be next year before the effects emerge. But with the latest money supply
figures (for January) showing a year-on-year growth of just 1.8 per cent,
the potential exists for a credit shortage hurting a nascent future
recovery.
The Bank of Japan is aware of the risk, not least because of the repeated
demands from politicians and industrialists for interest rate cuts. A
further cut of 0.5 percentage points to 4 per cent in the Official Discount
Rate is widely expected. But the weakness of the yen, which is trading at
about Y134 to the US dollar compared with Y125 at the end of 1991, could
limit the cental bank's scope for action. With long-term interest rates
firming in the US and in Germany, a reduction in Japan could further depress
the yen.
It would be wrong to exaggerate the weakness of the real economy. Private
sector economists expect about 2-3 per cent next year, sluggish in
comparison with late 1980's but respectable by standards of other
industrialised economies.
Nevertheless, Japan faces some difficult challenges. On the political front,
bribery scandals have disrupted the ruling Liberal Democratic party's
efforts to secure the parliamentary passage of the budget and could fatally
delay possible supplementary measures. Meanwhile, financial scandals, such
as Daiwa's latest affair, postpone the recovery of confidence in the market.
Equally significantly, the partial deregulation of interest rates and of
foreign exchange controls has made the current bear market quite different
from the past. Before, Japanese investors could not easily switch funds from
equities to other instruments. Interest-bearing deposits often paid low
rates. It was difficult for investors to put funds overseas. So,
particularly for institutions, there was little choice but so sit out a bear
market.
Today, liberalisation has removed many of the constraints. That is why
Japanese investors are starting to demand higher profits and higher
dividends from companies. Without an increased flow of income from their
stocks they will have little reason to hold on to equities during a bear
market.
Responding to demands for reform would require wholesale change from
Japanese companies, which are accustomed to putting investment and sales
above profits in importance and employees before shareholders. But the
longer the bear market lasts, the greater will be the pressure for corporate
reform.

you can take out a year's subscription to the Bank of England's very

The young press officer at Labour's Walworth Road headquarters insists that
the price is set by supply and demand. However, an old Labour hand tells me
that one has to charge a lot, or people don't think it is a serious

Good to see that GPA, Ireland's high-flying aircraft leasing company, seems

punters to back this high-risk enterprise, the least that can be expected is
that key members of the management team are required to stay on board until
the company has proved that it can fly out of the recession. All it needs
now is for Tony Ryan, GPA's reclusive founder, to put in an appearance at a
press conference and GPA would have the makings of a half- normal stock

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it is Sir David Walker's own uncertainty about his next career move
that explains the apparent
difficulty in filling the chairmanship of 3i, Britain's biggest venture
capitalist. Then again, it may be that 3i's clearing bank owners can never
agree among themselves.
Whatever the reason, the delay in filling the post is rather odd since an
in-bred organisation like 3i urgently needs a familiar face at the top in
the run-up to its flotation. Sir John Cuckney, who has been chairman since
1987, would be ideal, but he is stepping down, and the gossip is that the
job is Sir David's. . . if he wants it.
If this really is the case then it is rather disturbing. Clearing bankers
may believe that the Bank of England knows best when it comes to making
these sorts of appointment but putting well-known mandarins in charge of
City institutions has not always worked, witness Sir Kit McMahon's unhappy
tenure at the top of Midland Bank. Much better to look outside the City and
appoint an industrialist with a proven track record, such as Shell's Sir
Peter Holmes.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Observer: Governing party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first tasks for whichever party wins the
election will be to replace the Governor of the Bank of England, whose term
runs out at the end of June 1993.
The ideas a continuing Conservative government would have on suitable
pedigrees have been reasonably well aired, with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's
man on the Court for the past decade, an obvious contender. But what happens
if Labour wins?
In that case, the dossier of qualified candidates with apt backgrounds is
somewhat thin. There are some Labour peers who have worked in the City, such
as the Lords Williams and Donoughue. But their credibility has not been
enhanced by their recent career moves. Another possibility is Lord Peston, a
Labour academic, but he is said not to be interested and, even if he were,
his appointment would be controversial - at least among economists.
History suggests that Labour prime ministers tend to play much more safely
than their Tory counterparts when it comes to picking governors.
On nationalising the Bank in 1946, Labour might have given the place a
thorough shake-up. In the event, it passed up the opportunity by asking Lord
Catto, a former Morgan Grenfell partner, to stay on as governor. Since then,
Labour governments have had only a couple of chances to choose a new
governor, and both times it promoted from within.
Admittedly, in 1949 Stafford Cripps wanted to give the job to John
Hanbury-Williams, a well respected chairman of Courtaulds. But when he
turned it down, the post was offerred to Cameron Cobbold, the deputy
governor. Similarly, Harold Wilson also settled on the deputy, then Leslie
O'Brien, to take over from Lord Cromer in 1966.
On this basis, the two obvious front-runners are the current deputy
governor, 53-year-old Eddie George, and Sir David Walker, who has worked in
the Treasury as well as the Bank and steps down as chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board at the end of May.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Battle of the budgets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER BEFORE have voters in a general election been given a choice between
two budgets. That this is so is partly an accident of timing. But it is also
a credit to the Labour Party which offers a choice that is clear, but far
from dramatic.
Since Labour's draft Budget is a political document, deception is to be
expected, as was the case in the Budget itself. The shadow Red Book argues,
for example, that the recession was caused by the government's policies, but
fails to note that the proximate cause was ERM membership, a policy
framework for lowering inflation to which the Labour Party is also
committed. The draft also calls for immediate implementation of a Pounds
1.1bn recovery programme. But it fails to recognise the modest nature of the
stimulus. A Labour government, too, would have to wait and hope for a
recovery.
Even on the 'fiscal principle that the Government should only borrow for
investment', Labour merely talks a good game. The prospective fiscal deficit
would be quite as large under Labour as under the Conservatives and, taken
as a whole, that deficit will probably exceed investment. Moreover, the
increased spending now envisaged is not for investment, except on the most
elastic definition. Labour's puritanical bite is less bad than its bark.
Once enquiring voters have waded through the quagmire of disinformation,
however, they reach the dry land of genuine differences.
Personal allowances
Labour tax-raising proposals include abolition of the national insurance
ceiling and a new 50 per cent income tax band, starting at gross earnings of
Pounds 40,000, but increases in the basic and 40 per cent tax rate are ruled
out for the next parliament. The two changes, taken together, are supposed
to raise Pounds 2.87bn in the first year and Pounds 4.84bn in the second.
Labour also 'saves' the Conservatives proposed 20 per cent reduced rate
band, worth Pounds 1.77bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 2.32bn in 1993-94.
The money is to be spent on a 10 per cent increase in personal allowances
(costing Pounds 920m and Pounds 1.17bn in the first two years,
respectively), abolition of the 2 per cent national insurance entrance fee
(costing Pounds 720m and Pounds 1.07bn), an increase in child benefit to
Pounds 9.95 (costing Pounds 315m and Pounds 750m) and increased state
retirement pensions (costing Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 2.56bn). After already
announced changes in national insurance treatment of benefits in kind, a
proposed tax exemption for employer assisted childcare, abolition of the
incentive to opt out of the state earnings related pensions and retention of
stamp duty on share transactions, Pounds 1.89bn and Pounds 3.51bn are left
for increased public spending in the two years.
Pensioner households
Labour's proposals are more redistributive than those of the government.
According to the Institute of Fiscal Studies, below a household disposable
income of Pounds 399 a week the number of gainers would exceed losers. Most
pensioner households would gain. So would most parents, whether single or
couples. Incentives at the margin for the relatively well paid would be
worse, but no more so than prior to 1988. Labour's proposals also involve
more public spending. In 1993-94, for example, the difference would be
Pounds 6.8bn. The sum may seem huge, but Labour's budget would raise the
share of public spending in GDP merely from 43 to 44 per cent.
Here then is the choice: monetary rectitude and fiscal profligacy in the
blue corner and fiscal profligacy and monetary rectitude in the red one; a
'medium term financial strategy' in the blue corner and a 'strategic
framework for finance and industry' in the red one; public spending kept
down to 43 per cent of GDP in the blue corner and public spending up to 44
per cent of GDP in the red one; a reduced rate band of 20 per cent in the
blue corner and higher fiscal allowances in the red one; lower taxes on the
well off in the blue corner and higher spending on pensioners, parents,
health and education in the red one. A fight is, indeed, on. But it is
between products carefully positioned on either side of the the middle of
the market place.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: Le Siege de Corinthe - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The activities of the Rossini 200th anniversary year begin to unfold in
London's theatres and concert halls. There may not not enough of them - for
this is, after all, a composer of many little-known or even unknown works of
superb quality and only a few popular favourites. But those that are
scheduled (such as next month's Royal Opera revival of Guillaume Tell and
QEH concert performance of the Neapolitan opera seria, Ermione) will surely
aid in sharpening our vision of a composer of the first importance still
shrouded in prejudiced misunderstanding.
This is what anniversary celebrations always should have as their goal; and
this was certainly the achievement of Sunday's Chelsea Opera Group concert
performance of Le Siege de Corinthe (1826), first of the three grand operas
Rossini wrote for Paris. It was an occasion of high excitement but with also
the properly missionary purpose and revelatory impact. The convenient
formula is that with this work 19th-century Grand Opera was launched; what
is less well known is the fierce charge of dramatic urgency and vigour that
it can still release when sympathetically delivered.
Like Mose, the second of Rossini's Paris operas, Le Siege is a radical
re-fashioning of an earlier work - in this case Maometto secondo (Naples,
1820). The Neapolitan expansiveness of invention and luxuriant vocal writing
were drastically cut back; the siege itself was re-located from Negroponte
to Corinth. The Paris premiere was given against the backdrop of the Greek
War of Independence, and so the enthusiasm it inspired may have had a tinge
of topicality; but the boldness of the opera, its opening-up of new paths
and possibilities and its surging forcefulness of forward movement were the
real roots of its success.
Forward movement is the aim: this is a through-composed drama with only a
single solo scena uninterrupted by the addition of other solo or choral
voices. Not until Il trovatore would opera re-discover such rugged vitality
in martial rhythms; the grandeur of Rossini's Gluckian and Beethovenian
veins and, in the Act 2 choral prayer, his pre-Schumann richness of Romantic
harmony are kept trimly directed toward the driving oppositions - Greek
versus Turk  - of the drama, also achieved in the wonderfully apt and
detailed scoring.
Character is subsumed in the love-versus-duty plot; this is perhaps the
backward-looking aspect of the opera, which makes it less easy to revive
than Tell. My single encounter with Le Siege in the theatre - the 1982
Florence staging, a tepid, going-through-the-motions affair - underlined the
point. But though the Chelsea Opera Group orchestra and chorus are peopled
with amateurs, their commitment to the work proved on Sunday so infectious,
and the skill of the conductor, Howard Williams, so great in reconciling
formal grandeur and dramatic dynamism, that for me the experience was
transformed beyond recognition.
A crucial element was still lacking: the focus of solo singing both pure and
powerful in tone and style. Only the tenor Justin Lavender, whose easy
command of Neocles's high tessitura won him an ovation in the Act 3 scena,
could really be deemed a 'possible' in his role. (If Mr Lavender could groom
his tone and line still further he could become this country's much-needed
Ottocento tenor.) The impassioned leading female role was confided to Eileen
Hulse, a delicately musical soprano on far too small a scale.
But there was a quality of no-frills honesty in the singing of Geoffrey
Shovelton's Greek leader and Neil Howlett's Turk, and useful support from
Louise Crane and Lawrence Richard. And as ever in Chelsea Opera Group's most
notable successes, the plusses triumphantly outnumbered the minuses.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: The forgotten expressionist - Otto Dix at the Tate and
in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the full retrospective study of the German painter, Otto Dix, which has
come to the Tate Gallery from Stuttgart (where it was organised) and Berlin,
and the coincidental exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern
Art, Edinburgh, of his works on paper in the collection of the Dresden Print
Room, again covering his full career, we may at last see clearly the life's
work of this important artist.
It is not so much that Otto Dix alone, but that a whole generation of German
artists was all but forgotten, except for its work of the brief, hectic
period of the Weimar Republic. The social and satirical expressionism of
George Grosz and Max Beckmann, and of Dix himself, was known well, but of
what else they and their contemporaries achieved over full working lives we
knew little and saw less.
Yet Grosz and Beckmann lived on until 1959; Schlicter until 1955; Hubbuch
and Schad well into the 1980s; and Dix himself until 1969. Not until quite
recently, through such revisionist shows as the Arts Council's Neue
Sachlichkeit of 1979, Les Realismes at the Centre Pompidou in 1982 and
similar exercises, did it become apparent that the story was somewhat more
rich and complicated.
Was such critical myopia more convenient than real? Many of those artists
had gone into exile after the rise of Hitler to power; and quite as many
remained at home. Only by luck did no artist of manifest distinction emerge
from the Nazi period. Even so, the Royal Academy's survey of German art in
the 20th century left a large hole that the 1930s and '40s should have
filled. Political correctness is new only in name.
Dix was one who remained in Nazi Germany, an internal emigrant, taking his
family to the country, eventually settling at Hemmenhofen near Lake
Constance. He was called up at the age of 53 to serve through the last
desperate months of the War, and in April 1945 was taken prisoner. On his
release he returned home to what was now East Germany and to life under
communism. While to him, with his bleakly misanthropic cast of mind, it
would seem all one, to the world at large such resignation might well seem
acceptance of more positive a sort. As an active artist Dix all but
disappears from view, except in his own country. There the influence of his
coded symbolism of the Hitler years has proved itself potent still, and
unmistakeable.
Dix's own post-war work is disappointing, a competent and painterly
figurative expressionism after the manner of the Parisian mainstream: shades
of Picasso, Clave, Braque, underscored with a dour symbolism. But it is the
mark of the true artist that even his bad work remains interesting, and Dix
was nothing if not inconsistent, never afraid to over-reach himself. If in
these late works we see him withdrawn and self-contained, the contrast with
the large symbolic machines of the Nazi middle years, 'The Triumph of Death'
or 'The Temptation of Saint Anthony', is only the stronger.
Such paintings as these, with their conscious reversion to the German and
Flemish tradition of the late Renaissance, are overblown, uneven,
extravagant in ambition, in a sense wonderfully bad, yet wonderful is a
proper compliment. The several small landscapes, after Breughel and
Altdorfer, by which he made a living, are exquisite, the realist
self-portrait of 1942 magnificent.
There was nothing inconsistent in the looking back, for that was where Dix
began as a student in Dresden before 1914, looking quite as much at Cranach,
Durer and Van Eyck as at anything of cubism, futurism or any other
modernism. While such current examples would preoccupy him in their turn,
especially during the earlier part of his career, it was with that larger,
older, encompassing realist tradition that he would always identify himself.
Dix volunteered in 1914 and served throughout the Great War. What work he
found time to do pointed no moral on the horror and futility of it all. His
remarkable drawings of the trench landscape, shown to advantage in
Edinburgh, are objective and topographical, almost pastoral, exactly
comparable to the working drawings of Nash and Lewis and their British
war-artist colleagues.
Only some time afterwards is a more searching and despairing response
expressed, in the suite of 50 etchings, Der Krieg, of 1924, with their
eroded, visually erosive images of death and mutilation. A direct comparison
is with Goya's 'Disasters of War', some of which are shown in Edinburgh in a
pendant display along with woodcuts and engravings of Cranach, Durer,
Baldung and others. For Dix the suite marks not so much the turn to a
particular kind of imagery so much as a change of heart. He had been
painting mutilated ex-servicemen and low-life imagery in general, whores and
pimps and the like, for a year or two. But what was lively and robust,
almost jolly in a black sort of way, was now to become bleak and, if not
unforgiving, at least unblinking in its view of the human condition.
The work becomes more straightforward, less directly engaged with the formal
devices of the current avant-garde. Dix was well capable of the direct and
unaffected approach, and had already painted a notably ravishing portrait of
his wife in a red hat. But the years after 1924, especially after his move
from Dusseldorf to Berlin in 1925, and on to Dresden in 1927, were to see
his finest work, finest of all the portraits and the nudes.
With them Dix truly returns to the old northern humanist tradition, with its
clearer drawing, thin paint and thinner glazes. His subjects are treated not
satirically, but all too truthfully, their figures set at just the right
exaggerated curve, their features pointed with just too wicked an emphasis,
their every vanity and frailty exposed. The professional model shrinks away,
covering herself, as who would not before that baleful gaze.
The Otto Dix exhibitions continue at the Tate until May 17, sponsored by
Beck's Bier and The Independent; and until May 10 in Edinburgh, sponsored by
the German government.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Taking everything into
account - What your bank manager really wants to know
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR I
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a fraught half hour for the four directors of Pristine Pools.
They have been trying to persuade the bank manager to agree to a Pounds
70,000 overdraft to help their pool cleaning business get off the ground.
Among their difficulties are the limited funds - just Pounds 20,000  - they
can put up as share capital and uncertainty surrounding two large local
authority contracts they hope to win.
It has not been an easy session. The bank manager has questioned the
directors closely on their backgrounds and was reluctant to lend without
security in the form of personal guarantees.
Fortunately for the four, the questioning formed part of a training course
entitled Survive your Bank Manager, run by the Hertfordshire Training and
Enterprise Council*.
If it had been a real interview, it seems unlikely that they would have
raised the money. In the debriefing session, the 'bank manager' said she was
annoyed by the argumentative approach of one member of the Pristine team,
adding: 'They presented their credentials well, but after that they fell
apart a bit'.
With the banks taking an increasingly tough line on lending to small firms
in the present recession, knowing how to get on with your bank manager and
how to put a convincing case for funds is crucial. It is clear that some of
the 20 participants on the course have problems understanding their
real-life bank manager.
'They put you on the spot,' says Sarah Maidment, director of Harvee
Engineering of St Albans. 'They ask you why you haven't brought in certain
information when you didn't know they wanted it.'
'The rules have changed,' comments Oliver Shannon of the High Barnet-based
Printing Company. 'You find yourself second-guessing them.'
The morning session starts with a look at the question of gearing - the
participants are surprised at how, apparently, small changes in interest
rates can radically alter an investor's return from a particular investment
 -before moving on to the crucial area of cash flow forecasts.
These are not difficult to prepare but will be one of the key documents a
bank manager will expect to see.
Companies which fail frequently do so after a very good year's trading,
warns Peter Phillips, a former chief accountant with British Coal and
presenter of the course. 'Fast growing companies often run out of cash. They
do not realise that cash and profits are not the same thing.'
Businesses frequently run into problems because they do not collect on time
the money which is owing to them - turnover shoots up but the business is
still short of cash to pay wages - but there are other transactions which
will affect a businesses cash flow without showing up on its profit and loss
(p and l) account.
Buying an expensive item of equipment will have an immediate impact on the
cash available in the business but the p and l will only record the amount
by which that equipment is depreciated in any year.
Similarly, the p and l will not take into account spending on stock but only
the amount used up, which may be smaller.
As part of the Pristine Pools exercise, course participants draw up a
12-month cash flow forecast so as to calculate the size of the loan they
will need to ask for. This brings home the implications of a large customer
making them wait two months for payment.
A cash flow forecast is a crucial part of any approach to a bank manager,
but forms only one of the criteria by which you will be judged, Phillips
explains.
Bank managers will normally base their discussion with you on the Campari
mnemonic or a similar system. Campari stands for:
CHARACTER
Bank managers are expected to take into account the stability of your
personal life and how long you have been a customer.
ABILITY
Do you have a successful track record in business and is it relevant to the
business you now want to set up? The banks are not renowned for taking a
positive view of previous failures.
MARGIN
The rate of interest will reflect the manager's view of the risk.
PURPOSE
The bank will obviously want to know what the loan is for. The manager may
have burned his fingers in a particular sector, such as property, or
regional office may have set down exclusions.
AMOUNT
The bank will probably not want to lend more than the sum you are putting
into the business, but it is also not in its interest for you to start up
with too little finance.
REPAYMENT
Will you meet sales forecasts and achieve a large enough margin to repay the
loan?
INSURANCE
The bank will usually want security even if its other criteria have been
met. This may be fixed against a specific asset or floating against all the
assets of the business.
You will probably have to explain these issues to the bank manager but
include them in more detail in a written business plan.
This should include projections for sales - broken down by customer and
market - as well as cash flow and profit forecasts.
Increasingly, bank managers are looking at financial criteria at the expense
of the possibly more subjective elements in Campari-style analysis, Phillips
explains.
At the heart of their analysis are certain financial ratios.
Phillips suggests three key figures:
The acid test. This measures your ability to pay your creditors. Divide
debtors and cash by your current liabilities. A result of 1 or more
indicates the business has enough cash to pay its outstanding bills.
Interest cover. This indicates whether you can repay the interest on loans.
Divide profits before tax and interest by the interest due. Bankers do not
usually like this number to fall below 2.
Return on capital employed. Divide profits before tax and interest by
shareholders funds and loans and multiply the answer by 100 per cent. The
figure arrived at should not, over the long term, fall below what could be
earned if you left the money on deposit or what you pay in interest.
When the course participants return for their second session with Pristine
Pools the simple cash flow forecast has become a more extensive business
plan with details of pricing and promotion policies and forecasts for cash
flow, profits and balance sheets.
They put a convincing case to the bank manager who offers to provide what
has now become an Pounds 80,000 overdraft at 5 per cent above base rate.
However, this appears rather expensive to the directors of Pristine Pools,
who have a potential corporate backer in the wings, so they retire to think
about the bank manager's offer.
Life may have become tough for the small company seeking business but it has
not got any easier for the bank manager either.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Spending boost would build for long-term
prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat manifesto said: Be warned - this manifesto may not be
what you expect.
This manifesto does not promise good times just around the corner. It does
not avoid difficult questions out of fear of unpopularity. It simply tells
the truth; the truth about what Liberal Democrats believe has to be done in
order for Britain to succeed.
Britain's prosperity
Emergency programme should reduce unemployment by at least 600,000 over two
years. Increased spending on public transport, housing, hospitals, schools,
energy efficiency and conservation, education and training. Support for
transport infrastructure. Freeze on business rates this year. Training
incentive for firms through levy equal to 2 per cent of payroll, from which
they would deduct their expenditure on training. Employers to release
employees under 19 for minimum of two days a week further education and/or
training.
New regional development and local enterprise agencies. Tecs to provide
business services, acting as effective voice for business at local level,
and overseeing training of those in employment. Encouragement for
decentralisation of banks and other financial institutions. Immediate
increase in government science budget to 0.35 per cent of GDP and raise it
steadily thereafter.
Tough action against monopolies, mergers and financial raids. The Monopolies
and Mergers Commission will be combined with the Office of Fair Trading and
made independent of government. A Restrictive Practices Act will penalise
anti-competitive behaviour and end price-fixing by cartels. We will
encourage greater competition in the banking sector.
Break-up of monopoly providers of services such as BT and British Gas. We
will permit access by private operators to the British Rail track network.
We will liberalise the coal industry.
Encouragement for decentralised wage bargaining.
Substantial increase in investment in schemes to encourage innovation in
industry, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in
manufacturing. We will reform corporation tax and the taxation of savings to
achieve even treatment for different forms of savings. Encouragement for
long-term approach to private investment. We will reverse the burden of
proof for acquisitions away from the target company towards the predator,
and require companies to ballot shareholders on bid plans . We will reform
company law to require greater disclosure of information such as expenditure
on research and development. We will define the responsibilities of
non-executive directors and insist that all publicly quoted companies have
them on their boards.
Encouragement for small businesses and the self-employed, by relieving the
administrative burden, legislating to make interest payable on overdue debt,
and encouraging Tecs, chambers of commerce and local enterprise agencies to
reorganise to form a network of business-led one-stop shops. We will
encourage, and if necessary legislate for, banks to treat small businesses
fairly by agreeing contracts for services.
Encouragement for flexibility in working patterns. Legislation to establish
the right of every private sector employee in a substantial company to have
access to a share in ownership and/or in the profits they help to create.
The right for every employee to participate in decision-making in their
enterprise. We will set up a new Industrial Partnership Agency to help
companies and employees find the precise forms of partnership which suit
them.
We will change the ways economic policy is made and implemented. Our key
changes are:
An operationally independent Bank of England to become the Central Bank of
the UK.
Moving sterling to the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism
as soon as possible, helping stable progress towards lower interest rates.
Taxes and public spending to be set to reach a 'savings target' for the
nation over a period of years. We will set a target as a total of private-
and public-sector savings, and adjust fiscal policy to achieve the target
over the medium term.
We will publish a draft Budget four months before the final version. This
will make it easier to measure the impact of economic policy on the
environment. Independent National Statistical Commission to collect and
publish statistics and improve their quality.
Working towards European economic and monetary union, including the
establishment of an independent European Central Bank and a single European
currency. We will renounce the Conservatives' Maastricht opt-out' clause,
accept the timetabled approach to EMU, and renegotiate the Social Chapter
with a positive British input.
The environment
Liberal Democrats will:
Reform land use planning so that the protection of the natural environment
becomes a major feature of the planning system.
Improve public transport, reduce traffic congestion, and encourage
pedestrianisation and cycling schemes. We will make compensation for
excessive commercial noise more widely available.
Provide grants for recycling schemes, introduce regulations on the use of
packaging materials.
We will use market mechanisms, where feasible, to reduce pollution. Direct
controls will still be needed in some cases. We will:
Set targets for cutting pollution. Introduce a system of tradable emission
licences. Create a new Department of Natural Resources with sole
responsibility for environmental protection.
To conserve energy we will:
Support a Community-wide Energy Tax on all energy sources.
Invest in energy conservation and efficiency. We will set new energy
efficiency standards for homes, offices and factories, and for products such
as light bulbs, fridges and cookers. Double government spending on renewable
energy research.
Aim to phase out nuclear fission power stations by the year 2020 and will
not proceed further with the construction of the Sizewell B PWR.
By expanding provision and quality of public transport and reducing
dependence on the private car, we will improve travel efficiency and protect
the environment. We will achieve this by:
Investment in public transport. Immediate improvements in the rail network.
A reduction in fuel consumption. Long-term increases in petrol prices phased
in gradually by applying Energy Tax to petrol, while graduating Vehicle
Excise Duty and Car Tax according to fuel efficiency. We will scrap the
remaining tax breaks for company cars and apply tougher limits to permitted
emissions.
Making concessionary fares on local public transport widely available and a
variety of road-pricing schemes. Approving major motorway or trunk road
investments only where it can be demonstrated that alternative transport
provision cannot meet the need at lower eco-nomic and environmental cost.
Expanding airports outside the south-east, while at the same time freezing
further development at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
Britain's skills
A single Department of Education and Training, a National Qualifications
Council to co-ordinate a single system of academic and vocational courses
for 14-19 year olds, and a Higher Education Standards Council.
A fully independent HM Inspectorate of Education and Training.
We will:
Guarantee pre-school education for every child and introduce a National
Record of Achievement.
Reduce class sizes and reward academic and vocational achievements.
Broaden post-16 education and improve Special Educational Needs provision.
Phase out the Assisted Places Scheme and review the charitable status of
independent schools.
Increase the number of students in higher education to 2m by the year 2000.
Establish a proper career structure for research fellows and Pay Review Body
for academic and non-academic staff to halt the brain drain.
Britain's people
Our priorities are:
A decent level of health service funding.
Resources for preventive medicine, health education and occupational health.
An effective Patient's Charter and a comprehensive no-fault compensation
scheme. New National Inspectorate for Health to guarantee a quality service.
Providing housing
We will:
Introduce housing cost relief weighted towards those most in need and
available to house buyers and renters. This will replace mortgage tax relief
for future home buyers.
Boost house building and renovation.
Improve tenants' rights to better standards of repair and maintenance. Take
urgent action on homelessness.
Protecting people
Liberal Democrats will:
Give local authorities the powers to develop comprehensive community crime
prevention programmes. Put more police officers on the beat.
Establish a Ministry for Justice, merging the relevant functions of the Home
Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department.
Radically reform conditions inside prisons.
Incomes for all
Our objectives are to simplify and integrate the two systems, to mount a
determined assault on poverty and dependence, and to protect our citizens
from want.
We will work towards the eventual creation of a new Citizen's Income',
payable to all irrespective of sex or status.
Our immediate priorities, which will act as steps towards the Citizen's
Income, include:
Immediate improvements in benefits - increasing Child Benefit by Pounds 1
per week. Income support for under-25s at the full rate, an increase of
Pounds 8.50 per week. Increasing the basic state pension immediately by
Pounds 5 a week for single pensioners, and by Pounds 8 a week for married
couples. Basic pension to be uprated every year in line with average
earnings, to be paid for by abolishing SERPS. A statutory framework of
protection, including employee representation on occupational pension
trusts.
Further improvements in benefits. Unifying income tax and employees'
National Insurance contributions. Making the investment needed to end the
recession, using the money borrowed by the Conservatives to pay for their
pre-election tax cuts. We will also raise the basic rate of income tax by
one penny in the pound to pay for the improvements essential to education.
Equal opportunities
Liberal Democrats will:
Fight discrimination by incorporating the European Convention on Human
Rights into UK law and then extending it into a full UK Bill of Rights.
Guarantee equal pay for work of equal value.
Introduce a flexible 'decade of retirement' for men and women, in which
people may choose to retire and take a state pension at any time between
ages 60 and 70 (the value of the pension increasing with the age of
retirement). Protect the rights of ethnic minorities.
Britain's partners
Liberal Democrats will take decisive steps towards a fully integrated,
federal and democratic European Community.
Our vision of the new Europe is of a federal community, where power is
exercised at the lowest level consistent with good governm ent. For us,
federalism means decentralisation: passing powers down more than passing
them up.
Our priorities are:
Economic and monetary union including establishment of independent European
Central Bank and single European currency. We will renounce the
Conservatives' opt-out' clause and accept the timetable for Emu.
Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Further moves to European union, and enlargement, must depend on the
institutions of the EC becoming truly democratic. We will:
Set out the rights of the European citizen. Increase the democratic powers
of the European Parliament. Introduce fair votes for the 1994 British
elections to the European Parliament. Make the Commission more accountable.
Increase democracy and accountability in the Council of Ministers.
Sharing security
We will:
Develop common European Community foreign and security policies.
Instigate a comprehensive review of UK defence policy.
Establish an Arms Conversion Agency to help arms manufacturers to diversify
and convert out of the defence field, funded by savings made in the defence
budget. Maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent.
Propose new disarmament initiatives covering all categories of conventional
and nuclear weapons.
Britain's democracy
We will:
Introduce proportional representation for all elections. We propose the
single transferable vote, by which electors cast their votes in multi-member
constituencies based on natural communities.
Introduce fixed-term Parliaments of four years. Reform the House of Lords.
We will maintain a second chamber as a Senate, primarily elected by the
citizens of the nations and UK regions.
Power to the people
Immediate creation of an elected Scottish Parliament.
The immediate creation of an elected Welsh Senedd.
We will create the framework for regional government in England. We will
decentralise power to the new national and regional governments.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown's mixture lacks cohesion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday said his party's
manifesto was 'a combination Britain has not seen before'.
To him it is an earthly embodiment of a 1990s Zeitgeist. More prosaically,
it is an assortment of policies, some old, some new and some requiring far
higher public borrowing and higher taxes.
The manifesto has evolved over the past five years largely under the
direction of Lord Holme, the urbane former Liberal party president. It
mirrors Mr Ashdown's impulsive and sometimes contradictory political
convictions.
He wants to be a radical, to be set apart from both Labour and the Tories,
but he covets common-sense policies and hard-nosed pragmatism. It is not a
cohesive ideology. Instead, bright wheezes have been costed and reworked to
fit into a framework that has common strands but cannot be defined in
conventional terms or in a single phrase.
A Keynesian package of investment and education spending to kick-start the
economy, at a cost of Pounds 6bn, is ring-fenced from measures to promote
competition and efficiency by the application of free-market economics.
Private monopolies such as BT and British Gas would be broken up; a
restrictive practices court established and the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission combined with the Office of Fair Trading. The Bank of England
would win independence, and sterling would move to the narrow bands of the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Tactically, Mr Ashdown can sell the Liberal Democrats as stronger on public
investment than Labour and more pro-market than the Tories. But in practice
a Liberal Democrat government would find itself simultaneously raising taxes
and public borrowing for its government-directed investment programme,
creating 600,000 jobs over two years, while supposedly recognising 'that the
free market is the best guarantee of responsiveness to choice and change'.
Parts of the manifesto will be familiar from the Alliance parties' 1987
campaign - particularly the commitment to constitutional reform. Pledges to
Scottish and Welsh home rule, a local income tax, profit-related pay
schemes, help for small businesses, and an integrated tax and benefits
system have also survived.
But under Mr Ashdown and Lord Holme the 1950s internationalist Liberal
tradition has been revived and reinserted. European union is embraced almost
without qualification; defence spending cuts will be halted pending an
assesment of Britain's role in a rapid reaction force or a United Nations
peacekeeping project.
Grassroots liberalism has returned, reflected in policies for increasing
local control over schools, hospitals and local taxation. There is also Mr
Ashdown's version of the Tory Citizen's Charter, which includes a
state-guaranteed basic income for all.
The only acknowledgement of a possible hung parliament is in the manifesto's
conclusion, where the party pledges itself to 'neither support nor
participate in a government which turns its back on reform'.
Mr Ashdown almost relishes the potential vote-losing appeal of his
manifesto. He wears a hair shirt in proposing an extra 1p on income tax to
fund an extra Pounds 2bn on education and in raising petrol tax by 10p a
year for five years to help cut pollution. This is tempered by a promise not
to introduce rises until compensation schemes are ready for rural areas and
the disadvantaged.
Mr Ashdown's overall promise is a varied one: tough policies for voters who
dislike tax bribes or unsubstantiated spending promises; free-market
economics for disgruntled Tories; job-creation schemes for the unemployed.
The intellectual consistency may be brash, but it is a manifesto that can be
sold to many different audiences.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Questions over coalition refuse to go away -
The issue that will dominate Liberal Democratic thinking in the next three
weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paddy Ashdown wanted to talk about policies. As usual the journalists at
the launch of the Liberal Democrats' manifesto preferred to explore his
party's conditions for participation in a coalition government.
The Liberal Democrat leader has responded to the same questions about a hung
parliament perhaps a thousand times during the phoney war leading up to the
election campaign. But neither the questions nor the dilemma are likely to
go away before April 9.
His aim is to demonstrate that his party is more than a spanner that they
might choose to throw in the Conservative or Labour works: that the
political force rescued from the wreckage of the old SDP-Liberal Alliance
has a distinctive message.
So Mr Ashdown dwelt at length on his manifesto's blend of Conservative
free-market economics (the breaking up of private monopolies, introduction
of private services on British Rail) and Labour's belief in public
investment (more taxpayers' money for education and housing).
It was not an attempt to look both ways at once, he insisted. Rather a
recipe that had brought proven success for Britain's continental European
competitors
The price of being the third party in a two-party system is a media focus on
the 'What if' question that will dominate the election campaign as long as
neither Labour nor the Conservatives look like securing an overall majority.
Mr John Major apparently had cleared up some of the confusion in Torquay at
the weekend when he ridiculed the terms for coalition which Mr Ashdown has
outlined in recent weeks.
The prime minister scorned the commitment to a proportional voting system
which Mr Ashdown set as the precondition for his party's support; and Mr
Major rejected the creation of a Scottish assembly which the Liberal
Democrats have said must be included in an agreed four-year legislative
programme.
Incidentally, Mr Ashdown indicated that other policies in his manifesto
would be negotiable in descending order of importance. He presumably would
not force a minority government to put 1p on the basic rate of income tax,
but would demand more spending on education.
He could not admit the obvious implication of Mr Major's stance: that the
only leader he could keep in office after an inconclusive election would be
Mr Neil Kinnock. He said yesterday that the reality of defeat might easily
persuade Mr Major to change his mind.
It is not a judgment shared privately by colleagues in the 22-strong
contingent of Liberal Democrats at Westminster. They believe that Mr Major
could not do a deal. Even if he could, it would be a mistake for Mr Ashdown
to sustain a minority Conservative prime minister.
Their wider, albeit unstated, judgment runs like this: the party is doing
well in the opin- ion polls and will probably do better than that on April
9; but there is no prospect of the decisive breakthrough - to about 30 per
cent of the votes - needed to lift its representation significantly at
Westminster.
In those circumstances, an inconclusive result on April 9 would hold as many
risks as opportunities. Mr Ashdown has no choice during the campaign but to
stick rigidly to his principal conditions for coalition.
He will have to judge after the election if it would really be in his
party's interests to vote down a minority Labour government that offered a
package which fell just short of proportional representation for
Westminster.
Some of his Scottish colleagues might be more than reluctant to vote down a
Queen's Speech which offered an Edinburgh assembly elected proportionately.
In the meantime, Mr Ashdown has another three weeks of answering the same
question.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The man who will launch more than 5,500 faces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Conservative director of communications, Mr Shaun Woodward is responsible
for launching what may be the largest poster campaign in British advertising
history.
The former BBC producer and director now charged with controlling all
aspects of the Tories' press and publicity campaign, has covered nearly
5,500 hoardings with party posters. In the advertising business, a
2,000-site campaign is a huge one, and even a high-profile lager brand was
content with 800 posters in a recent campaign.
Mr Woodward's brief is 'to put together a full communications strategy for
John Major's first general election campaign. That covers press, television,
public relations, advertising, posters, working out new ways of doing party
political and party election broadcasts, opinion polling, direct mail.'
'By and large no-one remembers a single Labour party poster from previous
elections,' he said. 'What that shows is not that the Labour party wasn't
producing posters; it shows that you can spend money on advertising and not
necessarily get results.'
Along with that poster campaign will be a drive to keep Conservative
politicians in front of the television cameras - a grid plan has been drawn
up to ensure that a senior cabinet figure appears in each of the main
television regions on each campaigning day.
Newspaper advertising is likely to get short shrift. 'I have a feeling that
double-page spreads don't work in newspapers and Chris Patten shares that
view. However, if Neil Kinnock delivers a mistake then we might capitalise
on that with a press ad the next day.'
But in commercial advertising all that can be demonstrated is a correlation
between advertising and sales - increased sales seem to coincide with
increased advertising, though no causal relationship can be demonstrated.
In planning his poster campaign, Mr Woodward is content with the correlation
argument - he points to Labour's six-point lead in a Mori poll in January
before the Conservative 'Labour's Tax Bombshell' poster hit the streets. By
the end of the month, Mori had the Conservatives three points ahead of
Labour.
'The political argument was not made by a poster or by advertising but by
politicians who had an idea, which was that we must point out very clearly
to the electorate what a Labour government would do to the average income
tax that most people pay. Advertising was used to put that on the map. If
your policies aren't right when you are on the map, you won't win.'
Anything less than a public expression of supreme confidence would be
shocking, and Mr Woodward does not disappoint: 'Running a good campaign is
not just about having money. It's about being disciplined, coherent and
organised.
'In the last few months I think most people regard us as having run the
better campaign and I think that's by and large a reflection of the
relationship between the party chairman and the prime minister - you
couldn't get a sheet of tissue paper between them.'

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher bows out to a kiss and Tory cheers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, received a salvo of cheers
from ministers and Tory backbenchers, and a kiss on the hand from Mr Bernard
Weatherill, the Speaker, when she bowed out of the Commons yesterday.
She took her seat at 9.30am, when MPs assembled for the last time before the
general election, and kept in touch with developments over the next six
hours as the timetable for the final ceremony was repeatedly rearranged.
MPs dispatched five bills in as many minutes, in the process giving blanket
approval to 126 clauses and 22 schedules of the Friendly Societies Bill, and
disregarding - after momentarily overlooking  - an infringement of the
Commons' privileges by the Lords.
Peers were in less haste to clear the legislative decks. To the irritation
of MPs, debates on the Finance Bill, the Army Bill, the Friendly Societies
Bill and the Museums and Galleries Bill took far longer than expected.
MPs twice assembled, expecting to be summoned to the Lords for the
prorogation ceremony - the preliminary process before the dissolution of
parliament - only to be told that the Upper House was not yet ready to
receive them.
An exasperated Mr Tony Banks, the Labour MP for Newham north-west, bellowed:
'Thank God we are going to abolish them.'
When Admiral Sir Richard Thomas, the gentleman usher of the Black Rod,
finally arrived to summon the Commons to the Lords, Mr Ron Brown, the Labour
MP for Leith, made a vain attempt to impose a further delay on the
proceedings.
Ministers paid their own special tribute to Mrs Thatcher by allowing her to
take precedence over the other occupants of the government front bench and
follow Mr John MacGregor, the leader of the House, as he led MPs in bidding
farewell to the speaker, to the cheers of Tories.
There were further cheers for the Father of the House, Sir Bernard Braine,
who is also standing down.
Mr Banks, a wildlife campaigner, presented the Speaker with a toy badger,

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: John Major: The Movie starts to roll - The
Campaign Machine: Conservative / The Tories' style shift from past poll
battles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK Mr Chris Patten how the Conservatives are running their general election
campaign and the party chairman's first response is a negative: not like
1987.
Ask him on which issues the campaign will be fought and he offers a negative
and a positive: Labour's tax plans and Mr John Major's leadership.
The recession is to be ignored. When it must be acknowledged, it is to be
blamed on the world economy, fear of a Labour government or, privately, the
mistakes of Mr Major's predecessors.
Facing the closest election since the early 1970s, Mr Patten's priority is
to avoid the confusion, the personal and political rivalries, and the sheer
incompetence which allowed Labour to win the campaign five years ago.
Then it did not matter. In 1987, the slick efficiency of his campaign
machine could not overcome voters' distrust of Mr Neil Kinnock's policies.
This time the party that wins the campaign will win the election.
So the message from Conservative Central Office is that there will be no
repeat of the rows between Downing Street and Smith Square which dogged the
party in 1987.
The prime minister and party chairman, who have become good friends as well
as close political allies over the past 16 months, agreed well in advance
the main elements of the campaign. As one insider puts it: 'There can be no
recriminations if things go wrong.'
Of course, there will be more to the campaign than solidarity at the top -
about Pounds 20m more. The Conservatives, notoriously secretive about their
finances, are not prepared to put any figure on how much they will spend in
the quest for a fourth term. But senior figures do not demur at speculation
that the final bill will approach Pounds 20m.
One member of the party's ministerial 'A team' suggested at the weekend that
if it was still behind in the opinion polls in the final days before April
9, it might add another Pounds 4m or so to that figure in a burst of
last-minute advertising.
Shaken and rather humiliated by Labour's superior style in 1987, the Tories
intend to be more sophisticated, better-organised and more aggressive than
their main rival.
This time there will be lots of Tory glitz. Mr John Schlesinger, the
Hollywood film director, has been drafted in to make 'Major: The Movie'.
Central Office is spending Pounds 500,000 on a pantechnicon to haul round
the country the set for half-a-dozen 'Major in the round'
question-and-answer sessions.
Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber has rearranged a piece by the composer Henry Purcell
to produce a new theme for Tory election rallies. Shirley Bassey, Sarah
Brightman and Paul Daniels are among those enlisted to give the party
celebrity appeal.
Mechanics are in the hands of Mr Shaun Woodward, the communications director
recruited by Mr Patten on the recommendation of Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, a
mutual friend. The young but self-assured Mr Woodward has asked Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi to repeat the magic which won the Conservatives the 1979 election
but faded somewhat in 1983 and 1987 before the agency resigned the account.
Mr Maurice Saatchi leads a team of 25 working full-time on the account.
The aim is to reactivate the fears that led the skilled working classes to
desert Labour for Mrs Thatcher during the 1980s.
There is a less-than-subtle subtext: Labour cannot be trusted because Mr
Kinnock cannot be trusted. Look how often he has changed his mind, the
Tories will say. Can voters be sure he will not do so again?
It is only then that the positive message appears. The focus is Mr Major, Mr
Major and Mr Major. The theme is ing Street in which he abolished the poll
tax, led the country to victory in the Gulf war and ushered in a new, more
caring, brand of Conservatism, the prime minister deserves his own mandate.
The pitch is not for a fourth Tory term but for a first Major term.
The manifesto published tomorrow - built around the distinctly
un-Thatcherite concept that wealth and welfare go hand in hand - is designed
to give substance to the image.
But it is the man rather than the policies that the campaign is designed to
sell.
As one self-confessed cynic on the Conservative team puts its: 'They (the
voters) like John Major and they are afraid of Labour's tax plans. We
shouldn't clutter their minds with too much else.'

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Targeting voters wastes valuable ammunition -
The fight for those marginals that may prove crucial to the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS election there are 500 seats where the outcome is not in doubt. In
the 150 seats where there is a chance of change, 80 per cent of voters will
vote as they did last time - even though a few of them may need a little
encouragement to go to the polling booth.
The election will be decided by at most 2m people (say 12,000 people in each
of 150 constituencies). On a more ruthless estimate there will be 80,000 key
voters (say 2,000 in each of 40 constituencies). Rational campaigners should
focus all their efforts on these target voters.
As the identification of marginal seats has become more precise, parties
have indeed focused more of their efforts on them, targeting resources on
the constituencies most likely to be won and lost.
With computers it is easier to build up marked registers, showing
occupations and past canvass returns and records of voting. Subject to the
limits on election expenses, direct mail can be sent to particular groups
and above all to opinion leaders - not only doctors and journalists but also
publicans and hairdressers. Money can be raised, workers can be recruited,
membership can be maintained in ways impossible in the past.
Does it make a difference? Can voters be efficiently targeted either
collectively or individually? Is it possible to identify and persuade the
minority of voters who have a special propensity to float?
Targeting has three problems:
How to identify the individual targets. There seldom is enough evidence to
isolate subgroups.
How to speak to the targets in the right persuasive language.
How to address any appeal to those who will be attracted by it without
letting it reach those who may be alienated. A pledge to end fox-hunting may
drive away as much support as it attracts.
Over 40 years of election watching I have listened to much talk about
organising mutual aid (workers from safe seats helping out in marginals),
about reaching out to opinion leaders, about listing old people's homes
where postal votes may be garnered, and about employing other campaigning
gimmicks. I have found little evidence that these efforts have much effect.
About 10 per cent of people are entitled to a postal vote but it tends to
average a mere 2 per cent. In no constituency in Britain is 5 per cent
reached and there has been only a modest link between the size of the postal
vote and the marginality of the seat. Party organisations plainly fail to
deliver on this most obvious of opportunities.
The point is that local campaigning is nothing compared with national
campaigning. Not 10 per cent of voters will encounter their local candidate,
but more than 90 per cent will be exposed to leaders of the parties on TV.
It is on television and in the press that the parties make their case. Does
that give them the opportunity to target voters? They can hardly focus
solely on marginal seats since these are scattered across the various
television and newspaper markets. But can they target especially vulnerable
voters, people whose social condition or occupation or policy views make
them especially open to persuasion?
A generation ago the chief publicity officer of the Conservatives was
convinced that the election would be decided by the wives of the skilled
working class, C2 women. But when the election was over it seemed that the
appeals achieved nothing. The targets had, if anything, moved less towards
the Tories then the rest of the nation.
There is a popular legend that the C2s won the 1979 election for the
Conservatives. There was a large 8 per cent shift among C2s to the
Conservatives when Mrs Thatcher was elected, but no bigger than the 8 per
cent shift among the DEs. The cause lay far more in the working class's
disillusion with Mr Callaghan's government and the winter of discontent than
in any special targeting. The swing in marginal seats was no greater than in
the rest of the country.
At the mass level, targeting is difficult because the parties are addressing
a collective audience. Giveaways to a supposedly vulnerable sub-group will
have no appeal to the bulk of the audience and may excite cynicism. There is
always the question: 'Where's the money coming from?'
The trouble with targeting is that we are multiple personalities. An old-age
pensioner may be house owner, animal lover, anti-European and retired
farmer. A single parent may have diverse interests and prejudices far
removed from any stereotype. Any attempt to appeal to such people under one
heading may offend them as general citizens.
The assumption of a common interest among a common category may be
misconceived. Mori recently found that 33 per cent of the unemployed would
vote Conservative. This, allowing for their class composition, is very
little below the national figure.
For an issue to have a significant impact on the election outcome it must
satisfy three conditions:
It must be salient to the electorate. If they don't know or care about it,
it can't sway votes.
The public must be aware of a party difference on it, if it is to affect
their preference.
Opinion must be skewed on the subject. If the public is evenly divided then
as many voters will be alienated as attracted.
Relatively few issues meet this triple test of a public that cares, that is
informed of the party's stand, and that is unevenly split. For example, some
people care passionately about fox-hunting and know that Labour will vote
against and Conservatives for. However, it is an issue where there are as
many votes to be gained as lost.
On other issues, such as crime or cruelty to children, the public does not
differentiate between the parties. Targeting is logical, inevitable and
largely ineffective.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: SNP sees 40% of vote as a mandate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Scottish National Party needs the support of 40 per cent of the
electorate to win a mandate to negotiate independence for Scotland, Mr Alex
Salmond, the SNP leader, said yesterday.
The party calculates that it could win the majority of Scotland's 72 seats
with 40 per cent of the votes cast on April 9.
This would give the party a moral authority to act on its programme for
independence within the framework of the European Community, Mr Salmond
said.
He added he was 'very confident' that the ICM poll in the Scotsman last week
which gave the SNP 28 per cent was right, and that a Mori poll in the Sunday
Times, which showed the party on 24 per cent, had got it wrong.
Both polls had showed Labour in the lead with 42 per cent.
He said that in the election of October 1974, the SNP had started with poll
ratings of 22 per cent, but had won 30 per cent of the actual vote, which
gave it 11 MPs.
The SNP holds five Scottish parliamentary seats. It had 14 per cent of the
vote in the 1987 election.
Since then, it has gained Glasgow Govan from Labour in a by-election and
Dunfermline West through the defection of Mr Dick Douglas, the sitting MP,
from Labour.
Mr Salmond, who was launching the SNP's general election campaign in
Edinburgh, said the party was optimistic of achieving its 40 per cent in
spite of the amount of ground it still had to gain.
'The Scottish National Party enters this election full of confidence and the
will to win. We are not running for a place, we are not campaigning for a
hung parliament, we are campaigning for a mandate for Scottish
independence,' he said.
Mr Salmond said that the future of Scotland was the biggest issue in this
election campaign, and claimed that the SNP was setting the agenda for all
the other parties.
PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh Nationalist party, began its election campaign with a
call for extra help for small businesses in Wales. Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, MP
for the Isle of Anglesey in the last parliament, said the most important
economic benefit for the Welsh economy would be the end of the uniform
business rate.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The markets take cover - City Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE first sound of electoral gunshot the stock market has posed a far
from valiant spectacle, with the FT-SE 100 Index losing 104 points since
last Wednesday when the April 9 poll was announced. There was little sign of
serious resistance yesterday, with rallies petering out and the Footsie
closing 5.7 points down at 2,470.7.
There are apparently two intermingled problems. First, big investors are
starting to have doubts about their long-held assumption that somehow the
Conservatives would squeeze back into power with a small but working
majority. Second, the Budget last Tuesday turned out to be a sad
disappointment: it failed to include convincing vote-catching proposals, and
at the same time it promised a flood of gilt-edged issues.
According to Mr Richard Kersley at broker Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stock
market had got a little ahead of itself, closing on Budget night at the
year's high. Dashed hopes for interest rate cuts helped to undermine this
level. But he argues that at around 2,400 and a 5 1/2 per cent yield, the
market would start to look attractive, come what may in the polls.
If the Tories win, he thinks the market would soon threaten its all-time
high of 2,679.6 last September and could reach 2,900 by the autumn, assuming
a decent economic recovery.
Mr Nick Knight of Nomura says 'the political outcome is probably largely
irrelevant'.
A cautious message comes from Mr Tony Dye, strategist at Phillips &amp; Drew
Fund Management. 'Last week there was a realisation that a Tory win was not
a 90 per cent certainty,' he says, adding: 'There is quite a lot more
vulnerability in the market.'
Labour's threat looms larger in London. Kleinwort Benson's chartist Mr Nick
Glydon says that on average the market has risen 2.3 per cent the day after
a Tory win but has fallen 2.6 per cent after Labour victories. After the two
unexpected Labour wins in 1945 and February 1974 prices were nearly 10 per
cent lower within a week.
It is bound to be hard for the City's well-paid professionals to ignore
their own forebodings about a jump in personal taxes under Labour. The
shadow Budget yesterday confirmed a rise in the marginal income tax rate to
59 per cent for those earning more than Pounds 40,000.
Labour's policies on sterling and government borrowing seem to be no
different from those of the Conservatives. But this does not prevent the
City from harbouring suspicions, and the investment institutions may demand
a higher interest rate if they buy gilts from a Labour administration.
Higher gilt yields would undermine equity prices, given that yield ratios
are a key factor in market valuation. The nervous defenders of the equity
market may be driven into their own minefield.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour plans to end age discrimination at
work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party's manifesto, to be announced tomorrow, will contain a
commitment to outlaw age discrimination at work. This legislation would
stand alongside the existing laws on race and sex discrimination.
The measure would make it illegal to specify age in job advertisements or to
select people for redundancy on the basis of age (as opposed to length of
service).
It would also make it illegal for government programmes to discriminate
against the over-50s as does the Employment Training scheme, which gives
priority to younger workers.
Party leaders would offer nothing more than a broad commendation of the
manifesto last night after a three and a half hour joint shadow cabinet and
national executive committee meeting finalised the document in time for
tomorrow's launch.
Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign co-ordinator, commented only that
the 10,000-word manifesto would contain 'fresh ideas and some surprises.' He
added that together with the shadow budget unveiled yesterday it would
constitute a formidable launch pad for a Labour election victory.
Supporters of such legislation argue that one worker in three will be over
40 by the end of the decade, yet older workers are widely discriminated
against and increasingly used as a reserve army of labour pulled into
employment in boom and jettisoned in recession.
Well over a third of all unemployed over-50s have been out of work for more
than one year - a far higher proportion than in other age groups. Labour
policy makers argue that legislation could cut that number significantly.
They also claim that nearly 40 per cent of all job advertisements
discriminate on grounds of age.
Most employer bodies acknowledge that there is some unjustified prejudice
against employing older people, although some employers, including retailers
B&amp;Q and Tesco, have special recruitment drives for older people.
The US has outlawed age discrimination since 1967 but the UK's Conservative
government has repeatedly opposed legislation. Last month the government
announced plans to set up an advisory body to help eliminate age
discrimination.
Support for the government's voluntarist view has come from the Commons
employment committee which examined, and rejected, the case for legislation
in 1989.
A growing number of big employers, including Unilever, Allied Lyons and BTR,
are allowing men to retire at the age of 60, according to MSF, the general
technical union.
MSF claims there is now a strong pull towards harmonisation 'downward' to
60.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT Election Share Index drew a mixed bag of phone calls on its first day
yesterday: a broker and a radio station wanting to quote it, and a
constituent commenting ever-so-politely on its place in the index. The
company concerned is BET, which made a lot of play a year or so ago of its
role as a one-stop supplier of business services. This led brokers to argue
that profits might suffer if BET had to pay a Labour national minimum wage
to its armies of cleaners and security guards, and qualified it for a place
in the Conservative win/Labour defeat section of the index.
Yesterday's phone call pointed out that BET also has a UK construction arm,
which might benefit from a Labour government's infrastructure spending. Nice
try: BET wins a small prize for attempting to position itself as the first
each-way bet of the campaign.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Real depth - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour has a bountiful range of politically powerful economic statistics
about the length and depth of the recession with which it can embarrass the
Tories. So why do they keep quoting one of the more dubious comparisons?
It is true that total UK gross domestic product fell by 2.5 per cent last
year; and yes, that is the largest annual fall since the 1930s, outstripping
the 1980 contraction by 0.5 percentage points.
Yet this is a needlessly misleading statistic. The current recession may be
the longest recession since the war, but 1980-81 is still the deepest,
whatever these annual gymnastics seem to suggest. GDP has fallen, in this
recession, by 3.7 per cent over the six quarters since the middle of 1990.
But GDP fell by 4.9 per cent in the five quarters between the fourth quarter
of 1979 and the first quarter of 1981. Counting from the third quarter of
1979, the first quarter of both negative growth and Tory government, output
fell by 5.5 per cent.
This government may have presided over the two deepest recessions since 1945
but this is still the shallower of the two - at least so far. Another
quarter or two of recession and 1990-92 could win both prizes.

For what seems like months, the Conservatives have been hammering away at a

 -one-third of all poster locations, according to the Tories.
Some have already fallen victim to simple, but effective political vandalism

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith claims he would revive economy in
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VISIBLE turnabout in the economy should be in evidence 'within a matter of
months' of a Labour government taking office, Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, claimed last night.
Speaking in the first of a series of televised debates between frontbench
spokesmen, Mr Smith said the impact of Labour's training and employment
relief measures would quickly register a slowdown in the rise of the jobless
figures, followed by a reversal of the trend.
His claims on the BBC's Panorama programme were dismissed by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, and deemed inadequate by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal
Democrats' finance spokesman.
Hopes that the debate would provoke fierce controversy or even a telling
election gaffe failed to materialise as the three combatants warily circled
each other on important tax and spending topics.
The challenges and counter-claims for the credibility of each party's
programme were less dramatic than the regular clashes that take place in
faster-paced interviews on current affairs programmes such as Newsnight.
With so much at stake, it was clear non one was ready to venture far from
their approved texts.
For Labour, Mr Smith made a credible case for his tax and spending plans,
unveiled in his shadow Budget yesterday, in spite of a repeated charge from
Mr Lamont that more rises in taxes, inflation and interest rates would
follow.
Mr Lamont pressed home the claim that Labour's plans were the most punitive
ever on middle income earners and that the Opposition's national minimum
wage would hurt business.
In between them, Mr Beith made his case for a further Pounds 2bn lift to the
economy over and above the increase in the public sector borrowing
requirment proposed in last week's Budget.
All three men committed their parties to observing the current exchange rate
within the ERM and rejected any suggestion of a devaluation.
Only once were voices tellingly raised, when Mr Lamont accused Labour of
being 'ludicrous' when it said a Pounds 1bn recovery package would have an
impact on a Pounds 600bn economy.
Mr Smith was stirred if not shaken. It was a 'typical Tory technique' to
claim credit for bringing down inflation and interest rates, when they had
put them up, he claimed.
As for inflation rises being a 'blip', since Mr Nigel Lawson's
chancellorship it had been 'blip, blip, blip', Mr Smith added.
What was Mr Lamont's response? Unfortunately, the Buggins' turn rules of
engagement meant it was time for Mr Beith, not the chancellor, to take his
cue.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A clash of symbols
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE only two days into the election campaign proper and the British
public is in danger of falling asleep to the clash of symbols.
Exactly a week ago we had Mr Norman Lamont's Budget, which confirmed that
the government could not risk a huge pre-electoral bribe for fear of how the
markets might react. What was on offer was therefore almost wholly symbolic.
It was pocket money now, as an earnest of intent to cut taxes by serious
amounts in the future.
Yesterday we had Mr John Smith's Budget. It was more or less all his own
work, which cannot be said of Mr Norman Lamont's proposals. That is why when
talking of the politics of the matter it feels apposite to refer to broad
Tory fiscal strategy as that of the prime minister and First Lord of the
Treasury, not the Chancellor.
Mr Smith, like Mr Major, was constrained by the magnitude of the public
sector borrowing requirement. You have to be a Liberal Democrat, with no
hope of achieving office, to dare to tell the voters that you would actually
increase a projected PSBR of Pounds 28bn by a further Pounds 2bn. This
proposal, made by the Lib Dems yesterday, is not damaging to Mr Paddy
Ashdown's party because nobody believes that there is the slightest chance
of it being put into practice.
Mr Smith enjoys no such luxury. He has a reputation to maintain as the most
conservative potential chancellor to appear on our television screens since
the then Mr Roy Jenkins bowed out in 1970 - or do I mean Sir Stafford Cripps
in 1950? Perhaps Mr Jenkins. Either way, Mr Smith is a star. If he led his
party Mr Major and the Conservatives would not stand a chance. When Mr
Smith's face appears on the television screen you know that all is right
with the world. He is sober, serious, sympathetic, straight and, to cap it
all, Scottish. No mere English politician can compete.
So when he presented his alternative Budget yesterday Sober John was careful
to preserve his reputation. It all had to look right. It did. It had to
appear to be no more profligate than the Tory offering. I suspect that to
untutored eyes it may have done so. It was also supposed to add up. It did
not. Something specific on inflation assumptions and privatisation receipts
would have helped. Absent of such little details, achieving the appearance
of probity must have been a strain. The net effect is that some of the
electoral bribes being offered by the shadow chancellor are almost as
symbolic as those put forward by Mr Lamont.
Mr Smith's scratch outline must at least further neutralise the Tories'
efforts
In the examples provided by the party the top beneficiary is an engineer on
Pounds 19,527 a year, married to a bank teller on Pounds 10,270 with three
children 'and Grandma living in with a pension of Pounds 54 per week'.
Thanks to significant increases in child benefit and pensions, the total
household gain would be some Pounds 500 a year compared with Mr Lamont's
Budget - but try telling that to Grandma in the hope of a larger increase in
her contribution to housekeeping.
I suspect that the engineer, who doubtless hopes to earn more than Pounds
21,000 next year, would be put off voting Labour by the abolition of the
ceiling on National Insurance contributions. The bank teller/mother of three
is well-bribed, however.
Unfortunately for Mr Smith, most of the other examples are down to the
symbolic level, even if you use his trick of citing family rather than
individual incomes. As to a solicitor on Pounds 24,000 married to a teacher
on Pounds 16,071 with two children, Mr Lamont's Budget is shown in Labour's
examples to be the better financial bet.
There would have been more for Labour to spend lower down the income scale
if its original threat to extend the 9 per cent National Insurance impost to
'unearned' income had been maintained, but Mr Smith learned in time that
this would be a vote-loser, not least among the party's many potential
supporters who are nursing large redundancy payments.
The shadow chancellor's spending plans may do more political good for the
party than his juggling with taxes. Labour is now able to assert that it has
properly costed a Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme, a 'minimum' further
increase of Pounds 1bn on the National Health Service, and Pounds 600m for
education. That should in theory wrap up the nurses, the teachers, and the
building workers. It is also offering something to encourage capital
investment which may raise the hopes of some of the unemployed.
Add to these categories mothers gaining child benefit, pensioners gaining
Pounds 5 a week if single and Pounds 8 if a couple, irrespective of their
current incomes, and other state beneficiaries, and the Labour spending
programme can be said to be well-market-researched by the Institute of
Bribery, Inducements, Handouts, Backhanders, Vote Purchasing, Wallet Voting
and Symbolic Democracy.
As to its effect, we shall see in next week-end's polls. Labour's backroom
officials were in a state of some excitement in advance of Mr Smith's
presentation of his Budget yesterday. This, they argued, would break the tie
between the two leading parties. It would put Labour ahead of the Tories in
the opinion polls, and keep it there. They must be at least half right: if
Mr Lamont's Budget neutralised itself last week, Mr Smith's scratch outline
must at least further neutralise the Tories' efforts this week.
There remains, however, the other half. That is the long list of Labour
spending promises which must, by definition, now go unmet. Either these are
to be made good later, breaking yesterday's shadow Budget, or they are like
so much else in this election: merely symbolic.

Score: 1 out of 10
THE spending measures are strangely focused for a party which seeks to use
fiscal policy to boost the economy's long-term growth rate. What role do
higher child benefit or extra pensions play in that? The abolition of the
national insurance contributions ceiling is in itself a useful taxation
measure but the implications of the top rate of income tax and national
insurance contributions will probably undermine the work efforts of the
higher-paid and to that extent undermine the supply potential of the
economy. Industrial measures were too small-scale.
PETER SPENCER - SHEARSON LEHMAN
Score 7 out of 10
I GIVE it two cheers. It is a prudent Budget remaining within the limits set
by the government's own Budget proposals. It maintains the safety net of the
ERM and as such there is little in this to worry the financial markets. In
terms of income distribution the Budget casts Mr Smith in the guise of a
latter day Robin Hood - taking from the rich, and not so very rich, to give
to the not so poor. You have to have a taxable income to benefit from this -
the very poor don't do so well. Its main failing is that it does very little
to help boost confidence and promote economic recovery.
DAVID KERN - NATWEST BANK
Score 5 out of 10
BASICALLY an unsurprising shadow Budget which confirms the perception of
John Smith as a competent and fundamentally prudent potential chancellor.
This is underlined by the net tax increase of Pounds 1.8bn. However, the
statement leaves some big question marks. It is not at all clear what
assumption Labour is making about privatisation receipts, and although there
was a commitment to staying in the ERM, the statement did not address the
widespread anxieties in the City that Labour might devalue.
KEVIN GARDINER - SG WARBURG SECURITIES
Score 5 out of 10
ONE point higher than Lamont but only just. There is as much consumption
going on but it is different people doing the consuming. It is a
redistributional Budget with a macro framework, not much different from last
week's Budget. The overall tone should be reassuring to the markets. It is
quite encouraging to have an opposition party quantify its proposals in a
reasonably systematic way. Also welcome is the restatement of the commitment
to the ERM, and that there are no plans to borrow more than the present
government.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Proposals 'neutral for middle earners'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW would the alternative Budget proposals affect FT readers?
A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that 48 per cent of the
population would benefit more under Labour's proposals than under the Tory
Budget. However, 17 per cent would do better under the Tories. Labour's
proposals would help the lowest paid, and would be virtually neutral for a
broad swathe of middle-income earners, according to the study.
For example, those earning between Pounds 400 and Pounds 499 are on average
Pounds 2.13 per week better off, while those earning between Pounds 500 and
Pounds 599 are Pounds 1.49 per week worse off. This is thanks mainly to the
abolition of the National Insurance contributions ceiling, which effectively
means that nobody currently earning more than Pounds 22,000 per year pays
more than Pounds 1,699 in NICs.
But only 1 per cent of those with an income of more than Pounds 1,000 per
week will be better off under Labour, according to the IFS, while 98 per
cent will be worse off. Their average weekly loss is Pounds 105.70.
Figures produced by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, show how this
will work. They take as their example a family with one breadwinner with a
gross annual income of Pounds 150,000. While under the Conservative Budget
this family would only pay Pounds 48,454 in income tax at 40 per cent, under
Labour they would pay Pounds 5,070 at 40 per cent, and Pounds 54,140 at 50
per cent.
Abolition of the NIC ceiling also adds to the tax burden. Under the
Conservative Budget the National Insurance bill would be Pounds 1,699. Under
Labour this increases to Pounds 13,247.
This means that take-home pay would be reduced from Pounds 94,022 to Pounds
71,618. On the assumption that the family has two children, Labour's child
allowance proposals would reduce this difference slightly from Pounds 94,929
to Pounds 72,653. This would leave the family of four Pounds 428.38 per
week, or 23.6 per cent, worse off than under the Tory Budget. For a family
earning Pounds 100,000 gross, net pay is cut by 19.67 per cent.
Families on this income but with two earners are much less severely
affected, because they earn double the amount at only 25 per cent tax before
the higher rates become payable.
A family earning Pounds 50,000 gross annually would also pay more, although
the effect is less marked. Rather than paying Pounds 8,454 at 40 per cent,
they would pay Pounds 5,070 at 40 per cent and Pounds 4,140 at 50 per cent.
NICs would rise to Pounds 4,247.
This makes for a fall of 10 per cent in take-home pay, from Pounds 34,022 to
Pounds 30,618.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Smith kills charge of concealed tax horrors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN election-winning Budget it was probably not. There was too much detailed
talk of complex, voter-unfriendly concepts such as thresholds and National
Insurance for that.
However, Labour's unprecedented shadow budget extravaganza cannot be written
off as a merely defensive public relations gesture. As one of the party's
senior number-crunchers put it: 'We have been playing a lengthy game of
poker - as far as I am concerned, we have won.'
That, too, is premature. Only on April 9 will the game be formally judged.
In the meantime, just as a real budget demands a decent interval before the
initial verdicts become clear, so must that unveiled yesterday by Mr John
Smith.
But as the economists pore over the figures, some political conclusions can
be drawn immediately. First and, arguably, foremost, the shadow chancellor's
detailed presentation kills the charge that Labour has been concealing a
confidential folder of tax horrors from the electorate.
Asked directly by the Financial Times yesterday whether he had further
proposals under his desk, Mr Smith swallowed, then gave his pledge that
there was no more to come, at least, in his first Budget.
The Conservatives' claims that there is a buried 'Tax Bombshell' - an
average of Pounds 1,000 per head was the politically powerful charge in
January - have effectively been defused, however much it may still be
repeated in the election campaign.
Furthermore, Mr Smith's calculation that somewhere between 80 to 90 per cent
of taxpayers will either be beneficiaries or unaffected will be a statistic
deployed time and again by Labour canvassers.
If Mr Smith's figures are right, their revenue-raising impact will give a
Labour government a total of Pounds 5.4bn to play with up until the end of
its first full year in government - that is until April 1994.
This not only provides the funds for Labour's Pounds 1.1bn recovery
programme. It makes way for the party's plans to allocate Pounds 1bn for the
National Health Service and Pounds 600m for education, with plenty to spare
for other schemes.
Months of Tory attacks along the lines of 'there they go again, spending
money they haven't got' should, in theory at least, now fall.
Above all, Mr Smith's fully-patented remedy for Britain's ills at least
appear to address the parts Labour policies are intended to reach. Its
strongly redistributive underlying theme will go down extremely well in all
quarters of the party from right to left.
Whether, however, the Budget also 'sells' Labour to the country's crucial
floating voters remains the huge and, until the opinion pollsters do their
work, wholly unanswered question.
The political calculations behind the Budget-making exercise focused on how
to counter the Tories' negative campaigning on the then-undisclosed details
of Labour's tax and spending agenda.
The findings of private polling revealed the powerful impact of Tory Central
Office's January tax offensive on what one Labour official described as
Basildon man.
'We discovered that a group of people earning between Pounds 12,000 and
Pounds 16,000 a year who had nothing to fear at all from us, believed what
the Tories were saying about 'Labour's Tax Bombshell'. We had to deal with
that.'
Mr Smith also dealt with fierce hostility - particularly from the recently
redundant - to his plans to apply a 9 per cent National Insurance levy to
unearned income over Pounds 3,000. On the advice of his postbag, he dropped
it.
But none of this frees Labour from Tory charges that it is essentially
hostile to the better-off. Many not-so-rich Basildon men will be affected.
What is more, those that simply aspire to salaries over and above the
relatively modest sum of Pounds 21,060 - the point at which the NIC measure
bites - will also be wary.
The shadow chancellor was honest enough to deal with that head-on yesterday.
'We have had 13 years in which people at the top got preferential
treatment,' he said. 'In this budget, we are starting to take back something
for the average taxpayer and the average family.'
The task now lies with Labour's campaign propagandists to present the shadow
Budget as a new battleground on which voters must choose between the two
parties.
Yesterday's unprecedented exercise - a historic first for any opposition
party - gives voters more detailed data from which to make their decision
than ever before.
Inspite of all the razzmatazz, there are still no guarantees that the
electorate will thank Mr Smith for that.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'A fair deal for average taxpayer'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Smith said that Labour's draft Budget would 'provide a fair deal for
the average taxpayer' and help Britain achieve recovery from recession.
Compared with what had been announced and leaked in advance, the shadow
chancellor's proposals contained few surprises. To a considerable extent, he
has taken over last week's Conservative proposals to help business and added
some of his own, such as a one-year increase in capital allowances to 40 per
cent from 25 per cent and increased government spending on training and
providing job experience.
On personal taxation and benefits, Labour's Budget maps out a very different
philosophy from that of Mr Norman Lamont. The average taxpayer stands to be
better off under Labour, but not dramatically so. At the higher income
levels, particularly in families with only one, highly-paid earner, election
of a Labour government would result in a significant reduction in disposable
income. Mr Smith's first Budget would redistribute income from the high to
the low-paid while Mr Lamont's Budget was designed to pass modest tax cuts
to all.
If he becomes chancellor, Mr Smith will:
scrap the lower 20 per cent tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable
income announced by Mr Lamont last week;
increase the personal allowance before which income tax is paid by 10 per
cent, compared with the government indexing this by 4.5 per cent.
abolish the 2 per cent employee's contribution to National Insurance on
earnings under Pounds 54 a week.
These moves would take 740,000 people out of income tax and benefit every
employee earning up to Pounds 22,000 a year.
On benefits, Labour's child-benefit plans would provide an extra Pounds 127
a year for a family with two children. Its proposal to raise pensions by
Pounds 5 for a single person and Pounds 8 for a married couple contrasts
with last week's government announcement of extra help for pensioners on
income support of Pounds 2 a week for a single person and Pounds 3 for
couples from October.
Mr Smith said a single person on average earnings would have over Pounds 100
a year more in disposable income; an average two-earner family with two
children would gain Pounds 311.
These gains would be financed by increased levies on people earning more
than Pounds 22,000 a year. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies
(IFS), Labour's plans would cost families earning Pounds 52,000 a year an
average of Pounds 5,500 a year. Under Mr Lamont's budget, most taxpayers
would be about Pounds 2.64 a week better off, with higher earners, at
present paying the 40 per cent top tax rate, gaining Pounds 160 a year.
Mr Smith's first Budget would fulfil Labour's long standing promise to scrap
the upper earnings limit on employee National Insurance contributions.
Employees would pay 9 per cent on every pound earned above Pounds 21,060 a
year, against nothing at present. Also, a 50 per cent higher tax rate would
apply to taxable income of Pounds 36,375 and over, so that a single person
would pay 59 per cent in tax and national insurance on every pound earned
over Pounds 40,000 a year.
The shadow chancellor also announced tougher tax treatment on certain
benefits in kind, including a plan to scrap the 2 per cent incentive paid to
people to opt out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps).
Labour would also keep the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions for
at least another year.
To reassure financial markets, Mr Smith pledged to take sterling into the
narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism at its DM2.95 parity 'in
due course'.
Mr Smith also said that Labour would keep some parts of last week's
government Budget. These included the proposals to ease the burden of the
uniform business rate, the special assistance for the car industry and the
help for small businesses, including the removal of most small businesses
from inheritance tax. He also said Labour would not alter Mr Lamont's
proposals on excise duties.
Labour said its tax plans would raise extra revenue of Pounds 1.89bn in
1992-93 and Pounds 3.5bn in 1993-94, which it would use to increase
investment. This would include a Pounds 1.1bn 'recovery programme' for the
economy, incorporating the more generous treatment of capital allowances as
well as Pounds 600m spending on skills and the unemployed.
Labour's published plans contain no estimate for the cost of the proposed
capital allowance changes, though these could be expected to hit government
revenues from 1993-94. Last night Labour officials estimated the likely cost
at Pounds 600m against a recent IFS study which estimated that 40 per cent
capital allowances for one year could cost Pounds 2bn.
Labour's Budget has other gaps too, with no estimate of the impact on growth
or inflation. Labour adopted the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing
requirement set by the government for 1992-93, but did not indicate its
future borrowing needs. It was silent on privatisation. Last week's
government Budget envisages privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn in 1992-93
and Pounds 5.5bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR PARTY'S shadow Budget proposals brought a mixed response from
manufacturing companies yesterday.
SmithKline Beecham, the UK's second-largest drug business, said: 'There is
nothing in the announcement that gives any stimulation to industry
whatsoever.' But Mr Kanak Bhatt, finance director of British Vita, a
plastics company, said: 'A lot of Labour's ideas on revitalising industry
and public-sector investment seem highly credible.'
Sir Colin Corness, chairman of Redland, the building materials group, said:
'The only obvious benefit to the construction industry lies in the phased
release of council-house receipts, a good thing for the construction
industry and rented sector.'
The Confederation of British Industry and several large companies, including
ICI and BA, refused to comment. The CBI reiterated that capital allowances
for investment should be raised from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, one of the
shadow chancellor's proposals.
The Institute of Directors called it 'a Budget for re-cycling money'. Ms Ann
Robinson, head of the IoD Policy Unit said: 'It nationalises private wealth
for public spending'. The IoD attacked raising capital allowances as
'fundamentally flawed'. It would 'only suck in imports of plant and
equipment'.
Mr John Binnie, deputy managing director of Allied Colloids, said he was
sceptical about Labour's proposed Pounds 1.1bn industrial recovery
programme. He said: 'Britain has tried ideas like this before and they
haven't worked.' Proposals to tax the higher-paid would de-motivate senior
management.
Many industrialists were unimpressed by proposals to increase taxes for the
higher-paid but would welcome higher capital allowances.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Party upheaval led to 'responsible' approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT is the intellectual pedigree for Mr John Smith's alternative budget?
The shadow chancellor's modestly redistributive aspirations and his
acceptance of fiscal fine-tuning would no doubt have been familiar to an
earlier generation of Labour politicians. So, too, would the discipline of a
semi-fixed exchange rate. But the 'responsible' approach to public spending
is unquestionably something new.
It would simply not have occurred to many Labour politicians in the 1970s
that an election might be winnable on the basis of financing increased
spending out of higher taxation, while maintaining a similar public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) to the one promised by the Tories. How did this
upheaval in Labour economic thinking come about?
The watershed almost certainly came with the cabinet debate over the terms
of Britain's letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund in 1976.
The terms of the debate were set, first, by the then prime minister, James
Callaghan, in a speech to the Labour party conference, which was partly
drafted by his son-in-law Peter Jay. Against the background of a spiralling
PSBR, plummeting sterling, high unemployment and inflation that had hit 27
per cent at its peak, Callaghan declared: 'We used to think that you could
spend your way out of a recession. . . .I tell you in all candour that that
option no longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only
worked. . . .by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy,
followed by a higher level of unemployment. . . .That is the history of the
last twenty years.'
Callaghan's speech appeared to herald the end of the Keynesian orthodoxy.
But orthodoxy was not to go without a fight. And it was the late Anthony
Crosland, the great architect of the revisionist Labour dream of a social
market economy, who emerged as the most articulate opponent of the
'deflationist' tendency. He told Callaghan that it was all a banker's ramp.
The economy, he claimed, was in better shape than the Treasury was prepared
to admit.
As irony would have it, Crosland was more right about the the economy than
the Treasury knew. Cash limits were making bigger inroads into the PSBR than
officials recognised and the balance of payments deficit substantially
reflected investment in North Sea oil fields that had yet to produce
revenue. But as the former Trade Secretary Edmund Dell observes, in his
memoir of the 1974-76 period, that was not the perception in the markets;
and it was inconceivable that any version of Crosland's strategy would have
won international support.
It took some time for the free spending habit to extinguish itself. Indeed,
the implausibility of Labour's spending plans was a contributory factor in
its departure from office in 1979. Nor did Labour ever adopt the domestic
version of monetarism that came and went under the Tories in the first half
of the 1980s. But by the late 1980s, after a decade of Thatcherism, the
boundaries of the economic debate had undeniably changed. And so had the
people with most influence on Labour party policy.
The star of the Oxbridge intellectuals who dominated in the 1960s and 1970s
has waned. Meantime the Scottish ascendancy, represented by John Smith,
Gordon Brown and Robin Cook, exerts a more powerful influence.
If Tony Crosland were around today he might well have worried about the
narrow ground over which John Smith is seeking to differentiate his party
against the Tories. The case for and against devaluation in present
circumstances might have been more noisily fought. But that does not mean
that a fight will not come in the end under a Labour government or
Labour-led coalition.
The new responsibility means that Labour's more enticing promises have been
made dependent on economic growth. Yet last week's cheerful growth forecasts
from the Treasury have met with widespread scepticism. The worry today is
about a 1930s-style debt deflation, in which adherence to the ERM prevents
sufficiently large interest rate cuts to limit the damage. How will the
Labour faithful respond if the promised expenditure seems to be endlessly
deferred? How long before they recall that it was a Labour chancellor,
Philip Snowden, who gave financial rectitude a bad name in the Slump?

THE UK newspaper and magazine industry yesterday emerged as the winner of
the year-long legal contest with the BBC and ITV over the cost of printing
programme schedules for television and radio.
The Copyright Tribunal yesterday set a scale of charges for printing the
listings which fell well short of those demanded by broadcasters.
Under the settlement BBC Enterprises and Independent Television Publishers
will receive a maximum of Pounds 800,000 a year each for allowing their
listings to be printed in the national and regional press.
The BBC estimated it would have received about Pounds 4m a year if the
tribunal had ruled in favour of its proposed rates. The ITP would have
received about the same.
The Newspaper Society produced a figure of Pounds 14.5m for the possible
costs of the broadcasters' original rates to the newspaper and magazine
industry.
The tribunal ruling will be backdated to last year and increased by 4 per
cent for this year and rise in line with inflation.
The tribunal ruled that any publications wanting to use the listings must
pay Pounds 200 for 1991 and Pounds 208 for 1992. A further charge of 0.003
pence per copy must then be met for daily listings.
The BBC said: 'We are disappointed at the decision. We feel it fails to
recognise the value of the BBC programme schedules. It appears that
newspapers and magazines feel they have a considerable value otherwise they
would not rush to produce so many supplements.'
The BBC and ITP have 28 days to lodge an appeal, but a BBC spokesman said no
decision had been taken yet. ITP made no comment on the ruling yesterday.
The Newspaper Society welcomed the ruling. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, its
director, said: 'We are delighted at this outcome. Regional and local
newspapers have published daily TV listings without charge by either side
for 30 years.'

FT  17 MAR 92 / EETPU leaders seek to isolate Hammond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW leadership of the EETPU electricians' union sought to distance
itself yesterday from the actions of Mr Eric Hammond, former general
secretary, in a move which signals an attempt to improve its relations with
other unions.
Without directly attacking Mr Hammond, the executive issued a statement
implying strong criticism of his role in the move by News International, the
newspaper publisher, to Wapping in the mid 1980s and the subsequent loss of
more than 5,000 print jobs.
Last week Mr Hammond admitted he held secret talks with News International
for more than a year before the Wapping move. Previously he told the TUC
that any talks had been at local level.
The EETPU executive said after an emergency meeting it had believed the
submissions to the TUC had been 'accurate in every respect . . . the
executive places great store in dealing in good faith with other trade
unions, employers and our members. We look forward to developing
constructive working relationships with other unions'.
The statement will encourage unions that the EETPU is planning a
constructive attitude in forthcoming talks over its possible re-admission to
the TUC as part of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Local pay deal likely at health trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMUNITY health trust in Dorset announced yesterday that it expected to
agree Britain's first locally negotiated deal on pay and conditions,
signalling a move away from the national Whitley Council agreements for
health workers, Lisa Wood writes.
West Dorset Community Trust said it was negotiating a local 'reward package'
with trade unions representing its 1,200 hospital and community services
staff. This would be applicable to all staff except doctors. The package
would include performance-related pay and changes in holiday and hours
agreements.
A radical departure from the rigid pay and conditions of the National Health
Service's Whitley Council was a prime objective for the self-governing
hospital and ambulance trusts when the first wave came into operation in
April last year.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Looking down the barrel of the supergun: Ministry procedures
are blamed for allowing British involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN British customs swooped at Teesport, Cleveland, on April 10 1990, it
seemed an unusual move. They seized innocuous steel tubes, supposedly for an
Iraqi petrochemical project.
One week later Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary,
explained to parliament that 'the government recently became aware in
general terms of an Iraqi project to develop a long-range gun'.
It is now know Saddam Hussein's 'Project Babylon' aimed to produce several
giant guns theoretically capable of threatening the whole of the Persian
Gulf - and Israel  - with nuclear or chemical warheads. Moreover, three
British companies were involved, directly or indirectly, in supplying
components. How these companies were duped both by Iraq and the designer of
the supergun - Space Research Corporation (SRC) of Belgium - and how they
avoided export controls for so long, has never been fully explained - nor
has the validity of Mr Ridley's claim that the government was ignorant of
the affair until the last minute. Those looking for answers in yesterday's
report from the Commons trade and industry select committee may be
disappointed.
After a two-year investigation the committee has plumped for the 'cock-up'
theory, blaming inadequate procedures and communications in government
departments.
The events which prompted the investigation began in summer 1988, when the
Department of Trade and Industry examined two UK contracts to supply steel
tubes supposedly for an Iraqi petrochemical project. Without consulting the
Ministry of Defence the DTI decided one of the contracts - placed with
Sheffield Forgemasters  - did not require an export licence.
Walter Somers, the Halesowen steel company which had a similar contract
referred to the DTI by the Conservative MP Sir Hal Miller, a business
contact approached for advice, was told it did not require an export
licence, although the DTI referred the matter to a materials specialist in
the MoD. The specialist said he could establish no definite military purpose
for the tubes. His decision was based on two 10-minute phone conversations.
In autumn 1989 the MoD and UK intelligence services received separate
tip-offs about the Iraqi project from directors of Astra Holdings, the
British defence group. Astra had recently acquired PRB, a Belgian munitions
company, and discovered it was supplying propellants to Iraq for a very
large gun.
A report was circulated around the DTI and MoD, but no connection was made
with the contracts for steel tubes examined the year before. The MoD
specialist who examined the Somers contract did not even see a copy. This
was blamed by officials on MoD 'compartmentalisation'.
In spite of the warnings more than five months passed before British
intelligence tipped off customs officers in April 1990. Their information
prompted the seizure at Teesport of tubes made by Sheffield Forgemasters.
Further British-made components were impounded at Patras, Greece.
This version of events, however, ignores several questions raised during the
investigation. These have prompted theories of a conspiracy involving
western intelligence services and, possibly, the highest levels of
government.
The unanswered allegations centre on the following claims:
Dr Christopher Cowley, supergun project manager at SRC, has claimed that
from June 1988 Dr Gerald Bull, the gun's designer, kept British intelligence
fully informed about the project until he was murdered in Brussels in 1990.
If so, why did intelligence officers allow it to proceed and did they notify
ministers?
Evidence emerged at the weekend that the UK's Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) intercepted communications regarding the supergun in
autumn 1989, which were passed to an assessment officer in the cabinet
office. From here they may have been discussed by the joint intelligence
committee and included in a weekly intelligence summary sent to some cabinet
minis-ters and the prime minister.
Mr Gerald James, former Astra chairman, has alleged his company was steered
into acquiring PRB, the Belgian company manufacturing propellants, by a
number of prominent figures with intelligence connections.
New documents were presented to the committee last week suggesting that
Sheffield Forgemasters may have had closer links with other European
companies supplying supergun components than was disclosed during hearings.
The only two legal cases brought in connection with the affair - against Dr
Cowley and Mr Peter Mitchell, managing director of Walter Somers - were
dropped on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Dr Cowley claims this was
because they would have embarrassed the government. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
attorney general, and customs officials refused to answer the committee's
questions about these cases.
Mr Christopher Gumbley, who had been arrested by MoD police on corruption
charges, met Dr Bull in Brussels only hours before the scientist's
assassination. He says Dr Bull showed him what appeared to be surveillance
documents on members of PRB's staff and said British intelligence had used
the company for covert operations.
What could have been the motives for a conspiracy by the government and
intelligence services? Some believe the government had a covert policy of
bolstering Iraq against the threat of Islamic fundamentalism. Only when
opinions about Saddam Hussein were revised in early 1990 was the project
stopped.
It may never be established whether it was incompetence or a covert policy
that allowed arms and equipment to be supplied to a country which would end
up at war with Britain.

FT  17 MAR 92 / BT puts help desk in Highlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT STAFF in the south-east of England who experience trouble with their
personal computers will be calling a help desk based at Thurso in Caithness
 -600 miles away at the northern tip of Britain  - by the end of this year.
The Pounds 650,000 project, which will initially employ 26 people, is aimed
partly at demonstrating that the remote Highlands of Scotland are a viable
location for telecommunication-based operations. It is being heavily
subsidised by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), the official
development body.
BT is working on a Pounds 16m project to upgrade the telecommunications
system in the Highlands and Islands to the latest digital standard, and is
also installing integrated services digital network (ISDN), which allows
very fast transmission of data. The Highlands are getting ISDN before many
parts of England.
The Thurso operation will be part of BT's group computing services
directorate which services about 250,000 computers through 23 centres all
over Britain.
Users will be able to telephone Thurso for help and the Thurso centre will
be able to plug into their computers to evaluate and solve faults.
No jobs are being moved from the south of England. Two managers will be
transferred from elsewhere in BT but the rest of the staff will be recruited
locally.
BT is establishing the Thurso centre to fulfil a commitment to HIE, which is
contributing Pounds 5m to the cost of upgrading Highland telecommunications.
HIE is contributing Pounds 158,000 towards the Pounds 527,000 start-up costs
of the project and will fund half the Pounds 140,000 costs of training the
staff. It will also build a 7,000 sq ft office block, which it will lease to
BT.
Caithness is a priority area for HIE because of the gradual rundown of the
Dounreay fast breeder reactor, which could cost the area 1,600 jobs.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Consumer body attacks Abbey over bank code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group, was criticised by a consumer group
yesterday after deciding not to issue its own code of banking practice for
customers.
Yesterday was the last day for banks and building societies to declare
whether they had accepted a draft code of banking practice agreed last year
by banks, building societies and consumer groups.
Unlike the other big high street banks which have all produced their own
special codes of service for their customers, Abbey National says that it
will simply place copies of the code 'Good Banking' in its branches for
those customers who ask for them.
Mr Guy Dehn, legal officer at the National Consumer Council, said he was
disappointed by Abbey National's decision. 'Good Banking is the bare minimum
that is acceptable in the market place,' he said.
Britannia, the ninth largest UK building society, has launched the first
stage of a Pounds 30m mortgage rescue scheme in partnership with Circle
Thirty Three Housing Group in East Anglia.
The scheme is part of a Pounds 1bn package pledged by mortgage lenders after
talks with the government just before Christmas about ways of reducing the
number of homes repossessed this year.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Deluge of Mozart to hit the airwaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATER this year the airwaves will be alive with the sound of Mozart and
Beethoven, as Britain's first national commercial classical music station
goes on air.
Classic FM, which won the first of three new national commercial licences,
hopes to launch in September with an unashamedly popular schedule of
classical music aimed at members of the ABC1 social group aged 25 to 54.
There will be plenty of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, Lalo's Spanish
Symphony, Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik and, of course, Beethoven's
greatest hits.
The music will change subtly during the day. During the peak periods for
radio - the drive to work and return-home hours  - will be lots of Mozart.
The pieces will have to be short to fit in with regular news, traffic and
weather bulletins, plus advertisements.
In the evenings there will be time for concerts.
Mr Ralph Bernard, chief executive of GWR, the Bristol-based group of
commercial radio stations, said: 'The music has to fit. There are commercial
considerations which have to be met to make the station successful.'
GWR is an investor in Classic FM and will manage it on behalf of the other
investors, Sir Peter Michael, chairman of Cray Electronics, Time Warner, the
US media group, Mr Brian Brolley, former managing director of The Really
Useful Group, and Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail.
Classic FM, which bid Pounds 670,000 a year for the franchise, and must also
pay Pounds 1m a year for the licence and 4 per cent of qualifying
advertising revenue, does not see the BBC's Radio 3 as its target.
Research suggests it is more likely to take listeners from Radio 4 and
upwardly mobile sections of the Radio 1 audience. Mr Bernard suggested,
however, Radio 3, which broadcasts classical music and speech, could face a
dilemma in deciding how to respond to the competition.
'They will have to walk carefully between retaining their very, very loyal
listeners, who will go potty if changes are made, and meeting the commercial
challenge,' the GWR executive said.
Classic FM, which has raised Pounds 6.5m, is already broadcasting trial
transmissions in six parts of the country.
It is likely to cost between Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m a year to run, including
transmitter costs and music royalty fees, but Mr Bernard believes that
providing a national service of popular classical music, plus regular news,
will turn out to be a lucrative business.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Oil crews meet Shell for safetytalks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFSHORE oil workers met representatives from Shell late yesterday to
discuss the helicopter crash on Saturday night which killed 11 people, amid
calls for tougher safety regulations on North Sea helicopters.
Mr Ronnie MacDonald, who chairs the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, a
union representing oil workers, said: 'Some very serious questions have to
be asked about search and rescue cover offshore.'
Mr MacDonald said there is currently no UK regulation requiring North Sea
operators to have rescue facilities on-site, leaving them free to rely on
shore-based safety cover.
Shell had shut down its own helicopter in the harsh weather conditions on
Saturday night.
The helicopter that crashed was a freight and passenger machine which was on
a visit to the platform and was asked to transfer the crew.
Search teams yesterday recovered the bodies of the remaining five oil
workers and the wreckage of the heli-copter.
Mr MacDonald said the survivors from the crash were rescued by a Norwegian
helicopter in an operation which took about 40 minutes. 'But if a helicopter
has to come from onshore, it can take over an hour to reach the site of the
accident.'
Some North Sea operators have removed rescue facilities from their
field-based helicopters because of the cost of carrying them.
A year ago offshore workers protested strongly when British Petroleum moved
its rescue helicopter from the Forties field. The facility had been in place
for 12 years and had rescued nine people.
Shell said yesterday there will be an extensive inquiry into the cause of
the acci-dent.
Mr Chris Ryan at the UK Offshore Operators Association, which represents
companies operating in the North Sea, said: 'The industry is not averse to
spending money on helicopter safety.' Mr Ryan said oil companies are
investing Pounds 25m in a scheme to improve helicopter maintenance.
The association's aircraft committee will meet next week to discuss the
implications of Saturday's accident.

A NEW generation of universities was announced yesterday, after the Privy
Council office gave 14 polytechnics approval to become universities under
the government's higher education reforms.
The Higher Education Act, which has just become law, allows polytechnics to
call themselves universities.
Such places as Sunderland and Huddersfield will gain universities for the
first time, while Leicester, Newcastle and Liverpool all get second
universities - each with a carefully chosen name.
Leicester Polytechnic becomes De Montfort University, Newcastle Polytechnic
will be the University of Northumbria at Newcastle and Liverpool
Polytechnic, Liverpool John Moores University.
The others are Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University), Polytechnic
South West (University of Plymouth), Portsmouth Polytechnic (University of
Portsmouth), Huddersfield Polytechnic (University of Huddersfield), Kingston
Polytechnic (Kingston University), South Bank Polytechnic (South Bank
University), Staffordshire Polytechnic (Staffordshire University), Teesside
Polytechnic (University of Teesside) and Wolverhampton Polytechnic
(University of Wolverhampton).
The remaining 20 polytechnics are expected to adopt the university label
soon - almost doubling the number of English universities.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Peat Marwick to cut up to 250 audit jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest accountancy firm by fee income,
is cutting up to 250 jobs across the country, it emerged yesterday.
A total of 200-250 qualified accounting staff from the firm's audit division
are to be told to leave later this week, although the figures do not include
any partners.
The losses will come from all regions, but the majority are concentrated in
the south-east and the Midlands. They come on top of similar job losses at
this time last year.
There has been fierce competition for fees in all business sectors between
the firms, including widespread reductions in audit bills.
Senior staff within the firm said the action had been forced by the slowdown
in the normal turnover of staff and the lower numbers required to carry out
audit work.
The recession has reduced the number of alternative financial sector jobs
available which are traditionally taken by accountants after qualifying with
the big firms.
Mr Jim Butler, senior partner, said: 'This is not unexpected. We did it last
year and we are doing it again this year. There is a continual problem of
people not leaving.'
He said KPMG had, like other accountancy firms, suffered from some clients
going out of business, but that overall its volume of audit business
remained stable.
The lay-offs are taking place just as the peak period for auditing client
companies' financial statements for the year is coming to an end. They
follow some smaller lay-offs in recent weeks, including at least 20 in
Scotland.
Three months ago KPMG unveiled fee income at Pounds 484m up 12.3 per cent on
the year to September 30 1991.
The employees to be made redundant have already been identified by senior
management but they have not yet been told. The firm had planned to notify
them tomorrow.
The decision on who will leave is in large part made outside London, because
KPMG is structured as a regional partnership with considerable autonomy
given to each district.
Many accountancy firms have been suffering from the effects of the
recession.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Nikkei fall puts investors on tenterhooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO AND AGENCIES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the Japanese stock market were on tenterhooks as prices
fluctuated in hesitant trading early today after yesterday's resounding fall
to their lowest level for five years.
In an effort to steady the market, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister,
said temporary and technical factors were largely to blame for yesterday's
sharp drop in share prices - which took the Nikkei index through the
psychologically important 20,000 level. He predicted the market could
recover in the not-so-distant future.
In a similar soothing vein, Mr Takeshi Noda, the Economic Planning Agency
minister, said the Tokyo price fall did not reflect Japan's economic
fundamentals.
Share prices made a modest rebound when trading began this morning, then
dipped down again before attempting a further slight recovery, with the
Nikkei index of leading stocks soon at 19,766.
Yesterday the Nikkei index lost 618.90 points or 3 per cent to close at
19,837.16. The fall below 20,000 - for the first time since February 1987 -
had been widely expected because of the market's recent weakness. It brought
the Tokyo market down 49 per cent from its 1989 peak - in contrast to New
York and London, where shares have been trading relatively close to all-time
highs.
The broader Topix index yesterday shed 19.14 points to close at 1,444.86,
its lowest since November 1986.
The Tokyo decline has meant that equities have now lost all the spectacular
gains made in the late 1980s, when a supply of cheap credit prompted a
wide-ranging financial boom. Stocks have slumped in response to higher
interest rates, declining economic growth and political turmoil in Japan and
overseas.
Yesterday's losses were triggered by a modest spate of selling by Japanese
corporate and institutional investors preparing their books for the end of
the financial year this month. Yesterday was the last day for some groups of
investors to complete transactions in time for the year-end.
Many Japanese investors early today were bracing themselves for further
falls, fearing that the poor financial health of some securities companies
and banks would undermine the market. Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, of the
investment management affiliate of Sumitomo Life, a life company, said
yesterday: 'The Nikkei may rebound above 20,000 but the overall downward
trend is unchanged. Who will buy stocks from securities companies which are
about to collapse?'
However, a significant minority believed prices were bottoming out. Mr
Tsuneo Nakamura, managing director of Yamaichi Securities, one of the big
four brokers, said yesterday: 'Market statistics indicate that we have
already entered the final stages of the correction period.'
The Japanese authorities at first maintained a studious calm in the wake of
yesterday's sharp drop in share prices. Their stance was in contrast to
October 1990 when the Nikkei last dropped through 20,000 in intra-day
trading and the finance ministry unveiled an emergency package of
market-boosting measures.
Ministry officials now believe that changes to trading and other rules do
little to help stock prices in the long run and distort free markets. In
recent weeks they have encouraged a tightening of rules governing stock
futures trading. This was in response to complaints from brokers who blamed
the market's weakness on over-aggressive futures trading by foreign
securities companies. But latest revisions have had little effect on
sentiment.
However, politicians yesterday repeated calls for further cuts in interest
rates, urging the Bank of Japan to reduce the Official Discount Rate from
its current level of 4.5 per cent. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank
governor, told a parliamentary committee he was still studying the effect of
previous reductions.
Japanese bond prices remained virtually unchanged yesterday, evidence of the
fact that investors were well prepared for the fall in equities. But on the
foreign exchanges, the yen lost ground against the US dollar.
Bankruptcies in Japan rose by 56.2 per cent in February to 1,056 cases,
reflecting the cooling of the Japanese economy, Teikoku Data Bank said,
Steven Butler adds. The pace of corporate insolvency has risen steadily on
an annual basis for the past 17 months. It said liabilities of bankrupt
companies in the fiscal year ending this month were likely to reach Y7,600bn
(Pounds 33bn).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in Taiwan's industries fell 61 per cent to USDollars 132m
(Pounds 77m) in the first two months of the year from the same period last
year, while Taiwanese investment abroad dropped by 66 per cent to Dollars
229m (Pounds 133m).
Japan was once more the biggest investor, according to figures published
yesterday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. More than Dollars 56m of
funds for investment into Taiwanese industry were approved in January and
February. The second largest was Europe, with Dollars 25m.
Rising operating costs on the island have taken their toll on inward
investment, and the world recession has affected both inward and outward
investment, according to economists,
Foreign investment interest centred on trade and the electronics industry.
However, foreign investment in electronics fell nearly 80 per cent from last
February, and investment in the plastics sector increased more than 10-fold.
Analysts say, however, that these statistics are based on applications
approved, not on funds actually entering the country, and that duplicate
applications by foreign companies in several countries in the region can
lead to over-estimation of foreign investment.
Although Taiwanese investment abroad decreased overall, funds approved for
investment in the US were up by nearly 40 per cent on the same period last
year, to Dollars 44m, 19 per cent of all outward investment approved from
January to February.
Officials say the outward investment figures measure only investments made
through official channels. Many companies making smaller investments
overseas often do so without registering with the government.
Taiwanese investment in China is increasing, bringing with it the fear of
over-dependence on mainland markets. Taiwanese companies invested Dollars
1.5bn in Fukien province alone in 1991, and Dollars 15.6m in southern China
in January and February, Dollars 11m of which was in metals, electronics and
plastics.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Iran attacks Turkey over arms seizure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL FIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN has bitterly attacked Turkey after a state security court in Istanbul
confiscated a ship carrying a cargo of arms on its way to an Iranian port.
The 2,700 tonne Cypriot-registered Cape Maleas was stopped in the Bosphorus
last October soon after it had left a Bulgarian port carrying anti-aircraft
guns, rocket launchers and ammunition.
The Turkish court said the vessel was 'shipping arms and ammunition in an
organised manner' and was thus in contravention of an international treaty
which requires all arms shipments through the Black Sea and Aegean to be
notified to the Turkish authorities.
Iran gave no such notification, claiming the Bosphorus counted as
international waters. Iran had hoped that after the ship was seized its
release would be assured both by diplomatic efforts and through the good
relations enjoyed by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mr Turgut Ozal,
his Turkish counterpart, who is associated with an Islamic constituency in
Turkish politics.
However, the state security court yesterday handed the freighter over to the
Turkish armed forces. Although the 24-man crew was freed late last year, the
court sentenced its captain to five years in prison.
Iranian officials do not accept that a Turkish court can be politically
independent and say they believe Mr Suleiman Demirel, the prime minister,
and ultimately the US, are behind the decision.
Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi, the Iranian prosecutor general, on Sunday
cancelled a meeting with the Turkish ambassador and called the confiscation
'obscene and illegal'.

<TEXT>
ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the accountants, yesterday agreed to pay an immediate
Dollars 22m (Pounds 12.5m) in cash and to set aside a further Dollars 8m to
settle an investor lawsuit charging the firm with improper behaviour that
contributed to the collapse of Mr Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan.
The out-of-court settlement is the latest in a series of claims against
auditors, lawyers and other consultants who worked for Mr Keating, who was
last year convicted on 17 counts of defrauding investors through the sale of
worthless junk bonds and who faces other charges.
The Arthur Andersen settlement results from a class action lawsuit by
representatives of 17,000 bond investors who sued Mr Keating, Arthur
Andersen and other firms including Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche. The
cases against those two firms are still pending.
Arthur Andersen said last night it continued to believe that the allegations
against it were unfounded. 'We have agreed to the settlement based on an
overall business strategy to avoid escalating legal costs of protracted
litigation and to get the matter behind us,' Arthur Andersen said.
Last week, in a separate development, the New York law firm of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler agreed to pay the US government Dollars 41m
to settle a federal lawsuit from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the
savings and loan industry regulator. The OTS suit charged the law firm with
withholding information about Lincoln from regulators.

FT  17 MAR 92 / A new industrial resilience belies Rust Belt blues: The
story of the Midwest's economy is not as bad as that of the country as a
whole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN CHICAGO recently, 9,000 people queued in a blizzard for hours to apply
for 500 hotel jobs. Last month General Motors told 4,000 workers in
Ypsilanti, Michigan that their plant, rather than one in Texas, would be
closed. To many it feels as if the worst days of the Rust Belt are back.
It is not surprising, then, that the candidates in the presidential
primaries this year have been tempted to play to the region's economic
distress.
However, the story of the Midwest's economy is not in fact as bad as it is
in the country as a whole.
The region has suffered less in this recession than it did in the early
1980s, said Mr David Allardice, assistant director of research at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
While the slowdown has recently begun to deepen in the Midwest, many
regional analysts still say the region will pull through 1992 in better
shape than the rest of the country.
In the past, the Midwest, as the industrial heartland, has tended to lag
behind the nation in its economic downturn and then rebound more slowly.
Analysts believe the Midwest may have fundamentally changed.
'The region has been restructuring and is in a better competitive position,'
said Mr Robert Schnorbus, manufacturing analyst at the Chicago Fed. This has
included retooling through more capital expenditure, reduced workforces and
higher productivity.
Helped by a slimming of inventories over the past several months, the
Midwest may well be able to bounce back more quickly than ever, he said.
While the General Motors' cuts, the demise of Midway Airlines and a long
strike at Caterpillar have taken their toll on employment in Illinois and
Michigan, the total number of jobs has edged up - 0.5 per cent between
December and January - in the five-state area of Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin.
One of the key boosts for the trimmer heartland since the start of the
recession in July 1990 has been exports, in particular of capital goods. The
region accounts for a large share of US capital goods production exports of
which have been growing at about 10 per cent a year over the last two years,
compared with total US export growth in 1991 of 7.6 per cent.
The export picture for this year has, however, been clouded by the economic
slowdowns in Germany and Japan.
But, says Ms Diane Swonk, regional economist for First Chicago: 'Trade won't
fall apart like some people think.' Ms Swonk believes that as long as the
dollar stays relatively competitive, Mexico and other newly-industrialising
countries will pick up some of the slack in exports. Capital goods demand
from Canada, which alone accounts for between 40 and 50 per cent of the
region's trade, would also pick up later this year, she said.
Other evidence suggests that even European markets might not be as bad as
expected. At Giddings &amp; Lewis, the largest North American maker of machine
tools and assembly systems, orders shot up during the 1991 fourth quarter -
and 35 per cent of them were from Europe.
The company won its first order from France in more than five years. Strong
interest came from the Pacific Rim, in particular South Korea.
The real estate sector in the Midwest has not been the plague that it has in
other regions, largely because commercial property was not excessively
over-built - though the vacancy rate is rising in Chicago - and home values
did not rise sharply as they did elsewhere.
One of the more marked differences between the region and the nation is in
single-family homes. Between 1988 and 1991, single-family (detached) housing
starts, an indicator of middle-class prosperity, remained almost unchanged
in the Midwest while they dropped 22 per cent in the country as a whole.
First Chicago expects them to rise 24 per cent in the Midwest this year.
Agriculture has recuperated from its trough in the mid-1980s and has been on
a steady if unspectacular course. The US exports 20 per cent of its maize
and half its wheat, the bulk of which come from the region.
Net cash farm income dropped 6 per cent last year and is expected to fall
slightly again this year. But, overall, the farm sector has not had as
serious a downturn as the rest of the economy.
Exports are expected to enjoy a slight increase this year, largely from more
shipments of and higher prices for wheat.
Meanwhile the Midwest's old complaint that it has not won enough defence
contracts has turned out to be a blessing. The wrenching shrinkage of the US
defence industry will barely be felt in the region.
With respect to the Midwest's longer-term prospects, adjustment in the motor
industry, some 60 per cent of which is concentrated in the region, and an
increasing orientation to exports will be key, according to Mr Robert Dieli,
regional economist for Northern Trust Company in Chicago.

French consumer prices rose a provisional 0.3 per cent last month, holding
year-on-year inflation roughly steady at 3 per cent, according to Insee, the
state statistics body, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The increase widens
the gap between French and higher western German inflation rates because of
a 0.6 point rise in Germany last month. Inflation in France now runs at 1.3
percentage points below western Germany - as against 1.1 points at the end
of January.

FT  17 MAR 92 / France to reform pensions system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government will table legislation before the end of June to
reform the pension system, with the introduction of new tax-efficient
personal equity plans a central feature.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, said in an interview with
the newspaper, La Tribune de l'Expansion, yesterday that he saw the proposed
eight-year personal equity plans as the basis for a private pension system
to run alongside the existing state pension scheme.
Pension reform is a pressing issue in France. Almost all pensions are
provided by the state with the exception of the small number of fonds
salariaux schemes for senior executives.
The government runs the system through the Caisse de Retraite, a body that
pays for pensions with money received from those in employment.
However, this system, devised after the end of the second world war, is
coming under strain as the elderly population increases and there are
proportionally fewer people in employment to pay for their pensions. The
logical solution would be to expand the use of private pensions.
The government, however, has been reluctant to act partly because of
opposition from the trade unions, who believe pensions should continue to be
solely provided by the state. There is also the political problem of asking
the electorate to pay extra money for their own private pensions at the same
time as they are contributing to the state scheme.
Despite these obstacles Mr Beregovoy earlier this year signalled that the
government was determined to take action.
Mr Beregovoy originally considered a German-style system of corporate
pension plans but was deterred by the complexity of such an initiative, as
well as by the impact of the Maxwell pension scandal in the UK.

will be expelled from the Dnestr region, Itar-Tass news agency said. Moldova
refuses to recognise the self-styled republic, which borders Ukraine on the
east bank of the Dnestr river.
The ethnic Russian minority in the east of Moldova declared the breakaway
Dnestr republic in September 1990 over fears that Moldovan efforts to unite

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE yesterday justified its decision to back down and agree to share
collective responsibility for the former Soviet Union's debt with the other
republics.
Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister, said Ukraine had obtained important
concessions on Vnesheconombank, the bank through which the foreign debt is
serviced and which will now be controlled primarily by Russia and Ukraine
together.
Mr Fokin was defending a change of stance by Ukraine, which was previously
demanding that it should be allowed to pay its share of the debt to western
creditors independently of the other republics.
Underlining the haphazard state of the debt negotiations, Mr Fokin admitted
that Ukraine had not yet actually signed the critical Group of Seven
memorandum - which binds all the republics to 'joint and several'
responsibility for the debt - because officials had misplaced the text.
Signature by Ukraine was a condition set for the restructuring of
Vnesheconombank, and Mr Fokin insisted that Ukraine did intend to sign.
He said the bank would in future be governed by an inter-state council which
will have three co-chairs, one from Ukraine, one from Russia and a third
representing the other 10 republics on a rotating basis. The voting
structure of Vnesheconombank is also to be slanted in Ukraine's favour, Mr
Fokin said. Votes are to be distributed according to each republic's share
of the debt, but decisions can only be taken if they are backed by 80 per
cent of the votes.
Mr Fokin said this structure could give Ukraine, which has agreed to pay
16.37 per cent of the debt, veto power if it had the support of any one of
the medium-sized republics. The bank's operations are to be fully
transparent and subject to the supervision of an independent auditor. Mr
Fokin also reiterated plans to introduce a separate currency in two to four
months.

THE ex-Soviet republics face an increasing hard currency financial gap which
could rise to between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 25bn next year, and will
probably need western aid to supplement International Monetary Fund credits,
an EC Commissioner said yesterday.
But Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC economic affairs commissioner,
confirmed yesterday's decision by EC finance ministers to let the IMF take
the lead, admit Russia and the three bigger members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) next month, and set the conditions for stabilising
their econom ies.
EC ministers also refused to soften their legal terms for the Community's
Ecu1.25bn (Pounds 880m) pending food credit to the CIS. They agreed that CIS
borrowers must agree to submit to court action in the event of default on
repayment.
If Russia - which has already received an EC-backed Ecu500m bank credit to
buy food and medical supplies - continued to insist on its 'sovereign
immunity' from court action, the Community loan would go ahead to CIS
republics like Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrghystan,
which had agreed to waive this right.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French Treasury director who has led Western
negotiations on CIS official debt, told EC ministers that Ukraine,
Uzbekhistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia now appeared to have agreed to join
other CIS states in shouldering responsibility for past Soviet debt (as of
October 28, 1991).
Settlement of the responsibility for this debt, which the Commission says
totalled Dollars 68bn by end-1991, is another EC precondition for new
lending to the CIS.
EC ministers decided to await a green light from the IMF before trying to
mobilise any extra macro-economic aid for the CIS, despite warnings from
some in the Commission, notably Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs
commissioner, that IMF assistance might be too little and too late to
prevent further economic and political instability within the CIS.
However Mr Christophersen said extra aid would be needed by 1993.

<TEXT>
EC finance ministers last night supported legislation aimed at preventing
banks overstretching themselves with large loans to single clients, writes
Andrew Hill. French and Spanish objections to the detail of the measure
still have to be ironed out. But all 12 ministers agreed that the ceiling on
bank loans to individual clients should be brought down to the equivalent of
25 per cent of a bank's capital.
Britain imposed a 25 per cent ceiling after Johnson Matthey Bankers, a small
bullion bank, came near to collapse in 1984, having made large loans to a
small number of dubious companies. The measure agreed yesterday should
prevent a repeat of that episode in other EC countries.

Opposition to EC spending rise of Ecu20bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE ministers from Italy and Germany yesterday voiced their deep
concerns about Mr Jacques Delors' five-year EC budget plan.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told the European Commission
president and his EC colleagues that the budget package - which would run
from 1993 to 1997 - was 'not acceptable in its present form'. Mr Guido
Carli, Italy's finance minister, echoed a confidential Italian treasury
document which suggests that an enlarged EC budget is 'incompatible' with
parallel demands on Italy to shrink its public debt.
Germany's principal objections to the package focus on the call by southern
member states' for EC money to fund closer 'cohesion' with their wealthier
northern counterparts.
Germany - itself under pressure because of the cost of unification of east
and west - argues there is a risk that cohesion money will be considered the
only instrument for encouraging convergence of EC economies.
Mr Waigel said the 1993 start-date for the plan gave member states plenty of
time for a closer analysis of the budget. Supporters of the so-called Delors
package want any debate over its content to be resolved by the Lisbon summit
of EC leaders at the end of June.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, is holding fire on the
Delors proposals while they are examined by the French treasury.
The finance ministers - discussing the package for the first time - did not
examine the budget plans in detail, but a number of member states voiced
objections to the proposals, which envisage an annual increase in EC
spending of nearly Ecu20bn (Pounds 14.2bn) by 1997.
The sceptics even included federalist Belgium. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the
finance minister, said that although Belgium respected the commitments made
at the Maastricht summit last December, the projected figures in the budget
looked enormous and were not completely justified.
'Wanting to control expenditure does not mean one is necessarily in the
British camp,' he said - a reference to Britain's vocal opposition to budget
increases.
On the other hand, Mr Noel Treacy minister of state at the Irish department
of finance, said Ireland welcomed the Commission proposals as a good
starting point. Ireland believes substantially increased funding for less
developed EC members is essential to give force to the Maastricht treaty's
commitments on economic and monetary union.

Some 2,000 Finns joined a protest rally outside the parliament building
yesterday as deputies inside the chamber began debating the government
proposal to seek membership of the European Community, police said, Reuter
reports from Helsinki.
The rally, which was organised by the Alternative to the EC movement,
follows the lighting of bonfire beacons along main roads at the weekend by
hundreds of farmers who fear the loss of big subsidies to the farming sector
if Finland joins the Community.
Bonfire beacons are an ancient way of warning that an enemy was approaching,
said a spokeswoman for the Central Union of Finnish Agricultural producers.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Finns start the long road to Brussels: How the country sees
its future as part of the European Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB

<TEXT>
MUCH as the Finns hate to be seen copying their neighbours and traditional
rivals in Scandinavia, tomorrow they are expected to follow Sweden's example
and make a formal application to Brussels for European Community membership.
The majority of Finnish politicians and industrialists see EC membership as
vital to Finland's economic interests at a time when the country is
suffering from a severe recession and a decline in trade with the former
Soviet Union, once one of its most important trading partners.
If parliament votes tomorrow in favour of applying for membership, the
government aims to start membership talks as soon as possible and will join
its fellow Efta-members, Sweden and Austria, in parallel negotiations. Its
aim is to be a full member of the EC in 1995, but will hold a referendum
before a final decision to join.
EC membership is firmly supported both by the opposition Social Democrats
and by the Conservative Party, which rules in a coalition with the Centre
Party. But the issue has proved a difficult one for Prime Minister Esko
Aho's Centre Party. His party represents the country's farmers, many of whom
are concerned that EC membership will spell an end to their generous
subsidies.
Mr Ilkka-Christian Bjorklund, a member of the Social Democrats' EC working
group, says: 'The Centre Party has faced a dilemma. It is the most anti-EC
of the three parties, but it has been forced to lead the EC application
because it knows that if it opposed EC membership the existing
Conservative-Centre government would split and it would be succeeded by the
Red-Blue Finland's previous Conservative-Social Democrat governments)'.
However, Mr Bjorklund predicts that there will be no problem in winning
parliamentary approval for membership. 'Even if it's in our interests to
fight against this government, we think that this is a matter of national
and historic interest and we have no intention of jeopardising it.' Three
weeks ago, the Centre-Conservative government agreed to apply for EC
membership provided it received parliamentary approval, saying 'Finland can
best pursue its national interests as a member of the European Community.'
The Confederation of Finnish Industries (CFI) pointed to the important
economic and trade benefits of EC membership in a recent statement, saying
that it would 'lower domestic costs and prices to a competitive European
level' and 'stimulate exports and domestic investment as well as allow the
possibility to influence the future development of the Community.' It adds
that Finland would become 'more appealing' to Russia as a trading partner,
and would be able to join in the closer co-operation between the EC and the
central and eastern European countries.
However, it is on the matter of economic and monetary union (Emu) that the
CFI sees the clearest advantages: the fact that Emu remains outside the
scope of the European Economic Area 'necessitates Finnish membership in the
EC,' the Confederation says. The advantages would include lower interest
rates, stable exchange rates, and lower state budget deficit and debt
levels.
Such a scenario seems all the more attractive in the light of Finland's
current economic woes: GNP fell by 6 per cent in 1991, unemployment hovers
around 10 per cent, and three-month money market rates soared to nearly 15
per cent last autumn, although they have fallen back to around 12 per cent
since the devaluation of the markka in November 1991. On a more positive
note, annual inflation is gradually falling, reaching 2.6 per cent in
February, down from 2.9 per cent in January and 5.0 per cent in February
1991.
While industrialists and politicians are excited about the economic
advantages of joining the EC, Finland's small but outspoken farming
community is less enthusiastic.
Agriculture accounts for a mere 3.9 per cent of Finland's GDP and 7 per cent
of the workforce, but the sector receives generous subsidies. Mr Jarmo
Vaittinen, of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners,
is resigned to the fact that Finland will apply for EC membership, but adds:
'we must get EC members to understand our special climate - we want the EC
to understand why Finland has subsidised agriculture, why we need to keep a
big country populated, because it is vital for us and for the EC to keep the
north populated.'
Mr Erkki Tuomioja, a Social Democratic MP, says he expects Finland 'will get
a fair deal on agriculture ..subsidies will have to be adjusted and phased
out gradually and there will be a period of adjustment.' Plans to make
Finnish agriculture more competitive include a more favourable tax burden
and low-interest loans to encourage farmers to increase the size of their
farms.
'Agriculture is very, very small in terms of GNP, but very important in
terms of population,' says Mr Keijo Korhonen, former Finnish UN ambassador
and now editor-in-chief of Kainuun Sanomat, a Centre Party newspaper in
Northern Karelia. Mr Korhonen opposes EC membership, warning that if Finland
makes sacrifices on agriculture, it will lead to higher unemployment and
'pauperisation.'
He also believes membership would compromise Finland's neutrality, adding
that Finland cannot afford to take risks on its security given its
historical relations with Russia and the fact its powerful neighbour is in a
potentially unstable state.
'When it comes to supranational decisions (in the EC) our own weight would
be very very small indeed. Quite simply the cost of membership outweighs the
benefits,' he says.
Whatever his views though, a national poll taken by Gallup in mid-February
showed that 55 per cent of those questioned thought EC membership would
provide more advantages for Finland, 21 per cent thought it would bring
disadvantages and 23 per cent couldn't tell.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S new centre-left coalition government yesterday unveiled
value-added tax rates, higher excise duties and budget savings to tackle the
country's large budget deficit, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The government, sworn in just over a week ago after more than 100 days of
political stalemate, has made reducing the deficit, one of the highest in
the European Community, its top priority.
A statement issued after a special cabinet meeting said the standard
value-added tax (VAT) rate would be raised half a percentage point to 19.5
per cent and excise duties on fuel increased from April 1.
This would raise government revenue by BFr6.6bn (Pounds 110m), the statement
said. Another BFr6bn will be saved by cutting government administration
costs by 5 per cent, freezing new spending on defence and limiting civil
service recruitment. The total is still far from the BFr94bn in additional
revenue and savings the government has to find to bring the 1992 deficit
into line with the target of BFr405bn.
The government said it will also scrap the top VAT rates - 33 per cent for
luxury goods and 25 per cent for electrical goods - which will be charged at
the new 19.5 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Smith says plan would benefit 'eight out of ten': Labour's
shadow Budget proposes to increase taxation for higher earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHT out of ten taxpayers would be better off after the first Budget of a
Labour government, Mr John Smith said yesterday as he announced plans to
increase taxes for high earners in order to give more to those lower down
the income scale.
The shadow chancellor's alternative Budget, to be enacted soon after an
election victory, was designed to seize the initiative in the first week of
the election campaign in which the parties were running neck and neck in the
opinion polls. A Harris poll for today's Daily Express, however, gives the
Tories a three-point lead over Labour.
As the battle over tax and spending moved to the centre of the election
campaign, Mr Smith said he would raise income tax thresholds by 10 per cent,
abolish National Insurance contributions for the the first Pounds 54 per
week of income and increase state pensions and child benefit.
To pay for those measures and raise funds for public spending, Labour would
re-move the present ceiling on National Insurance contributions and
introduce a new 50p top rate of income tax on earnings above Pounds 40,000.
The changes would mean everyone earning more than Pounds 21,060 would pay 9
per cent more on every extra pound of income and those with gross incomes
over Pounds 40,000 would see their tax rate rise from 40 to 59 per gure.
The documents accompanying Mr Smith's statement suggested that a single
person earning Pounds 40,000 a year would be Pounds 1,500 a year worse off.
For those on much higher incomes, the losses would rise sharply.
Labour's calculation is that the package will be attractive to the vast
majority of voters. Those earning less than Pounds 21,000 a year should
gain. According to the Tories, average male earnings are Pounds 18,000 a
year. Mr Smith said that a couple with two children and an income of Pounds
16,000 a year would gain Pounds 5.98 a week from the combination of higher
tax thresholds, the abolition of the 2 per cent starting rate for National
Insurance contributions and higher child benefit.
The package brought charges of a Labour 'retreat' over the principle of tax
cuts from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Chris Patten, the
Conservative party chairman, said higher taxes on middle incomes would
threaten a collapse in the housing market in southern England.
But Mr Smith's colleagues said that the package was a 'carefully calculated
gamble' to outbid the Tories in the battle for the votes of those on average
incomes. Even in some of the crucial electoral battlegrounds of London and
the south-east, only about 15 per cent would lose, they claim.
The shadow chancellor, whose package includes incentives for industrial
investment, increased training provision and provides more funds for health
and education, acknowledged that the measures would involve a significant
redistribution of income. He calculated that over two years, his Budget
would release Pounds 1bn for the health service, Pounds 600m for education
and Pounds 1.1bn for his 'economic recovery programme'.
He told a packed London press conference: 'We have had 13 years at which
people at the top got preferential treatment. In this Budget we are starting
to take back something for the average taxpayer and the average family.'
Some of the money needed to finance the package would be raised by
postponing for a further year the abolition of stamp duty on share
transactions and by scrapping the 2 per cent incentive paid to those who opt
out of the state earnings-related pension scheme.
His promise that 8 out of 10 taxpayers would benefit won the backing of the
independent Institute for Fiscal Studies. Labour leaders seized on further
IFS calculations showing that relative to Mr Lamont's proposals in last
week's Budget, 48 per cent would gain more from Mr Smith's.
The shadow chancellor would scrap the new 20 per cent income tax band if
Labour wins, but is pledged to maintain the basic rate at 25p.
His proposed 10 per cent increase in the tax threshold would take 740,000
people out of income tax. Child benefit, currently at Pounds 9.65 per week
for the first and Pounds 7.80 per week for subsequent children, would be
paid at Pounds 9.95 for all. The state pension would be increased by Pounds
5 per week for a single person and Pounds 8 per week for a couple. Mr Smith
dropped plans to extend National Insurance contributions to savings income.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Ashdown says poll reform is first aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'first aim' of the Liberal Democrats would be to break free from
Britain's outdated electoral system, Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday as he
unveiled his party's election manifesto.
The 50-page manifesto proposes a system of proportional representation and
combines a two-year, job-creating investment programme with measures to
stimulate private enterprise.
In the event of a hung parliament, the manifesto pledges to 'neither support
nor participate' in a government which 'turns its back' on constitutional
reform.
It backs a single transferable vote system for local, national and European
elections, with multi-member constituencies for Westminster MPs.
Mr Ashdown dismissed Mr John Major's refusal to embrace proportional
representation, saying little attention should be paid to a 'political
leader with his back to the wall'.
The Liberal Democrats are proposing an increase of 1p on the basic rate of
income tax to fund an extra Pounds 2bn in education spending. The party
would also abolish the new 20p lower income tax band and increase borrowing
by Pounds 2bn to fund Pounds 4bn in extra public investment in the first
year to create 400,000 jobs.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Russia to form its own army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday signed a decree clearing
the way for the restoration of a purely Russian army, 75 years after its
defeat in the First World War precipitated the Bolshevik revolution.
The decree, signed when Mr Yeltsin returned from holiday, creates a Russian
defence ministry of which he will take temporary charge while the military
forces are created and lines of command cleared. This is a break with both
Soviet and Russian Tsarist tradition under which the post was held by a
military officer.
General Dmitri Volkogonov, a military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, told a meeting
of Russian deputies last night that the armed forces would take two years to
create and might number between 1.25m and 1.5m men. That compares with the
3.7m-strong former Soviet army, now under operational federal control of the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The timing of the move may be meant as a show of strength in the face of
demonstrations planned in central Moscow today by communist diehards and
resurgent nationalists, which the organisers claim will be heavily
supported.
It may also be an attempt to set the agenda before Friday's crucial meeting
in Kiev of CIS leaders, which will consider the division of the old Soviet
army's assets and future military structures.
Russia is anxious to extricate its men  - who make up the bulk of the former
Soviet army  - from the growing number of trouble spots around the former
Union, most notably Nagorno-Karabakh. Yesterday's decision shows that Russia
can no longer afford, and does not wish, to intervene in conflicts outside
its influence.
The Russian leadership is reluctant to cast aside the CIS military command
altogether, in part because it will continue to control the strategic
nuclear forces for at least the next two years. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the
Russian deputy prime minister, said the new army would be created within the
bounds of the CIS armed forces.
Almost all the former Soviet republics are committed to forming their own
armed forces  - although only Azerbaijan, Belarus and Ukraine have said they
will do this outside the CIS framework.
Russia's decision to create its own military is likely to force the other
republics rapidly to build up their own defence forces  - with the CIS being
confined, at best, to a loose co-ordinating role.
Mr Yeltsin's decision to take over the defence ministry was in part to avoid
a 'conflict between the democrats and the military' over whether the defence
minister should be a general or a civilian, said Mr Shakhrai  - giving a
glimpse into the still-existing power of the generals. He said such a
struggle 'could lead to grave consequences'.
Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy director of the USA Canada Studies Institute and
the most prominent civilian candidate for the post, said he believed his
candidacy was still in play once Mr Yeltsin stepped down from the ministry
after the initial period of creating the military forces had passed.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, chose yesterday to
announce the formation of a national guard dedicated to guarding the
constitution, the republic's vital interests and citizens' freedoms. No
mention was made of the size of the guard.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Selling of Glaxo drug to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday ordered an independent inquiry into the
ethical, legal and medical acceptability of the methods used by Glaxo, the
UK pharmaceuticals group, to promote one of its newest drugs in France.
The social affairs ministry has appointed two senior law and medical
professors to report within two months on Glaxo's promotion of Imigran, a
migraine treatment. It will decide in the light of the findings whether to
ask the European Commission to investigate possible abuse of a dominant
market position, officials said.
Imigran was approved in Britain and the Netherlands last autumn, but has not
yet received clearance from the French government, which also sets prices -
through negotiation with producers - for drugs reimbursed by social
security.
French officials suspect Glaxo of arranging heavy press coverage of
Imigran's virtues to whip up demand from patients before the government has
carried out full checks. Officials argue that migraine is hard to diagnose
objectively and that doctors could come under unnecessary patient pressure
to prescribe what is a costly treatment.
Imigran costs about Pounds 10 for each pill and about Pounds 20 for every
injection. One US analyst estimates its sales could reach Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.6bn) a year by the end of the decade. Glaxo claims there is no
alternative effective treatment for migraine.
Imigran is one of three new Glaxo products described by analysts as
potential blockbusters. The company needs substantial revenue from Imigran,
and two other drugs, Zofran, a treatment to curb nausea in cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy, and sales of the ulcer treatment drug Zantac, the
world's best-selling pharmaceutical.
Analysts point out that pharmaceuticals companies selling in Europe have
been unable to increase prices of existing products in line with inflation.
They have compensated by introducing new products at high prices. Gross
margins of patented pharmaceuticals are normally higher than 90 per cent.
They say Glaxo is also keen to charge a high price for the drug in France, a
country with traditionally low pharmaceuticals prices, to help avoid
parallel exports from France to other EC countries.
Glaxo said last night its French company had not re-ceived a direct
communication from the French government. The company said it was confident
that the French company had 'acted properly and in a way consistent with the
highest standards of our industry'.
This is the second European government to show concern over Glaxo's
commercial strategy. Denmark asked Brussels at the end of February to
examine whether the UK company was abusing its position by charging too much
for Imigran, Serevent and Zofran. 'If allegations over marketing hype as
well as Glaxo's pricing went to the European Commission, this would
certainly cause serious problems,' said Mr Robin Gilbert, pharmaceuticals
analyst at James Capel, the London stockbrokers.
He added that the total cost of treating French migraine sufferers could be
more than the Pounds 1.2bn estimated for the UK. This would undermine both
Glaxo's strategy of charging high prices for innovative drugs and its policy
of giving new products heavy advance publicity.

FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent depressed by
Japanese weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVENTS in the Far East echoed gently, but still depressingly among most
continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS drifted to the day's low shortly after the start and stayed there for
most of the day. The CAC-40 index hit 1,922.22 before closing at 1,929.22,
down 17.83. Dealers reported several basket trades and blamed the bigger
price movements on the low turnover, estimated at FFr1.7bn-1.8bn.
Lafarge was one of the day's most active stocks, falling FFr8 to FFr337 with
300,600 shares traded on 1991 profits below market expectations of FFr1.3bn.
Some brokers are likely to revise down their 1992 profit estimates as a
result.
News that a Paris court had cancelled the sale of a 13.82 per cent stake in
Perrier to Groupe Saint-Louis prompted Perrier to jump FFr14 to FFr1,650
while Saint-Louis dropped FFr43 or 3.1 per cent to FFr1,341. Dealers said
the ruling improved Nestle's chances of success in taking over the mineral
water company, and at the same time, raised the likelihood that it would
only have to increase its offer price of FFr1,475 by a nominal amount.
Total fell FFr6.80 or 2.9 per cent to FFr232.10 as relatively heavy selling
by a UK broker hit a thin market.
FRANKFURT traded in a thin range as the FAZ index fell 3.12 to 700.70 at
midsession, and the DAX closed 7.84 lower at 1724.80. Turnover fell from
DM4.7bn to DM3.8bn.
The market was hurt by a report that Volkswagen's margins on car production
were very adversely affected last year by start-up costs for the new Golf
model. VW itself fell DM4.60 to DM366.40. But this may also have reflected
profit-taking: after a weak 1991, the shares had led the German market up
this year with a rise of 31 per cent to a 1992 peak of DM378.50.
The multiple expiry of March DAX index contract, options on the DAX future,
options on the DAX itself and stock options on Friday was expected to bring
some volatility into the market later this week.
MILAN closed weaker on the final day of the February account and there were
reports that rather than covering short positions, professionals were
borrowing stock from banks in order to carry them over. The Comit index fell
5.44 to 505.27 in turnover estimated at around Friday's 96.9bn.
Fiat eased L15 to L4,870 at the official fixing but was quoted as low as
L4,770 in afternoon trading in London on the Paris news about Perrier. This
move was seen as lessening the Agnelli group's chances of taking over the
French mineral water company.
The banking sector lost 1.7 per cent, and there were further signs that the
San Paolo share offering had not gone smoothly. The shares are due to start
trading today. There was a grey market offer price of L12,300, just above
the issue price of L12,200, but no grey market bid price. Mediobanca fell
L350 to L13,820.
Pirelli was one of the few gainers, adding L5 to L1,185 on short-covering.
ZURICH ended above its lows on bargain hunting in moderate volume, the SPI
index easing 3.9 to 1,121.0. Bearers in the restaurant and hotel group,
Movenpick, rose SFr150 or 4.1 per cent to SFr3,850. After the bourse the
company said that its chief executive officer, Mr Michel Favre, had stepped
down with immediate effect.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower and the CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.5 at 124.7.
Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, reported a 24 per cent increase in net
profits, below market expectations, and shed 70 cents to Fl 68.80.
Hunter Douglas, the building materials group, which reported disappointing
results on Friday, rose 80 cents to Fl 64.00 on bargain-hunting, while
Ahold, the retailer, closed down 40 cents at Fl 85.60 as investors took
profits.
News that an Italian engineering group had taken a 6 per cent stake in
Fokker left the aircraft manufacturer 30 cents lower at Fl 34.70.
MADRID was quiet in low turnover: the general index closed down 1.31 at
258.87. The construction sector, which had performed strongly at the end of
last week, fell back as investors took profits.
BRUSSELS ended mixed with the Bel-20 index closing down 3.64 at 1,208.76 in
turnover of BFr558m. Petrofina shed BFr50 to BFr10,500 while Solvay fell
BFr75 to BFr12,425.
STOCKHOLM was supported by Ericsson, which saw its B shares up SKr5 to
SKr131 and accounted for more than a quarter of overall volume, moderate at
SKr391m.
Ericsson had already risen on big orders in Malaysia and Germany; yesterday
there were rumours of even bigger orders yet to come in Iran and Japan, and
a story that General Electric was eyeing a stake in the telecommunications
group.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 2.1 to 988.6. Modo B closed only SK1
lower at SKr227 on an 82 per cent fall in 1991 profits, better than its own
forecast of break-even.
COPENHAGEN fell across a broad front, with the CSE index closing 2.89 lower
at 340.12. Danske Bank, Novo Nordisk and East Asiatic were among the most
active losers, falling DKr6 to DKr311, DKr6 to DKr523 and DKr4 to DKr141.
HELSINKI fell back slightly, the HEX index shedding 2.8 to 860.0 in turnover
of FM13.2m.

FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: UK and Japan lead global equities down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of the general election in the UK, a further weakening in
the Japanese market and a fall in Mexico helped to push the FT-Actuaries
World Index down by almost 1.3 per cent on the week.
The UK government's decision to call the election on April 9, a date
correctly forecast by commentators, came the day after the annual Budget
statement. The Budget proposals were greeted coolly by most analysts, who
also took the view that the opportunity for an interest rate cut before the
election had disappeared. On Wednesday the UK market registered its biggest
one-day fall since the stock market crash of November 1987.
The rest of Europe was moved more by local factors than the political
turbulence in the UK.
Switzerland, which ended in a more positive mood following a drop in
interest rates, still showed a decline as equities were depressed by higher
rates ruling earlier in the week.
German stocks moved lower following depressing results from BASF and
Hoechst, both of which announced dividend cuts. Only Finland managed to
break the negative tone after signs that its parliament might vote to join
the EC.
The fall in Tokyo, which only delayed the drop below 20,000 on the Nikkei,
was not mirrored on the Pacific Basin, with Hong Kong soaring to a record
high after HSBC reported an 83 per cent increase in net profits on Wednesday
and said that it would not be making a rights issue. This news gave a boost
to the market after fears that leading companies might be announcing rights
issues. A successful government land auction also helped sentiment.
Mexico, which has been a strong performer so far this year, was hit by
profit-taking and uncertainty over when the North American Free Trade
Agreement would be concluded. Analysts said that they did not see the fall
continuing in the long term: since the beginning of the year the market has
shown a gain of some 19 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Authorities offer no
help as Nikkei falls below 20,000

Tokyo
THE Nikkei average fell 3 per cent yesterday, closing below the critical
20,000 level for the first time since February 1987, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
Small-lot profit-taking and arbitrage unwinding left the 225-issue average
down 618.90 at 19,837.16, below the October 1990 low of 20,221.86.
The index opened at the day's high of 20,442.53 and reached a low for the
session of 19,790.16 in the afternoon.
Volume dropped to 200m shares from Friday's 650m, the settlement day for
March futures and options contracts. Declines led advances by 763 to 231,
with 129 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated more slowly, but its
fall of 19.14 to 1,444.86 left it at the lowest level since November 1986.
The Topix has fallen for 10 consecutive trading days, the first time since
March 1964. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased only 0.04 to 1,102.75.
Small-lot selling by tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment trust
funds, which closed trading for the financial year yesterday, depressed
share prices.
Dealers said trading was not panicky and that share prices fell in an
'orderly fashion'. 'We weren't in a free fall,' said Miss Caroline Stone at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
However, Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said market conditions
were 'very weak' as represented by the declines in the Topix index and other
benchmark stock prices, pointing out that the fall in the Nikkei had lagged
behind. Traders said sharp falls in illiquid component stocks in the Nikkei
yesterday suggested that the index had been propped up by dealers in recent
weeks.
The authorities declined to support the market. On previous occasions of
market weakness, the Ministry of Finance has tried to talk up the market,
and the Bank of Japan has lowered short-term interest rates to add
liquidity.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said he was not considering steps to prop
up the stock market, and Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, told a
House of Councillors' committee that the economy was unlikely to slow much
further, disappointing those who had expected a cut in the official discount
rate.
The top losers of the day included illiquid Nikkei components. Daito Woollen
Spinning and Weaving fell Y210 to Y1,470 and Godo Shusei Y190 to Y1,740.
Okamoto Industries, the condom maker which has been traded actively by
short-term traders, retreated Y60 to Y1,270. The Tokyo Stock Exchange put
the issue on its 'watch list' due to its volatility.
Blue chips lost ground on selling by investment trusts. Matsushita Electric
Industrial and Sony fell by Y40 each, to Y1,240 and Y3,920 respectively.
Banking shares were also weak, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y20 to
Y2,540 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y1,970.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 288.88 to 21,588.64 in volume of 160.8m
shares.
Roundup
THE NIKKEI'S drop through 20,000 weighed on Pacific Rim markets.
SEOUL was brought off the day's lows as the Market Stabilisation Fund spent
Won30bn to support prices. The composite index lost 1.09 to 608.36. Turnover
stood at Won171.3bn after Saturday's half-day Won146.1bn. The fund focused
on heavily weighted issues such as Korea Electric Power and Pohang Iron &amp;
Steel.
HONG KONG lost ground on profit-taking following last week's gains. The Hang
Seng index slipped 11.33 to 5,059.86 as turnover declined to HKDollars
2.53bn from HKDollars 3.56bn.
HSBC and Cheung Kong dominated trade, with interest in Cheung Kong fuelled
by expectations of good results being reported on March 26.
NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a late rise in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The
NZSE-40 index closed 6.80 higher at 1,458.18. Turnover fell to NZDollars
13.2m from NZDollars 16.1m.
Telecom shares rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.36 and Fletcher Challenge 2 cents
to NZDollars 3.45. Corporate Investments, a diversified trading company,
declined 4 cents to 55 cents after reporting a loss of NZDollars 32.5m in
its fiscal first half.
TAIWAN finished lower in light trading on political uncertainty after the
ruling Kuomintang failed to reach an agreement on how to choose the
president. The weighted index relinquished 16.65 to 5,012.96 as turnover
fell to TDollars 26.45bn from TDollars 34.03bn.
AUSTRALIA surrendered early gains after the Japanese market dropped through
20,000. The All Ordinaries index ended a net 1.7 off at 1,586.7 after
turnover of ADollars 143m (ADollars 161m).
MANILA ended lower in uncertain trading as Philippine National Bank started
an additional offer of 10.4m shares. The composite index dipped 16.02 to
1,106.61 as turnover shrank to 42m pesos from 336m.
KUALA LUMPUR finished weaker in light trading. The composite index slipped
3.48 to 591.74 in turnover of MDollars 94.0m, after MDollars 92.0m.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index closed 1.1 per cent or 16.42 down
at 1,449.66 in turnover of SDollars 83.1m, against SDollars 107.5m. NatSteel
dropped 24 cents to SDollars 3.96 on heavy selling after announcing a 4 per
cent cut in its steel bar prices.
BANGKOK blamed uncertainty about Sunday's general election for a fall in the
SET index of 13.30 to 792.29 in turnover of Bt4.98bn. Investors are
uncertain whether reforms and policies adopted by the current government
will be maintained after the election.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Rates remain firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE money markets remained pessimistic about a cut in UK interest rates,
closing slightly firmer in a day of quiet trade.
The firmer tone followed an easier opening as the markets attempted to
correct Friday's excesses - when traders swapped rumours of a six point lead
for Labour in the April 9 election campaign. In the event, the sighs of
relief were almost audible when the polls revealed a mere one point lead for
Labour.
Traders dismissed the prospect of a cut in the short term, and the rate as
far out as one year was even nudging 11 per cent by the end of the day.
The key three month inter-bank rate closed at 10 3/4 - 5/8 per cent. On the
futures market, the June short sterling contract fell from an opening of
89.22 to 89.15 at the close.
Day-to-day funding took encouragement from the Bank of England's early
actions to stem the greater than expected shortage. Tax payments put heavy
pressure on the system, with the Bank of England initially forecasting a
shortage of Pounds 2.15bn, which was revised twice revised upwards to end at
Pounds 2.3bn.
In early operations, the Bank took out the bulk of the shortage with a
Pounds 1.6bn repo at 10 7/16 per cent and a token amount in the cheaper band
four bank bills at 10 5/32 per cent. Late morning brought a Pounds 512m
purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band three bank paper at
10 3/16 per cent, band four treasury and bank at 10 5/32 per cent.
Afternoon and late assistance totalled Pounds 200m.
As a result of the Bank's generous morning help, overnight rates were being
quoted as low as 8 per cent. However, little money changed hands at that
level, with the bulk of the cheap money being traded at noon at levels of
about 9 1/2 per cent.
In Germany, the March tax deadline drained funds from the market. This
pushed call rates slightly higher during the day from 9.50/60 per cent to
9.55/65 per cent.
Traders said they expected rates to stay at or above 9.65 per cent during
the tax period.
The Federal Reserve injected temporary reserves into the US banking system,
as funds had firmed to 4 1/8 per cent. The injection came in the form of an
unfixed three-day repurchase agreement. This means that dealers can withdraw
their collateral over the agreement's term.
The presumed Fed target for federal funds is 4 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: All quiet on the dollar front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE foreign exchanges appeared reluctant to move on any currency yesterday,
with most units trading in a narrow range, reports Peggy Hollinger.
The dollar was consolidating after recent gains, to close at DM1.6655,
compared with a previous DM1.6665. The lack of statistics out of the US gave
traders little incentive to find new positions on the dollar, said Mr Nick
Parsons, head of the treasury advisory group at CIBC. Strong resistance at
DM1.6720 was expected to hold for the short term. However, he argued, there
remained an underlying bid sentiment to the dollar market.
The lack of inspiration in the dollar market was being attributed to the
signs of recovery now being seen in the US economy. Recovery had already
been priced in, said Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, and now the
market was unsure of its next moves. 'There is a risk the dollar will drift
off unless there are exceptional numbers from the US,' he said.
Sterling took some support from the Labour Party's budget proposals, which
included a strong commitment to the exchange rate mechanism. Rumours that a
15 tick jump in sterling in the afternoon was the result of Bank of England
intervention were unsubstantiated. Mr David Simmonds, chief treasury
economist at Midland Montagu, dismissed the intervention speculation and
said there had been nothing unusual in the jump.
Sterling closed a touch stronger at DM2.8575, compared with DM2.8550, and at
Dollars 1.7155, against a previous close of Dollars 1.7125.
Traders said the prospects for sterling were on the downside this week, with
Thursday's unemployment figures not likely to boost support for the
Conservative Party. Furthermore, speculation about a UK rate cut was likely
to resurface this week with the retail price index out on on Friday.
The RPI figures were expected to show UK inflation below Germany's, perhaps
opening a window of opportunity for a rate cut. After Thursday's
unemployment figures, the government could well be desperate for some good
news for the Tory party campaigners to carry to the voters, said Mr Parsons.
'It is no more than an outside chance,' he said, 'but it is a chance.'
Within the ERM, sterling traded close to its limit against the peseta for
most of the day.
The yen came under pressure following the Nikkei's tumble to five-year lows,
and weakened against the dollar, sterling and D-Mark. The Japanese currency
weakened from Y133.55 to Y133.95 per dollar, from Y228.75 to Y229.75 per
pound and from DM1.2493 per 100 yen to DM1.2420.
Investors in the South African financial rand would be anxiously awaiting
the results of the all-white referendum, expected on Wednesday, said Mr
Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. The financial rand would need a
'resounding yes vote on a good turnout' if it was to avoid a sharp tumble,
he added.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC wants tougher fishing
punishments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY member states are hampering the community's fisheries
inspectors and limiting their efficiency with bureaucratic rules, according
to the European Commission.
In a report published yesterday on surveillance of the EC's common fisheries
policy, the commission called for the powers of EC inspectors to be
strengthened and punishments for overfishing and other breaches of the CFP
to be tougher.
'Surveillance is supposed to happen on a co-operative basis, but in practice
the (community) inspectors are seen as intruders,' said a commission
official yesterday.
The commission will produce formal legislation to improve CFP surveillance
later this year, and will also propose minimum community sanctions for
fishing vessels which break EC rules.
Brussels believes improved surveillance and control of fishing are essential
if planned reforms of the CFP are to be successful.
The report itself does not single out individual countries for criticism but
the problems are thought to be worst in the North Sea where stocks are at
their lowest.
Commission officials say they do not want to interfere with surveillance
which can best be carried out at national level, but the commission does
want national authorities to improve the transparency of their own
administrative procedures.
According to officials, member states' attitude to EC surveillance has
improved significantly in recent years as the need for changes in
traditional fishing policy has become obvious.
But surveillance has not kept pace with technological developments in the
practice of fishing. A comprehensive community register of fishing vessels
was only set up last year, and the commission would like to improve the
monitoring of fishing fleets by computer and satellite.

banana producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BANANA EXPORTERS in small African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries
should be assured a minimum quota in the European market and tariff
protection against cheaper, large-scale producers, says a report published
yesterday by a coalition of lobbyists for the developing world.
In addition, tariffs levied on large-scale producers should be earmarked to
fund a system of price support for ACP suppliers, along with assistance on
diversification, the International Coalition for Development Action said in
its report. The European Community should monitor the cartel activities of
the three multinationals that dominate banana production among large-scale
producers.
The report comes in the wake of fresh British government assurances that
treaty promises made to Caribbean banana exporters will be honoured when the
European Commission decides next week how to create a single market in
bananas.
Mr John Gummer, the UK farm minister, assured the House of Commons in a
parliamentary answer last Friday that Britain intended to stand by its
obligations under the Lome convention (a trade agreement with developing
former European colonies), and would support any EC decision that conformed
with these commitments.
The 'Eurobanana' has generated immense controversy, since the creation of
the single market makes it possible for 'dollar banana' producers, mainly in
central America, to undercut traditional suppliers. These are mainly former
French and British colonies, which have protected access to particular
European markets, and high prices - both assured by development commitments
made under the Lome convention.
The EC is the world's biggest importer of bananas, purchasing 3.2m tonnes in
1990. Small ACP countries like Jamaica and the Windward Islands supply 18
per cent of the market, while former French colonies and small EC producers
like the Canary Islands supply a further 26 per cent. Dollar bananas account
for the remaining 56 per cent.
Dispute inside the EC arises from rules being set by the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, which would require all farm products to be subject to
import tariffs. These would then be reduced during the next six years.
The community has not set a tariff for the so-called 'dollar bananas'.
Instead, it limits their entry by means of quotas. The European Commission -
like the Council of Ministers (of the 12)  - is divided between those who
want a temporary exemption from the Gatt rules, and those who want to set a
very high tariff on dollar bananas.
Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica in the Windward Islands in
the Caribbean - where 70 per cent of export earnings come from bananas -
spoke for many Caribbean suppliers when she predicted during a recent visit
to Brussels and London that tariffication would 'never by itself be able to
protect our banana industry: it would mean the end of the industry in our
part of the world.
'If we lost the industry completely, we would lose the country,' she warned:
'It would be the beginning of despair.'
She may have been comforted by Mr Gummer's assurance last week that he 'has
pressed the importance of a settlement under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in conformity with our continuing commitment to the
Windward Islands and Jamaica.'
These assurances did not rule out the possibility of tariffs, however. It is
still possible that compromise will be found in a longer period of tariff
protection than six years, and substantial funds to aid diversification into
other products. There have been informal signals from the Gatt that a
compromise that was technically outside Gatt rules would not jeopardise the
Uruguay Round proposals.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Van Niekerk's Cape crusade to
rescue farmers - The South African agriculture minister is trying everything
to minimise bankruptcies / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST FRIDAY was the day of the annual agricultural show at Prieska in the
northern part of South Africa's Cape Province. A few score farmers and their
families from a radius of a about 100 km (62 miles) had gathered to wander
around about a dozen trade and craft stands, have a braai (barbecue) lunch
and to see which of them would be awarded the prize for the best Fat-Tailed
Persian sheep. The temperature was in the mid-40s centigrade (about 120 deg
F).
This is virtually desert country where a farmer needs several thousand
hectares and a drought- and heat-resistant breed of sheep to make a
reasonable living. It lies between the Great Karoo in the south and the
Kalahari in the north and the town owes its existence and past wealth to the
mining of blue asbestos and copper from the nearby hills.
Now the copper mine is worked out and the lung disease asbestosis has killed
the demand for the asbestos the area once produced. Today Prieska relies
almost entirely on agriculture and in both prosperity and population it is
only half the town it once was.
But the mood at the show was jovial and relaxed. The quality of the sheep
entered for the competition was excellent, the food was good and the local
MP was among the small crowd. They know him well; for not only is he a
neighbouring farmer (his farm is just 170 km away by dirt road and that
qualifies as 'neighbour' in this vast hot countryside) but he is also South
Africa's minister of agriculture.
Mr Kraai van Niekerk would probably have attended the show as a farmer in
any case but last week he was campaigning for today's referendum on
continued political reform in South Africa, and Prieska is the centre of his
constituency. He had delivered a speech at another town that morning; now he
was pressing the flesh of his fellow farmers before addressing a house
meeting in the late afternoon and another in the local town hall in the
evening. In the sweltering heat it was a punishing schedule.
If the voters reject continued reform Mr van Niekerk, along with the rest of
the cabinet, will begin preparations to resign. But if the majority of South
Africa's white electorate votes against calls by the Conservative Party and
the AWB for a return to old ways, the minister will be able to return to
other pressing problems in his department.
Chief among these is the extended drought which has affected a significant
proportion of the Republic. Indeed, I had expected that the arid area in
which the minister's own farm is situated would be suffering most. But I was
wrong.
When I went with him to his 13,000-hectare holding, which has an annual
rainfall of just 6 inches and where temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s
centigrade are normal throughout the long summer, he explained that the
secret of success on such dry bush veldt was to restrict stocking rates (he
runs only one Merino wool sheep per 10 hectares) and to conserve what little
moisture was available.
This meant moving each 300-head flock on a regular basis from one
100-hectare camp (pasture) to another so as not to destroy the indigenous
grasses and bushes sprouting from the sandy, rocky terrain and which,
incredibly to my unaccustomed eye, sustained the animals in good condition.
He talked with enthusiasm and detailed knowledge about the balance of
nature. And he claimed that it was not farmers like him, who were used to
managing in dry weather, who were in financial trouble.
It is, in fact, the arable farmers further east who are suffering most, as I
had seen and heard for myself a few days earlier, and Mr van Niekerk has
already set up committees of bankers, extension officers and local farmers'
representatives, to try to find ways to avoid many of them going bankrupt.
Aid schemes are being worked out, wherever possible, to write off some debt
and to re-schedule the rest, often at subsidised interest rates. But in many
cases the financial position is such that the farmer is beyond help.
Critics of the rescue attempts allege that most of the farmers who are in
trouble are financially illiterate and that they are reaping the results of
unbridled expenditure and expansion in the boom years of the 1970s and
1980s. Mr van Niekerk concedes that such suggestions contain an element of
truth But the drought is also an established fact and there are
socio-economic as well as agricultural reasons why as many farmers as
possible should be saved.
To allow vast numbers of farms to go out of business at a time when there is
little enthusiasm, even among successful farmers for expansion, would put
tens of thousands of black farm labourers out of work. Since the repeal of
the Group Areas Act two years ago there has already been enormous growth in
the squatter camps around big towns. Hordes of unemployed farm workers would
add to an already serious problem.
There is also the immediate problem of ensuring the availability of
sufficient food. South Africa consumes between 6m and 7m tonnes of maize
each year. Production from this year's drought stricken crops is forecast at
less than 3m tonnes. In addition, the republic has long term commitments to
supply maize to other southern African countries.
It appears likely, therefore, that it will be necessary for South Africa to
import up to 5m tonnes of maize during the coming months. Some commentators
have suggested that the port facilities are inadequate to handle such
volumes within the time available but Mr van Niekerk assured me that his
department had done the calculations and confirmed that they can and that
imports have already begun to arrive. He also denied that there was any
possibility of rationing over coming months.
Some of his optimism was based, however, on the possibility that South
African-grown wheat could be substituted for maize when it was harvested in
November. But back in the Orange Free State, last week, farmers were
worrying about the continued absence of any rain to provide moisture to
germinate wheat seeds when they were due to be planted in a few weeks time.
Theirs is a summer rainfall area and that season is almost over. If they get
no rain, there will be no point sowing the seed and they will have no crops
to harvest next November.
As the minister said, that is a long way ahead and there will be time to
make arrangements to deal with that problem should it occur. But in the
meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers
and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South
African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. Whichever way you
look at it this is a crucial time for South Africa.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar prices forecast to remain
in narrow range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD SUGAR prices are set to remain locked in the 'desperately narrow' 1.5
cents a lb trading range of the last 12 months, according to the latest
sugar report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house.
The resistance to movement in spite of a volatile trading environment is due
to fear of uncertainty at a time of revolutionary change in the eastern
European and Cuban markets, Man suggests. It also coincides with 'an
unprecedented convergence of views about the overall supply and demand
balance'.
While uncertainty surrounds crop prospects in both Cuba, the biggest
exporter, and the CIS, the biggest importer, the convergence can be
explained by favourable growing conditions in many exporting countries.
Output in Brazil, Thailand and India in the year to the end of last month
has exceeded the previous year by 24, 30 and 8 per cent respectively. 'The
full impact of these potentially bumper crops has not as yet been felt on
the market,' says Man.

mine

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY MONTHS of labour peace at Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer
of two-thirds of all of Peru's copper, came to an end yesterday when
blue-collar workers from all four company unions and white collar workers at
the Cuajone mine went on strike.
The smelter at Ilo, which produced a record 300,117 short tons (2,000 lb
each) of blister last year, was still functioning, according to SPCC. About
40 per cent of operators had turned up for work as normal. A senior company
official commented, 'We are maintaining production at near normal levels -
we have contingency plans for this sort of situation'.
Surprise was expressed in the local mining sector over the SPCC strike,
scheduled to last 48 hours. SPCC workers are among the best paid in Peru's
mining industry. A 'labour peace' pact for 1992 is still under discussion by
the striking unions.
The motive for the strike - a technicality for calculating wage rises -
'seems inexplicably trivial,' said one mining industry source in Lima. 'This
looks more political than anything else.'
SPCC recently announced investment plans totalling Dollars 300m over the
next five years. The US-owned company is to build electro-winning plants at
both its huge open-cast mines of Cuajone and Toquepala, and a partial
capture acid plant for the Ilo smelter.
Metal workers blocked traffic and disrupted rail services here to protest at
the threatened closure of the 90,000-tonne capacity lead works of Sociedad
Minera y Metalurgica de Penarroya Espana, a wholly-owned unit of
Franco-German multinational Metaleurop, Reports Reuter from Cartagena.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold market in confusion as
price sets 5 3/4 -year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION REIGNED in the gold market yesterday as the price in London
dropped at one stage to Dollars 341 a troy ounce, the lowest since June
1986. It closed at Dollars 342.20, down Dollars 3.80 from Friday's close.
On the New York Commodity Exchange the most-active April contract crashed
through all remaining technical barriers to Dollars 342.10 an ounce and at
midday seemed set to test new lows.
Some analysts said there was now nothing to stop spot gold falling below
Dollars 300. One recalled that the last time that happened, in 1985, the
price took a year to climb back to Dollars 340.
Dealers said yesterday's selling started at the morning 'fix' in London and
came from several quarters. Some suggested selling seemed to be related to a
specific deal or deals somewhere in the market's shadowy background, rather
than being caused by any fundamental reason.
Some said the fall was associated with uncertainties about the South African
referendum. Whatever the reason, the drop in London triggered more selling
by computer-driven US funds.
'With Middle East players effectively out of the market because of (the
fasting month of) Ramadan, there were no buyers when people began baling
out. The price could just keep going down,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst
at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez group.
Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst at the SG Warburg Securities financial services
group, said: 'It is very worrying because chartists say there is no real
support for the price below Dollars 342. The price could go all the way down
to Dollars 325 and I can't see what would push it back over Dollars 350 in
the near term'.

Several base metals were testing support levels at the end of a quiet day on
the LME. Traders pointed to the continued lack of fundamental news dampening
recent bullish sentiment. COPPER ignored the strike by Peruvian copper
workers and three-month metal continued to edge into the support area
between Dollars 2,220 and Dollars 2,225 a tonne from which the market
bounced last week. Three-month ALUMINIUM, having failed to break up through
resistance in the Dollars 1,315 to Dollars 1,320 band last week, eased
throughout the day under liquidation and light sell stops. Traders now see a
test of the Dollars 1,280 to Dollars 1,285 support level. Three-month ZINC,
attempting to consolidate last week's sharp gains, was aided by developing
support which absorbed liquidation on any dip to Dollars 1,230 a tonne.
Traders said if the consolidation is successful then a rise to test
resistance around Dollars 1,260 is possible near term. London's robusta
COFFEE lost morning gains by the close as New York failed to gather enough
support to break through the 74.50 cents resistance level in near May,
traders said. The New York arabica market was awaiting news of a meeting
between Central American producers and US trade officials on renewed export
quotas.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Telebras offering heralds
batch of Brazilian deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEBRAS, the Brazilian telecommunications company, yesterday launched a
Dollars 90m deal which heralds a further batch of offerings by Brazilian
issuers.
Brazil returned to the international capital markets last year as the
perception of its debt improved on expectations that a Brady plan for the
rescheduling of its foreign debt was close to agreement. When no agreement
was reached, prices on Brazil's commercial debt fell sharply, but demand for
fresh bond issues does not appear to have weakened.
The five-year Telebras deal, arranged by Salomon Brothers, has a put option
after three years, priced to yield 450 basis points over the three-year US
Treasury. The deal included a 144a option for distribution in the US private
placement market, but dealers said demand for this small deal was
concentrated in Europe.
Telebras is also planning to issue equity later in the year. Merrill Lynch
has won the mandate to act as global co-ordinator of Telebras' offering of
ADRs, expected to raise between Dollars 600m to Dollars 1.2bn. The ADRs will
be listed and registered in New York, but placement is expected to be split
between the US and the international market.
Meanwhile, a number of other Brazilian bond offerings are in the pipeline:
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the Brazilian iron ore company, is
preparing to launch its second offering in the international capital
markets. The Dollars 150m Eurobond, with a 144a option for placement in the
US market, is expected to have a maturity of three years. CVRD returned to
the international markets last year with a Dollars 200m deal maturing in
1994 with a put option in 1993, which has performed well. The spread between
the yield to put and the comparable US Treasury has tightened to 234 basis
points, compared with a 300 basis point yield spread to maturity.
The new deal, arranged by Chase Investment Bank, is expected to emerge next
month, with a tighter spread than yesterday's Telebras deal.
Banco do Brasil, Brazil's state-run bank, is preparing a Dollars 150m
three-year Eurobond. Credit Suisse First Boston is believed to have won the
mandate for that deal.

Singapore seats

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) yesterday offered seats to seven
foreign securities companies, allowing them to trade directly in the market
under the new category of 'international members'.
Membership will cost the foreign brokers SDollars 8.2m (USDollars 4.9m).
They will be allowed to undertake deals of any size for foreign clients, and
deals of at least SDollars 5m for local customers.
The seven, chosen from 11 applicants, are Baring Securities, Credit Lyonnais
Securities, Daiwa, Nikko Merchant Bank, Nomura, Smith New Court Securities
and Yamaichi Merchant Bank.
'These seven foreign securities companies were selected on the basis of
their contributions to the development of the Singapore securities market,'
the SES said. 'The exchange also believes that these companies have the
resources and are in a position to continue to contribute to the development
of Singapore as a regional securities trading centre.'
Singapore's plan to admit 100 per cent foreign members was announced in
October 1990, and brokers have been waiting impatiently for yesterday's
announcement.
Previously, foreign brokers could deal either as part of a joint venture in
which they were allowed a maximum 49 per cent stake, or by working through a
local broker and sharing commissions.
The SES, which is trying to attract more foreign institutional business,
said it would take 'all necessary measures' to achieve its objective of
promoting Singapore as the centre for trading regional securities.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo SE formalises broking
trade curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has formalised rules on share trading which
severely restrict the ability of large broking firms to trade on their own
account.
However, the rules do not apply to medium-sized and small brokers, who have
been hit particularly hard by the stock market slump. Indirectly, this could
benefit the leading Japanese brokers: these control a number of smaller
broking firms, though their shareholdings are limited to 5 per cent.
The TSE had originally proposed that the rules should also be applied to
programme trading - the computerised selling or buying of a basket of
shares. This would have made arbitrage trading, which is the core of
foreigners' business in Tokyo, impossible.
This proposal has been dropped from the final rules, although its earlier
inclusion has served further to heighten tensions between the financial
authorities and leading foreign brokers.
The Tokyo stock market has been shaken by rumours that a leading foreign
brokerage has threatened to move out of the Tokyo market. Market
participants have become increasingly concerned over the regulators' spate
of restrictions, aimed at reviving the sluggish cash market.
Leading foreign brokers have expressed discontent as they were excluded from
discussions towards the formalisation of the rules.
The new rules had already existed in voluntary form for own-account trading
by large brokers. They include a number of restrictive regulations, such as
prohibiting the the trading of equity-linked issues.
Also, brokers trading on their own account are severely restricted in the
prices at which they can deal, being effectively tied to the last price at
which a trade was conducted in the market.
The move represents special treatment toward medium-sized and small brokers,
who are exempt from such limits on proprietary trading.
Meanwhile, two further rule changes by the TSE have raised concern that the
transparency in the Tokyo market may once again decline, following attempts
recently to outlaw practices which some claimed amounted to market
manipulation.
The TSE has lifted its '30 per cent rule', which prohibited brokers from
dealing in more than 30 per cent of the turnover in any stock in a given
month. The rule was originally implemented to avoid the dominance of the
leading Japanese securities in the market.
The TSE also abolished its '15-minute rule' which prohibited brokers from
proprietary orders during the last 15 minutes of the trading session.

CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, has provided an extra Fl 3bn
in loan guarantees to Credit Lyonnais Nederland Bank (CLBN), its 94 per cent
owned Dutch subsidiary, Reuter reports from Rotterdam.
Credit Lyonnais now stands as guarantor for nearly Fl 5bn of CLBN's debts,
up from Fl 2bn in mid-1991.
CLBN yesterday announced that net profits in 1991 more than halved to Fl
30.1m from Fl 63.4m the previous year.
Credit Lyonnais last year provided Fl 2bn in guarantees for CLBN loans to Mr
Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier.
The Dutch bank had loans of USDollars 888m outstanding to Mr Parretti as of
July 1991. The bulk financed his 1990 takeover of MGM, the US film studio
which sank into financial crisis last year.
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) said it and the
Sudwest-Deutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (SudwestLB) have combined their
activities in Switzerland.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME Eurodollar bond yields have tightened in relation to US Treasury yields
following the sell-off in the Treasury market on Friday which pushed the
long-bond yield above the 8 per cent support level.
Dealers said that Eurobonds with current coupons - that is bonds with
coupons which accurately reflect current yield levels and therefore trade
around their par value - have outperformed the market, tightening by three
or four basis points.
Spreads on recent new issues which are still unplaced had already widened,
but the unsold paper still shows little sign of attracting any investor
interest.
In the dollar sector yesterday, Toyota Motor Finance launched a Dollars 200m
three-year deal via Credit Suisse First Boston.
The deal was considered reasonably priced at 35 basis points above the
comparable Treasury yield, and dealers said that the short end of the market
is attracting what investor demand exists.
Some money managers are extending to short-dated bonds, where they perceive
value in the wake of the sell-off, according to some traders.
Toyota's outstanding 6 1/2 per cent bonds due November 1994 are currently
trading at just 8 basis points above the curve, because those bonds are
tightly held by investors.
The deal was bid at 99 7/8 , around the level of its fixed price re-offer.
A FFr1bn 10-year offering for Aerospatiale, the French aerospace company,
suffered from an aggressive pricing in unfavourable market conditions.
Political uncertainty surrounding the local elections, scheduled for next
weekend, is exerting a negative pull on French bond prices.
The Aerospatiale deal, priced at 52 basis points above the interpolated
yield curve, widened by several basis points, as the trading level fell to
99.65 from 99.90.
Dealers said that a two-year bond issue for Aerospatiale launched last month
had widened from a launch spread of 35 basis points above the comparable
BTAN to a current spread of 44 basis points.

GERMANY'S Finance Ministry, attempting to close a potential loophole, is to
ensure that Germans with accounts abroad are liable for a new tax on
interest income, Reuter reports from Bonn. It will take effect at the start
of next year.
German bond prices fell last week on speculation that foreigners would be
made subject to the modified 25 per cent withholding tax on interest income,
agreed last November, or that Germans with non-resident accounts would have
to pay it.
The Finance Ministry last week made clear that there were no plans to make

The ministry said, however, that German banks acting as paying agents for
interest income would be free to release it only after they had learned
which investors outside Germany were not citizens and therefore not subject
to the tax.

<TEXT>
MEXICO has set up a Dollars 500m Euro commercial paper (ECP) programme, the
first ECP programme to be established by a Latin American sovereign
borrower.
The ECP programme will allow Mexico to borrow in a broad range of OECD
currencies with a maturity range of between 30 days and a year.
Citicorp Investment Bank, which is the arranger and dealer for the
programme, said Mexico would use the programme to establish its short-term
debt profile in the hope of attracting international investment, for
example, from money market funds.
Mexico has built up a variety of international bonds ranging in maturity
from one year to 10 years, including 30-year Brady bonds. So far, Mexico has
not offered investors short-dated paper.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: SIA searches for global 'open
skies' policy - An airline concerned at the bilateral system of air
agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), one of the airline industry's big success stories
of the past 10 years, competing with British Airways for the title of the
world's most profitable carrier, has launched a campaign for a global 'open
skies' policy to replace the existing regulatory system governing the
international air transport industry.
The airline is worried its long-term expansion could be undermined unless
the current bilateral system of international air agreements is replaced by
a more liberal, multilateral approach to regulations.
The bilateral system dating back to the 1944 Chicago Convention has become
'the biggest single barrier to airline stability and profitability', Mr
Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, warned at two recent aviation
conferences.
The airline's campaign also coincides with a meeting in Montreal early next
month of the International Civil Aviation Conference (ICAO), the air
transport arm of the United Nations, to discuss changing the present
bilateral system and moving gradually to a more collective, multilateral
system reflecting the increasingly global nature of air transport.
'The present bilateral system is outdated,' Mr Michael Tan, SIA's deputy
managing director, said in an interview in Singapore. 'The current system is
used to protect carriers rather than stimulate growth.' But he conceded that
changing the system would be a long process. 'What we are encouraging is
that like-minded people and organisations can perhaps sign a mini agreement
to act as a catalyst for future change,' he said.
The issue is particularly important for SIA because the airline, lacking a
domestic market base, has always had to compete internationally to grow. A
dispute between the governments of Singapore and Canada over Ottawa's
decision to scrap the bilateral air service agreement between the two
countries and stop SIA's first transatlantic service to Toronto this summer
has further highlighted the problem for the airline.
The Canadian move is a vivid example of how governments protect weaker
carriers to the detriment of consumers and the wider economy, according to
Mr Tan. He now hopes both North American and European Commission proposals
to negotiate future air agreements as blocs will help forge a more liberal,
multilateral system. But he is also worried the new North American and
European blocs could become protectionist. This would probably force Asian
countries to consider forming a retaliatory bloc of their own.
This would be as a last resort, added Mr Tan, who argued in favour of a
system in which multilateral regulation would be intended only to ensure a
'level playing field' and open market access to all airlines. With more and
more airlines forging international alliances including cross-border equity
investments in other carriers, the structure of international aviation is
rapidly changing and becoming global making the old system of bilateral air
agreements increasingly irrelevant, according to SIA.
The airline has been the first to establish what it calls a 'trilateral
alliance' with 5 per cent cross equity investments with Delta in the US and
Swissair in Europe. Although the three carriers continue to compete, they
see their alliance as a partnership to improve efficiency and productivity
and generate more revenue in the world market.
SIA is also keen to acquire a minority stake in Qantas as part of the
Australian carrier's privatisation. 'Australia is a very important market
for SIA and Singapore is very important for Qantas as a hub and operational
centre,' Mr Tan explained. 'There is a common desire to forge a link,' he
added.
SIA has no desire to manage Qantas but wants a seat on the Australian
carrier's board. 'We are a conservative company. Taking over airlines is not
our business,' Mr Tan emphasised. Mr Cheong recently told his staff that
SIA's relationship with Qantas had been erratic in the past. 'One reason why
we wish to own part of Qantas is to remove the kinks in our relationship,
making it more predictable and conducive to planning,' he said.
Like the rest of the airline industry, SIA has not escaped the slump caused
by the Gulf conflict and the economic recession in several western markets.
But it has fared better than most, with pre-tax profits 7 per cent lower at
SDollars 634.5m (USDollars 380m) for the first half of its current financial
year ending this month. 'The Gulf war and the recession were blessings in
disguise because they reminded us of our mortality,' Mr Cheong told his
staff at the beginning of this year.
Unlike many of its international competitors, SIA decided not to cancel or
defer any of its outstanding aircraft orders. 'We did not downsize the
company; our mission is a long-term one and the airline has the strength to
cope with ups and downs in between,' Mr Tan said.
This confidence reflects the bullish outlook for the Asian-Pacific air
travel market. 'A great part of our capacity is deployed in Asia and we see
the market going up 8 to 10 per cent in the next three years,' Mr Tan said.
SIA is developing new routes in the region and has just started flying again
to Vietnam after a 17-year interruption. It is also about to start services
to South Africa and to Madrid later this year.
But the airline's longer-term growth ambitions are now facing two
significant obstacles. The first is the increasing congestion developing at
important airports in the Asian region as well as in Europe and the US. To
cope with this problem, SIA is one of the airlines actively discussing with
Boeing and Airbus the possibility of developing an ultra large 600 seater
aircraft by the turn of the century.
The second is the risk that instead of liberalising world air transport even
further, the emerging new international trade and economic blocs will
increase protectionism. Nothing could be worse for SIA.

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Trust &amp; Banking, a leading Japanese trust bank, will assist in the
restructuring of debt-laden Japanese non-bank financial institution Nippon
Mortgage, starting on April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Nippon Mortgage has debts of about Y630bn (Dollars 4.85bn) and is behind in
interest payments on about 40 per cent of those, Sumitomo Trust said. The
plan involves Nippon Mortgage paying back Y200bn to its creditors by selling
Y430bn of assets, mainly in property and securities.
It will also ask its creditors to delay loan repayment and reduce interest.
There are 69 financial institutions which have extended loans to Nippon
Mortgage. Sumitomo Trust, Nippon Mortgage's main creditor, now extends it
loans worth Y110bn,
The restructuring also calls for Sumitomo Trust to extend all necessary
funds to Nippon Mortgage from April 1. The trust bank expects to lend about
Y28bn in 1991-92.
Sumitomo Trust will also send seven officials to Nippon Mortgage, of whom
three will become directors after an extraordinary shareholders' meeting
this month. Mr Hidemori Idenoshita, one of three former Sumitomo Trust
officials already working at Nippon Mortgage, was appointed president on
March 10.
Nippon Mortgage mainly extends housing loans and loans guaranteed by real
estate, but has no overseas operations.
Japanese non-banks are financial institutions which offer loans but do not
accept deposits. They rely on banks for over 80 per cent of their funds to
finance their own lending, analysts said.
Some Japanese non-bank financial institutions are facing a rough road after
adventurous lending in the 1980s left them saddled with bad property loans
and real estate firm bankruptcies.

halfway

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Dunlop, the diversified Australian manufacturing group, yesterday
reported a 22.5 per cent cut in interim net profits to ADollars 106m
(USDollars 79.6m) for the six months to the end of December. Turnover
improved 14.5 per cent to ADollars 2.9bn.
Mr John Gough, chairman, said the result was a 'satisfactory' outcome for
the 'very difficult' period. The result was in line with forecasts in the
annual report.
Mr Gough said demand had been flat in all the group's main markets in
Australia and New Zealand, and the impact of the recession had spread from
consumer products to those associated with the construction and automotive
industries.
The Petersville Sleigh foods subsidiary, acquired from the Adelaide
Steamship group in September, had returned a 'satisfactory' profit, he
declared. Sales were slightly down on the comparable four months of the
previous year.
Mr Gough said demand for consumer products was improving and some signs of
recovery had been evident in the automotive replacement market. However,
demand for industrial products continued to be depressed.
He added that an improved performance from the group's international
businesses should lead to an improvement in profits for the second half,
unless the Australian economy deteriorated further.
The group was expected to report lower profits for the full year, however,
because of the slower-than-expected recovery of the Australian economy.
The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 10.5 cents per
share, but itwill be franked to 55 per cent, compared with 100 per cent in
the previous first half.
Mr Gough said the reduction in franking was in line with advice to
shareholders in the annual report that the company's franking capacity in
the current year would be abnormally low.
This was because of the slow economic recovery, the increased dividend
servicing requirement resulting from an ADollars 644m rights issue last
year, and the minimal franking capacity contributed by Petersville Sleigh.

Paladin's NZE takeover

<TEXT>
SCHRODERS Asia, the Hong Kong merchant bank 75 per cent owned by Schroder of
the UK, has become the first financial adviser in Hong Kong to face major
legal proceedings for alleged negligence.
Paladin, a Hong Kong investment company, served a writ against Schroders
Asia yesterday, claiming damages of HKDollars 100.6m (USDollars 13m) as a
result of the merchant bank's role as adviser to its previous directors and
independent committee on the acquisition of New Zealand Equities (NZE). The
New Zealand-listed company went into receivership in February 1990, seven
months after Schroders' recommendation was given.
Ms Lilian Oung, Paladin chairman, said yesterday: 'Paladin's legal advisers,
in consultation with both Hong Kong and leading London counsel, have stated
that they were quite satisfied that Schroders Asia has been grossly
negligent in discharging its duties which has caused Paladin substantial
loss and damage.'
A Schroders Asia source said the company was 'relaxed' about the accusations
and would 'vigorously' defend its position.
The successful takeover of NZE led to a bitterly-contested battle for
control of Paladin, eventually won by a minority shareholder group
controlled by the Taiwanese Oung family.
A number of former directors of Paladin were subsequently publicly censured
and Schroders has been threatened with legal action a number of times, for
its part in the NZE transaction. However, the Oung family has subsequently
had its own difficulties.
Paladin's former chairman, Mr James Oung, faced forgery charges in Taiwan
last year, while the Hong Kong regulators blocked a HKDollars 335m share
issue by Paladin, due to concerns over the 'adequacy of information' on its
proposals.

Besides the public portion, AMFB alloted 38.5m shares for sale to existing
shareholders and 3.3m shares to its employees and workers of Arab-Malaysian

<TEXT>
DWINDLING sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles resulted in Hong Kong toy
company Playmates International announcing a 27.5 per cent drop in 1991
earnings to HKDollars 881.6m (USDollars 114.5m) from HKDollars 1.22bn in
1990.
But it remained the most profitable toy company in the world. The Mutant
Turtles were the best-selling toy in the US last year, in their fifth year
on the market, while Playmates' new 'WaterBabies Doll' became the number one
baby doll in the US.
The company blamed an overall fall in sales on the 'difficult overall retail
climate'. Playmates had announced an 8 per cent increase in profit at the
interim stage, but the anticipated surge in Christmas sales failed to
materialise.
The company said it took 'a decision not to ship heavily during the fourth
quarter, leaving retailers sold through and ready to reorder at the start of
1992'. Operating profit was sharply lower, falling 31 per cent to HKDollars
1.17bn, but the net profit figure was rescued by a sharp reduction in
overseas tax.
Analysts expressed concern that sales of the mutant plastic action figures
had peaked and Playmates had failed to come up with a 'hot' replacement. The
much-vaunted 'Toxic Crusaders' was a big disappointment, with the grotesque
figures withdrawn within a year of their launch.
The company has retained a war chest of more than HKDollars 1.5bn to seek
'opportunities in mergers, acquisitions as well as diversifications', but it
has had difficulty locating suitable targets.
Playmates recommended a final dividend of 25 cents and a special cash
dividend of 40 cents, making a total payout of 83 cents a share, compared
with 65.5 cents in 1990 - adjusted for a bonus issue.
Mr Chan Tai Ho, chairman, described the outlook for 1992 as 'excellent',
with strong sales expected for product lines including a number of new lines
based on television shows and films, including 'The Addams Family'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELRON Electronic Industries, which groups several leading Israeli
high-technology companies, announced net profits for 1991 of Dollars 20.3m,
up almost threefold from Dollars 7m the previous year, due mainly to
one-time gains from a restructuring of its holdings.
The sale on the New York over-the-counter market of more than 10 per cent of
Elbit, its principal affiliate, was chiefly responsible for a contribution
of Dollars 11.8m to total revenues of Dollars 27m made by sales of stock in
group companies.
The sale reduced Elron's holding in Elbit, which makes military electronics
and computer-based medical imaging equipment, to 44.3 per cent from 55 per
cent.
Elron, established in the 1960s, has a record as a pioneer among Israeli
private sector companies in both military and civilian high-technology
products, with the vast majority of sales outside Israel. Itself quoted on
Nasdaq, Elron's main companies, Elbit, Elscint, Fibronics and Optrotech are
also quoted on New York markets.
Combined sales by Elron companies reached Dollars 555m in 1991 compared with
Dollars 521m in 1990.
Elbit and Elscint were the best performers, while Optrotech and Fibronics,
in the printed circuit board and fibre-optics markets, respectively blamed
recession for lower sales and lower margins.
During 1991, Elron paid down its debt to zero. It was also due yesterday to
complete a stock placement with Israeli institutions to raise more than
Dollars 20m with a view to financing further expansion.
Net earnings per share in 1991 came to Dollars 1.26, against 46 cents in
1990.

INVESTCORP, the internat-ional bank formed in 1982 as a conduit for Arab
money into western industry, is leading a group of investors in a Dollars
450m bid to acquire Circle K, the second biggest US convenience store chain.
The chain has been operating under bankruptcy protection since 1990.
Investcorp has invested in several other US retail ventures including Saks
Fifth Avenue and Tiffany's.
Under the terms of a reorganisation plan, filed by Circle K in the US
bankruptcy court on Friday, Investcorp and its associated investors have
agreed to pay Dollars 425m in cash, and an additional Dollars 30m after the
deal has been closed.
Some liabilities would also be assumed by the investors, including Spain's
Corporacion CNL and the US property developers RAK Development.
All Circle K's common and preferred stock would be cancelled and new shares
of common stock would be issued by the purchaser.
Under the plan, the net acquisition proceeds will be shared among the
remaining creditors based on the priority of their claims.
Mr Bart Brown, Circle K chairman, said the plan had two primary advantages.
'First, it would provide our creditor groups with substantial value, in
cash; and second, it would enable the company to continue as a vigorous
competitor in the convenience store industry.'
Circle K ran into trouble in the 1980s after it took on Dollars 1.1bn of
debt during a six-year expansion programme aimed at quadrupling its store
base to more than 4,600. The company was also hit by strong competition from
petrol companies which installed convenience stores at their outlets.
In December, Circle K put forward a business plan which included cutting its
store base to 2,200 from 3,776 and withdrawing from 14 of the 32 states
where it has operations.
Mr John Antioco, the company's recently-appointed president, said: 'We are
continuing to take new steps to streamline operations, revamp and remodel
facilities and remake Circle K into a leaner, more efficient, more
profitable company with excellent prospects and enhanced opportunities for
employees in the future.'
The reorganisation plan is subject to acceptance by creditors and equity
holders, confirmation under the bankruptcy code and consummation of the
stock purchase agreement.

<TEXT>
THE formidable task of 'demutualising' the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
the large US insurer, has got under way with the mailing of 2.2m ballots to
eligible policyholders.
Two-thirds of policyholders voting must be in favour for the
'demutualisation' plan - that is, a scheme which will turn the company from
one belonging to policyholders to one owned by shareholders - to go ahead.
The vote is scheduled for May 6.
A hearing by the New York Insurance Department has also been arranged for
April 21; approval by the New York Superintendent of Insurance is a further
pre-condition to the move.
The Equitable has been struggling financially following over-aggressive
expansion in the 1980s and heavy exposure to junk bonds and property-related
investments.
Last year, Axa, the French insurance company, provided a much-needed Dollars
1bn capital infusion which will convert into an equity stake of between 40
and 49 per cent when demutualisation occurs.
The demutualisation scheme will allocate ordinary shares among Equitable's
policyholders, and is being combined with an initial public offering, which
will involve selling shares to outside investors.
The offering must raise at least Dollars 300m. Part of this money will go
towards providing alternative cash payments or policy benefits to
policyholders receiving a small number of shares under the demutualisation
scheme; up to Dollars 220m may be used to pay operating expenses and
dividends; the rest will be added to Equitable's capital.
In the demutualisation documents, Equitable revealed that individual
insurance and annuity policy surrenders and withdrawals increased by 53 per
cent to Dollars 1.88bn in the first nine months of 1991 over the comparable
1990 figure.
It also says that equity real estate and below investment grade debt and
equity interests comprised 12.6 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively of
the Dollars 41.3bn general account and GIC segment investment portfolio.

TWO of the most powerful players in European publishing, Hachette of France
and Rizzoli of Italy, are to end their five-year-old collaborative
agreement.
Hachette, which owns the worldwide rights to Elle magazine and was recently
hit by the collapse of La Cinq, the French television station that it
controlled, announced several months ago it was considering ending its
involvement with Rizzoli.
The Italian group, which publishes Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's
leading newspapers, has decided to end the involvement, too. This will
involve a share swap - Hachette owns 8.1 per cent of Rizzoli which, in turn,
holds 9.2 per cent of the French company's press subsidiary - and some form
of cash payment to Hachette.
The move comes as Hachette, still scarred by the La Cinq debacle, is
embroiled in an elaborate plan to merge with Matra, the French electronics
and transport group, also owned and managed by the Lagardere family. Both
companies are chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere who announced the proposed
merger earlier this year.
Hachette and Rizzoli may also review their joint holdings in several
individual titles.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Eaton faces a challenging drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Friday, Mr Robert Eaton was extolling the long-term nature of General
Motors' commitment to Hungary as he drove the first Hungarian-built car of
modern times off the assembly line at GM's new car assembly plant in western
Hungary.
After 29 years, his own commitment to GM had only hours left to run,
however.
Having taken his leave of Mr Jozsef Antall, the Hungarian prime minister, Mr
Eaton rapidly changed aircraft, changed scenes and changed companies.
By yesterday he was in Detroit to be presented to the world as the
chairman-elect of Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US car makers.
The Chrysler board's choice of Mr Eaton was 'a sensational decision,' said
Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman since 1979 and not a man to shrink from hyperbole.
'Bob Eaton has impeccable credentials and an incredibly successful track
record at General Motors.'
But Mr Eaton, who becomes vice-chairman and chief operating officer of
Chrysler with immediate effect and chairman and chief executive officer from
the end of the year, has seldom taken a greater risk.
As president of GM Europe, Mr Eaton, 52, led probably the most profitable
volume car maker in Europe last year. He is giving that up in favour of
taking sole charge of a corporation which last year suffered a net loss of
Dollars 795m on a turnover of Dollars 29.4bn, and whose senior management is
nursing several badly-bruised egos after being overlooked in the hunt for a
new chairman.
Mr Eaton had the good fortune to take over as president of GM Europe when
the operation was riding a wave of unprecedented financial success.
For years GM had been the poor relation of Ford in Europe, racking up heavy
losses. The corner was turned in 1987, however, when GM Europe jumped to a
net profit of Dollars 1.3bn from a net loss of Dollars 343m a year earlier.
Mr Eaton's success has been to keep GM Europe on course, and the figures
have clearly not been lost on Chrysler. He became GM Europe president in
mid-1988 and in the three years 1989-91, under his sole charge, the
operations accumulated a total net profit of Dollars 5.5bn.
To a Detroit awash in red ink, such a performance excuses Mr Iacocca's
hyperbole, particularly when it has been achieved in four years when Ford of
Europe has collapsed from record profits to record losses.
Mr Eaton came to Europe as one of GM's most accomplished engineers and since
1982 had been vice-president of the Advanced Engineering Staff.
Throughout the 1970s he was in the forefront of GM's efforts to 'down-scale'
its products in response to successive oil crises, and for a period he was
chief engineer for GM's small family car project at the Chevrolet
Engineering Centre.
In Europe, his broader management skills blossomed. He led one of the
best-motivated senior management teams in the European car industry from
GM's tightly-run headquarters in Zurich, and in the past three years has
proved himself to be a formidable deal-maker.
Caught napping by Ford in 1989 in the battle to take control of Jaguar, the
UK luxury car maker, Mr Eaton turned the tables only months later by
stealing Saab, the Swedish executive car maker, from under the noses of Fiat
of Italy.
It was also fitting that Eaton's last act for GM was to drive the first Opel
Astra off the new assembly line in Hungary last Friday. He has been the
architect of GM's ambitious expansion in eastern Europe with important
projects in eastern Germany and Poland as well as in Hungary.
He has led GM Europe's efforts to increase its capacity by 25 per cent by
the mid-1990s, and has kept the company's vital new product programme on
track, most recently with the launch of the new generation Opel/Vauxhall
Astra.
In Europe, he has undeniably enjoyed a following wind, but at Chrysler he
will have to prove that he can hold the helm through much stormier
conditions.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nobel result well short of
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBEL Industries, the Swedish chemicals group, yesterday reported a 51 per
cent decline in profits after financial items, to SKr460m (Dollars 76.6m)
for 1991, a result substantially lower than the company's forecast of
SKr700m.
The dividend, which was SKr0.75 in 1990, will be passed this year because
Nobel posted a loss of SKr5.08bn after extraordinary items. This was due to
its involvement with Gamlestaden, the finance company which collapsed last
summer after bad property loans exhausted its capital.
Nobel was subsequently rescued by the state-owned Nordbanken, which has
become the principal owner of the concern.
Group sales fell by 6 per cent to SKr24.7bn, primarily due to the takeover
of its Bofors armaments division by Swedish Ordnance. Nobel predicted that
earnings after financial items would improve this year, although the
operating results would probably remain weak.
One reason for the fall in earnings last year was that income from portfolio
investments dropped to SKr96m from SKr408m in 1990.
A programme to concentrate activities in a few core areas will continue,
with Nobel recently having sold its consumer products division.
Operating earnings for its adhesive and paints group, the company's largest
division with sales of SKr9.3bn, rose by 29 per cent to SKr315m. Although
sales of chemicals for the pulp and paper industry rose by 28 per cent to
SKr4.3bn, operating profits fell by 46 per cent to SKr121m due to heavy
investment spending.

<TEXT>
MODO, Sweden's third largest pulp and paper company, yesterday announced
that profits after financial items dropped by 82 per cent to SKr221m
(Dollars 36.8m) for 1991. It plans to cut its dividend to SKr7 from SKr13.
The result was better than MoDo's forecast of break-even for 1991. The
company said it was too early to give a forecast for 1992.
Sales last year fell by 5.5 per cent to SKr17.4bn, as the recession and
excess production capacity depressed pulp and paper prices.
Although pulp prices have started to rise, the outlook for price increases
for fine paper, newsprint and magazine paper remains uncertain.
Operating profits dropped by 50 per cent to SKr969m. Although most of MoDo's
divisions reported earnings close to 1990 results, the MoDo Paper group
swung into a loss of SKr194m after a profit of SKr617m a year earlier.
MoDo also wrote off SKr145m against its operating result for the planned
reduction of personnel this year, as part of a rationalisation programme.
MoDo intends to cut costs by SKr500m to SKr15bn by the end of 1993. This
will include the elimination of 2,000 jobs.
Danish medical measuring equipment maker, Radiometer, has agreed to buy
family-controlled laboratory equipment producer, Struers, for DKr93.5m
(Dollars 14.4m).
It said it had been looking for a strategic alliance after a fall in sales
which left it with a DKr13m net loss in 1990-1991. The deficit came despite
cost cuts and staff reductions. It forecast a DKr7m loss in 1991-1992 and a
swing to a small profit the following year.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Profits at Lafarge Coppee tumble
44% to FFr1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAFARGE Coppee, the world's leading construction materials group, yesterday
announced a 44 per cent decline in annual profits, its first downturn for
eight years.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, attributed the setback to the deep recession
in the US construction industry, competition from allegedly dumped imports
into Spain, and a collapse in plasterboard prices across Europe.
Group net profits fell from FFr2.19bn (Dollars 390m) in 1990 to FFr1.23bn,
on turnover down by 2.7 per cent to FFr31.6bn. Adjusting for exchange-rate
changes and acquisitions, sales fell by an underlying 4.6 per cent, said Mr
Collomb. 'Clearly, it has been a bad year,' he said.
The chances of a recovery this year depended on a pick-up in the US and
Canada, where Lafarge lost the equivalent of FFr650m last year. Mr Collomb
believed the US market touched bottom last year, with a 9 per cent decline
in sales. However, Lafarge's order books there had not yet shown any real
sign of a pick-up.
Spain added a FFr240m loss, where prices have been hit by cut-price imports
from Romania, Turkey and Tunisia, currently the subject of a European
Commission anti-dumping investigation.
Meanwhile, Lafarge's plasterboard division, which accounts for 8 per cent of
group sales, lost FFr210m because of fierce price competition with Britain's
BPB Industries - the European market leader  - and Knauf of Germany. The
trio hold more than 90 per cent of European plasterboard sales.
Mr Collomb estimated that French plasterboard prices fell 28 per cent last
year, and that the European plasterboard industry had around 20 per cent
overcapacity, the equivalent of four or five years' growth. Lafarge Coppee
would continue to defend its 25 per cent market share and believed that
prices could recover this year.
However, sales and profits held up well in French and Moroccan cement sales,
new materials - Lafarge's fastest growing business  - and biochemicals.
The group continued with acquisitions, spending FFr1.9bn on eastern Europe,
the Mediterranean and south-east Asia. This left debts slightly up, at
FFr9.1bn, where they represented 37 per cent of shareholders' funds by the
end of year, against 33 per cent.
Gearing was 'reasonable and prudent' and Lafarge planned to keep it at
around that level for the foreseeable future.

<TEXT>
LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, managed to beat off the
worst effects of the worldwide economic slowdown last year, with a 10 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits to DM528m (Dollars 315m).
Based in Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt, the company is the world's biggest
producer of fork-lift trucks, having bought Lansing Bagnall of the UK four
years ago. Its other activities include industrial gases, heavy plant
manufacture, and refrigeration systems.
Group turnover in 1991 increased by 14 per cent to DM6.9bn. Although new
order inflow was 8 per cent lower at DM6.8bn, Linde said there was an
increase of 10 per cent to DM5.8bn when the plant division - which booked an
unusually big DM1.1bn order in the previous year - was excluded.
The dividend is being maintained at DM15 a share, as indicated by Mr Hans
Meinhardt, the chief executive, last November.
Fresenius, the German pharmaceutical and medical products group, has
acquired the fusion solutions, dialysis solutions, and irrigation solutions
activities of BASF.

FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Italians reveal 6% Fokker stake
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCRAMBLE by European aircraft manufacturers to consolidate their
position in the cut-throat regional jet market took a new twist yesterday
with the disclosure that Finmeccanica of Italy had accumulated a 6.02 per
cent stake in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft group.
Fokker said it had been taken by surprise by the disclosure that the Italian
state-controlled company had acquired the stake, worth Fl 71.5m (Dollars
38.1m) at Fokker's current share price.
The announcement coincides with a flurry of negotiations between European
aircraft groups to try to rationalise the loss-making European regional
aircraft industry.
It comes only a week after Fokker announced it was in discussions with
Deutsche Aerospace to expand collaboration in regional jets, including the
participation of the German company in Fokker's plans to develop a smaller
version of its Fokker 100 jet.
The Fokker stake appears to reflect an effort by the Italian group to hedge
its position in the current restructuring of the industry to ensure it will
play a role in the development of a new regional jet.
Finmeccanica declined to comment yesterday. It was caught off-balance by the
disclosure of its Fokker stake.
The disclosure comes at an embarrassing moment for Finmeccanica and its
aerospace subsidiary Alenia. The French authorities have been pressing the
Italian group for an early decision on injecting Dollars 250m to increase
the capital of SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor venture in which Finmeccanica
has a 45 per cent stake.
However, Finmeccanica has been playing for time, arguing it lacks funds
while at the same time seeking some counterpart from the French for going
ahead with the capital increase. But its secret acquisition of a stake in
Fokker is unlikely to please the French.
Its Alenia subsidiary is currently a partner with Deutsche Aerospace and
Aerospatiale of France to develop a family of 90 and 120-seater regional
jets. But the German group appears increasingly reluctant to launch the new
Dollars 2.5bn programme at this stage.
Instead, it is considering forging closer links with Fokker while
encouraging the European Airbus consortium, in which it has a 37.9 per cent
stake, to develop a smaller 130 seat version of the A320 airliner. Such a
move risks isolating Alenia.
Finmeccanica's investment in Fokker came to light as a result of a new Dutch
law introduced last month requiring shareholders to disclose stakes of 5 per
cent or more in quoted Dutch companies.
Fokker would not comment on whether it believed the Italian stake was a
long-held investment or a more recent purchase. But some industry officials
suggested Finmeccanica had held an undisclosed stake in Fokker for some
time.

FUGRO-MCCLELLAND, the Dutch-based group of consultancy engineers, is to
float roughly one-third of its shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange next
month. It wants to raise up to Fl 128m (Dollars 68m) to finance a recent
acquisition in the US and to fuel growth.
The company will offer 3.2m shares to the public, at between Fl 37 and Fl 40
each, with the final price to be announced on March 30.
Trading in the shares will begin on April 7, marking the first company
flotation in Amsterdam so far this year. Of the shares on offer, 1.66m are
existing shares held by several Dutch institutional investors and venture
capital firms. The rest will be newly issued.
Fugro-McClelland, the product of a 1987 merger between Fugro of the
Netherlands and McClelland Engineers of the US, will use part of the
proceeds to repay a Fl 59m loan it took out in 1991 to finance half of its
acquisition of John E. Chance, a US surveying company.
The consultancy group, with annual turnover of Fl 310m and a workforce of
2,200, is active in geo-technical and offshore services, surveying and
environmental consulting. It has more than 100 offices in 30 countries.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Suter falls 26% to Pounds 17.8m but
maintains the worst is past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTER, the industrial, distribution and chemical company chaired by Mr David
Abell, yesterday announced a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits but said
that the outlook for some divisions had improved. 'We have bottomed out,'
said Mr Abell.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 17.8m in the year to December 31. The
company blamed the fall on the recession, eroded margins and the
cancellation of an important contract for Pentagon Chemicals, a subsidiary.
Turnover edged ahead by almost 2 per cent to Pounds 205.7m but would have
slipped by 3 per cent if adjusted for 1990 acquisitions. Fully diluted
earnings fell to 10.5p (15p) per share. The directors recommended a
maintained final dividend of 5.6p, making an unchanged total of 8.8p.
Turnover in the chemicals division increased 10 per cent, reflecting a full
contribution from Chemoxy International, the Middlesbrough chemicals group
won from rival bidder MTM in 1990. But operating profits fell 32 per cent to
Pounds 6.3m after an unrelated company, which sub-contracted to Pentagon,
lost the contract. Pentagon has won some new business but its plant is only
at 60 per cent of capacity.
Turnover in the industrial division rose 2 per cent to Pounds 96m but
operating profits fell 15 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. Air-conditioner sales
were affected by recession in the building industry although the valves
division, which supplies the petrochemical and oil sectors, performed well.
There were extraordinary losses of Pounds 6.3m, which included a Pounds 4.1m
provision to cover an investment in Harton, the loss-making plastics
distributor. The 21.9 per cent stake cost Pounds 6m and is now valued at
Pounds 2.5m.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 33.6m, bringing gearing down 10
percentage points to 74 per cent. Mr Abell said debt levels would not be
reduced this year.
The Department of Trade and Industry is continuing its investigations of six
companies with Suter links. DTI inspectors were appointed in 1988 and 1989
to establish whether certain investors in the companies acted in concert.
Their report is due to be handed to the DTI soon.
COMMENT
Suter continues to be spurned by the market, which marked the shares down 1p
to 121p despite results in line with expectations and a maintained dividend.
Parts of the business, such as Chemoxy, the valves division and Raffel, a
European supplier of heat exchange equipment, show promise and should come
out of recession strongly. But too many questions remain. The investment in
Harton now looks unfortunate and Mr Abell admits Suter paid too much for
Pentagon. His remarks yesterday that Suter may be interested in buying part
of MTM look well intentioned, but it is difficult to see how it can pay with
its gearing and share price at these levels. If Suter achieves forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 22m this year, the shares are on a multiple of
less than 10. But even if the cloud of the DTI report is removed, the shares
are unlikely to be attractive other than for their yield.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden down 8% as caution unsettles
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON BOWDEN restricted the fall in its pre-tax profit last year to just 8
per cent at Pounds 27.8m as it unveiled what is likely to be one of the
better performances from housebuilders in the current reporting season.
However, the group cautioned against optimism created by a rise in house
sales since the end of last year. This has prompted some suggestions that
the housing market may be starting to recover after almost four years of
recession.
Mr David Wilson, chairman, said that the modest improvement was being
compared with a very depressed period in 1991, when sales were affected
badly by the Gulf war. It could in no way be described as a recovery, he
said.
Purchasers' confidence remained fragile and was likely to be dented by the
uncertainty caused by the election campaign. Sales had already started to
drift back, said Mr Wilson.
His comments sent the group's share price down 10p to 430p and caused other
housebuilding and building materials stocks to fall.
The decline from the previous year's Pounds 30.1m came on turnover ahead
from Pounds 129.1 to Pounds 135.9m.
The final dividend is increased to 6.2p for a total dividend of 8.7p (8.3p),
covered almost 3 times by earnings which, after allowing for the effects of
the Pounds 34m rights issue last March, fell from 28.6p to 24.5p.
The total dividend on the enlarged share capital represents a 14 per cent
increase.
The housebuilding division increased profits from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds
21.5m. It sold 1,324 homes last year - against 1,263 in 1990  - at an
average price of Pounds 80,000, up from Pounds 78,500.
Commercial property profits, however, fell from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 6.7m
on sales virtually unchanged at Pounds 30m.
At the end of the year the group had net cash of Pounds 7m compared with
shareholders funds of Pounds 157m. Borrowings, however, are likely to rise
this year as the group takes advantage of lower prices to purchase
residential and commercial land.
COMMENT
The market paid more attention to comments about the fragility of confidence
in the housing market than it did to the quality of Wilson Bowden's results.
Despite its current reservations, the company is clearly positioning itself
for a recovery. Borrowings have risen to about Pounds 20m and could approach
Pounds 30m by the year end - representing gearing of about 20 per cent. The
company's housing land bank last year increased from 6,200 plots to 7,900
plots with planning permission. The company also recently acquired the
rights to a further 230 acres of commercial land. These purchases should
stand it in good stead when demand does start to recover. Much of this
potential, however, is already in the share price with a prospective p/e of
19.4 on prospective profits of Pounds 25.5m in 1992.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brighter outlook at Jones &amp; Shipman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, one of the UK's few remaining publicly-quoted machine tool
companies, yesterday reported a 'quickening in the pace of new order
inquiries from manufacturing industry in the US and Canada, as well as the
UK.'
Mr John Wareing, managing director, said that since early February 'positive
interest has grown' in buying the Leicester-based company's
computer-controlled precision grinding and honing machine tools.
The announcement contrasts with the tone of the company's interim statement
in December, and is one of the first indications that the outlook for the UK
machine tool industry may be improving.
The company fell from profits of Pounds 400,000 to losses of Pounds 2.46m
pre-tax in the six months to September 30 and passed its interim dividend,
blaming a 'widespread moratorium in investment in manufacturing facilities,
particularly in the UK.'
Yesterday, Mr Wareing said most of the new inquiries had come from
traditional customers in the aerospace, precision tool, electronic component
and computer accessory industries.
But interest had also been expressed by new customer sources such as
manufacturers of medical and surgical equipment, power-tool makers, air
conditioning system manufacturers and the diesel fuel injection industry.
Mr Wareing was speaking in connection with the company's decision to exploit
'the first signs of a flickering recovery' by exhibiting in force at Mach
'92, the UK's largest machine tool exhibition, at Birmingham NEC in May.
Mr Wareing's statement will be of interest to many in the UK's hard-pressed
machine tool industry.
However, a rise in inquiries needs to be followed by an upturn in orders
before the industry can say real recovery has begun, and most still believe
that will not come until 1993.

ISA International, the Bradford-based computer accessories distributor,
reported a 25 per cent contraction - from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 2.12m  - in
pre-tax profits for 1991.
However, Mr John Parkinson, chairman, said the outcome arrested the decline

Net interest charges fell from Pounds 649,000 to Pounds 481,000. Borrowings
at the year-end amounted to Pounds 603,000 reducing gearing below 10 per
cent.
Turnover improved 7 per cent to Pounds 76.4m. Earnings per share dipped to
4.31p (5.84p), but the proposed final dividend is raised to 0.951p for a
total of 1.365p (1.288p).

The Alliance Trust reported a net asset value of Pounds 15.39p at January 31
 -an advance of some 24 per cent over the year.
Directors attributed the rise to the comparative strength of US markets

centred.
Net revenue edged ahead to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.5m), for earnings of
43.5p (40.66p) per share. A recommended final dividend of 29p lifts the
total for the year by 3p to 43p.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lower copper prices behind Fags decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The lower copper price was the main cause of a sharp profits fall in the
mining division of Antofagasta Holdings, the UK-quoted group with mining,
railway, industrial and banking interests in Chile. This fall lay behind a
35 per cent decline in group pre-tax profits from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds
19.2m in 1991.
The company said that it would be introducing two new copper mines in 1992
which were expected to increase copper production, attributable to the
group, from 31,000 tonnes in 1991 to 53,000 tonnes in 1992. This time mining
made profits of Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 14.5m) on turnover of Pounds 43.4m
(Pounds 45.2m).
Group turnover was static at Pounds 57.1m. Group operating profits shrank 48
per cent to Pounds 9.82m (Pounds 18.9m) and income from associated companies
 -in banking, manufacturing, telecommunications and mining - slipped 10 per
cent to Pounds 9.34m.
Earnings fell to 50.2p (76p) per share, but an unchanged final dividend of
13p is recommended for a maintained total of 19p.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Jas Fisher to close terminal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES FISHER and Sons saw annual profits dive 59 per cent following
increased losses from port terminal and agency operations and a reduced
contribution from shipping.
And the Barrow-in-Furness-based group is to close its profitable terminal at
Whitehaven following the decision by Albright and Wilson, the principal user
of the facility, to cease the importing and processing of phosphate rock.
The pre-tax outcome for the 1991 year - Pounds 1.5m against Pounds 3.63m -
came on turnover of Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 29.9m). Despite the outcome at
Whitehaven, port operations incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.99m
(Pounds 351,000), reflecting 'difficult trading conditions' at the Newhaven
and Heysham terminals.
The shipping side contributed operating profits of Pounds 3.8m, down from
Pounds 4.22m, as the recession led to lower freight rates and fewer bareboat
charter commitments.
The directors hope that the closure of the Whitehaven terminal, while having
an adverse effect on the group, would be offset by improved profitability of
the other two facilities.
Earnings per share dipped to 5.1p (9.11p) but the final dividend is held at
a proposed 3.5p, maintaining the total for the year at 5.5p.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: BTR disposals and Hawker Canada stake may
be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, has sold two businesses acquired through
recent takeovers for Pounds 33.1m.
It also said it was considering the sale of its majority stake in Hawker
Siddeley Canada, valued at about CDollars 220m (Pounds 107m).
The group acquired Hawker Siddeley last November for Pounds 1.55bn and said
yesterday it was conducting a review of its interest in the Canadian
subsidiary. BTR holds 59 per cent of HSC's common stock and 42 per cent of
its preferred shares. BTR shares rose 2p to 406p.
HSC has diverse manufacturing interests, including aircraft engine
components, steel castings, and mining and forestry equipment. It also
repairs jet engines and leases railway wagons. Profits fell last year from
CDollars 23.7m to CDollars 11.3m, largely as a result of problems in British
coal-mining and Canadian forestry industries.
Bowater, the packaging and industrial films group, is buying the printing
division of Rockware, which BTR bought last September in a Pounds 197m cash
bid, for Pounds 15.3m. Bowater recently launched a Pounds 333.5m rights
issue and announced two acquisitions of packaging groups for Pounds 444m.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, said that the purchase of
Rockware Printing had been under discussion even before BTR's bid. The deal
would roughly double Bowater's market share in the bespoke business forms
market to about 10 per cent. There could be some rationalisation of the
business, he said.
Rockware Printing's turnover in 1991 was Pounds 23m. Its profits and assets
were not disclosed, but Mr Lyon said he thought Bowater was paying a fair
price. The purchase is for cash and Mr Lyon said it would increase Bowater's
gearing from 35 per cent to 38 per cent, after taking account of the rights
issue and the other acquisitions. Bowater shares rose 1p to 770p.
The other disposal BTR announced was of a 24 per cent stake in Bunnings, a
quoted Australian timber products group, for ADollars 40.3m (Pounds 17.8m).
The stake has been sold to Westfarmers, of Perth, Western Australia.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rugby falls 16% on downturn in construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at the Rugby Group, which sells about a fifth of the UK's
cement, tumbled by 16 per cent from Pounds 66.7m to Pounds 55.8m in 1991 as
construction output fell sharply in the UK, US and Australia.
Turnover fell almost 8 per cent, from Pounds 578m to Pounds 532.6m. Despite
the profits fall the company proposed a maintained final dividend of 3.6p
for an unchanged total of 6.45p. This is comfortably covered by earnings of
12.7p (14.9p).
Profits from the UK cement division, which accounted for 37 per cent of
trading profits, fell by a quarter from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 19.1m.
Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that UK cement volume sales fell by
almost 18 per cent, compared with about 16 per cent for the industry as
whole. Rugby's main markets are in southern England which has been worst
affected by the downturn in construction.
Mr Carr said that UK cement sales were expected fall by a further 5 per cent
this year.
Profits from the UK joinery business, fell from Pounds 18m to Pounds 15.2m,
despite benefits from new acquisitions. The division was hit both by falling
sales and prices as UK residential and commercial property markets went into
reverse.
The UK steel reinforcing business suffered particularly badly with profits
falling from Pounds 4.23m to just Pounds 509,000.
Overseas profits also dipped sharply. The only respite was found in
Australia where demand from the alumina industry pushed cement and lime
profits up by a quarter to Pounds 9.68m.
This was partially offset by a fall in Australian joinery profits from
Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 203,000. US joinery profits fell from Pounds 342,000
to Pounds 265,000. Joinery profits from continental Europe fell by 6 per
cent to Pounds 2.27m. Glass profits from continental Europe, however, rose
by almost a third to Pounds 2.14m.
COMMENT
Forget about the profits, look at the strength of the balance sheet. Last
year Rugby produced a positive cashflow of Pounds 18.6m leaving it with net
cash at the end of the year of Pounds 23.8m. The oligopoly in the UK cement
market, where there are only three large manufacturers, means that cement
prices have not come under the same sorts of pressures as other building
materials. Rugby, meanwhile, has put in some hard work reducing costs,
cutting a further 400 jobs in the past 12 months. The cash flow benefits of
cement making, however, is well known and is already in the share price. The
group is in a position to spend up to Pounds 100m on acquisitions if it
could find something worthwhile. Pre-tax profits slightly higher at Pounds
57m would put the group on a prospective p/e of 15. The shares are safe but
look fully valued at this point in the cycle.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reinsurance underpins JIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance in the international reinsurance sector underpinned
profits growth at JIB Group, the insurance broker floated in November by
Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based trading company.
JIB, the latest of a series of medium-sized brokers to obtain a stock market
listing, reported a 33 per cent rise, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 20.1m, in
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 1991.
The figures were flattered by a contribution of Pounds 2.61m from interest
earned on a capital injection made by Jardine Matheson last June, but
underlying profits increased by 13 per cent with earnings per share up to
13.6p (12p).
The company declared a dividend of 5p.
However, the performance failed to stir much enthusiasm among investors.
JIB's share price fell back to 187p, 3p down on the day and 8p down on the
195p paid for shares at the flotation.
Approximately one third of the company's shares were placed in an offer
which was subscribed three times.
The company's reinsurance division increased its contribution to profits
from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 10.7m against an improvement in turnover to
Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 20m).
Growth in France, Australasia and Asia, where reinsurance operations have
begun recently, was the main reason.
Mr John Barton, chief executive, said that in London JIB's avoiding
involvement in retrocession or spiral business had held the company in good
stead following problems in that part of the market this year.
JIB's US retail division, which generate 43 per cent of revenues, was held
back by continuing softness in US insurance rates. Profits contributed fell
from Pounds 3.93m to Pounds 2.11m.
JIB completed a review of its US operations during the year and opted to
close 25 offices.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Metalrax bucks sector trend with modest
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METALRAX, the Birming-ham-based specialist engineering group, yesterday
reported record profits and a sizeable increase in the dividend in sharp
contrast to evidence of recession in much of the sector.
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 advanced from Pounds 7.13m to
Pounds 7.21m on sales marginally lower at Pounds 62.9m (Pounds 63.9m).
The company said the record profits had been achieved through productivity
gains from capital investment and positive cash flows, as well as its broad
spectrum of engineering activities which range from branded storage systems
and housewares to general engineering components.
Earnings per share rose from 7.25p to 7.62p and the directors have
recommended raising the final dividend to 2.9p (2.58p), giving 3.9p for the
year, a rise of almost 12 per cent. The company is also to make a 1-for-10
scrip issue. To this end, the directors are recommending that Pounds 325,523
of reserves be capitalised.
Metalrax said that its 'momentum' had continued during the first two months
of 1992.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, which last December expanded its information technology interests with
the Pounds 15m acquisition of Redwood International, is planning to float
its computer servicing interests in about three years time, writes Paul
Cheeseright.
It is also likely, when property markets have strengthened, to seek outside
investors for its property interests, grouped together under the title of
Holford Estates.
Mr Gary Allen, chief executive, acknowledged yesterday that these two arms
'don't seem to lie well' with the rest of IMI's businesses.
The aim is to build up IMI Computing until it has turnover of about Pounds
200m a year before the flotation. This suggests further acquisitions. Buying
Redwood doubled the size of turnover to about Pounds 60m.
The same approach will be adopted with Holford Estates, which has been
developing business parks on industrial land surplus to IMI's requirements.
'We need to build it up to a critical mass where it can attract outside
investors,' Mr Allen said.
IMI has five main operating divisions - building products, drink dispensing
equipment, fluid power, special engineering and metals. But the metals
business is being re-organised with the copper interests going into building
products, and titanium into special engineering.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: MMC to probe shoe polish buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday signalled his
interest in Britons' clean shoes by referring last October's acquisition of
Reckitt &amp; Colman's shoe polish businesses by Sara Lee to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Through the acquisition, the US-based Sara Lee, which already owns Kiwi shoe
polishes, added the Cherry Blossom and Meltonian brands to its portfolio
giving it more than half the UK market.
The Office of Fair Trading, which investigated the acquisition and
recommended the referral, thought it raised fears about excessive
concentration in the Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m market, especially given the
combined strength of the brand names.
If the MMC decides the merger is against the public interest, Mr Lilley may
force Sara Lee to sell the Reckitt polishes.
The OFT is believed to have intervened in response to several complaints
from retailing companies, which feared there had been too great a
consolidation of power among their polish suppliers. Many big supermarket
groups have developed their own-label shoe polishes and would be strong
enough to look after themselves but smaller operators suggested they might
prove to be especially vulnerable.
Sara Lee rejected the charge yesterday. Mr Euan Venters, marketing director
for Sara Lee in the UK, said: 'We continue to believe very strongly that the
acquisition is not against the interests of consumers or the trade.'
He said he could not state what market share the company possessed. 'The
total market is an oddity. We cannot give figures because it is a very
fragmented and complicated market,' he said.
Sara Lee manufactures its polishes at Honley, West Yorkshire, and has been
transferring production of Reckitt's brands to this site. It did not acquire
Reckitt's production plant at Hull, which continues to produce the Nugget
shoe polish for the UK consumer products group.
The assets acquired by Sara Lee were less than Pounds 30m, ensuring that the
referral could only be made on the grounds of excessive market share.
The MMC will report by June 17.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Christies cuts dividend as profits slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIES International, the auctioneer, slashed its final dividend after
pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 43.1m to Pounds 6.4m in 1991.
The shares fell 12p to 115p.
The final dividend is set at 1p, down from 6p, to give a total of 3.3p
(8.3p). Even so it was not covered by earnings per share of 2.12p (14.43p).
Christies had to extract Pounds 2.1m from reserves (retained profit of
Pounds 10.5m) to help meet the dividend cost.
The group said the dividend payment 'should be the base for dividends for
the future'. The dividend had risen sharply in the late 1980s when the art
market saw a series of high-priced sales - such as Van Gogh's Sunflowers -
and the group's pre-tax profits reached Pounds 66.9m in 1989.
Mr Christopher Davidge, managing director, said that Christies planned to
revert to a one third/two thirds split between the interim and final
dividend.
Mr Davidge said he thought the art market had now bottomed out. Pre-tax
profits in the second half were Pounds 3.4m compared to Pounds 3.1m in the
second half of 1990 and Pounds 3m in the first half of 1991.
Christies' share of the market, which it splits with Sotheby's, had risen to
48 per cent, its highest level since the mid-1950s. Mr Davidge said that
traditionally Christies did better under Labour governments than
Conservative ones.
He said that a sale next month, when Hans Holbein's A Lady with a Squirrel
and a Starling is to be auctioned with paintings by Rembrandt, Canaletto and
others, was important for the first half of the current year.
Sales in 1991 totalled Pounds 583m, slightly over half the Pounds 1.11bn of
1990, and group turnover fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds
168.2m).
Mr Davidge said that the drop was mainly the result of falling sales of
impressionist and contemporary pictures. These had made up 44 per cent of
sales in 1990 but only 19 per cent in 1991. Other areas, such as old
masters, prints and drawings, furniture, silver and books, had shown
'healthy increases' in sales.
Costs had been cut too, with auction and print costs down 27 per cent to
Pounds 64m and administrative expenses down 17 per cent to Pounds 37.2m.
Interest receivable fell from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 4.9m, as the group's
cash balances were run down, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 9.1m. The cash
inflow was insufficient to cover the outflow for tax, dividends, capital
expenditure and working capital.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Interest rise and strong wholesale broking
help push MAI ahead 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the broking, financial services and information group, yesterday
announced interim pre-tax profits up 2 per cent after a strong performance
from wholesale broking and higher interest payments on its Pounds 100m cash
pile.
Lord Hollick, the managing director ennobled last year as a Labour life
peer, said most core businesses saw progress. 'This is a good performance in
a recession,' he said.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 29.6m) in the six months
to end-December. Turnover improved 13 per cent to Pounds 187.2m (Pounds
166.4m). Earnings firmed to 5.8p (5.7p) and the interim dividend is again
1.4p.
Operating profits from wholesale broking increased to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds
16m). About one third of the increase was due to favourable exchange rates.
'We've also been quite successful in gaining market share and moving into
new markets,' Lord Hollick said.
Net interest receivable increased to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.1m). Most of the
company's Pounds 100m cash came from the sale last year of part of its stake
in Avenir, the French media group. MAI has retained 15.2 per cent of the
company, worth Pounds 44m.
MAI is the majority shareholder in Meridian, which last year won control of
the ITV franchise held by TVS Entertainment. Meridian has acquired freehold
land, studios and equipment from TVS. This will reduce Meridian's expected
investment from Pounds 35m to Pounds 25m, Lord Hollick said.
COMMENT
Lord Hollick is one of few City figures hoping for a Labour victory.
Actually, a hung parliament would be the best outcome for his media division
since it would mean yet more polling for NOP. But longer term, MAI is
relatively immune from the swings of party politics. With the new
government, whatever the party, likely to be faced with a higher PSBR, MAI's
inter dealer brokerage in the gilts market will be active. The retail
financial services and information divisions, meanwhile, need an economic
upturn rather than a change of government. With full year profits forecast
for Pounds 70m, the shares are on less than 9 times earnings. The low rating
has been partly due to worries about spending on Meridian, but given the
savings from the TVS deal, MAI's shares now look undervalued.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pay-out held as IMI falls to Pounds 73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at IMI, one of the largest of the UK's international
engineering groups, last year fell by more than a third to 1986 levels as
recession caught hold of its titanium business.
The outcome for the year to end-December was Pounds 73.3m, compared with
Pounds 115.1m in 1990, making the second successive year of decline.
Nonetheless, the board remained comfortable about the resilience of other
parts of the group and recommended maintaining the dividend at 1990 levels.
There is a proposed final of 5.8p, bringing total payments for the year to a
same-again 10p.
By contrast with Glynwed, the last leading engineering group to maintain its
dividend in the face of a sharp profits fall, the payments are amply covered
by earnings of 15p per share, against 23p last time.
The figures were in line with expectations, and the share price drifted with
the market to close 4p down at 243p.
'It was a tough year in many of the markets in which we operate,' said Mr
Gary Allen, chief executive.
In the coming year, IMI will depend more on the rationalisation and cost
cuts it has made in the group to bring through higher profits than any
economic changes.
'It is difficult to see any significant upward trend in most of the markets
we serve,' said Sir Eric Pountain, chairman.
IMI does not see much improvement in the UK economy until the last quarter,
but will continue to invest, with capital spending exceeding the Pounds 50m
spent in 1991.
Last year the titanium part of the group's refined and wrought metals
business faced the toughest conditions as prices and volume dropped by up to
30 per cent.
As demand in the aviation industry slid away, the group's customers cut back
their stocks and competitors dropped their prices. The group also lowered
its prices to keep its share of the market, but nonetheless the metals
business incurred a trading loss of Pounds 2m compared with a trading profit
of Pounds 23.4m.
Although IMI found the UK market, which accounts for 42 per cent of total
group sales, difficult, its overall performance has been boosted by its
companies in the US. The strength of the German market has also helped the
building products division.
COMMENT
If it had not been for titanium, IMI would have looked in very good shape at
the last year-end. Outside the metals business, its sales were slightly up,
and not many engineering groups could have said that in 1991. It is
protected from recession to some extent by the wide variety of its products
and its markets. The only snag is that, on its own account, the market
prospects for 1992 are not bright. So an increase in 1992 profits is going
to depend a great deal on the benefits obtained from rationalisation already
undertaken. It is realistic to look for 1992 pre-tax profits somewhere
between Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m, which could give earnings per share of
about 18p and put the shares on a prospective p/e of 13.5, with a much
sharper increase in 1993 when the economic cycle swings IMI's way.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Improved engineering outcome pegs decline
at Delta to 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance from its engineering division helped to offset the
impact of weak prices on electrical cables at Delta, leaving pre-tax profit
24 per cent down from Pounds 87.1m to Pounds 65.8m in 1991. Turnover fell to
Pounds 774m, against Pounds 793.6m.
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said the main damage was caused by
pressure on prices in the UK power cables market as the privatised
electricity companies husbanded their cash and as European competition
intensified.
Operating profit in the cables division came out at Pounds 15.1m, less than
half the comparable Pounds 31m, on sales of Pounds 279.4m (Pounds 307.2m).
Engineering, on the other hand, advanced to Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 19.8m) on
Pounds 295.1m (Pounds 279.6m) turnover. Demand for plumbing products and gas
controls was particularly strong in Germany and Spain.
Sites were still being closed, but one positive move was the switching of
the production of fire-fighting valves from Germany to the UK, 'where costs
are much lower. It's much more efficient to manufacture in Walsall than
Frankfurt,' Mr Easton said.
Industrial services was affected by the downturn in Australia and
rationalisation costs. Profit fell to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 24.1m).
Circuit protection suffered from destocking, reflected in profit down by
nearly Pounds 4m to Pounds 13.7m. Some cushioning was provided by the
Malaysian business and a recovery in exports to the Middle East.
Delta took the cost of redundancies and closures above the line and did not
quantify them. Mr Easton said more than 3,500 people had left the group
since 1989. The process was expected to moderate this year.
The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 41.2m) for
gearing of 13 per cent. There was ample borrowing capacity to make
acquisitions, Mr Easton said. In the US, he wanted the group to grow to five
times its present sales of Pounds 48m by the mid-1990s.
Earnings per share fell to 28p (35.7p). A maintained final dividend of 9.8p
makes an unchanged total of 14p.
COMMENT
Mr Easton is perhaps the first industrialist to describe the recession as
history, especially when his company is still being affected by it. His
equanimity is to some extent justified by the resilience Delta has shown. In
spite of its 50 per cent exposure to the UK, earnings per share have fallen
by less than 24 per cent since the 1989 peak. The benefit of prompt cost
cuts and a tempering of the reorganisation bill this year should restore
profit growth, although cables markets are likely to remain difficult.
Indeed the collapse in cables profits from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 4.4m
between the first and second halves was the most disappointing aspect of the
figures. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 70m-Pounds 75m this year gives a
prospective p/e of about 14 on yesterday's close of 446p. Its track record,
strong balance sheet and comfortable dividend cover has earned a small
premium to the market. Although there is little scope for short-term
progress, the shares remain worth holding.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Medeva pays Pounds 9.3m for two hepatitis B
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, UK pharmaceuticals group, has bought worldwide rights to two
hepatitis B products for about Pounds 9.3m.
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, said the acquisitions continued the
programme of acquiring and developing pharmaceutical products with a short
lead-time before they could be put on the market.
Medeva is paying SFr10m (Pounds 3.86m) immediately to Epitec and GA
Investments.
The balance is dependent on successful completion of further development
work and reaching some registration milestones in European countries.
One product is a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B. It is in
late-stage clinical development and the early phases of regulatory approval.
Current estimates of the size of the market for this product are Pounds
150m, Medeva said.
The other product is a treatment for chronic hepatitis caused by the
hepatitis B virus. This is in early clinical development and will reach the
market in five years.
Medeva said it would probably seek a partner to develop the second
treatment.
Meanwhile, Mr Bernard Taylor, executive chairman, said the company's
unbranded generic businesses were for sale, adds Paul Abrahams.
These include a small part of the Pounds 85m Evans acquisition in January
1990, and Thomas Kerfoot which Medeva bought for Pounds 10m in September
1990. Mr Taylor said the businesses were holding their own.

Renold, a maker of chains and gears for power transmission equipment, has
got its retaliation in early against a possible hostile bid from TT Group,
writes Jane Fuller.
In response to TT taking a 2.9 per cent stake, Renold warned that the
acquisitive industrial holding company might try to acquire it 'on the cheap
at the lowest point in the economic cycle'. It advised shareholders not to
sell.
The share price promptly rose by more than 20 per cent to 55 1/2 p, a market
value of Pounds 36.4m, but not before TT had taken its stake to 4.6 per
cent. Mr John Newman, a director of TT, said the purchases were 'just an
investment'.
Renold said yesterday the full-year pre-tax deficit would not exceed Pounds
3.5m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.5m.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Publishing performance gives BPP lift to
Pounds 6.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BPP HOLDINGS, the financial training and publishing group, announced pre-tax
profits 23 per cent ahead, up from Pounds 5.19m to Pounds 6.39m, for the
1991 year.
A strong performance from publishing offset a fall in profits from training
and language courses. These were hit by lower recruitment of chartered
accountants and the Gulf war.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said: 'We like to think we are a good each way
bet for the general election. If the Conservatives win it will be good for
the underlying strength of the economy, while if Labour wins it will be good
for training.'
Earnings per share increased to 17.3p (15.7p) as sales rose to Pounds 42.4m
(Pounds 36.7m). An increased final dividend of 4.5p lifts the total to 6.9p
(6.3p).
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 362,000 to cover the costs of
closing BPP Management Education and the unsuccessful legal action to lift
an injunction preventing the group from bidding for DC Gardner.
In May the group raised Pounds 12.3m by way of a rights issue, used to
acquire Letts Educational, a publisher of home-study books for school
examinations, for Pounds 3.7m, and the purchase of 75 per cent of Melrose, a
publisher of video-based training packages, for Pounds 5.75m. The group now
has net cash of Pounds 5.2m and is looking at various publishing companies
to buy.
The publishing activities all did well, benefiting from the rise in numbers
of college students, and increased profits to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.27m).

FT  17 MAR 92 / Nestle wins crucial court case in battle for Perrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, yesterday won a crucial round in its fight for
control of the Perrier mineral water group when a French court invalidated
the purchase of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French
sugar company.
Saint Louis is allied to Italy's Agnelli family, Nestle's opponents in its
FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) bid for Perrier.
This is the second big court case Nestle has won in the battle. Ten days ago
another French court froze the voting rights on part of the Perrier shares
owned by Exor, the property group that controls Perrier for which the
Agnellis are in the throes of an agreed FFr5.6bn offer.
These cases will be critical in determining Nestle's chance of winning
Perrier. The Agnelli camp, which controlled almost 49 per cent of the voting
shares, could have blocked the Swiss group's bid, but this stake is now
reduced to 31 per cent, increasing Nestle's room for manoeuvre.
'Nestle now has a very good chance of winning control of Perrier,' said Mr
John Graham, European food analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
Yesterday's case hinged on whether Perrier had sold the block of new shares
to Saint Louis as part of a concert party to block Nestle's bid. The court
has now annulled the sale.
However Nestle, which joined with Indosuez, the French bank, in bidding for
Perrier, will almost certainly have to raise its offer because Exor recently
mounted a counter-bid for the rest of the mineral water company's shares at
FFr1,475, the same price as Nestle.
Perrier's shares rose FFr14 to FFr1,650 in Paris yesterday on expectation of
a counter-bid. Analysts agreed Nestle would not have to bid much above the
market price to win control unless the Agnellis, who stand to make a profit
on their Perrier shares, launch another counter-bid.
Conversely the Agnellis, who have been pitted against their old ally, BSN,
the French food group which has aligned itself with Nestle by mounting a
FFr6bn counter-bid for Exor, could decide to negotiate a settlement.
Mr Loic Morvan, food analyst with James Capel in Paris, said the court
victories would give Nestle a 'considerable psychological advantage' in
negotiations.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Maxwell kept pension fund trustees in dark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'PHANTOM' board meeting in September 1991 at which Mr Robert Maxwell
authorised stocklending from the Maxwell pension funds was unknown to
pension trustee directors, it emerged yesterday.
Confidential minutes of the board meetings of Mirror Group Pension Trustees
(MGPT), obtained by the Financial Times, show that the only directors
present at a meeting on September 2 were Mr Maxwell and his son Ian,
together with Mr Trevor Cook, the pensions manager.
At the meeting, Mr Robert Maxwell, the MGPT chairman, drafted a letter
assuring Invesco MIM, one of the managers of the pension funds, that the
programme of stocklending - lending out assets to boost income  - was
approved by the board of MGPT.
However, in one of the crucial sections of a forthcoming report by the
parliamentary committee on pension reform, to be published after the general
election, other directors of the MGPT say they were unaware that pension
fund assets had been lent out until after Mr Robert Maxwell's death in
November.
Several who were contacted yesterday said they had only recently become
aware of the September 2 board meeting and the letter to Invesco.
Stocklending is a legal and commonplace practice, but normally high quality
collateral is given until the assets are returned. Stocklending with
inadequate collateral was the mechanism Mr Robert Maxwell used to divert
Pounds 400m from the care of pension fund managers to his private companies.
One pension trustee director said yesterday the directors had received legal
advice that, though the board was quorate with two directors, decisions
could be deemed illegal if the rest of the board was not made aware of them.
Mr Cook, not a director of MGPT, confirmed that he had signed and sent the
letter to Invesco on Mr Robert Maxwell's orders. As far as he was aware the
minutes of the meeting had been filed in the normal way.
The letter, addressed to Mr James Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Invesco MIM, says
'at your request we confirm our earlier advice that you take instructions
from Bishopsgate Investment Management', the investment company chaired by
Mr Robert Maxwell, which managed the bulk of the pension funds.
It adds: 'We concur with the stocklending operation being carried out by
Bishopsgate on our behalf'. On BIM's instructions, MIM passed it some Pounds
20m of assets for stocklending.
There is no suggestion that MIM directors acted improperly, as the letter
appeared to give them adequate authority for the transfer. The letter also
recognises that BIM, not Invesco MIM, 'is responsible to us for the holding
of adequate collateral'.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: Aid to Russia would be small price to pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRYAN CARTLEDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial comment, 'Fiddling while Russia burns' (March 10 ),
badly needed to be made. As you were right to emphasise, the case for
financial aid to the Russian government must now move beyond demonstrating
the need for it into the less easily predictable territory of calculating
the rapidly shrinking timescale within which it could be effective.
Your report, 'St Petersburg sounds the alert on wages' (March 11),
graphically illustrated the speed with which inflationary pressures on the
Yeltsin government are mounting. These will be supplemented in April by the
impact of planned energy price increases, which are likely to result in
closure for many industrial enterprises and a leap in unemployment.
The provision by the G7 nations of a Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn
stabilisation fund to assist the Russian government to strengthen the rouble
would not in itself guarantee a deceleration of the inflationary spiral or
the defusing of the acute social tensions to which it, together with rising
unemployment, will give rise. But it is the only resource, apart from
humanitarian aid, at the west's disposal. It would stiffen the morale and
the will of Mr Gaidar, Russian first deputy prime minister, and his
colleagues, in pressing on with their programme of reform; and it would have
an important psychological impact on a population facing the humiliation of
a worthless currency.
The coincidence of looming crisis in Russia with a US presidential election
campaign in which the incumbent is under threat from the isolationist right
is unfortunate: but it should not be allowed to prevent western governments,
including the US, from acting now rather than hiding behind the
International Monetary Fund's inevitably protracted procedures. If inflation
in Russia cannot, with western help, be slowed within the next few weeks,
the Russian government could be obliged, despite its current denials, to
resort to a monetary reform which would wipe out savings and risk a social
explosion. The sum of Dollars 5bn to Pounds 6bn is a small price to pay to
help to reduce that possibility and the long-term dangers for the west which
it would create.

Sir, The outcome of your survey ('Business chiefs want decisive Tory win',

You should try surveying the 10-person business, grappling with the uniform
business rate, late payment of invoices by big companies, inflated interest
from aggressive banks which seem to be just waiting to liquidate one, savage

FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: Where power lies in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID FIFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to add a few thoughts to Christopher Lorenz's article 'Sum
total adds up to more than figures' (March 6) and Peter McGregor's letter
(March 9). One has to ask how accountants have achieved their power within
the UK business world. This I believe can be traced to the importance of the
stock market in corporate ownership, with power delegated to senior
managers. The accountant in this scenario acts as a policeman working on
behalf of the owners. Having realised this situation the accountants have
then organised the best closed shop.
If we consider the long-term as practised in Germany and Japan we find
ownership more closely involved in management and able to see financial
conditions for itself. Under this arrangement creativity and evolutionary
product design come to the fore. Interestingly, creativity as represented by
intuition and measured by psychometric assessment is found more among
scientists than accountants.
I write as one educated as a scientist who chose a business career, passed
through business school and later looked after the financial affairs of a
group of companies.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Kohl struggles to land his catch: The debate in Germany on
European economic and monetary union could last until its December deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 90 per cent certain that Germany, driven on by the European
convictions of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, will ratify the Maastricht treaty on
European political, economic and monetary union by the end of the year.
It is equally certain that the country is going to make terribly heavy
weather of it. Indeed, Mr Kohl may well have to pay a heavy political price
for his convictions. The whole debate will probably run right up to the last
stroke of midnight on December 31, causing soul-searching in Bonn, in Berlin
and in Brussels, and even the odd beery bickering in the back-streets of
Bielefeld.
Throughout the small group of high-level government officials in Bonn
responsible for negotiating the EC packages over the past two years there
reigns a deep gloom about the coming confrontation. For even if they are
convinced that Maastricht will be ratified, they fear that the debate will
encourage the mood of questioning that prevails in the unified Germany -
questioning of the old certainty of Germany's role firmly anchored in
western Europe.
It could also leave loopholes - if not legal, then at least political - in
the ratification of economic and monetary union (Emu), allowing opponents of
the process to call it into question once again before the final step to
full implementation of a single European currency.
Last week Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the finance ministry, leader
of Germany's Emu negotiating team, and Mr Kohl's 'sherpa' - chief adviser
and fixer - for the Group of Seven world economic summits, summoned a rare
public briefing of leading economic correspondents to spell out his concern
at the content and direction of the current debate.
'Surely this debate is serious enough for us to try a bit harder,' he said.
The simplistic state of the discussion 'only goes to show that our German
self-confidence has not come very far'.
He was expressing the fear that the debate would be reduced to the level of
knee-jerk nationalism: to accusations such as 'you are endangering the
D-mark, so you are a traitor to the Fatherland', as he put it.
At the same time, there is a growing fear that anyone who has an axe to
grind within the German body politic will seek to attach it to the
ratification process. That seems to be exactly what the 16 German federal
states are doing, in insisting that they will only give their blessing to
Maastricht if their own involvement in all future Euro-negotiations is
greatly increased. And it is the sore temptation faced by the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD).
The support both of the states, and the SPD, is essential to get
ratification. Mr Kohl will present two items of legislation next month to
the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the two houses of the German parliament.
The first seeks to amend the German constitution in two ways, each requiring
a two-thirds majority in both houses. They must approve the transfer of
powers from the German Bundesbank to a future European central bank. And
they must allow the vote at local elections to all EC citizens.
Only once that law has the necessary approval can the full ratification of
Maastricht be voted through, by a simple majority. So Mr Kohl is a hostage
to his opponents both in Bonn, and in the states.
Already he has been forced onto the defensive. Both he, and Mr Theo Waigel,
his finance minister, have begun to argue that the most likely name of the
single currency - the Ecu  - has by no means been agreed, and both would
prefer the 'Euro-mark'. Mr Waigel went further at the weekend, suggesting
that the future European central bank must have its headquarters in Germany,
as the only way to ensure 'broad approval and acceptance' of Emu among the
Germans.
Little more than three months ago, it seemed that most of the electorate
barely cared about Maastricht. There was little debate in the media, and
even less in parliament. A broad consensus ruled in Bonn that European
integration was a good thing. While the debate raged in Britain on whether
Emu should happen at all, there was a certain smug self-satisfaction in Bonn
that Germans were far too European to doubt it.
To be sure, there were grumblings within the mighty German Bundesbank, where
the state representatives - men such as Mr Lothar Muller from Bavaria, and
Mr Wilhelm Nolling from Hamburg - were more sceptical about the stability
and security of the process than their Frankfurt-based colleagues in the
bank's directorate. But the Bundesbank as a whole never questioned the fact
of Emu, only the terms, and the politicians in Bonn slumbered on.
All that changed on the eve of Maastricht when Bild Zeitung, the country's
only mass-circulation newspaper and a worthy bell-wether of the mood in the
Bielefeld beer-cellars, ran a banner headline declaring: 'The D-mark to be
abolished.' The next day it ran a funeral address for the demise of the
beloved currency.
Since then the debate has broken out all over the place, fuelled by a
belated recognition among the more populist politicians that a unified
Germany is a lot more sceptical about European integration than the old
divided nation.
The trouble is that the discussion is thoroughly confusing, because the
assault on Maastricht is coming from several directions at once. In the
first place, there are the outright Euro-sceptics, dubious about the demise
of the D-mark, and convinced that Germany must now concentrate more on
integrating east and central Europe, and less on the old EC.
The second group comprises the Euro-enthusiasts, convinced that Maastricht
has failed to strengthen European political union enough, alongside Emu, and
seeking to block the latter until the former has been achieved.
Third come the German federalists, the powerful German federal states, which
see their territory increasingly whittled away by Bonn, through Brussels.
Among them are both Euro-sceptics and Euro-enthusiasts, equally keen to see
the power of central government curbed.
The Euro-sceptics amount to a small minority in Bonn, but with growing
popular support. The opinion polls certainly suggest that. According to the
respected Allensbach institute, the polling body, the proportion of Germans
wanting to slow down the European integration process has risen from 21 per
cent in 1989 to 38 per cent last year. Those suggesting it should not be
slowed down dropped from 58 per cent in 1989 to only 34 per cent last year.
As for the precise question of giving up the D-mark, according to the
Society for the Protection of German Savers, the proportion has switched
from a clear 52:26 in favour back in 1970, to a decided 56:18 against last
year. Other polls suggest the same, with a growing backlash since
Maastricht. The most recent put opposition at 72 per cent, with almost 30
per cent saying they would change their vote in the 1994 elections to
support any party saying it would not give up the D-mark.
That is one option which so far German electors do not have, unless they
vote for the extremes of left and right. The political establishment in Bonn
is very largely united in support of Emu - but the temptation is growing at
the fringes to exploit the popular desire to maintain 'the D-mark in one's
pocket'.
The first to do so was Mr Peter Gauweiler, the environment minister in
Bavaria, a leading member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) in that state.
He is a rival to Mr Waigel, the party leader, and is often seen as the real
heir-apparent to Mr Franz-Josef Strauss, the long-time conservative prime
minister there.
He suddenly came out with a ringing denunciation of the whole process of
European union, describing it as a 'totalitarian dream of universal
redemption', and denouncing the Ecu as 'Esperanto-geld'. He lost the debate
in the party leadership, but his are the words which linger on in the public
memory.
Then came Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader and enfant terrible of the SPD,
who surprised and alarmed his own colleagues by calling for outright
rejection of the EC treaty - because Emu will be built on foundations of
sand. You cannot have a common currency, and a single central bank, while
allowing each member state to pursue its own incomes policy, social and
financial policies, he said.
'Thank God for Mr Lafontaine,' one EC diplomat remarked. 'His capacity for
choosing the wrong horse is legendary. By coming out against Maastricht, he
forced his party to come out in favour.'
That at least is what happened - up to a point. The SPD has promised not to
allow its doubts to block ratification. But what it wants in exchange is the
promise of another debate on Emu before Stage Three - the final step to a
single currency. That debate should not be a mere formality, says Mrs
Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, the party spokesman on Europe: it would overrule
the 'automatic' trigger mechanism for Emu provided by the Maastricht treaty,
and give the German parliament its own right to decide whether it believes
the preconditions for Emu have been fulfilled.
Such a 'second look' at Emu certainly seems very similar in effect to the
'opt-out' clause built into the treaty for Britain, although the intention
may be to 'opt in'. It is something Mr Kohl seems certain to fight against.
What he will have to accept is an instruction to report back to both the
Bundestag, the lower house, and the Bundesrat, representing the 16 federal
states, before Stage Three. He will have to report both on how the economic
preconditions for Emu have been fulfilled - whether, for example, Italy has
satisfactorily reduced its state debt and budget deficit far enough to join
 -and on what further progress has been made to political union.
That much the Euro-enthusiasts seem to have won, while promising to ratify
Maastricht in principle.
The greatest threat to Mr Kohl's position, however, comes from those German
federalists who wish not to transfer all decision-making to Brussels, as the
British might suspect, but to keep it all back in the Lander (states) in
Germany. They are demanding fully-fledged changes in the constitution to
give them control over any future moves to transfer more power to Brussels,
or any other multi-lateral institution. They also want a seat in all EC
negotiations on budget spending.
The prospect is regarded with horror by the likes of Mr Kohler. Far from
imposing budget discipline on Brussels, he sees the dilution of Germany's
negotiating position as an invitation to profligacy. But if Mr Kohl wants
ratification by the end of the year it is hard to see what he can do but
compromise.
While this debate goes on back in Bonn, the European debate is moving
forward into further potential quagmires. Mr Jacques Delors' budget
proposals to finance ever greater 'cohesion' in the poorest member states
have for once united all parts of the German political spectrum in
opposition. With the gigantic costs of German unification causing public
spending to be cut no one wants to give new net transfers to the Community.
'It is going to be a terrible year for Europe,' according to one senior
German official. 'There are linkages on all sides. Our states want more
powers for saying yes to Maastricht. But at least we can all agree on EC
budget discipline. Then Spain may insist that it gets more money, or it will
block any moves to englargement. That means blocking Sweden, or Austria -
whose membership we are committed to support. But don't get us wrong. At the
end of it all, we will still be good Europeans.' At least in Bonn.

THE Liberal Democrats, who will not form the next government, serve a useful
purpose. Their party is a fruitful source of ideas, some of which are bright
and some of which are incomprehensible. It is also a potential junior
partner in a Labour-led coalition. The senior partner would have to be
Labour, since the Conservatives could not in good faith ally themselves with
Mr Paddy Ashdown's followers on the basis of their manifesto, 'Changing
Britain for good', published yesterday. The prime minister refused to
contemplate a change to proportional representation in his speech in Torquay
on Saturday. Mr Ashdown is as unequivocally committed to the opposite
policy. 'Liberal Democrats will neither support nor participate in a
government which turns its back on reform,' states the manifesto.
Labour, on the other hand, is proposing to keep talking about PR, even for
elections to the House of Commons. The Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock,
remarked the other day that it was 'very highly unlikely' that
first-past-the-post would be abandoned for national elections. He could
hardly be more equivocal than that. Yet Labour policies on other items of
constitutional reform are so close to those of the Liberal Democrats as to
be indistinguishable. Both favour Scottish, Welsh and English regional
self-government; both offer a freedom of information act and bills of rights
(the Liberal Democrats would incorporate the European Convention into UK
law), and both promise the reconstitution of the House of Lords as an
elected senate.
Party similarities
Much of this is constructive; Britain needs a debate about governance. The
Liberal Democrats' central argument, which is that constitutional reform is
a necessary prerequisite for other reforms in the management of the British
polity, has much to commend it. But there are other, more questionable,
similarities between the two parties of the centre-left.
Labour would sign the social charter proposed at the Maastricht meeting of
European Community heads of state; so would the Liberal Democrats. The
latter are more welcoming than the former to full economic and monetary
union, but it is a distinction without a difference. Regrettably, both
parties would retract the Conservatives' structural reforms of the social
services. In the case of health this would be to abandon one of the
government's more promising attempts to modernise the welfare state.
Both appear to regard public expenditure as an absolute good, with tax
increases guaranteed. The Liberal Democrats take this belief seriously: they
alone hypothesise a public sector borrowing requirement Pounds 2bn higher
than either Labour of the Conservatives dare to propose, and that after
taking into account general increases in taxation.
Attractive menu
As most continental Europeans are aware, coalitions are not constructed on
the basis of minority party manifestoes. Just a few choice items, or
compromises, cement many political alliances. The Liberal Democrats'
manifesto contains an enormous a la carte menu of attractive items. The Bank
of England would become 'operationally independent'. Monopolies like British
Telecom and British Gas would be broken up. Coal would become crown
property, with licences to mine issued to British Coal and assorted
competitors. The proposed EC energy tax would be supported, with offsetting
reductions in VAT.
Yet there are also propositions that simply do not make sense, such as the
table indicating that a Pounds 4425m increase in state benefits, offset by
tax 'reforms' (ie: increases) of Pounds 4,380m, could be implemented in year
one of a new administration - and still give a net yield of Pounds 355m,
after 'administrative savings' of Pounds 400m. Others are merely
fantastical, such as the 'gradual integration of Community members' armed
forces under a joint military command'.
So long as the Liberal Democrats are not a prospective government such
excesses need not be taken too seriously. Should it succeed in breaking the
electoral system, the party would have to leave behind such cheerful
confusion.
