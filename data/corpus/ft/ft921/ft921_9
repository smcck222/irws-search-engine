In contrast to the usual tales of gloom and destruction shown in so many
wildlife programmes, today's Survival promises a story of success and hope.
Conservationists were worried about the development of Stansted airport but
today, a year after the new airport opened, orchids thrive at the end of the
runway, rabbits play, owls hunt for voles and mice and there are still
kestrels in residence (7.30 ITV).
Beginning in the desert cities of Samarkand and Bokhara on the Old Silk
Road, Assignment reports from central Asia following the disintegration of
the Soviet Union. The newly independent states of Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan
are bankrupt and Moslem fundamentalism is resurgent. The programme asks
whether any political party can control the social forces unleashed by the
end of Soviet rule (7.45 BBC2).
At 8.00, Channel 4 has a profile of former war photographer Don McCullin who
now lives in Somerset and concentrates on landscape and still-life
photography.
ITV's downbeat series about real life detection, Murder Squad ends with the
views of two men now serving life sentences as a result of investigations
featured earlier in the series (9.00).

FT  17 MAR 92 / Arts: John Mortimer's 'Zaide' - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozart was composing Zaide, his first essay in German opera, when the
commission for the opera seria Idomeneo arrived, and Zaide was set aside.
Two years later, Joseph II was commissioning German pieces for his national
company: Mozart looked at his unfinished Zaide, decided it was not 'comic'
enough for Vienna, and wrote instead Die Entfuhrung, on much the same
subject but with Blonde, Pedrillo and Osmin added. Zaide remained unknown
until the composer's widow found and sold it to a publisher.
Fifteen musical numbers - perhaps three-quarters of the intended  - survive,
but not the spoken dialogue that should link them. Mozart's source was a
libretto in which Zaide, the Constanze figure and Gomatz, the Belmonte
figure turn out to be brother and sister, and the Sultan's overseer turns
out to be both their father and one who had saved the Sultan's life 20 years
before. But after the first few numbers Mozart departed from his source; and
for the soprano and tenor he wrote tender love music suggesting that he had
a different denouement in mind.
The score ends with what is presumably the second-act finale, in which the
recaptured pair face death together, Allazim pleads for mercy, and the
Sultan is inflexible. Thereafter, it's anyone's guess what happens . . . and
so Zaide, which contains marvellous numbers, has attracted many speculators,
eager to save some excellently dramatic music for the stage.
Italo Calvino produced a version - it reached London in William Weaver's
translation - in which Mozart's incomplete score was washed up on a desert
island and the performers who came across it tried various ways of fleshing
it out and resolving it. The latest version of Zaide is by John Mortimer. It
received its world premiere last Thursday in the Juilliard Theater, brought
by the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music.
Mortimer - like Peter Sellars in his production of Handel's Giulio Cesare
and Ken Cazan in his St. Louis production of Mozart's Mitridate - chose the
modern Middle East as his main setting: the Sultan, a religious fanatic,
heads the party in power, Gomatz is a political prisoner and Allazim is a
professor who once taught both of them. The roles are doubled: singers in
robes sing Mozart's music, and actors in modern dress speak Mortimer's
drama. At the close, Mozart's Sultan releases Zaide, Gomatz and Allazim to
freedom while, on the other side of the stage, Mortimer's Sultan has the
trio executed.
Well, it's a having-it-both-ways idea, but it did not amount to much. In a
programme note, Mortimer wrote rather promisingly of a contrast between
dreams, such as can be sung about, and harsh prose reality. But his
political prose exchanges are trite and obvious, his modern characters
conventional cardboard. His Allazim's 'Battles are a sign of weakness, not
strength. If you let them go you'll prove yourself strong enough not to care
about dissidents . . . I could guarantee you an excellent press. Perhaps a
seat at the conference table' is a fair specimen. In the aftermath of a real
Gulf War, this tacking of contemporaneity to an 18th-century abduction drama
seemed glibly opportunist - and ill-matched to the emotions explored in the
score.
It was the 'unreal' figures - the singers animated by Mozart's music - who
came to life. Or would have come to life had they been better sung, had
Cincinnati been able to field less modest vocal resources. The Juilliard,
only a 1,000 seater, apparently intimate, but very wide and with dead
acoustics, is a trap into which the Bloomington troupe that brought Lo sposo
deluso to New York earlier this season also fell. And the actors lacked the
rhetorical force to quicken the melodramas. Malcolm Fraser produced. Jindong
Cai conducted, too blandly.
William Mann in his Mozart book says, 'Attempts to turn this fragment into a
viable theatrical musical experience cannot succeed . . . the best use to be
made of it is either by gramophone records or concert performances.' I
agree. I've not seen Paul Griffiths's The Jewel Box, which sounds
captivating. But John Mortimer's Zaide proves as unsatisfying as all the
earlier attempts to 'make something stageable' of Mozart's unfinished,
unfinishable Zaide, Oca del Cairo and Sposo deluso.

<TEXT>
Shostakovich's fourth symphony (Op. 43) is one of his biggest and most
brazen - the modernist excursion of 1936 which he did not dare have
performed once Stalin had condemned the 1932 opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk
for formalism, and which was succeeded by 'the Soviet Artist's Practical
Creative Reply to Just Criticism' in the form of the world-beating fifth
symphony. It was not until 1961 that it was deemed safe in the USSR to give
the fourth its premiere; and experiencing the cataclysmic climaxes, grinding
dissonances and moments of pure weirdness in Jeffrey Tate's splendid account
of the work with the London Symphony Orchestra on Sunday night one could
hear why.
It is a huge structure - a central quasi-scherzo flanked by movements
lasting each some 25 minutes - scored for a huge orchestra and dealing in
bold ideas. As if anticipating Penderecki's early manner, Shostakovich
creates a dialectic of sheer sonority. The presto fugal passage for the
strings in the first movement generates a sonorous energy that goes far
beyond the needs of any conventional thematic argument - or it did in the
LSO's rendering at any rate. Likewise, the thick chorus of woodwinds early
in the second movement began to conjure up the music of Ligeti; while the
outbreak of dry ironic percussion, dominated by unlikely castanets, with
which the movement comes to its sudden stop evoked for all the world the
later loopier Tippett.
Tate well brought out this movement's strange quality of tragic insouciance,
and elsewhere, variously, the bitter-sweet naughtiness of fugues and
waltzes, the painful stridency, the note of desolation, and all the
characteristic expressive elements which no criticism ever compelled
Shostakovich to alter. The climaxes were admirably judged, even if the last
of them taxed the Barbican's acoustics. Admirable too were the numerous
solos for instruments or sections: Ian Bousfield's trombone, Martin Gatt's
bassoon, the piccolo section, the two frenetic timpanists, the
celesta-player who inscrutably signs the work off.
Gatt and three of his fellow principals composed the solo quartet in
Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante in E flat, K. 297b, for oboe (Roy Carter),
clarinet (Andrew Marriner), horn (Hugh Seenan) and bassoon which filled the
first half. A work of doubtful authenticity, it rarely fails to make a
tedious impression, but the stylish virtuosity of these players did much to
sustain interest.

Hall

<TEXT>
A decade of war and revolution is the subject of this year's arts events in
'Towards the Millennium'. The festival, which is surveying the cultural
legacy of the 20th century on an annual basis up to the year 2000, is
presently engaged on the decade 1911-1920. When concerts are arranged by
chronology in this fashion, it is fascinating to reflect on how posterity
has selected what it wants to hear. For there is a clear dividing-line. The
orchestral concerts, being given by Simon Rattle and the CBSO, include a
good proportion of present-day favourites; while the smaller-scale events
feature music that is still liable to be looked upon as new and difficult.
There was certainly nothing to frighten people away from Friday's concert,
although even the lure of Rattle and his orchestra in a programme for which
they are superbly well equipped had not succeeded in drawing a full house. A
pity, as the invigorating opening of Nielsen's Third Symphony announced that
the team was on good form. Their performances of the big showpieces from
this period are rarely flashy: the musicians rather give the impression of
having worked assiduously with their Music Director and produce accounts of
each score that are musically penetrating, exciting where appropriate, but
never in a superficial way.
It would be quite possible, for example, to find a performance of Ravel's
Daphnis et Chloe that gave a more scintillating expose of precise sounds or
an uninhibited display of orchestral muscle. What would be difficult is to
equal Rattle's expressiveness and feeling for atmosphere - a heady
sensuality, often seducing the ear with ravishing quietness on the part of
the CBSO musicians and Chorus.
There was some exquisite playing in the evening's novelty, too. This was
Szymanowski's Songs of a Fairy-tale Princess, three miniatures in which a
high soprano floats away on stratospheric cadenzas over lush and exotic
tinkling from celesta and piano, a sound-world shamelessly borrowed from
Stravinsky's opera Le Rossignol. Eileen Hulse was the effortless soloist and
Rattle the chivalrous accompanist who let her every phrase be heard.

FT  17 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: No tax relief on magical loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ENSIGN TANKERS (LEASING) LTD v STOKES House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel,
Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Templeman, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord
Jauncey of Tullichettle): March 12 1992
A PARTNERSHIP which enters into a tax avoidance scheme, with the object of
obtaining first year allowance for expenditure on plant, is entitled to
allowance in respect of that part of the transaction which can plainly be
identified as a trading transaction, but not for that part which has the
apparently magic result of creating a tax loss where there was no real loss.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Ensign Tankers
(Leasing) Ltd from a Court of Appeal decision (FT, February 6 1991) to refer
the case back to Inland Revenue Commissioners to weigh the fiscal and
non-fiscal elements of a transaction and to decide whether, having regard to
the parties' paramount motive, it was a device to secure a fiscal advantage
or was a genuine trading activity.
Section 41(1) of the Finance Act 1971 provides: ' . . . where (a) a person
carrying on a trade incurs capital expenditure on . . . plant . . . for the
purposes of the trade, and (b) . . . the . . . plant belongs to him at some
time during the chargeable period . . . there shall be made to him an
allowance . . . (referred to as a first year allowance) . . .'
LORD TEMPLEMAN said that in March 1980 Lorimar Productions Incorporated
(LPI), a Californian company, embarked on production of a film called Escape
to Victory.
Guinness Mahon, a merchant bank specialising in tax avoidance schemes,
persuaded Ensign and four other British companies to participate in a scheme
whereby they would contribute Dollars 3.25m to the cost of the film in
return for 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts.
The scheme was a single composite transaction embodied in 17 documents, all
of which were dated July 14 1980.
Under the scheme a partnership agreement was made between Victory Film
Productions Ltd as general partner and the five British companies as limited
partners. Victory was a wholly owned subsidiary of LPI.
The partnership's capital was Dollars 3.25m contributed by the limited
partners, including Dollars 2.378m contributed by Ensign. Management was in
the hands of Victory.
The partnership was granted worldwide exploitation rights by LPI, which was
to make the film in Hungary, and transferred them to two distributors who
were LPI subsidiaries. It put Pounds 3.25m into the production and borrowed
Pounds 10.75m from LPI towards production and completion. LPI was to have no
recourse against it for repayment.
The distributors were to pay LPI 75 per cent of the exploitation receipts,
and to pay the partnership 25 per cent up to Pounds 3.25m; then 100 per cent
to LPI up to the cost of its loans; and then 25 per cent to the partnership,
75 per cent to be retained by the distributors.
The cost of the film was Dollars 14m, and was borne as to Dollars 3.25m by
the partnership and as to Dollars 10.75m by LPI.
In the tax year 1980 to 1981 the partnership incurred capital expenditure of
Dollars 3.25m in the provision of 'plant', namely the film. The negative
belonged to the partnership, subject to the distributors' exclusive
exploitation rights. It also owned 25 per cent of the exploitation receipts.
The partnership therefore fulfilled the conditions necessary to generate a
first year allowance of Dollars 3.25m under section 41 of the Finance Act
1971, provided the expenditure was incurred 'for the purposes of the trade'.
By section 155 of the Corporation Taxes Act 1970, the benefit of any first
year allowance generated by the partnership accrued to Ensign and the four
British partners in the proportions in which they contributed to its
capital. Ensign, having contributed Dollars 2.375m, was entitled to first
year allowance of Dollars 2.375m.
Ensign claimed the partnership had generated a first year allowance of
Dollars 14m, being the total cost of the film.
That was rejected by the commissioners on the ground that the partnership
was not carrying on a trade but was carrying out a device to avoid tax.
Mr Justice Millett disagreed and decided that the partnership's activities
constituted the trade of making and exploiting films. He decided it had
incurred Dollars 14m capital expenditure for the purpose of section 41 of
the 1971 Act (FT, July 28 1989).
The Court of Appeal reversed his decision, but referred the dispute back to
the commissioners to decide whether the partnership was or was not trading.
Ensign now appealed and asked for Mr Justice Millett's order to be restored.
The parties agreed that the 17 documents of July 14 were interdependent, and
constituted one single composite transaction, which was a tax avoidance
scheme and must be read as a whole.
The non-recourse nature of the borrowing ensured that LPI paid the whole
cost of the film exceeding Dollars 3.25m, and that the partnership would not
be liable for the cost in excess of Dollars 3.25m.
The scheme involved exploitation of British capital allowances for the
making of a foreign film.
Mr Gardiner submitted that a taxpayer might enter into any transaction in
any form he pleased, and the court was confined to that form and could not
consider the substance of the transaction.
The Revenue appeared to look upon tax avoidance as a corporate cancer which
infected and destroyed any fiscal effect advantageous to the taxpayer.
In Ramsay v IRC (1979) 1 WLR 973,979,328 where the taxpayer entered into
transactions to match an allowable loss against a non-chargeable gain, a
claim for capital gains tax was disallowed because 'the true view, regarding
the scheme as a whole, was to find that there was neither gain nor loss'.
In the present case the true view, reading the scheme as a whole, was that
the partnership expended Dollars 3.25m.
In Ramsay Lord Fraser referred to the 'apparently magic' result of creating
a tax loss that was not a real loss.
The present scheme had the apparently magic result of creating for tax
purposes an expenditure of Dollars 14m, while incurring a real expenditure
of only Dollars 3.25m. The additional Dollars 10.75m was really incurred by
LPI.
The commissioners felt bound to ignore beneficial fiscal consequences
because the paramount object of the scheme was fiscal. In the Court of
Appeal Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C said if the 'sole' object was fiscal
advantage, it was not a trading transaction.
The principles of Ramsay and subsequent cases did not compel or authorise
the court to disregard all the fiscal consequences of a single composite
transaction read as a whole, on the ground that it appeared the transaction
was a tax avoidance scheme.
Neither the commissioners nor the courts were competent to decide whether
there was a sole object or paramount intention to obtain a fiscal advantage,
nor to weigh fiscal intentions against non-fiscal elements.
The commissioners' task was to find the facts and to apply the law. The
facts were undisputed and the law was clear.
The partnership expended Dollars 3.25m capital for the purpose of producing
and exploiting a commercial film. That was a trading activity. Expenditure
for that purpose was a trading purpose. By section 41 of the 1971 Act,
capital expenditure for a trading purpose generated first year allowance.
The section was not concerned with the purpose of the transaction, but with
the purpose of the expenditure.
The principles of Ramsay and subsequent authorities did not apply to the
Dollars 3.25m, because that was real and not magical expenditure by the
partnership.
A trading transaction could plainly be identified and could have resulted in
either a profit or a loss.
The expenditure was real. The receipts were real. The partnership was
entitled to a first year allowance equal to the expenditure. The receipts
imposed on the partnership a corporation tax liability.
The apeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed.
For Ensign: John Gardiner QC and Jonathan Peacock (Belmont &amp; Lowe, agents
for Hugh James Jones &amp; Jenkins, Cardiff).
For the Crown: Christopher McCall QC and Launcelot Henderson (Inland Revenue
solicitor).

FT  17 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When a buy-out becomes a
sell-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is widely acknowledged that managers need professional advice when
planning a buy-out, but less often realised that the vendor may also need
specialist help.
The directors of large, publicly quoted companies are no less prone to
putting unrealistic values on businesses for sale than the owners of private
companies.
One listed company gave a buy-out team permission to raise finance, provided
their offer was at least Pounds 9m.
Three months later, when the buy-out team made an offer of just Pounds 5.2m,
the vendor belatedly decided to appoint a corporate finance adviser.
The adviser's research showed that Pounds 9m was not a realistic sum for
either a buy-out or even a trade buyer. If the company had taken advice at
the outset, it would have rejected the request to prepare a buy-out. The
business was ultimately sold to a trade buyer for Pounds 6.3m.
This is just one of the pitfalls which can trap the unwary vendor, not used
to the rules of the management buy-out market, says Barrie Pearson, managing
director of Livingston Fisher, a London-based acquisitions consultancy.
Most buy-out teams are unable to match the price which can be offered by a
trade buyer, which may often be able to make substantial savings by merging
the newly-acquired business with an existing operation. There may, however,
be particular circumstances, such as low profits, which make a buy-out the
only realistic option.
To find out which type of sale will achieve the best price, vendors must
research a short-list of potential domestic and overseas buyers.
If this reveals no interest, then the business can be offered to a buy-out
team on an exclusive basis and within an agreed timetable.
Trade buyers are often unwilling to make an offer if they know they are in
competition with a buy-out team. Even if there is no buy-out offer, it may
be worth offering the management team a bonus to co-operate with the sale of
the business to another company.
Management teams may not be above using 'dirty tricks' to win, Pearson
warns. One vendor suspected that a management team leaked information to the
trade press suggesting it had nearly completed negotiations when they were,
in fact, at an early stage. The trade buyers all withdrew giving the
managers a clear field.
Vendors should also beware of acting solely on the basis of an oral offer
from a potential buyer. One company suspended negotiations with possible
trade buyers after the managers made an offer. But the company did not check
which institution was to provide the finance and whether the offer had its
backing. The institution's valuation was much lower than the buy-out team's
offer and talks had to be restarted with the trade buyers.
For a buy-out to succeed, the business involved must be self-contained. An
electronics subsidiary which was up for sale paid a management charge for
the use of the services of group sales offices, the staff of which were
employed by the parent company. The financial backers of the buy-out
objected at a late stage in the negotiations that the electronics company
would not be independent if it still relied on its former parent company's
sales force.
Equally, if a company makes a large part of its sales to other group
companies, it runs the risk of losing these markets once it is independent.
This may deter financial backers from supporting a buy-out.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Technology: Game of cards - Link keeps IT close to its chest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A team of tired volunteers with plastic cards in their hands ventured out
into UK high streets in the small hours of a winter's morning in 1987. At
5am they took up their positions at cashpoint machines throughout the
country and prepared to take out cash.
At the headquarters of Link, the cashpoint company that unites 34 banks and
building societies, operators watched their screens for the first test
transactions, which would signal the addition of Co-operative Bank to the
network.
But things did not go according to plan. Seconds before the first
transaction was due, an early-rising member of the public, keen to try out
his new card, beat the official swipers to the draw. 'We were surprised and
pleased,' says Trevor Jenkins, general manager of technology at Link
Interchange Network. 'It's good to be that much in demand.'
Since the Link network started in 1986 with four main members and 14 smaller
ones, it has grown rapidly. A stream of banks and building societies joining
the network has taken the total of automated teller machines (ATMs) to more
than 5,500, boosted in 1989 by a merger with Matrix, a rival UK network.
Last year, despite the recession, Link handled about 45 per cent more
transactions than in 1990.
Such rapid growth has forced Link to reconsider the computer and
telecommunications technology that underpins its business. When the network
started, Link brought in British Telecommunications to run the technical
side. 'At the time it was the right choice to help us set up the network,'
says Jenkins.
But five years later, Link came of age. Last summer, in a move that bucked
the trend for companies to contract out their computing to facilities
management (FM) suppliers, Link brought the whole operation in-house at a
cost of Pounds 7.5m.
It moved its headquarters and the hub of the network away from BT in London
to a new centre in Harrogate, West Yorkshire and installed the lastest
computer hardware from Tandem, the US supplier of fault-tolerant computers.
At the same time it set up a duplicate site in Leeds for disaster recovery
and established a new telecommunications infrastructure between Link and its
members, many of whom are also in Yorkshire. It recruited 20 staff to run
the system.
First among its reasons was the fundamental role of technology in Link's
business.
Being non-profit making, Link has no ATMs of its own. But it connects those
of its members through a central electronic switch. This allows Abbey
National card holders, for example, to withdraw cash from a Nationwide ATM,
or a Girobank account holder to get a bank balance from a Leeds Permanent
machine. Up to 40 transactions a second cross between the institutions
through Link's central computer running a software package called Connex
from Deluxe Data Systems of the US.
'This switch is our core business,' says Jenkins. 'We only have this one
application. Our whole reason for being here is to do ATM switching.'
Bringing control in house has simplified matters and shortened the chains of
command. Link computer operators now talk directly to their counterparts at
all the Link institutions. They also deal directly with the hardware and
software suppliers which used to be subcontractors to BT.
'We had a very close relationship with BT in the early days,' says Jenkins.
'Then the relationship became more formal and we were finding ourselves more
remote from what was happening. As you go on, contracts tend to become more
formalised, less flexible and it's more difficult to introduce changes.'
Link calculates that it is running the switch more cheaply than BT did. The
move in house was conceived as a five-year project and Link expects it will
have more than recouped its investment at the end of that time. Later this
year it plans to cut by one or two pence the fee that its members pay each
time a transaction goes through the switch.
Link board, comprising 23 representatives from the member institutions,
voted to bring the computing in house. But before this Link was already
considering setting up a second switch to use in the event of a disaster at
the first.
'Our service has become critical to the institutions and we were under more
and more pressure to provide disaster recovery,' says Jenkins.
Disaster recovery is an expensive form of insurance which involves
duplicating the entire network - all the hardware, software and
telecommunications links. One way of lessening the cost is to share disaster
recovery with other companies on the basis that only one company is likely
to have a disaster at a time. Link considered sharing disaster recovery with
other BT clients.
'It turned out that BT couldn't offer that,' recalls Jenkins. 'They didn't
have anything to share, so they were looking at setting up a second site for
us. But we realised the costs were going to be much the same whether we did
it or BT did it. And then our thinking moved on - if we were going to set up
a disaster site, then perhaps we could run the primary system ourselves as
well.'
Now with two sites of its own, and one of them used only for testing and
development, Link is itself considering offering a disaster recovery service
to other companies.
But this is long term. In the meantime it wants to stretch the Harrogate
centre to its full potential. The new Tandem Cyclone hardware installed
there more than doubles the power previously available. The Cyclone took
over the network from BT for two short tests last July. The third test in
August was so successful that Link decided not to hand the network back.
'The most dangerous part was actually transferring the system from one site
to the other - so, as everything was working well, it made sense to keep the
system,' says Jenkins.
Link is now looking at connections with European cashpoints. It already has
a gateway into Plus System, a big North American network. There is also room
left for growth in the UK, says Jenkins. Link wants more people to use their
cards in machines that do not belong to their own bank or building society.
The range of services could also be enlarged. At present, Link is the only
UK operator whose ATMs offer balance inquiries across a network of
institutions. Other services such as statement ordering and being able to
change a personal identification number are already offered by some
individual Link members in their private networks but are not carried across
Link's switch.
Long-term, the Link network could be used for far more than connecting
cashpoints. In theory it could pass any kind of electronic information
between Link's member banks. The institutions already use similar electronic
networks for direct debiting and clearing cheques, but Link has its eye on
other possible applications including the transmission of structured
documents from member to member using electronic data interchange.
'There's the potential for us to do that,' says Jenkins. 'But first we have
to find some data to exchange.'

FT  17 MAR 92 / Technology: Put designers in the driving seat - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

<TEXT>
Even while the mainstream UK motor industry was gazing happily into its cap
at last week's Budget largesse, politicians and government apparatchiks
began listening to another round of industry pleading.
This time it came from a much smaller and highly specialised sector; but one
which has been consistently successful and, in contrast to the rest of the
motor industry, operates an external trade surplus out of all proportion to
its size.
The setting for this encounter was the Motor Industry Research Association's
complex at Nuneaton, in Warwickshire. On Friday, government officials were
given a lecture on the UK's independent automotive engineering and design
sector, and why it deserves help from government.
The field now employs around 5,000 designers and engineers whose talents
lurk beneath the bodywork of a large number of cars from manufacturers more
likely to be based in Germany, Japan or South Korea than in Longbridge or
Luton. Though most have built strong technology bases, their culture still
remains intuitive.
This grade of talent has led British racing car designers and manufacturers
to dominate the motor sport industry. In the past decade or so, in the eyes
of many, UK designers and engineers have overtaken the Italians and are
mounting a strong challenge to the best the Germans have on offer. (Indeed,
if you could look down the employment roll of the design and engineering
departments of Opel, Volkswagen/Audi and Porsche, British workers would be
found in large numbers.)
Yet despite this, UK consultancies have consistently been better at
designing and engineering than at selling themselves. There are exceptions.
John Shute, chairman and founder of Worthing-based International Automotive
Design, gave high priority to becoming a master salesman, for example, in
taking his company from a Pounds 250,0000 turnover in the late 1970s to its
current status as a consultancy industry giant turning over many millions.
The fact remains, however, that the sector's seeming inability to talk
constructively within itself without prejudicing commercial confidentiality
has led to many missed opportunities.
Lots of plaudits, therefore, to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders (SMMT) in at last bringing the big companies together into a
cohesive body, formally entitled the Design Engineering Group, and
organising the Nuneaton meeting to tell politicians and senior civil
servants about it.
The teach-in was focused heavily on export prospects; not just for the
consultancy industry, but for the UK equipment, component and other supply
industries which stand to benefit from their efforts. For, as SMMT chief
executive Sir Hal Miller pointed out, the designers of new vehicles can
exert a significant influence on the eventual sourcing of tooling, component
supplies, test equipment and so on.
So what, specifically, does the industry want from Whitehall and
Westminster?
The shopping list is relatively modest: greater assistance through grants,
tax relief or soft loans for the capital investment which many of the
companies are making two or three times faster than much of the mainstream
motor industry.
The group would like greater official support, and better intelligence of
official UK missions to overseas territories. It would like to see more
flexible support in terms of the number of people qualifying for support on
such missions, and more missions - and return missions  - to more places.
Whichever government is in power after April 9, it should listen hard to a
strong case.

Teleworking is often viewed as a cottage industry carried out by women in
the middle of the Oxfordshire countryside or the Scottish highlands.
But working from home, using a PC linked by a phone line to the company head
office, is now practised by more than one in eight firms, according to a
survey carried out by the National Computing Centre (NCC) and the Which
Computer? Show.*
The main benefit of teleworking is increased productivity, say business
converts to the scheme. Nearly three quarters of companies employing
teleworkers cited it as one of the big benefits.
But increased productivity is often overlooked by companies that have not
taken the plunge. Only 43 per cent of those not employing teleworkers
foresaw this advantage.
Reduced costs also ranked high on the list of benefits according to
companies using teleworking. Surprisingly, says Bill Murray, head of the
communications and security division of NCC Consultancy, few companies that
practised teleworking found that there were hidden costs involved.
The other big advantage of teleworking is that it enables companies to
retain skilled staff - particularly in jobs related to the IT sector. The
most enthusiastic converts to teleworking among the 500 members of the NCC
which responded to the survey were companies in the IT field. However, the
most popular teleworking jobs were in sales, as well as those involving IT.
Companies in the south of England as well as those employing more than 1,000
staff also took to teleworking most enthusiastically.
The biggest disadvantage was the loss of face-to-face contact with staff.
The kind of people to benefit most from teleworking, says Murray, would be
'evolutionary, pro-active types'.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Costings assume saving on tax administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats sought to win credibility for their manifesto with a
supplement setting out full costings - including the higher taxes they would
charge. But they risked raising as many questions as they answered.
The party's central proposals for tax and benefits are intended to be
self-financing. They are separate from the Pounds 4bn emergency investment
programme planned by the party which would be funded by abolishing the new
20p income tax band and increasing borrowing by Pounds 2bn. The extra 1p on
income tax would then fund an extra Pounds 2bn spending on education.
In the first year, the gross cost of the party's benefit proposals is shown
as Pounds 4.3bn.
No breakdown is supplied but it includes increases of Pounds 5 a week in a
single person's pension and Pounds 8 a week for a pensioner couple, plus a
rise of Pounds 1 a week in child benefit, together with the abolition of the
20 per cent minimum poll tax contribution.
Offsetting this will be an expected Pounds 4.4bn raised from a integrated
tax, national insurance and benefit system.
Like Labour, the party would end the ceiling on National Insurance
contributions (NICs), but it claims its tax proposals would be less harsh on
middle-earners.
Income tax rates would start at 35 per cent (a 26p basic rate plus 9 per
cent NICs). For earnings above Pounds 33,000 there will be a combined rate
of 42 per cent, and on earnings of about Pounds 50,000 there would be a 50
per cent rate.
However, the costings also assume a saving on administering the new tax
scheme of Pounds 400m in the first year, largely from ending the need to
collect the 20 per cent minimum poll tax.
The figure appears highly ambitious given the complexities which would be
involved in integrating Britain's tax and social security systems.
At the same time, the cost of the party's promise to provide a 'citizen's
income' is not included in the manifesto supplement. While party officials
said it would not be introduced until the sixth year of a Liberal Democrat
government, a delay is not mentioned in the manifesto itself.
The party's costings show the public sector borrowing requirement rising in
real terms for two years under the Liberal Democrat programme but then
falling at a faster rate than envisaged by the Tories.
That assumes the planned programme of public works can be successfully
halted after two years.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pledge on Scottish Gas and Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats would create a Scottish Telecom and Scottish Gas by
breaking up the privatised monopolies if they were elected.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the move would be
part of a pledge to stimulate competition included in the manifesto launched
yesterday. The new Scottish utility companies would not involve
re-nationalisation. Shareholders had been given adequate warning. 'The
prospectus made it quite clear the Liberal Democrats were committed to
breaking up British Gas,' Mr Bruce declared.
Parts of British Steel would be transferred to Scottish ownership. The
manifesto mentions development of a site at Hunterston, which it says has
the potential to be a centre for an integrated Scottish steel industry.
Home rule for Scotland is a central issue in the manifesto, though Mr Bruce
stressed Scottish voters would be paying attention to questions affecting
the whole UK. The Liberal Democrat proposals for home rule were part of a
thorough reform of the political system, and so would guarantee fair
representation for Scotland. Other proposals include a Scottish ministry of
justice and a Scottish environmental protection agency.

PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh Nationalist party, began its election campaign with a
call for extra help for small businesses in Wales, Anthony Moreton writes.
Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, MP for the Isle of Anglesey in the last parliament, said
the most important economic benefit for the Welsh economy would be the end
of the uniform business rate.
'Many small businesses in Wales have been destroyed by introduction of the
uniform business rate in 1989. Its arrival saw a massive hike in bills, the
final straw for many small shops in our towns.'
Mr Wyn Jones called for the Welsh Development Agency and the Development
Board for Rural Wales to be given more money to spend on small companies, as
well as the setting up of 'advice' shops to help smaller businesses with
finance and accounting.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tory attack focuses on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday launched a wholesale onslaught on Labour's
shadow Budget with an attack on the plans to end the concession for people
opting out of the state earning-related pension scheme (Serps). It was
denounced as a retrospective penalty on the 4 1/2 m people who had taken out
personal pensions.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, leading a team of cabinet ministers
attacking Labour's initiative, condemned the proposals as 'a shadow Budget
in more than name'.
He called the increased investment allowance 'the first invisible kick-start
ever', as it was not mentioned as a cost in 1993-94, and said that while the
proposals attributed no cost to the phased release of local authority
capital receipts, these would add to government borrowing.
The specific charges came within a broad campaign assault on Labour's plans
which would, the Conservatives said, leave everyone worse off because
interest rates would rise, the housing market would be devastated, and the
tax bills of 'all those on whom we depend to help this country out of
recession' would rise sharply.
In their general attack on the impact of Labour's economic policies, the
Tories highlighted the finding of the Financial Times/Mori poll of
board-level executives in yesterday's FT, which said a quarter of
respondents suggested that their companies might reduce their investment
spending if Labour were elected.
'So much for the proposition that Labour would lead to higher investment,'
said Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman. Mr Tony Newton, the social
security secretary, underlined the impact of the Serps change on young
people, saying that more than half of personal pension contract holders were
under 30 years old. 'Within less than one month the basis of all 4 1/2 m
personal pensions will be wrecked,' he added.
Labour responded that it had consistently made clear its opposition to the
concession, and had said it would be ended. Though it would be preventing
people from receiving the final year's benefit of the five-year arrangement
running from 1988, it would not be taking away what people had already
received.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, targeted Labour's spending
plans, saying they would not produce any public benefit.
He said that the extra Pounds 1bn for the health service, for example, would
not go on patient care but on introducing the minimum wage, ending
compulsory competitive tendering and bringing in a Pounds 100m no-fault
compensation scheme.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Package outlines recovery policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party said: 'Our proposals are in two parts. First, a package of
tax and benefit changes that are self-financing. Second, a set of measures
for strengthening the economy and public services.
Removal of the National Insurance contribution ceiling. Employees earning
less than Pounds 405 per week (Pounds 21,060 per year) pay National
Insurance contributions (NICs) on all of their earnings, while above that
level of earnings no NICs are paid at all. This is an unfair anomaly in our
tax structure. The ceiling on contributions will be abolished.
Abolishing the National Insurance entry fee. The 2 per cent contribution on
earnings under Pounds 54 a week - effectively a Pounds 56 entry fee into the
National Insurance system - will be abolished.
We propose no changes to the National Insurance system for the
self-employed.
Reform of income tax personal allowances. The personal allowance will be
increased by Pounds 330 per year, (10 per cent), or Pounds 180 per year
above statutory indexation. As a result 740,000 taxpayers will be taken out
of income tax altogether.
Married couples will have the option of splitting the married couples'
allowance between them as they choose.
Tax rates:
The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged
The 40 per cent rate will remain unchanged
A new top rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to individuals with an
income of at least Pounds 40,000 (taxable income of Pounds 36,375, plus the
personal allowance of Pounds 3,625).
Treatment of benefits in kind. Following the principle introduced by the
Conservatives in last year's Budget, employers' National Insurance
contributions will be extended to all taxable benefits in kind.
Two per cent bribe for opting out of the state earnings-related pension
scheme, Serps. The 2 per cent incentive which is currently paid to encourage
people to opt out of Serps into money purchase, personal pension schemes
will be withdrawn for the financial year 1992-93.
Stamp duty on share transactions. The abolition of stamp duty on share
transactions will be postponed for a further year.
Relief for employer-provided childcare. The exemption of workplace nurseries
from tax as a benefit in kind will be extended to all forms of employer
assistance with childcare.
This package introduces a series of valuable reforms, abolishes a tax and
takes 740,000 taxpayers out of tax altogether. It also raises enough revenue
to cover the following measures:
Child benefit. Child benefit is currently paid at Pounds 9.65 per week for
the first child and Pounds 7.80 per week for all subsequent children. This
is less than its April 1987 level in real terms.
Child benefit will be restored to that level - Pounds 9.95 per week  - for
all children. This means higher child benefit for 12m children and is worth
Pounds 127.40 per year to a family with two children.
Basic state retirement pension. The basic retirement pension will be
increased by Pounds 5 a week for a single person and Pounds 8 for a married
couple. This will be paid on top of the annual increase for 1992, and will
not lated benefits received by pensioners. People on benefits linked by
statute to the level of the basic pension, such as widows and those on
invalidity benefit, will also receive the increase. Overall, these changes
will benefit 12m people.
Investment in recovery and the future. In a full year there will be Pounds
3.5bn available for investment in health, education and the other vital
public services. There will be an immediate implementation of a Pounds 1.1bn
recovery programme.
For the period which includes the remainder of this financial year, 1992-93,
and the first full year of the Labour government, 1993-94, there will be of
the order of Pounds 5.4bn additional resources available for the investment
which Britain needs.
The recovery programme will consist of:
Manufacturing investment initiative. This consists of enhanced first-year
capital allowances for additional investment in plant and machinery and in
innovation and design to run for a specific period. It will encourage an
investment-led recovery.
Package to help business. Small firms and others have suffered severely from
the Major recession. We will introduce measures to help tackle the problems
of small firms and to boost investment throughout industry.
A programme for skills. This consists of creating a new skills fund, Skills
for the 1990s as well as restoring cuts in Employment Training and Youth
Training.
Work for the unemployed. We propose a radical new employment programme that
for the first time shifts the focus from curing long-term unemployment to
preventing it from happening at all. This job experience programme will
promote work of benefit to the community as well as helping the unemployed.
Training will be available to those on the programme, and people on it will
be paid a 'rate for the job'.
A boost for housing. Getting housebuilding going again will have a powerful
employment effect in the construction industries as well as starting to meet
desperate housing needs. We will begin the phased release of capital
receipts held by local authorities from the sale of council houses to
achieve this.
Transport. We will immediately allow British Rail to proceed with a pilot
leasing scheme to renovate the rol-ling stock on the North Kent line.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR member of Japan's leading opposition party, the Social Democrats,
has offered to leave the party after admitting he received funds from Tokyo
Sagawa Kyubin, the transport company involved in a widening political
scandal.
Mr Ryoichi Yasutsune insisted, however, that he would stay in parliament as
a pro-opposition independent, despite the pleas of his party leaders that he
should also resign as a member of the upper house.
The controversy over Mr Yasutsune's Sagawa Kyubin links has undermined the
opposition's attempts to highlight government corruption as an issue in a
forthcoming upper house election, and has eased pressure on Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the prime minister, whose administration has also been shaken by
scandal.
Mr Yasutsune admitted that he received a Y5m (Pounds 22,000) loan from a
Tokyo Sagawa affiliate in 1989, but claims to have since repaid the money
and denies allegations that his often sharp questioning of the company's
affairs was blunted after he received the funds.
'Although I am innocent, I will leave the party for causing trouble,' Mr
Yasutsune said, after a meeting with party elders. He said that to leave
parliament 'would mean that I admit that I had done something wrong'.
Last week, a left-wing member of the Social Democratic Party resigned after
admitting that he had received political donations from a golf course
developer under investigation for alleged links to drug imports.

FT  17 MAR 92 / World Pharmaceutical Conference: More concentration in drugs
industry seen as inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER concentration of the world's pharmaceutical industry is inevitable,
according to Professor Horst Meyer, head of pharmaceuticals at Bayer, the
German chemicals group.
The need for substantial investment in research and development required to
discover 'block-buster' drugs with sales of more than Dollars 500m a year
was beyond the means of all but the largest companies, he explained
yesterday at the Financial Times World Pharmaceuticals Conference in London.
The top ten companies were spending 35 per cent of all money dedicated to
pharmaceutical research and development and the proportion was likely to
increase, he said.
In addition, smaller companies were handicapped by their inability to market
drugs in the the three largest markets - the US, Europe and Japan. The top
pharmaceutical groups were able to recover their ever-larger investments by
selling the drugs in all three areas, added Professor Meyer.
However, Mr Bernard Taylor, executive chairman of Medeva, the small UK
pharmaceuticals group, said companies with sales of less than Pounds 1bn a
year only lacked critical mass if they had ambitions to invest substantial
amounts in research and development.
Mr Taylor said there was plenty of room for small and medium-sized companies
willing to market products whose sales were too low for the larger groups.
The smaller companies could invest in higher-margin products such as
vaccines where the barriers to entry remained high.
Alternative products available to such groups included drugs with
complicated delivery systems which were difficult to copy and
pharmaceuticals whose formulations could be enhanced with minimum additional
investment, he said.
Mr William Parfet, president of The Upjohn Company, the US healthcare
company, said winning groups would have to form effective strategic
alliances for access to essential technologies or to broaden their
geographic cover.
According to Dr Hakan Mogren, president and chief executive at Astra, the
Swedish company, pharmaceuticals groups would also have to concentrate their
research efforts in a limited number of fields if they wanted to be
successful.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Tokyo acts to halt rise in illegal Iranian immigrants
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has moved to stem illegal immigration by agreeing with Iran to suspend
a bilateral visa-exemption treaty that has been operating since 1974.
Under the treaty, Iranian tourists were permitted to visit Japan without a
visa. However, an increasing number of Iranians have been entering Japan as
tourists and staying in the country illegally to work. Demand for foreign
labour in Japan is high in the service and construction industries.
The foreign ministry said that Iranians entering Japan had nearly trebled
from 1989 to 1991, with 44,376 Iranians entering the country in the first 11
months of the year. At the same time, Japanese immigration officials were
refusing entry to an increasing number of Iranians who arrived in the
country. This came to 6,631 in the first 11 months of 1991, compared to
1,571 in all of 1990.
In December, Iran refused entry to Japanese in Tehran in retaliation for
Japan's deportation of illegal Iranian workers.
The visa-exemption treaty is a relic of Japan's attempts to promote close
relations with the oil exporting nations of the Middle East. The Foreign
Ministry said yesterday, however, that the agreement to suspend the treaty
would not affect other aspects of the bilateral relationship.

FT  17 MAR 92 / World fund managers phlegmatic about fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE, IAN RODGER and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ZURICH, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL analysts in London suggested that the Nikkei could fall another
5,000 points, although fund managers around the world were more phlegmatic.
In London, Mr Patrick Thompson, a director of Fleming Investment Management,
said that Fleming had hoped that the index could hold 20,000. 'But on the
day,' he said, 'domestic sentiment was completely shot.'
Mr Thompson thinks that, under 20,000 on the Nikkei, and certainly at 19,000
or below, Japanese equities will start looking cheap by their own historic
standards, and by reference to the domestic bond market.
However, he also thought that domestic buyers would need encouragement, in
the shape of further interest rate cuts and a greater degree of fiscal
stimulus than the economy has seen so far.
Mr Peter Widmer, director of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich responsible for
international institutional asset management, did think the market could go
lower: 'The drop below 20,000 will obviously have a short-term impact,' he
said. 'There could be a sell-off - perhaps 10 per cent  - leading to buying
opportunities.
Mr Widmer said Baer had about a third of the equity portion of its
portfolios in the Tokyo market at its peak, but that now it had virtually
nothing, expect for some lingering positions in Swiss franc convertibles.
'A lot of stocks have dropped by 60 to 70 per cent so we are actively
looking for jewels. Corporate results will be lousy, not only those
announced in the next month or so, but also in September.
Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company in the US, said that
it, too, did not have much to worry about.
Mr John Hickling, who manages Fidelity's international growth and income
fund, said: 'I've been very dramatically underweight in Japan for some time.
'A lower stock market would make Japan more interesting to us, but right now
it's a bit like catching a falling knife - sometimes it's safer to let it
stick in the ground than to catch it in mid-air."
Looking ahead, Mr Hickling expects a little weakness in the Japanese market
through March until funds start trading for settlement in April, when there
should be some sort of a bounce.

THE Indian government yesterday confirmed an important shift in foreign
policy when it told parliament that India would soon begin bilateral talks
with the US on nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia.
The first round of talks are due to be held in New Delhi in May when a US
delegation will explore the possibility of confidence building measures
between India and Pakistan aimed at making South Asia - where both countries
have a nuclear capability - a nuclear safe area. Possible measures could
include mutual inspection of nuclear facilities and troop redeployments
aimed at reducing border tensions.
A further sign of the new warmth of ties between India and the US was the
confirmation by Mr Eduardo Faleiro, minister of state for external affairs,
that the US and India would for the first time conduct joint naval
exercises. The exercises reflect the collapse of India's Treaty of
Friendship with the Soviet Union and the US's increasing coolness towards
Pakistan - formerly its closest ally in the region.
The shift in policy, which emerged publicly during the talks that Mr J N
Dixit, India's foreign secretary, held in Washington last week, provoked a
parliamentary uproar here with the opposition charging that the government
had caved in to US pressure.
The US has been pursuing non-proliferation in South Asia more vigorously
since the disclosure of Iraq's nuclear capability and the threat that the
Islamic republics within the former Soviet Union might also gain possession
of nuclear weapons.
Mr Faleiro repeated to parliament that India would not sign the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty - which India regards as discriminating in favour
of existing nuclear powers, including China. He also put into cold storage
the US proposal, backed by Pakistan, for a five nation conference on
regional non-proliferation. Participants would have been included Russia and
China - whom India regards now as having no role in this region.
India's counter-proposal for bilateral talks with the US on
non-proliferation makes a big advance from the rigidity that has governed
Indian nuclear policy for over a decade.

<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments (TI), the US semiconductor company, has signed
cross-licensing agreements with two Japanese companies that recognise TI's
claim to have invented the integrated circuit, a fundamental device in all
modern electronic equipment.
The agreements, with Sharp and Ricoh, represent an important step for TI
towards protecting hundreds of millions of dollars in patent rights in
Japan. They are particularly significant because they are the first such
agreements since a decision last summer by Fujitsu, the Japanese computer
company, to dispute TI's claim in the Japanese courts.
It had been feared that other companies would hesitate to recognise the
Texas Instruments patent until its dispute with Fujitsu had been resolved.
Texas Instruments said yesterday, however, that it was continuing to
negotiate licensing agreements with at least ten other electronics
companies, including Mitsubishi Electric, and that the negotiations appear
to have been unaffected by the Fujitsu dispute.
Seven Japanese companies have now accepted the Texas Instruments patent
claim, including Toshiba, Oki Electric, Matsushita, and NEC.
Texas Instruments first applied for a Japanese patent for the integrated
circuit in 1960, but struggled until 1989 before the 'Kilby' patent - named
after a co-inventor of the integrated circuit, Mr Jack Kilby - was accepted
by the Japan Patent Office.
Texas Instruments claims the patent covers fundamental technology that
applies to all integrated circuits, while Fujitsu claims its own
semiconductor devices do not use Texas Instruments technology.
Fujitsu last July sought a court determination that the Texas Instruments
patent does not apply to Fujitsu products. Seven court hearings have been
held to date, and final resolution is expected to take at least another
year. Texas Instruments hopes that recognition of its patent by other
Japanese companies will support its case.

FT  17 MAR 92 / UK shipyard to build two Oman warships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Vosper Thornycroft shipyard has been told to go ahead with
construction of two missile-carrying corvettes for Oman, in the first
significant foreign order for British warships for more than three years.
The deal, confirmed at the weekend after months of negotiation, is worth
more than Pounds 150m including support.
Details of the planned armament for the ships, due to be build over the next
four years, are being kept secret.
The 83-metre corvettes represent the UK's biggest naval export order since
Vosper Thornycroft received the go-ahead from Saudi Arabia in 1988 to build
the first three in a planned series of minehunters.
Mr Chris Girling, the group's finance director, said the Oman order would
not affect plans already under way for 350 redundancies at the yard. But he
said it would assist Vosper Thornycroft's competitiveness in other export
markets by enabling it to resume steel shipbuilding work in addition to
vessels made of glass-reinforced plastic.
In 1989, the Southampton-based shipbuilder was set to build three corvettes
of the same type for Brunei. But the Brunei government subsequently decided
to re-open the contract to international competition and has yet to invite
fresh bids.

Thailand has put air force units on alert and reinforced troops on the
border with Burma following incursions into Thai territory by Burmese
soldiers pursuing Karen guerrillas, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok.
Border skirmishes have been particularly intense in the last few days as the
Burmese military tries to overrun Karen strongholds before the rainy season.
Thai officers have rejected demands from their Burmese counterparts to
withdraw from the area, and the military-installed government in Bangkok,
which enjoys good relations with Burma, has shown no public sign of concern.
Further north, the Burmese army's capture of Sleeping Dog Hill at the
weekend could lead to the capture of the nearby Karen headquarters at
Manerplaw.

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S prime minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, has ruled out any unified
initiative by the Association of South East Asian Nations on Burma for that
country's widespread repression of its Moslem minority.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Goh said developments in Burma
could have a destabilising effect on the region but it was not Asean's style
to seek a common position on a particular political problem.
Several countries in Asean, which groups Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei, have expressed concern about Burma's
handling of its Moslem minority and the fate of thousands of Burmese Moslems
who have recently crossed the border into Bangladesh.
Mr Goh said each of these protests had been delivered individually. There
was no common approach within Asean to Burma.
Asked about the considerable arms build-up in south-east Asia recently, he
said this was not a response to US withdrawal from the area. 'Countries in
this region always have believed in what is called national resilience,'
said Mr Goh. 'They must have the capacity to defend themselves.'
Singapore has one of the best equipped military machines in south-east Asia
and spends more on defence per capita than any other country in the region.
'I always imagine Singapore as a very small state that any adventurer can
grab with one hand. If you want to prevent that happening you've got to take
defence seriously,' he said.
On domestic politics, Mr Goh said he would continue to try to offer
Singaporeans more choices and a less regulated society. 'We are trying to
widen the fairways,' he said.
He was opposed to Singapore importing any more foreign workers to try to
alleviate Singapore's serious labour shortage. The government says there are
about 150,000 foreign workers in Singapore, but unofficial estimates put the
figure at nearly double that. Most of them come from the Philippines,
Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST US unions have decided to stay uncommitted in today's Midwest
Democratic primaries in Michigan and Illinois, despite intense lobbying from
Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California, for their endorsement.
Twelve labour organisations which had previously supported Mr Tom Harkin,
the left-wing Iowa senator who pulled out of the race last Monday, met in
Washington last week to consider whom to back.
But Mr William Byland, president of the International Union of Electronic
Workers (UEW), said after the meeting that there was 'no chance of us
endorsing anyone' before today's primaries.
Some labour leaders are sympathetic towards Mr Brown, the only candidate to
oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which some unions
feel could endanger US jobs by encouraging companies to shift their
factories to Mexico.
However, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas has also won some union backing.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Midwest applies litmus test: Today's presidential primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Rust Belt, as the Midwest is often unkindly called, still matters in
American politics for one very simple reason. Enough people live here to
ensure that nobody is going to become president of the US without winning at
least a share of these states in the November general election.
No strategy based exclusively on the south or the far west, or even the two
combined, can have other than a faint hope of success.
For those seeking the Democratic party's nomination, especially for those
from other parts of the country, the Midwest is the litmus test of political
acceptability.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas
and former California governor Jerry Brown hail from the south, the
north-east and the west respectively and all, having won at home, need to
show they can score away. Here the audience does not view them as favourite
sons. It wants to know more about them.
It is also often said that the Midwest is the microcosm of America's current
problems. It contains ailing manufacturing industries, run-down inner cities
plagued by drug addiction, ethnic and racial strife, overstretched hospitals
and underfunded schools.
The reality may be better than the awful picture sometimes portrayed, but
nobody is claiming that an economic and social Garden of Eden has been
rediscovered on the shores of the Great Lakes.
So it is to Illinois and Michigan, which vote today, and to Ohio, Indiana
and Wisconsin, with later primaries, that the three Democrat contenders come
with hope - and trepidation. They can be made here as legitimate candidates,
or they can be broken. To a much lesser extent the same applies to the two
Republicans.
In reality, Illinois and especially Michigan must constitute Mr Patrick
Buchanan's last real stand to regain, as he puts it, 'the conservative heart
and soul of the Republican Party' from the apostasy of President George
Bush.
He could go on after losing badly here, even to California in June, but
increasingly people will stop listening. In Chicago the anecdotal evidence
is they already have.
The same risk attaches to Mr Tsongas on the Democratic side. There is a lot
of admiration for the honesty and directness of the Tsongas message. At
least he says the country must pay a price for its excesses.
But his relative lack of money and organisation seem to be underlining the
more widespread perception among Democrats that a Greek from Massachusetts,
who has already been hammered by Mr Clinton in the southern primaries,
simply cannot win in November. If political organisation means anything,
which it still does, though less than it used to, in these two states, Mr
Tsongas cannot be sanguine about the outcome today.
This does not apply to Mr Brown for two reasons: he is better known and he
can run on shoestring finances. Moreover, if there is inchoate rage out
there about the system, which there is, then Mr Brown, inveighing against
the establishment in all its forms, is actually the man who can tap it best.
He has, after all, literally nothing to lose and, to the disaffected, he
makes some kind of sense.
He can also wound and goad, as Mr Buchanan has President Bush. In the
television debate on Sunday night here, he launched an extraordinary,
vicious attack on Mr Clinton, waving a Washington Post in the air and
claiming that the governor of Arkansas and his wife, a prominent lawyer in
the state, had no sense of propriety.
Mr Clinton was patently outraged, especially by the onslaught on his wife,
and explained that, since he became governor, she had not shared in any of
the partnership proceeds that her law firm, the oldest west of the
Mississippi, had earned from its dealings with the state.
His defence was measured and perhaps the watching public, exhausted from a
day of wall-to-wall college basketball play-offs, will have concluded Mr
Brown overstepped the mark.
But the Brown point was to suggest yet again that for this, and other,
reasons, it is Mr Clinton who is genuinely unelectable against Mr Bush.
And this is why Illinois and Michigan matter most of all to Mr Clinton, over
and above the number of delegates he may win and the proof that can prosper
in primaries outside the south. He has to inspire confidence in his party
not only that his smoothly articulated policies make sense but also that he
is not a fatally flawed personal vessel.
It is improbable in the extreme that Mr Brown will be seen as a viable
alternative, and unlikely that Mr Tsongas will, regardless of how both do
today. But anything less than a solid endorsement of the governor of
Arkansas will encourage the growth of the ABC (anybody but Clinton) movement
inside the Democratic party.

FT  17 MAR 92 / USSR diehards challenge Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 5,000 troops are being drafted in to guard the Kremlin today as the
authorities take extraordinary precautions to preserve the peace at
demonstrations planned by communist and nationalist forces in the centre of
Moscow.
Organisers of an extraordinary session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies
of the USSR (photograph right) - dissolved last year shortly before the
Soviet Union itself was consigned to history's dustbin - are, meanwhile,
taking even more extraordinary precautions to disguise the venue.
The participants will gather early today outside the Moskva Hotel and drive
in coaches to a clandestine destination. One possible venue is the offices
of Pravda, the former main newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party which
suspended publication on Saturday due to debts.
The aim of the congress is to muster support for the recreation of the
Soviet Union - a state which the organisers say still exists because of the
continuing interdependence of its former republics.
The Russian and Moscow authorities are treating the demonstration and the
congress as dangerous manifestations amounting to possible attempts at an
overthrow of the government.
Mr Gavriil Popov, the Moscow mayor, has allowed the demonstration to take
place on the central Manezh Square provided it does not block the traffic.
But Mr Serghei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister of Russia, said the
demonstration and the session were 'a very serious matter', and warned of
possible violence.
So far, however, the organisers of the demonstrations appear to lack mass
followings, while the organising committee of the congress are distinguished
more by their paranoia than by their power.
They are charging the Russian authorities with being both repressive and
fearful of them.
Colonel Nikolai Petrushenko, who was once, with Colonel Victor Alksnis, one
of the feared 'black colonels' of the Soyuz group of USSR deputies,
complained yesterday that he had been reported to the police when he checked
into the Moskva Hotel.
Mrs Saji Umalatova, one of the main organisers, said heavy government
pressure had frightened off many who might otherwise have attended.
Mr Yuri Golik, a Russian deputy, gave the most optimistic asessment of
today's attendance when he said that 1,470 deputies - out of a former count
of 2,250 - had said they would attend, but 'we cannot tell how many will
actually arrive in Moscow'.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (14):
Battleground where giants contend - Software and computer services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE is the cockpit for the latest round in the battle of the information
technology giants - the struggle for a leading position in software and
computer services (SCS).
SCS is a heterogeneous sector, difficult to define and analyse. In Europe,
there may be as many as 16,000 small SCS companies as well as a small number
of large ones, not one of which has more than a few per cent of the market.
The sector comprises, however, five broad areas of activity.
First, there is consulting services, including the development and
management of IT strategy. The consulting arms of the large accounting
firms, Andersen Consulting, Price Waterhouse, Arthur Young and so on have
traditionally had a strong position in this area, as have the US management
consultancies McKinsey and CSC-Index.
Few European owned consulting firms have the global perspective and coverage
of these large players, nor have they the financial muscle to stay at the
forefront of research and development.
Second, processing services. Computer bureaux offering simple data
processing services to companies without their own computers are effectively
extinct, killed off by the growth of the microcomputer (although a few
companies have maintained a thriving business in payroll processing). Today
processing services encompasses sophisticated activities like facilities
management and data network management. Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France,
Sema Group of the UK/France and Electronic Data Systems of the US are among
the leaders.
Third, professional services. The traditional stamping ground for SCS
companies, this includes technical assistance, business software, industrial
software, training and education. The leaders include CGS, Sema Group of the
UK/France and Volmac of Holland.
Fourth, software packages. This area has always been dominated by US
companies; when mainframes were at theheart of the computer business,
financial packages from Management Science America and McCormack &amp; Dodge
were the principal competition to bespoke solutions written by European
companies. Now major US microcomputer software suppliers like Microsoft,
Lotus Development Corporation and Wordperfect have the lion's share of a
market in which few European companies have any presence.
Fifth, systems integration (SI). SI has many definitions, but essentially
means putting together the best mix of software and hardware to solve a
customer's IT problem. Large SI contracts are often let on a fixed price
basis and demand considerable expertise on the part of the computing
services company if costly delays and overruns are to be avoided.
SD-Scicon, a UK computing services company in which British Aerospace held a
stake, was sold last year to EDS of the US after more than a dozen fixed
price contracts slipped out of control leading to more than Pounds 20m in
losses.
According to Sema Consulting, a leading Anglo-French player in the SCS
sector, the European market is the world's second largest after the US with
sales estimated at Ecu85bn in 1995. Sema says: 'The European market is
expected to grow at 12 per cent from 1990 to 1995, much reduced from the
average annual growth rate of 24 per cent of the past five years.'
Sema says that systems integration and software packages have the highest
growth rate while professional services and software packages will account
for two thirds of the market by 1995. Computing services, nevertheless,
remains one of the few areas of growth in an industry hit by recession and
market saturation. That is why it is so important to so many different kinds
of player.
The large computer manufacturers, for example, are exanding their services
activities to compensate for declining profit margins on hardware. ICL, the
UK-based subsidiary of Fujitsu of Japan, now derives more than half its
revenues from services.
IBM is strengthening its activities in systems integration. Earlier this
month in the UK it announced it would set up a separate computing services
company with a staff of 1,500 to tackle facilities management and
consultancy.
There is a measure of scepticism among traditional SCS companies about these
moves on the part of hardware manufacturers; the fact remains that when IBM
expands into a market sector, everybody has to take its presence seriously.
These trends are contributing to the changes the SCS industry is going
through. The market is maturing, technological change shows no signs of
decelerating and there is a shift towards a more capital intensive industry
 -with the inevitable acceleration in the rate of mergers and acquisitions
as the principal players look for size to guarantee stability and survival.
Where are the European-owned players in all of this? Unlike the hardware
business, where Europe has little to offer, it has a range of skills in
software and services that are the equal of any. It has, however, few
companies with the size, finance and skills of EDS, the computer services
arm of General Motors.
An exception is Cap-Gemini-Sogeti, the largest SCS company in Europe with
annual sales of about FFr10bn. It has pursued an aggressive acquisition
policy at home and abroad with the intention of building a company with
strengths in France, the rest of Europe and North America.
To date, few European software houses have made much of an impact outside
their home countries. SAP of Germany is, however, having considerable
success providing integrated accounting software to large corporations who
are beginning to standardise world-wide on its product.
Microfocus of the UK continues successfully to sell software tools which
make it simpler to write programs in Cobol, the most common business
computer language.
There is, however, no real European challenger to the major US packages like
Microsoft's MS/DOS and Windows 3.0 or Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3
spreadsheet. And none is likely to appear unless the European Commission can
bring about a speedy harmonisation of national traits and practices. Europe
remains a collection of small, heterogeneous markets where software cannot
be moved easily from country to country.
European countries lack the skills in international marketing and
distribution necessary to succeed overseas, especially in the US. An
interesting test case is Sage Group of the UK, a successful supplier of low
cost accounting software in its home market, which has bought a somewhat
similar US company, DacEasy Inc, of Dallas, which has been selling its
accounting software internationally.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (13): A boost for
push-button power - Mobile phone calls will soon span the Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBILE telephones will soon become truly mobile. Within the next two years,
it should be possible to drive from Helsinki to Rome and use the same
handset anywhere along the route.
It is an impressive vision, although achieving it has taken rather longer
than was originally hoped. Fifteen countries signed the memorandum of
understanding in 1987 to set up the pan-European cellular communications
network, with a target of July 1991 for the launch of a service covering at
least each country's capital city. Problems with the technology, wrangles
between different manufacturers and other delays meant that by the end of
1991 only a handful of countries had anywhere near a functioning system.
'I think the original targets were a bit tongue-in-cheek,' says Mr Chris
Gent, managing director of Vodaphone, one of the UK's two cellular phone
operators. 'They needed to give people some sort of impetus, but the fact
that we have got as far as we have is quite an achievement.'
The aim of the initiative - called GSM, the Groupe Speciale Mobile  - was to
set up a standardised cellular network for the whole continent, run by
individual operators in each country.
Mobile phone users will be able to make and receive calls in any country in
the system. Their phone will register on the country's network when it is
switched on, and the network will record and regularly update its location
so that incoming calls are automatically rerouted.
System users' details will be recorded on a 'smart' card, the size of a
credit card, containing a microchip. When this is plugged into the slot in a
GSM phone, the phone will temporarily 'adopt' the user's number, and all
calls will automatically be billed to the card owner. This will allow users
to travel without their own phones, but use standard handsets fitted in hire
cars, for example.
In addition to standard facilities such as call hold, call transfer and
multi-party, a 'short message' service will allow messages of up to 160
characters to be sent to a subscriber and stored even when the phone is
turned off.
A cell broadcast facility will allow short messages - for example, warnings
of traffic delays or accidents - to be sent to all phones within a certain
geographical area.
Perhaps most importantly, the system will be fully digital, improving both
voice and data transmission.
Digital encryption also makes calls virtually invulnerable to interception,
making the system suitable for police and the military.
Fax and data transmission will be much faster than in existing systems at
9,600 bits per second, and as the system is digital modems will not be
required.
GSM is at last becoming a reality, although it seems unlikely that all these
features will be available before the end of 1994. And there are still some
teething problems.
While the technological challenges presented by the system itself have been
largely overcome, testing equipment to ensure products meet the system's
exacting standards is still being developed. For example, while Telecom
Finland and the UK's Vodaphone successfully tested the first sections of
their GSM systems last year, neither is able to sell any phones.
'It is,' as a telecoms expert put it, 'a bit like building a beautiful
motorway and there being no cars to run on it.'
To speed up the process, an interim testing standard has been adopted, less
exacting than the full specification, and testing equipment should be
available before the summer. This could mean, however, early subscribers to
GSM facing the possibility of having their equipment recalled if it fails to
pass the more stringent full tests later next year.
There are other possible disincentives. GSM phones will initially be much
more expensive in the UK - between Pounds 1,200 and Pounds 1,500 (Dollars
2,100 and Dollars 2,625), against the Pounds 200 to Pounds 400 paid for
existing analogue cellphones, although the difference in price will be less
in other countries where analogue phones are more expensive. They will also
be much bigger, and more than twice the weight.
Most operators are confident that economies of scale will allow for a swift
drop in prices, and that, having successfully developed suitable digital
hardware, manufacturers will now concentrate on miniaturisation. Mr Damien
Callaghan, a spokesman for Cellnet, Vodaphone's competitor in the UK market,
says: 'GSM is not a technology issue, it's a marketing issue. Initially our
salesmen face the challenge of selling something that is bigger, more
expensive, doesn't do as much, and can't be used in as many places as our
existing product. 'By 1994, however, we believe all that will have changed.'
Cellnet is introducing its own GSM service later this year. Vodaphone, whose
service was launched last December, says it expects to provide nationwide
coverage by the end of 1993.
Before that it plans to launch a second service on the back of GSM, which
could prove a blueprint for similar systems in Europe.
The Micro-Cellular Network, or MCN, will be a low-cost urban-based portable
telephone service aimed at domestic consumers.
Call charges are expected to be cheap, from only 10 pence (Dollars 0.17) a
minute within a user's home town, to 20 pence a minute for national calls.
If they occasionally roam further afield, MCN subscribers will be able to
access the nationwide and pan-European GSM service albeit at a premium rate.
Mr Gent believes the UK mobile communications market could be as large as 7m
by the end of the century, with the as yet untapped domestic market
accounting for half of this.
This venture and similar ones elsewhere in Europe will face competition for
the domestic market from Personal Communications Networks. These will
comprise pocket-sized phones using higher-frequency 1.8GHz (Gigahertz) radio
signals over shorter distances to link users to traditional telephone
exchanges via a system of relay stations.
Supporters argue that PCN has a number of advantages over GSM, including
smaller phones, and a greater network capacity as cells are smaller, and so
the same frequency spectrum can carry a greater volume of calls.
Three UK companies - Microtel, Unitel and Mercury communications  - are
developing PCNs, with the latter two having agreed to share much of the
infrastructure and already installing it.
On a Europe-wide basis, however, GSM remains the most important advance
since the development of cellular phones. It is also a catalyst which is
changing the way European telecommunications operate. Many countries are
using it to introduce competition to nationalised monopolies.
It looks likely to spread into eastern Europe, where, as demonstrated in
east Germany, cellular systems can be a cheap and effective way of
introducing a business communications system.
Whether it will go any further is doubtful. While Australia, New Zealand,
and some Middle Eastern and African countries have shown interest in GSM,
both the US and Japan have plumped for different standards.
The dream of a global mobile communications system remains some way off.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (11): Cries of
desperation - Hardware makers have never had it so bad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S top computer executives must be wondering if they made the right
career choice these days. There are seemingly precious few rewards for
staying in the hardware business. The European computer market has always
been tough.
Now a combination of the recession, increased competition from the US and
Asia and a resistance to buying more computer equipment among their
customers has stacked the deck resolutely against European-owned players.
A note of desperation is creeping in. In a grim note to his staff, Mr Carlo
de Benedetti, chairman and chief executive of the Italian Olivetti group,
outlines a new management structure, adding: 'I am firmly convinced that
this new organisation is the most appropriate for the difficult months
ahead, during which the survival of the company will be at stake.'
Some top computer executives have already decided to seek their rewards
elsewhere. Mr Arno Bohn, former marketing director of Nixdorf, the ailing
minicomputer manufacturer taken over by Siemens two years ago, left to
become chief executive of Porsche, the luxury car manufacturer.
Mr Vittorio Levi, a former Olivetti executive who became managing director
of Nokia Data, the personal computer manufacturer, left to take up a senior
post with the Italian fashion house Georgio Armani when the Finnish unit was
acquired by ICL of the UK.
The European landscape is considerably less populated than a few years ago.
Fujitsu of Japan acquired ICL which in turn acquired Nokia Data. Keinzle, a
minicomputer maker at one time owned by Mannesmann of Germany, was sold to
Digital Equipment (DEC) of the US. Last year DEC also acquired the
minicomputer interests of Philips of the Netherlands. Norsk Data remains
independent but is still losing money despite a dramatic shift in product
emphasis.
The world IT market is dominated by US suppliers although Japanese mainframe
suppliers are making an impressive showing.
But of the top 10 manufacturers, only three are European, 1990 statistics
demonstrate. Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany is in eighth place with a turnover
of Dollars 7.7bn, Olivetti is ninth with Dollars 6.4bn and Groupe Bull of
France 10th with Dollars 6.3bn. All three are currently losing money.
Siemens' computer operations had been making a modest profit, but the merger
with the hugely loss-making Nixdorf left it a legacy of unprofitability
which it will take time to shake off. To put Europe's troubles in
perspective, the computer industry is in trouble world wide. IBM, the
world's largest computer manufacturer, lost money last year after taking
substantial restructuring charges. Profitability has been much reduced at
the leading Japanese suppliers, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi.
Nevertheless, Europe's makers are becoming 'marginalised' according to the
French consultancy Idate which points out that in 1990 European-owned groups
accounted for only 13.9 per cent of the Dollars 278.5bn world IT market,
while consuming more than 35 per cent of the total. By comparison, in 1990
Japan accounted for almost a quarter of global production.
There are a number of reasons for Europe's relative weakness in computing.
Despite the advent of the single market, Europe remains a series of small
markets each with its own computer champion. Insular attitudes have meant
that although these companies collaborate in precompetitive research and in
transnational programmes such as the EC's Esprit, it has proved impossible
to persuade them to work together on a grand scale for the common good.
These days, in any case, the wisdom of such an approach is open to question.
Small, agile units able to respond quickly and flexibly to customer needs
would seem to have the advantage over centralised and monolithic
bureaucracies. IBM, for example, is trying to recreate itself in the form of
a series of smaller, specialised units each with profit and loss
responsibility.
Merger has become, in any event, an academic question for Europe's surviving
manufacturers. There is little talk any more of full blooded takeovers; the
aim is rather to form alliances with stronger partners able to help defray
research and development expenses and giving economies of scale in
production.
The European Commission, while anxious to help indigenous producers, has
turned its face against subsidies or other means of providing aid which
might be seen as anti-competitive. It is still considering whether French
government plans to pump millions of francs into Groupe Bull are acceptable.
It is, however, prepared to provide the impetus for what has become known as
the European Nervous System, a transnational computer network designed to
help to co-ordinate aspects of social policy throughout the community.
The options open to Europe's manufacturers are narrow and getting still
narrower. They are all heavily overstaffed and must lose people on a large
scale.
In the case of Olivetti, it required six weeks of negotiations to persuade
the Italian government and trade unions to agree to a cut of 1,500, far
short of the 2,200 the company was hoping for.
They must also look for niche markets which play to their strengths. Now
only IBM can hope to cover every area of the hardware business. Groupe Bull,
after a protracted discussion period, has signed a broad ranging alliance
with IBM giving it access to the US giant's expertise in reduced instruction
set computing (risc) as well as a market for portable computers from its
Zenith Data Systems subsidiary. IBM, in return, benefits from Bull's
expertise in multiprocessing and networking. The deal gives Bull
substantially more credibility in the marketplace. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull
chairman, is looking more relaxed than for many months.
Siemens and Nixdorf have yet to settle into a comfortable working
relationship. Broad cultural differences between the two companies are said
to be causing difficulties and delaying the synergies expected of the
merger. This is common in the computer business, where troubled mergers are
more common than successful ones. It took ICL years to paper over the joins
between English Electric, Ferranti Computers and other companies which went
into the making of the former British computer champion.
If there is a future for a European owned computer industry, it lies in
services rather than hardware. Siemens Nixdorf already derives 37 per cent
of its revenues from services, Olivetti 27 per cent and Bull 36 per cent.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (10): Many
flowers bloom - The changing face of world telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRANSFORMATION of telecommunications across Europe over the past few
years has presented tremendous and undeniable challenges to the users and
producers of information technology. Separating the trends from the shifting
fog of change is another matter, however.
Mr Richard Hooper, special adviser on the information industry to PA, the
consulting group, says sharply: 'I hate the word de-regulation. I don't
think it's happening.'
He says the experience over the last decade in the UK and the US - two of
the countries furthest down the process of change - is rather different.
There has certainly been a growth in 'liberalisation', with the injection of
a greater degree of competition into the sector.
But it has been accompanied by a growth in regulation. In the UK, for
example, there has been the creation of Oftel, the UK office of
telecommunications regulation.
As a result, Mr Hooper prefers to characterise the last 10 years as a time
of 're-regulation'.
'The key is how much competition do you permit,' he says. 'That is the
fundamental European issue. There is no doubt that we are seeing
competition. But the questions are where and how much.'
Terminology aside, he segments Europe very broadly into three categories on
a spectrum of liberalisation. The UK, in common with the US and Japan, has
overhauled telecoms more than most. The basic infrastructure itself has been
freed from public control, alongside more peripheral aspects of the service.
Pressures for further change in the UK nevertheless remain. Sprint, the US
company, has made it clear it is interested in operating within the UK, but
will insist on access to profitable international routes from which new
suppliers are currently barred.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, a telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the securities
house, says:
'The UK has gone quite a long way down the road but it has hesitated in
going the whole hog. If it allowed competition on international routes, the
rates would fall dramatically, BT would have to raise domestic rates,
Mercury's financial viability might be questioned, and it would lead to
political troubles.'
Germany and most of the north European countries, by contrast, hold an
intermediate position in Hooper's typology, with some restrictions removed.
Germany has not yet liberalised its network and voice systems, for example.
'Sooner or later there will be pressure for Germany to allow two suppliers
of telephony and infrastructure,' he says. He suggests that this will result
in a toughly-contested battle with the Bundespost, which will argue it needs
to be protected from competition, particularly after it has invested heavily
in improving communications in the states of the former communist east
Germany.
Overall, he says the northern countries 'noticed the British model and saw
that civilisation didn't end in the 1980s'. More controversially,
governments saw some evidence that prices had dropped as a result of
liberalisation.
Then, he says, it is possible to draw a clear line through Brussels.
Southwards, in the 'Latin countries', he sees a more traditional,
state-controlled service which is likely to change more slowly.
In France, for example, two 'sacred monopolies' remain: the infrastructure,
including the carriage of data and voice information; and the voice and
public switch equipment. These elements remain sacrosanct, he says.
That reflects both a traditional role of the French state in guiding
manufacturing policy, and a sense of social and democratic obligations: that
residential services should be cross-subsidised by more profitable national
and international business calls to ensure the availability of a
comprehensive and affordable phone service to everyone.
The UK has also gone further than most countries philosophically, he argues.
The Department of Trade and Industry has decided that fundamental questions
over the size of the market and how many players should be allowed should be
left to the private sector to determine.
In the case of telepoint, the portable phone system which allows out-going
calls from a lightweight handset held near one of a number of permanent base
stations, that has resulted in licences issued to four operators, three of
which are now dormant despite large expenditures on the installation of
equipment and recruitment of customers.
Hooper believes it is difficult to decide how far these fundamental issues
should be left to the market.
'It's not the same as making decisions about supermarkets,' he says. The
distinction is that telecoms involve the use of a scarce resource, and
involve what he calls 'the constraint of how many people want to dig up the
road outside'. 'Even the most liberal Americans would say that it was crazy
to go too far. You need some mechanism to help you decide,' he says.
The implications for the suppliers and users of information technology are
widespread but not clear-cut. Hooper sees 'a classic consolidation of the
industry' taking place. Research and development costs are forcing
collaborations.
He sees the number of equipment suppliers dropping as a result. A key
question is whether there will be a convergence between computer and telecom
suppliers.
Robert Fleming's views are similar. In a research report released this
February, it argues that Alcatel Alsthom, the market leader for public
communications networks, will survive because of both its size and its
geographical and product spread. (This was underlined last week by its
purchase of ITT's 30 per cent stake in its main telecoms subsidiary, Alcatel
NV.)
Siemens has some of the same advantages, but is heavily dependent on
Germany, and is likely to suffer as a result with pending de-regulation and
privatisation. Smaller suppliers such as Ericsson and Nokia are already
suffering cutbacks in delivery volumes. The future of two companies, and of
Ascom, an Ericsson licensee, is considerably more in question, Flemings
argues.
Liberalisation has certainly boosted the variety and types of equipment
manufactured. For users, it has meant very good news: there has been a huge
increase in the speed, variety and range of telecommunications services
provided. These include cable television, electronic document interchange
and video telephony, for instance.
On the one hand, the market has grown substantially in those countries which
have been opened up to competition. On the other, the pace of innovation and
the introduction of new competing businesses has also brought price
reductions and the demand for quicker delivery. 'In the golden old days,
there was a monopoly buyer, and long-term fixed-price contracts,' he says.
'Now it is much more complicated.'
Adds Heyworth: 'I don't think you could argue that liberalisation has
benefited IT equipment suppliers in the short term. It's more a matter of
what could happen in the long term. It is totally inevitable across Europe
that telecoms will become entirely competitive.'

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (12): Outsiders
in full command - Semiconductors lack a local hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE build up to a single unified market, concerns over non-European
supplies of semiconductors prompted calls to create a European industry
heavyweight champion.
But as the formation of a single market draws ever closer, the prospect of a
powerful European semiconductor group able to take on foreign competitors
has faded.
Even Thomson-CSF, the French electronics group which until the very end had
hoped for a merger of SGS Thomson, its semiconductor business, with those of
Siemens and Philips, was forced to admit that there was no European
champion.
Leading European manufacturers have been left to take their own initiatives
in regaining competitiveness.
Philips, the large Dutch electronics group, which was the only European
manufacturer in the the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers last
year, has put profitability at the top of its priorities.
After a substantial loss in 1990, Philips's semiconductor division managed
to record a profit last year, largely through cost-cutting measures.
The next step will be to draw up a viable commercial strategy for the
semiconductor business, which still depends heavily on internal demand from
companies within the Philips group.
A huge debt burden means that Philips does not have much financial leeway.
It withdrew, for example, from certain programmes in static random access
memory chips due to the excessive financial burden that those entailed.
Siemens, the German group which is soldiering on as the only European
manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMS), is looking to
its development agreement last summer with IBM to boost the flagging
fortunes of its semiconductor business.
The decision by Siemens to co-develop the next generation of silicon memory
chips - 16 megabit DRAMS  - with IBM was what, in the end, killed the idea
of a strong indigenous group to champion the European cause.
The IBM link is not, however, a short-term solution for Siemens.
The deal, in effect, allows the German group to acquire a much-needed
technology drive from IBM. But this is not without its costs. The group's
semiconductor division, which has not been profitable, received a large
injection of capital from the corporate side to cover Siemens's contribution
to the joint programme with IBM in DRAMS.
However, it will be some time before Siemens will be able to derive external
sales based on the 16-megabit technology it is developing through the IBM
link.
The market is just taking up 4-megabit DRAMS and will not be ready for
16-megabit technology for some time, says Mr Jim Eastlake, the senior
computer industry analyst at Dataquest Europe.
As for SGS-Thomson, the abandonment of the cause by other European groups
left it in a rather awkward position.
It remained for the French authorities, led by Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime
minister, to come up with an ambitious and highly interventionist plan,
announced at the end of last year, to secure the future of the group.
By bringing it under the control of CEA-Industrie, the profitable industrial
division of France's atomic energy commission, the scheme aims to provide a
stable financial environment that would allow the semiconductor group to
make crucial R&amp;D investments.
The French plan to create a national champion in technology is in sharp
contrast with the British approach as exemplified by the UK's GEC Plessey,
Europe's fourth largest semiconductor group.
GEC Plessey has had to stand on its own two feet and make money, a factor
which probably makes it more successful, Mr Eastlake says.
The group has opted to focus on specialist sectors, specifically on
application specific standard products. In terms of application specific ICs
(ASICS) GEC Plessey is approaching the top 10 worldwide.
These moves highlight the growing trend among European manufacturers to seek
their own solutions to problems many of which they share in common.
Meanwhile, Jessi, the joint European research effort in semiconductors, is
no longer the European flagship that it was meant to be.
This has not, however, ruled out collaboration between indigenous groups on
a smaller scale.
Last year, SGS-Thomson and GEC Plessey agreed to pool their resources in the
development of advanced semi-custom chips while the French group and Philips
have also signed a letter of intent to build a state- of-the-art chip plant
in Grenoble.
But as European manufacturers move ahead in their own efforts to regain
competitiveness, foreign manufacturers have also been stepping up their
activities within the EC.
Europe will consume Dollars 20.7bn of semiconductors in 1995, according to a
recent forecast by Dataquest. It is a highly attractive growth market.
Yet European manufacturers have only 35 per cent of their indigenous market,
compared with Japanese manufacturers' 85 per cent stake in their own
domestic market and 70 per cent of the US market held by American groups.
American manufacturers with plants in Europe may also start simultaneous
manufacture of more of their new products in Europe and the US.
Digital Equipment (DEC), for example, announced that it will start to
manufacture its new Alpha chips, powerful microprocessors theoretically
capable of processing 400m instructions per second, both in the US and at
its South Queensferry plant in Scotland.
Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have forged ahead with plans to set up
manufacturing plants in Europe.
While these moves could lead to foreign competitors increasing their share
of the European market, the trend has been for Japanese manufacturers to win
market share from the Americans rather than for both to take share from
indigenous players.
So, while the share of European companies may not rise dramatically, it is
not likely to fall much either but to remain stable at its present level.
Regional demand is dependent on regional strength in applications, says
Dataquest's Mr Eastlake. The main threat of American companies is in
computer applications, an area in which Europe does not have as strong a
demand base as in other areas.
European manufacturers have strength in communications, auto, industrial and
consumer applications where they will continue to see demand from their
European buyers.
The European semiconductor industry in the years ahead will continue to see
manufacturers from the leading industrialised regions co-exist as
competition for market share intensifies.
For the Europeans, the main question will be what strategy to adopt in
trying to regain competitiveness.
The relative success over the medium term of those groups which go for
profits first, exemplified by GEC Plessey and to some extent Philips,
compared with the groups that are guided by an interventionist, nationalist
stance, should provide a salutary lesson for European industrial policy not
only in electronics but in other areas as well.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (9): After the
big rush - The Japanese presence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT rush by Japanese electronics manufacturers to locate in Europe
prior to the creation of a single market has subsided now that most of the
leading companies are established in the region.
More than 120 facilities owned by Japanese electronics companies are in
Europe and these are likely to draw in further investments by medium-sized
component suppliers.
Contrary to popular belief, the main impetus behind the surge of Japanese
investment in Europe has not been the fear of a 'fortress Europe', although
that has been a concern, but the growing need felt by Japanese companies to
globalise their operations.
Japanese electronics companies see a strong need to be closer to their
markets to ascertain the specific needs of those markets as competition
intensifies in many of their product sectors.
There is also a clear assumption among Japanese companies that Europe is a
growth market, which will become increasingly important with the closer
integration of the Efta countries and Eastern Europe.
'The whole of the European block as a market is going to be in the next five
to 10 years even more important than the US, and Japanese companies want to
be sure to be here for that,' says an official at one Japanese electronics
manufacturer.
But there is a growing recognition among Japanese manufacturers that they
will have to do much more than settle down in Europe to enjoy the full
benefits of the unified market.
Some Japanese companies with a presence in Europe have discovered that a
base within the EC does not necessarily guarantee acceptance as a European
company.
When Fujitsu took control of ICL, the UK-based computer group, it was
embarrassed to see it excluded from the Joint European Submicron Silicon
Initiative (Jessi).
The Japanese companies' need to increase local content in Europe, to
transfer technology and base more of their R&amp;D activities there is more
widely recognised but these trends have has been slowed in part by the
world-wide recession.
Mr Tomotsu Harada, manager of the public affairs office at the Electronics
Industries Association of Japan, thinks that once the profitability of
Japanese manufacturers based in Europe is raised further efforts can be
channelled into increasing local content.
In this respect, companies which have had a longer presence in Europe have
the advantage of being more familiar with the capabilities of local
component suppliers.
Panasonic Europe, for example, says that most of its 21 manufacturing plants
in the EC have well over 50 to 60 per cent local content while its vacuum
cleaner plant in Spain has about 90 per cent local content.
The group has also cooperated with local component suppliers for some time
and claims collaborative relationships with several suppliers in the UK.
Panasonic, however, is an exception and many Japanese companies still
complain that local suppliers do not meet their quality requirements.
The situation presents an opportunity for Japanese component suppliers to
follow their parent companies to Europe. Their moves are being watched with
concern by the European authorities, who fear that if too many Japanese
component suppliers come to Europe, indigenous suppliers could be severely
hurt.
Japanese manufacturers themselves are concerned that the trend could unleash
further resentment within Europe.
Such concerns can only be alleviated if Japanese electronics manufacturers
step up efforts to support local component suppliers through technology
transfers.
At the eighth Japan-EC Business Roundtable on Consumer Electronics in Tokyo
last October, the European position was put forward in a proposal by Mr
Robert Verrue, of the European Commission's directorate on industry (DG
Three).
Mr Verrue proposed that Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers set up
support and development programmes to improve the competitiveness of
European component suppliers. Japanese companies will not respond en masse
to his call, but the message, at least, will have been heard.
In terms of R&amp;D, Japanese efforts in Europe have been concentrated on
developing products to meet specific market conditions, rather than on basic
design and research.
In this respect too, early comers, particularly in the consumer electronics
industry, have a head start. Mr Eric Bean, a director of Panasonic Europe,
says that the group already has quite sophisticated development groups at
many of its European plants.
For example, Panasonic's television plant in Cardiff is producing a
completely pan-European television set which will be its first TV set to be
wholly designed, developed and produced in the EC.
Toshiba, on the other hand, which started out as a sales operation in
Europe, says that it does not yet plan to bring basic research to Europe,
although it expects eventually to introduce applications research capability
in Europe as well as the US.
Although it plans to increase manufacturing in the EC, localisation efforts
will be focused first on increasing local sales staff.
Europe, however, may provide attractive possibilities for basic research in
software, especially for medium to large computers, says Mr Shoji Hiroo,
executive vice president of Toshiba Europa.
Meanwhile, moves by Japanese companies to form relationships with academic
institutions in Europe could also increase. These, too, have been slower to
materialise than has been hoped but, says Panasonic's Mr Bean, 'Japanese
companies still need a lot of brain power'.
There are areas, such as opto-electronics and voice recognition where
Japanese companies could learn a lot from academic institutions in Europe
and the US.
Like other electronics groups, Japanese manufacturers are looking
increasingly to communications systems, such as mobile telephones and office
automation equipment, office computers and business systems as attractive
growth areas in the years to come.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (8): The scalpels
are out - US leaders slash costs to ride the slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE leading US information technology companies, battered by an
unprecedented slump in business over the past two years, have been forced to
take drastic cost-cutting action.
Now most of them predict a modest recovery in profitability in 1992, after
substantially reducing their workforces and other expenses in Europe and at
home.
Most of the major hardware makers, including the Americans, have either
plunged into loss or sustained sharply reduced profits. IBM made a loss of
Pounds 124m in the UK last year and reduced its payroll by 2,600. Compaq
fell into its first ever loss in the third quarter and laid off 200 at its
Scottish factory.
Unisys incurred a loss through servicing its debts and cut its European
staff by 14 per cent. All of the leading US companies have been forced to
slim down, trying to save money on production and distribution while keeping
their sales operations intact and protecting their major accounts.
Across Europe sales of most types of systems have fallen steeply, both
because of the economic recession and because the market is now almost as
saturated as in the US. Prices have been depressed by an excess of suppliers
and the greater standardisation of products.
The US manufacturers which dominate the European market have been troubled
by these problems as much as their European rivals. With most of them
already making 30 per cent or more of their income in Europe, there is
little chance of expanding their European business to make up for slow
trading at home.
There is no reason to expect any rapid revival in the market.
The level of European demand is now mainly determined by Germany, which is
still wrestling with the challenges of reunification.
Most European countries are beset by political uncertainties and many large
IT users are waiting to see what happens before they make any further
investment.
Suppliers expect little change in the first half of the year with revenue
flat or only slightly up over the year as a whole. Although the volume of IT
business may recover, with some bright spots in niche sectors, hardware
prices are still under severe pressure and revenue will not grow in line
with volume.
Mr Andreas Earth, Compaq's senior vice-president for Europe, sees no
prospect of a return to the old days of 13 per cent profit and says he would
regard 8 per cent as acceptable this year.
Mr Amit Chaudhuri, senior European research analyst at International Data
Corporation, says the IT market has reached a temporary plateau and the
investment climate across Europe remains bad, although he adds, 'there is
plenty of long-term scope for growth in the European market'.
The advent of the Single European Market may help US suppliers to gain sales
as well as increase their share of the business.
The prospect of the Single Market provided a boost for many IT manufacturers
a couple of years ago, as their customers prepared for its arrival with a
large capital investment.
IT vendors now expect a second phase of growth to follow the lowering of the
barriers, as cross-border competition in many industries is becoming much
more intense.
Mr Dick Nuthall, vice-president of marketing for Unisys in Europe, points
out that a big new demand for networking and integration of systems should
come from multi-national organisations, especially in the financial services
sector.
The leading US hardware vendors believe that the Single Market should
benefit them to some extent by removing a bias towards locally-based
suppliers, particularly for public sector and utilities contracts.
Some feel that they have been unfairly discriminated against in the past,
although that tendency has been less in recent years. Now the rules are
clearer and most US vendors can meet the 50 per cent local content
requirement laid down by the European Commission.
However, any significant improvement in trading conditions for American
organisations in Europe will depend heavily on the outcome of the current
round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.
Official rules are not the most important reason for the US companies
increasing their operations in Europe. They believe their success here
against indigenous suppliers is partly due to a policy of moving core
research activities as well as manufacturing operations to Europe.
Mr Roger Wilson, Hewlett-Packard's European director of communications and
public affairs, says the company has steadily built up its research
laboratories at Bristol and other European research activities in the past
few years.
HP's laser printer components factory at Bergamo was set up in 1990 as part
of an effort to boost European production.
Mr William Bird, NCR's assistant vice-president of product marketing for
Europe, says it is simply better to develop locally for local markets. NCR
has research and manufacturing sites at Dundee, Augsburg and Utrecht. The
Dundee facility is more attuned to developing multi-currency banking systems
than any US facility would be, Mr Bird argues.
The Single Market is also radically affecting the way IT suppliers do
business. Many have been reorganising their distribution operations to take
account of faster customs clearance.
Compaq and Unisys are both moving from a distribution centre in each country
to a single European centre. Unisys believes it will be possible to ship a
mainframe anywhere in the continent in three or four days.
Several of the leading US suppliers contend that their success in Europe
derives from having a more European culture and structure than indigenous
companies, which are centred in one country with outposts in the others.
They argue that they should therefore be better able to cope with the change
to a Single Market.
The top US players have adopted notably different strategies for
strengthening their European presence. Whereas Digital has sought to grow by
acquisition - the Kienzle computer systems division of Mannesmann in 1990
and Philips' information systems division last year - IBM has so far opted
for small minority stakes and a number of business partnerships.
IBM's recent 5-10 per cent stake in the ailing French government-controlled
Bull company will help it enlarge its European customer base while at the
same time cutting its development costs.
This agreement, and IBM's new relationship with Apple, are intended to
address the fundamental problem of cost-cutting, as the industry leader
tries to adjust to the much more competitive market.
IBM now sits alongside Japan's NEC as a minority shareholder in Bull - a
situation which illustrates how Europe has now become a battlefield on which
the US and Japan struggle for supremacy.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (7): A healthy
appetite - Europe's consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European market for consumer electronics is often slow to pick up new
trends, compared with the markets in US and Japan.
The Japanese are avid consumers of electronics products, their enthusiasm
unhampered by the monstrous presence of 30-inch TV sets in their already
cramped living rooms.
The Americans may not have an indigenous consumer electronics industry, but
the situation apparently has not dulled their appetite for new products.
In contrast, Europeans are slower to embrace new developments in consumer
products. At the same time, European manufacturers of consumer electronics
products have seen their profits slump and their home markets penetrated
increasingly by foreign competitors.
However, the enlarged European region, including eastern Europe and the Efta
states, is expected to become the world's largest market within the next
five to 10 years. As such, it is of tremendous strategic importance to all
the major consumer electronics manufacturers, regardless of their national
origin.
Europe's indigenous manufacturers hope that the creation of a single market
from next year will provide them with the strong home base necessary to
remain competitive and from which they might launch their global ambitions.
Their efforts to achieve those aims have been two-pronged - they have
stepped up their individual efforts at the corporate level to improve
competitiveness and profitability, and they have attempted through the
European Commission to formulate a European industrial policy in
electronics, aimed at strengthening the European manufacturer.
Philips, for example, has re-emerged from a loss-making year in 1990 as a
slimmed-down and more profitable organisation. The company has launched a
series of new products, stepped up its marketing efforts and outlined a
forward-looking strategy for moving into software as a means of supporting
its hardware developments.
But as the vision of a single market takes shape, the route which is
increasingly being explored to help the revitalisation process passes
through the Commission.
To outsiders, this has often seemed like an attempt to keep Europe closed to
external competition.
Thomson CSF, the French electronics company, and a leading champion of the
European cause, said recently: 'The European consumer electronics market is
the largest in the world and has the highest growth potential. This market
must be conserved.'
Over the next few years, this strategy of the manufacturers, in cooperation
with the Commission, will be tested on both fronts, with the final test
taking place in the marketplace.
So far, the road ahead is far from smooth.
On the corporate front, the recession, and particularly the cyclical
downturn of the consumer electronics industry, has undermined European
manufacturers' efforts to regain profitability.
As for a European industrial policy for electronics, the EC's latest
directive on high definition television (HDTV) provides important lessons
for the future.
The directive calls for the adoption by manufacturers, television
broadcasters, satellite operators and other interested parties of a
Europe-wide standard for HDTV.
It was important to reach a consensus on a standard to create the single,
harmonised market needed for manufacturers to benefit from a large home
base.
'We don't want to start with a new fragmentation based on standards,'
commented Dr Joan Majo Cruzate, adviser to the directorate of the EC
Commission responsible for telecommunications, information industries and
innovation.
In practice, however, the conflicting interests of the various EC member
states, and the different industries concerned, have resulted in a
compromise solution that may be flexible but is fraught with difficulties,
not to mention hopelessly confusing from the consumer's point of view.
European HDTV is already being audience-tested with the broadcasting of the
Winter Olympics at Albertville. While this effort has been hailed by a
Commission officer as an example of 'European technology made in Europe and
managed by European broadcasters,' the move towards full HDTV still faces
several hurdles.
The Commission's decision after lengthy negotiations that only satellite
services launched after 1995 would be required to be broadcast in D2-MAC, an
intermediate high definition format, could mean that the first step towards
HDTV - the adoption of D2-MAC  - could be sidestepped.
Since it is up to the broadcaster to decide whether or not to transmit in
D2-MAC, the costs and the lack of hardware penetration mean that not many
broadcasters are likely to do so.
Meanwhile, without a sufficient choice of programs broadcast in D2-MAC,
consumers are not likely to invest in the costly hardware needed to
appreciate the benefits of the new format.
According to Mr Joseph Flaherty, senior vice president of technology at CBS,
the US media group, 'D2-MAC has been in intensive care for several years,
and the new EC directive has probably disconnected its last life support
system'.
The EC is proposing funding for broadcasters and other software producers to
encourage broadcasters to sign up for D2-MAC.
Consumers, meanwhile, are likely to be more concerned about how many TV sets
they will need to buy to enjoy full HDTV in Europe and when that day will
come.
There is a real danger that the European compromise on HDTV will put
consumers off buying a new set until the last moment when they can be more
certain of broadcasts in a particular standard.
Nevertheless, regardless of the relative merits of the directive, it has
certainly taken Europe's experiment in industrial policy-making a step
forward. 'The most important point is that it exists,' Dr Cruzate says.
But will the directive, as a concrete expression of European industrial
policy, help to revitalise the region's consumer electronics industry?
Will European manufacturers regain their competitiveness in time to seize
this opportunity and take the initiative in bringing sufficiently attractive
new products to the market? Will consumers support the strategy by choosing
European products over foreign ones?
The next few years will provide clearer answers to those questions and will
therefore be critical for the industry.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (6): Shrieks over
Eureka - Research is a red-hot issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN collaborative research programmes have always generated
controversy. They have been hailed by their supporters as critical to
maintaining the competitiveness - if not the very existence  - of indigenous
European high technology industries, and sometimes dismissed by critics as
an expensive waste of mis-directed money.
Although collaborative research is often viewed as a recent development, the
first joint European research and development project began more than 25
years ago - into nuclear energy under the 1956 Euratom Treaty.
But the real surge in joint European R&amp;D began in the early 1980s with the
Community's first R&amp;D 'framework programme' (1984-87) which extended joint
research activities to cover a broad range of areas, and which has been
followed by three subsequent programmes.
The fourth and latest was agreed early last month when the EC's 17
commissioners approved an overall Community budget for the next five years
which will be worth Ecu 86bn (Pounds 61bn) annually by the time it comes up
for renewal in 1997. Some Ecu6.9bn will be available for 'internal
policies', including research and development.
Exactly how it will be spent has yet to be decided as the Community is only
just getting round to handing out the Ecu5.7bn earmarked under the third
framework programme for the 1990-94 period, some 40 per cent of it for
information technology.
EC funding under 'framework programmes' is designed to support cross-border
consortia carrying out pre-competitive research - projects with long lead
times which will help underpin innovation in European high technology
industries. EC funding normally covers up to 50 per cent of project costs.
The fourth framework programme, which officials are now working on, will
probably be divided into six strategic areas which in turn will be split
into specific programmes such as information technology (Esprit) or
biotechnology (Bridge).
Esprit, which was launched in 1984 and is probably the best known of the EC
joint research programmes, sponsors collaborative research in information
technology and is itself subdivided into four areas plus basic research
which aims to 'enhance the potential for future technological breakthroughs
in IT'. The four areas are:
microelectronics, aimed at strengthening the Community's capability to
design and manufacture leading edge integrated circuits, particularly
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (Asics);
software engineering and information processing systems - aimed at
increasing software productivity and applying software intensive systems
design and engineering to user needs;
advanced business and home systems and peripherals aimed at developing
user-friendly systems for offices and 'intelligent' homes.
computer-integrated manufacturing and engineering aimed at demonstrating how
the manufacturing and engineering industries can benefit from the
application and integration of IT products and processes.
The EC's fourth framework programme is also likely to overlap with its
predecessor, which finishes in 1994 and could prove to be the most
controversial target of Community-funded research yet, with advocates of an
interventionist EC industrial policy on one side and the free-marketeers on
the other.
Eureka, a pan-European research programme which involves the 12 EC member
states, seven other European nations and the EC Commission itself, already
provides a forum for the funding of more market-oriented projects.
It was originally launched in 1985 by French President Francois Mitterrand
as a response to President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars research. Eureka
operates out of a small Brussels secretariat and is restricted to civilian
research through which it hopes to improve the competitiveness and
productivity of European businesses by encouraging cross-border
co-operation.
Since its inception Eureka has acted like a high-tech dating agency -
finding research partners for companies which approach it with an idea. For
funding the partners can go to their governments or to the EC, which offers
financial support for the pre-competitive aspects of Eureka projects.
Eureka is designed to complement rather than compete with the EC's top-down
projects, encouraging products and ideas which should have a market
application worldwide. Sceptics initially dismissed the Eureka initiative.
However, it has helped launch more than 450 projects, with a total budget of
nearly Ecu10bn.
These include the Joint European Submicron Silicon investigation (Jessi)
into advanced microchips, (participants included Britain's ICL until it was
acquired by Japan's Fujitsu and its partners threw it out of three Jessi
projects), and which may have cost more than Ecu3.8bn by the end of its
seven-year span in 1996. Another is the European research project into High
Definition Television (HDTV).
Last year, an assessment of Eureka's first five years by a panel of
industrialists, academics and civil servants praised the flexibility of the
programme's approach as one of its principal advantages, but noted that
'strategic projects which would give Europe an additional competitive
advantage have not materialised on a large scale'. This, says the report,
should be one aim for Eureka's next five years.
The panel also identified several other problems. These included confusion
over the relationship with EC projects, compounded because some in Brussels
would like to see funded research become more closely geared to the market.
Eureka participants also complained that although applying for and obtaining
Eureka approval is fairly simple, projects often get swamped in bureaucracy
when it comes to arranging funding.
The major difference between Eureka and the directly subsidised EC research
programmes is that while Eureka projects do not conform to a set strategic
plan the scale and direction of EC research funding can be assessed in
advance. In addition there is a standard procedure for applications for EC
research programmes which usually lasts about 18 months.
Other important EC funded programmes include the Research and Development in
Advanced Communications in Europe (Race) which was set up in 1985 with the
aim of establishing a strong EC manufacturing industry in broadband
communications and to accelerate the emergence of a competitive Community
market for telecommunications equipment and services.
So far, most EC funding has focused on expanding R&amp;D, emphasising mainly
pre-competitive collaborative projects intended to boost European companies'
technological firepower. Advocates argue that, whatever its shortcomings,
this constitutes the most efficient policy instrument for the EC to promote
competitiveness in European industry and they point to the figures which
show that Europe's IT companies have doubled their spending as a result.
They add that new technological developments today - such as the next
generation of semi-conductors - are too costly for one company to do the
research alone.
But critics counter that EC subsidies have been too thinly spread to be
effective. More fundamentally, some argue that they do not address European
manufacturers' biggest traditional weakness - the belief that laboratory
breakthroughs can substitute for efficient manufacturing and aggressive
marketing.
The sceptics point out that in spite of all the R&amp;D efforts the performance
of the European IT industry has still to show any substantial improvement.
Europe's IT trade deficit has continued to deteriorate in the past decade,
industry profitability is poor and there are still few fast-growing product
markets in which European electronics companies are world leaders.
Some EC officials have argued that more time is needed for results to
materialise. But another explanation is that all the attention devoted to
R&amp;D may have obscured the more fundamental challenge of how to get new
products to market faster.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (5): An era of
global alliances - Companies must join forces to ensure survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past few years have witnessed a rash of alliances between information
technology companies worldwide as they seek greater economies of scale, more
effective methods of product distribution and better ways to defray the ever
increasing costs of research and development.
For European IT companies, such alliances are an essential element of their
efforts to remain in contention with their US and Japanese rivals.
Most of the technological building bricks of the IT revolution are not of
European origin. Personal computer microprocessor technology is the province
of the US companies Intel and Motorola.
With the exception of Inmos, a subsidiary of SGS-Thomson, no European
company has developed a commercial reduced instruction set computing (risc)
chip, the heart of high performance workstations. The Inmos chip, the
transputer, is now being considered by IBM for certain functions in the
personal computers and workstations. Operating software is developed by US
companies including Microsoft (MS/DOS; NT/Windows) and Apple.
European companies have been involved, however, in moves to create a
standard operating system based on AT&amp;T's Unix. Logica, the UK computing
services company, was involved in the Santa Cruz Operation's version of
Unix; Siemens of Germany and Groupe Bull of France are founder members of
the Open Software Foundation, formed to develop open systems products and
technologies.
European IT companies are small, insular and tied to their home markets.
Global alliances offer them access to technologies and markets that would be
otherwise expensive or unattainable. Siemens, for example, a company with
excellent technological skills, is working with International Business
Machines, to develop the next generation of high density semiconductor
memory which will compress 64m bytes of storage on a single chip.
Olivetti has long maintained a close working relationship with Intel and
with Microsoft which has enabled the Italian company to enter the market
quickly with, for example, advanced workstation technology. Now all serious
computer companies understand the importance of maintaining an alliance with
the key chip manufacturers, in order to keep the technological leading edge
and to share research and development costs.
IBM, for example, has formed an alliance with Apple Computers and Motorola
to develop new microchips, based on IBM designs, which could form the heart
of the next generation of personal computer and workstations.
Groupe Bull has in the past two months signed a far-reaching technology
agreement with IBM, part of which provides for the French company to take
part in the joint chip development programme.
Bull will be much more than a customer for the new chips, according to Mr
Bob Dies, director general for products and systems at IBM Europe. It will
be intimately involved in the design and will take much of the
responsibility for developing a multi-user versions of the chips, a
technology known as 'symmetrical multiprocessing' in which Bull has profound
expertise.
The most dramatic example in recent years of a global alliance involving a
European information technology company has been the merger between ICL of
the UK and Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer manufacturer.
The relationship between the two companies stretches back to 1981 when ICL,
struggling to return to profitability, signed an agreement with the Japanese
company, giving it access to technology which it could not afford to develop
on its own.
Since then, a careful market focus and sound housekeeping have resulted in
ICL remaining Europe's only consistently profitable computer manufacturer.
The takeover by Fujitsu - the Japanese company holds 80 per cent of ICL's
stock - was nevertheless essential to provide ICL with long term credibility
in an increasingly hostile market place. The purchase of the computing
interests of the Nokia Group of Finland, financed by ICL from its own
resources, was further evidence of ICL's rising star - the 'halo effect' as
Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, describes it.
ICL has become part of Fujitsu's worldwide family of wholly owned and partly
owned companies which include Amdahl, the US mainframe manufacturer, Poqet,
a US maker of handheld computers, and Hal, a US specialist in advanced
computing technologies. Since the takeover ICL has:
Provided Fujitsu with workstations and personal computers for sale in both
Japan and worldwide markets;
Begun to work on some elements of the technology for Fujitsu's mainframe
computers - as Fujitsu is regarded as the world's best mainframe designer,
this is an indication of the regard in which the UK company is held;
Formed three new companies with Fujitsu, in two of which it will be majority
shareholder and senior partner. In the US, for example, both companies are
strong in retail systems. The new joint company, Fujitsu-ICL systems, will
have about 2,000 employees and sales of Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). It will
be third to IBM and NCR in the US retail market.
Alliances are not confined to the computing hardware business. Cap Gemini
Sogeti, Europe's largest and most successful computing services company,
last year signed a wide ranging agreement with Daimler Benz, the German
industrial group, worth FFr2.4bn (Dollars 406m) through which Daimler Benz
will take a 34 per cent stake in Sogeti, CGS holding company. The idea is
that the two companies will cooperate, at first in Germany, but later
elsewhere in Europe, the US and the Far East as a method of helping both
companies broaden their product ranges and expand their computing services.
Late last month, CGS announced a wide ranging cooperative deal with Volmac,
a Netherlands-based services group in which it already held a small stake.
The new holding group will be two thirds owned by CGS and one third by the
World Software Group, Volmac's holding company. CGS has been involved in
some 20 acquisitions in recent years.
Further consolidation and cross border alliances seem inevitable as the
computer industry becomes increasingly a commodity business where volume
sales will be essential to adequate profit margins and where services will
increasingly be the principal way of adding value.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (4): Square holes
for square pegs - The impending Single Market gives new urgency to standards
harmonisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCEPT of Open Systems has won powerful proponents among users and
suppliers over the past decade and has helped thrust standard setting for
Information Technology out of obscurity and into the limelight.
Now the impending arrival of the Single European Market and accompanying
moves to harmonise regulations and practices across Europe has given added
impetus to standard setting in all fields and led the European Commission to
try to streamline and hasten the process.
This, coupled with the faster pace of technological change, is putting
pressure on standard setters to anticipate developments and not just pick
the best from the past. Mr Chris Cheetham, chief executive of DISC, the part
of the British Standards Institution (BSI) responsible for Information
Systems standards, says that 'users are increasingly reluctant to use new
technology if there are no suitable standards'.
The idea behind Open Systems in information technology is deceptively
simple.
In an Open Systems environment, IT hardware is built to a set of common
standards so that equipment from one manufacturer can work with equipment
from another, and software can be easily moved from one machine 'platform'
to another.
Today, there is little dispute, in Europe at least, that Open Systems
standards lie at the heart of users' future ability to integrate and fully
exploit information technology systems in every sector of commerce and
industry - from cross border mobile telephones to networked computers and
database structures.
The pressure from IT users for Open Systems began in the early 1980s after
General Motors told its suppliers to meet a protocol based on the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) standard developed by the International
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).
European users and computer suppliers were also among the early advocates of
Open Systems which they saw as a means to loosen IBM's grip on the mainframe
equipment market and provide an alternative to IBM's Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) which had become a de facto standard. Under pressure from
users IBM itself has now swung firmly behind Open Systems.
Tony Jeffree, a principal consultant with Sema Group Consulting, sees Open
Systems developments as the product of two relatively recent developments:
the IT consumer's realisation 'that the availability of standards-based IT
products can break the strangle-hold once exerted over them by the fact that
interconnection and interfacing techniques were incompatible between
different manufacturers' equipment. The availability of products based on
Open Systems standards provides them with a better choice of equipment, and
with the protection of their investment against the potential hazards of
single-sourcing.'
the realisation by the IT supplier 'that the wide use of Open Systems
standards actually has the effect of increasing the size of the potential
market for IT products, and that this more than compensates for the fact
that the open nature of the standards does not 'lock in' their customer
base'.
Nevertheless, implementation of the Open Systems concept has brought
problems as well as solutions. Because Open Systems reduce computing
equipment to a series of commodity products, price becomes a dominant factor
in purchasing decisions and fierce price competition is one factor behind
the recent sharp downturn in most major computer manufacturers' financial
fortunes.
In Europe, the move towards Open Systems was given further impetus by the
EC's decision in the mid 1980s that member governments' major public sector
IT contracts should be based on Open Systems standards. This led to the
development of the Government information systems profile (Gosip) in the UK,
and equivalents elsewhere in Europe.
Profiles select from the options within a set of standards and ensure that
IT suppliers make OSI products which are compatible with each other.
Since the public sector is a major IT purchaser, Gosip and the European
Procurement Handbook for Open Systems, Ephos have become very influential in
determining the implementation of standards. Indeed many industry observers
argue that standards have become the single most important issue in European
IT.
They suggest that the increasingly widespread adoption of Open Systems means
that those responsible for setting standards have assumed great power.
As a result there has been a proliferation of user groups seeking to ensure
their voices are heard and needs are met, and of supplier groups who try to
influence those standards that concern them.
Predictably this proliferation has alarmed some of the older Open Systems
groups who argue that it causes unnecessary duplication.
Rivalry also developed between groups supporting different versions of Unix,
the software language which has become closely associated with Open Systems.
Competing versions of Unix are available from several suppliers including
Unix International, which helped establish the Unix version from AT&amp;T Unix
System Laboratories (USL) in the market, and Open Software Foundation which
developed a Unix version called OSF/1.
Arguably, rivalry between the two organisations has delayed more widespread
adoption of Unix.
But there are now strong signs that the two groups are moving closer
together, in part as a result of pressure from X/Open which was set up by
suppliers in an effort to bring together enough standards to cover all the
basic functions of Open Systems under a common application environment
(CAE).
The 'Unix wars', as they have been called, may be close to resolution, but
they have underlined the fact that standardisation itself is not without
problems.
'A good standard must be widely acceptable both to the customer base and to
equipment suppliers,' says Tony Jeffree, who has direct experience with
standards development in ISO and the Institution of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers (IEEE).
'To achieve this the standard must address a wider set of requirements than
is usual in equivalent proprietary solutions. 'This leads to inevitable
conflicts and trade-offs between versatility and complexity, and
occasionally to the worst of all solutions, which is complexity without
versatility,' he says.
He argues that a good standard must also have an eye to future requirements,
sometimes resulting in the standardised product being less competitive in
the short term. A good example of this effect is the current rise of TCP/IP,
a set of networking protocol standards originally developed for use by the
US Defense Department's 'Arpanet' network.
TCP/IP is widely available, works, and is simpler than the corresponding OSI
offering. However, it was designed in the days when it was reasonable to
assume that any one organisation would own a handful of computers, and the
total number of subnetworks in the world that would require interconnection
would be numbered in the 100s or 1,000s.
Such assumptions, although ludicrous now, resulted in TCP/IP being
implemented with severe addressing limitations that prevent its use as a
global networking solution, and will probably relegate it to the status of a
local area networking protocol before long.
But Tony Jeffree argues that the most serious problem with standardisation
at the moment is the impact the worldwide economic slowdown/recession is
having on the ability of both supplier and user organisations to participate
in the standard setting process.
'Manufacturers of IT equipment are cutting back on their standards budgets,
similarly user organisations, which have never been well represented in the
standardisation process, are finding it increasingly difficult to
participate,' he says.
'In the UK, government departments, particularly the DTI, have traditionally
been a considerable source of support for standardisation activities, but
present policy has reduced DTI support for OSI standardisation to an
extremely low level. 'Given the potential importance of the IT sector in
helping to bring us out of the recession, this must be viewed as a dangerous
trend.'
Although Open Systems standards are usually associated with the computer
sector of information technology, the urgent need for widely accepted
standards is apparent in many other IT and consumer electronics sectors. For
example, it was the need to develop common European telecommunications
standards which led to the formation of the European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (Etsi) in 1988.
More recently the difficulties faced by the EC in defining a standard for
high definition television (HDTV) have served as a timely reminder that in
some areas of European standard setting national politics and industrial
rivalry still play a major part.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (3): Strategies
which yield inadequate results - Why the trade gap is widening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EUROPE'S semiconductor manufacturers have been forced to play a desperate
game of catch-up with their Japanese and US rivals, computer makers are
struggling for survival, and the consumer electronics groups have yet to
show that they can translate big spending in the laboratory into timely
commercial products.
These problems are not new. In November, 1988, the European Commission
presented its first report on the state of science and technology in Europe
and concluded that Europe was still gripped by technological dependency in
key areas.
The report said that in spite of a dramatic increase in research and
development spending in Europe, Japan and the US were well ahead in terms of
the amount of R&amp;D spending, the number of research scientists and engineers,
and in successfully enticing the private sector to invest in R&amp;D. It then
identified three main targets for research, improving competitiveness,
improving quality of life and concentrating on basic research.
In their attempts to revitalise Europe's flagging IT and electronics sectors
Europe's policy makers have consistently emphasised R&amp;D. In particular, they
have encouraged IT companies to pool their R&amp;D efforts, particularly in the
area of 'pre-competitive' research.
This policy is set to continue with the EC planning to spend Ecu5.7bn
between 1990 and 1994 to support research and development, 40 per cent of it
on collaborative research in IT. The Commission wants to channel this money
into fewer, larger schemes, but complains that its spending is diffused
because its member governments each insist on a share of the pie.
There is no doubt that companies have rushed to join EC-subsidised research
programmes such as Esprit and Race as well as pan-European programmes like
Eureka which includes costly flagship projects such as the Joint European
Submicron Silicon Initiative (Jessi) and the High Definition Television
(HDTV) project.
But there is a continuing debate over whether the EC has got its R&amp;D
strategy right, not least because the results are at best inconclusive - and
there seems to be much more research than development of commercial products
and processes, something Europe has recently fallen down on. Last year, the
European Court of Auditors joined the fray arguing that in spite of Ecu5.4bn
spent on research between 1987 and 1991 only a small fraction of research
work had resulted in concrete applications.
The Court of Auditors report recommended diverting more funds into the
practical application of research and reorganising the manner in which
research findings are disseminated. Supporters of the EC, strategy, however
claim that although EC funding for European collaborative research is tiny
compared with many national, or even some corporate R&amp;D budgets, it has
encouraged the European IT industry to increase its R&amp;D spending
significantly.
Nevertheless, the performance of the Europe's indigenous IT and electronics
industries has shown little improvement. Europe's IT trade deficit has
continued to deteriorate in the past decade, most of the region's large
computer and semiconductor companies are losing money, their share of the
global IT market is disproportionately small and falling, and despite higher
R&amp;D spending there are still very few developing product markets in which
European electronics companies can claim to be world leaders.
Europe's large semiconductor companies, Philips of Holland, Siemens of
Germany, and the French/Italian SGS Thomson, produce only about 10 per cent
of the world's output of chips and are dwarfed by their US and Japanese
rivals. All three continue to be heavily subsidised in their efforts to
catch up in chip technology and Siemens has now turned to IBM as a partner
to develop 64Mb D-Rams, the next generation of memory chips.
Similarly, nearly all the large European computer companies are in financial
trouble because of falling sales, increased competition, the high cost of
research and development, and demands from larger customers for open systems
which yield inherently lower gross margins than proprietary systems.
In Europe, the situation has been worsened by the plethora of small national
markets, which has made economies of scale difficult to achieve, and a
tendency to support 'national champions' which has hampered collaboration
and co-operation.
The sale of a controling stake in ICL of the UK to Japan's Fujitsu in 1990
effectively ended any hopes for a pan-European coalition which might have
linked ICL with the other leading players - Siemens Nixdorf of Germany,
Groupe Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy.
By 1995, according to some estimates, the European-owned full-line computer
makers could have less than 7 per cent of the worldwide market for
data-processing equipment, compared with just over 10 per cent at present.
As Groupe Bull's recently announced technological and marketing agreement
with IBM indicates, it is probably only a matter of time before they are
forced into strategic alliances with foreign competitors to ensure their
survival - but at the expense of their independence and national identity.
Inadequate home demand has been blamed for the industry's weaknesses,
including its difficulties in producing innovative products. Although
Europe's spending on IT has been rising, it is still lower per head than in
the US and Japan, and large European information systems users are
notoriously cautious about pioneering leading-edge applications.
Brussels is now considering plans to boost demand by persuading national
authorities jointly to back a plan hatched by the big European computer
companies for a multi-million-dollar computer network to span Europe. The
intention is to provide both an IT infrastructure for the Continent and at
the same time provide a boost for the ailing computer companies.
But there are already doubts about whether the large contracts it would
generate could legally be reserved for the European-owned suppliers it is
intended to benefit, and whether it would not simply repeat at the regional
level European countries' largely unsuccessful use of public procurement to
bolster national champion suppliers.
A similarly gloomy picture emerges in Europe's consumer electronics industry
where competition has dramatically shortened product cycles. In order to
compete, therefore, companies must get innovative products out of
traditional R&amp;D labs and into the marketplace fast. The need to address this
and other pressing challenges, like responsiveness to customer demand, has
now been recognised in some European boardrooms.
Philips has just announced it managed to swing back into profit in 1991
following the record Fl4.24bn loss sustained in 1990 which prompted an
ambitious restructuring including the sale of non-core businesses, and the
re-focusing of the company's technological strengths on new consumer
products.
In order to maintain a foothold in the fiercely competitive global consumer
electronics marketplace Philips has been investing heavily in the three
emerging technologies of Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), High Definition
Television (HDTV) and, in conjunction with Sony, Interactive Compact Discs
(CD-I).
The Dutch group's performance is being carefully watched as a barometer of
Europe's electronics industry. As one of the few remaining diversified
European electrical and electronics companies, Philips is a champion of a
cause - the maintenance of an independent European capability in electronic
technologies.
The only electronics equipment sector in which Europe consistently boasts
profitable world leaders is telecommunications, where the long established
monopoly procurement of network equipment in most countries shelters
entrenched suppliers from competition and maintains high margins.
Two other possible growth areas for European IT are custom-chips, and the
parallel processing field in which European companies are believed to have
an edge.
Europe is also well represented by software development houses and IT
service companies. There are some 13,000 computing software and services
companies in Europe and, if the region has a future in IT, it probably lies
with these companies rather than the troubled giants of the hardware
business.
As Mr Vittorio Cassoni, Olivetti's managing director, said recently when
referring to Europe's weakness in computer technology, the Commission should
not spend money trying to catch trains that Europe had already missed.
What is certain is that competition for indigenous European IT companies
will intensify, and that US and Japanese companies will continue to be
active in establishing plants in Europe.
If Europe's industrial strategists fail to halt the decline, the future of
European IT and electronics may rest in these foreign owned plants.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (2): 'We can
still catch them' - A fervent believer in Europe's potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JACQUES STERN, former chairman of Groupe Bull and doyen of French computer
industry executives, embodies the hopes, ambitions and contradictions of the
European information technology industry.
He believes passionately that Europe can, despite its current weakness in
data processing markets, catch up with the US and Japan if it puts the right
technology policies in place. He remains steadfastly optimistic about
Europe's potential despite years of failing to cajole its major firms to
work together.
And he is sharply critical of initiatives that spend public money on
programmes that he believes are destined to fail.
He is concerned, for example, about Esprit, the European Commission driven
programme in precompetitive research designed to give European companies
experience in working together.
He explains that when Viscount Etienne Davignon, EC vice president from 1977
to 1984, initiated the community's R&amp;D framework for IT, he saw Esprit as
the first step towards a European industrial policy for IT.
Davignon had failed to persuade the leading electronics companies to work
together on product planning, production or marketing. Still fiercely
independent, they were afraid of letting rivals in on their commercial
secrets. So Esprit was launched as a pre-competitive vehicle in the hope
that working together in research might inspire collaboration closer to the
market.
That hope was never fully realised and, with time, the gulf between research
and the market has widened.
At that time Davignon was Commissioner for both research and industry.
Today, research and industry report to two different Commissioners. 'Esprit
is not at fault, neither are the people managing the programme, who are
doing a good job in Brussels. But governments can question spending large
amounts of money from one precompetitive program to another if there is no
industrial application. The final goal of Esprit must be to bring in
cooperation innovative and competitive products to the markets that serve
real needs.'
The second phase of the Esprit programme, finishing this year, represents a
Community investment of more than Ecu3.2bn.
Mr Stern now heads the Advanced Computer Research Institute, a small
research organisation based in Paris.
He is unwilling to talk about his research, fearing the moment is not right
to reveal progress, but he is known to have an abiding fascination with the
development of supercomputers, which he likens to the creation of a Formula
One racing car.
The emphasis, he points out, is on doing everything faster. Just as
competition improves the breed, so techniques developed for supercomputing
eventually filter down to more mundane levels of computing: 'If you are not
active in this market, you lose these skills.'
Supercomputing is also a market controlled by US and Japanese companies. By
the turn of the century, Mr Stern worries, there will be more supercomputers
in Japan than in the US, with Europe trailing hopelessly if nothing is done.
Supercomputers will soon be used for many commercial tasks including the
design of automobiles and aeroplanes and buildings where their ability to
'visualise' structures and forces in three dimensions can improve quality
and shorten design cycles.
Much of what Mr Stern advocates these days turns around the idea of
conserving Europe's information technology skills for the future - a holding
operation while the community thrashes out an effective industrial policy
for electronics.
He sees a powerful opportunity with the advent of open systems, the
emergence of hardware and software from different manufacturers that works
easily together.
He believes that all new computer products will soon be based on standard
microprocessors of the risc variety. Risc, or reduced instruction set
computing, is a technology which trades off simple microprocessor chips
against complicated operating software. The result can be very fast chips
which, linked together in networks, generate enormous processing power. The
advent of risc and open systems is proving one of the few major disjunctions
in a business which, despite the rate of change, is often predictable.
Mr Stern says: 'It is easy to forecast what is going to happen; the
difficulty is to say when.'
There are only a handful of risc chip designers - International Business
Machines, Sun Microsystems, Mips, Hewlett Packard as well as Intel, Motorola
and Disitel Equipment. Groupe Bull has recently signed an agreement with IBM
which gives it access to the computer giant's risc technology, a deal which
Mr Stern believes was both fortunate - IBM was seeking new markets for its
risc technology - and essential.
Without a source of risc technology, Bull would have been cut off from the
leading edge of open systems developments. There are a number of
prerequisities for success in risc. First, considerable expertise in the
design and fabrication of microprocessors. Second, experience in the kind of
complex software - optimising compilers - which makes the best use of the
advantages of the risc chip. Third, volume sales to give economies of scale.
Mr Stern suggests that short term alliances with the US manufacturers of
risc technology could give European suppliers a breathing space to devise
ways to collaborate on the development of indigenous risc processors.
But with Europe's semiconductor manufacturers in disarray and trailing
behind the US and Japanese producers, has not Europe missed the bus on chip
manufacturer? Mr Stern is unambiguous: 'You cannot drive innovation if you
do not control the hardware.'
European electronics may be sickly, but it has hidden strengths, he argues.
There is, for example, software engineering, an area where European
companies are equal to any in the world.
Software engineering involves the development of methodologies, technologies
and software which make it simpler to write computer programs. Software
productivity has become a key issue in business with projects notoriously
overunning on time and budget.
Software engineering, which essentially aims to turn program production from
art to engineering discipline, has a key role to play in improving matters.
Mr Stern's prescription to return Europe to health involves a strong lead
from Brussels with the full support of the national governments of the
community.
It would strengthen Europe's indigenous players through alliances with
companies overseas, while seeking ways to help small, innovative companies.
It is some years since Mr Stern has publicly set out his ideas on the
rejuvenation of the European industry, but time has dulled neither the
urgency nor the content of the message.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (1):  The
barriers are falling - Europe's expansion as an increasingly unified trading
area is fuelling hectic competition among information systems suppliers. At
issue is how much of this market will be served by local industries and how
much by the US and Japan
</HEADLINE>

THE European information technology industry is looking forward to a number
of benefits from the creation of a single European market. It assumes that:
The market will spur demand for information and communication systems
capable of spanning national borders as barriers fall and businesses take
advantage of the enlarged market.
Corporations will rely more on information systems to disseminate
information across the wider business networks.
Financial institutions will boost their IT capability to provide
pan-European banking and other financial services.
Demand for mobile telephones will surge as travel throughout the EC
increases and as users become able to communicate with the same mobile
handset from anywhere in the Community.
Manufacturers will be encouraged to adopt computer-integrated manufacturing,
computer-assisted design and other systems as competition in many sectors
intensifies.
This, at least, is the rosy picture being painted by the IT industry. It has
lured the world's leading IT manufacturers, from the fast-moving computer
groups of the US to the large, integrated electronics giants of Japan, to
set up bases within the EC.
Europe will be the largest market in the world and foreign manufacturers
have been making huge investments to take advantage of the opportunities on
offer.
European manufacturers, for their part, are struggling to regain the
initiative in the marketplace, fearful of losing their growing home market
to outside competition.
As the foreign presence within their borders has come to be felt even more
strongly than before, European electronics and computer manufacturers have
been forced to accelerate moves to turn ailing businesses round.
They are being forced to question the narrow insularity that has made it
difficult for companies from one European country to collaborate closely
with those from another and to examine the barriers of custom and practice
that have made it virtually impossible for a whole range of information
technology products to find a Europe-wide market with the economies of scale
that implies.
The Community has, however, faced a growing dilemma over whether to continue
to support an interventionist approach that aims to create national or
European 'champions' or to opt for strategies based more on commercial and
business considerations. The signs from Brussels are that patience is
growing thin with organisations that look for subsidies as an aid to
competitiveness.
Pumping money into uncompetitive businesses or merging weak European
partners is now recognised as unlikely to produce an effective champion.
European companies, too, have often seen greater benefits for themselves in
alliances with the stronger technologies of US or Japanese companies.
In the semiconductor industry, hopes for the formation of a strong European
manufacturer through the merger of a number of leading groups were abandoned
when Siemens of Germany agreed a memory chip venture with IBM.
The remaining groups were left to seek strategic alliances and partnerships
to suit their own particular needs. Late last year, Bull, the French
computer maker, also reached a partnership deal with IBM.
Thomson, the French electronics group, meanwhile, is being compelled by its
government owner to take a rather odd turn down the industrial policy route.
It is threatening to force it to merge with CEA-Industrie, the state nuclear
and fuel business.
Despite this particular setback, Europe's indigenous capability in IT is
still being sought in a less dramatic way by manufacturers throughout the
Community as well as the Commission.
Partnerships between semiconductor manufacturers have been formed, such as
that between SGS-Thomson and Philips on the next generation semiconductor
technology and between SGS-Thomson and GEC Plessey in semi-custom chips used
by the telecommunications and computer industries.
The European-owned computer manufacturers are striking a variety of deals
and alliances to give them, first, access to technologies which are not
available from European suppliers, and second, expanded markets for their
products. Volume sales are now critical for computer companies which have
seen the profit margins on their systems collapse, driven by the widespread
availability of industry-standard components and a trend to 'downsizing' -
using smaller, lower costs systems to carry out tasks previously carried out
by mainframes or minicomputers - among their customers.
Siemens, of Germany a powerhouse of the European electronics industry, is
the owner of Nixdorf through the joint venture Siemens-Nixdorf Information
Systems, but has an alliance in mainframes and supercomputers with Fujitsu
of Japan. It has recently sold its share in Comparex, which distributed
Hitachi mainframes and other computing equipment in Europe, to its co-owner
BASF.
Groupe Bull of France, a heavy loss maker in recent years, is beginning to
regain credibility with its broad ranging deal with IBM - it gets access to
IBM's advanced chip technology for personal computers and workstations which
in turn gives IBM greater sales potential for its chips.
Olivetti of Italy has yet to seal a wide-ranging alliance with either a US
or Japanese supplier, but it works closely with the major technology
suppliers including Intel and Microsoft and supplies Digital Equipment of
the US with personal computers.
Joint R&amp;D efforts under pan-European programmes such as Esprit and Eureka
continue under the umbrella of the EC's 'framework programmes,' which
receive a budget covering five years work from the Commission. The latest
framework programme was agreed last month with a Community budget that will
be worth Ecu86bn annually.
Meanwhile, the European Commission itself has had to balance the demands of
the interventionists and its commitment to the rules of competition and free
trade.
The situation has, at times, resulted in an uneasy compromise. Pressure from
manufacturers and concern about building a European capability in high
definition television (HDTV), for example, led the Commission to set up a
standard and agenda for HDTV that aims to further the European industrial
cause.
As a result, the European HDTV programme has been delayed unnecessarily and
the Commission's goal of nurturing indigenous industry could prove to be at
the expense of the consumer.
In the end, with or without intervention, 'the market itself will determine
success or failure,' a point recognised by Dr Joan Majo Cruzate, adviser at
the Commission.
It is in the enlarged European marketplace that IT manufacturers will have
to face most directly their overseas competitors, many of whom react with
frank scepticism to continued talk in Europe about investment aid from the
Community and national subsidies.
'Subsidies and government support are not what make winners,' says a US
semiconductor group.
How fast the single market in information and communication is realised will
depend largely on the willingness of the individual governments to implement
the necessary changes. There are still substantial obstacles to be overcome
before the full benefits of integration can be enjoyed.
As competition in the European IT industry intensifies over the next few
years it could yet trigger renewed cries for protection from the region's
beleaguered manufacturers. That, in turn, could delay the benefits to the
Community.

FUGRO-MCCLELLAND, the Dutch-based group of consultancy engineers, is to
float roughly one-third of its shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange next
month. It wants to raise up to Fl 128m (Dollars 68m) to finance a recent
acquisition in the US and to fuel growth.
The company will offer 3.2m shares to the public, at between Fl 37 and Fl 40
each, with the final price to be announced on March 30.
Trading in the shares will begin on April 7, marking the first company
flotation in Amsterdam so far this year. Of the shares on offer, 1.66m are
existing shares held by several Dutch institutional investors and venture
capital firms. The rest will be newly issued.
Fugro-McClelland, the product of a 1987 merger between Fugro of the
Netherlands and McClelland Engineers of the US, will use part of the
proceeds to repay a Fl 59m loan it took out in 1991 to finance half of its
acquisition of John E. Chance, a US surveying company.
The consultancy group, with annual turnover of Fl 310m and a workforce of
2,200, is active in geo-technical and offshore services, surveying and
environmental consulting. It has more than 100 offices in 30 countries.

GERMAN customs officers yesterday demanded more staff to round up 'cattle by
the herd and cigarettes by the tonne' smuggled yearly across the frontiers
with Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The European Community would become 'a playground for international bandits'
if border security to the east and the south were not tightened, Mr Richard
Muller, chairman of the BDZ customs officials association, said yesterday.
The Polish border was a particular problem in the east, but there was also a
'security deficit' in the south, where Spain and Portugal were unable to
police their external borders effectively.
He was astonished that in laying plans for internal police co-operation
through Europol, member states had excluded customs authorities.
Mr Muller said his members were currently seizing about 20m cigarettes a
month, and estimated that the volume of smuggling was closer to 100m.
Experience had shown that gangs involved in tobacco smuggling typically
graduated to running hard drugs once their networks were established.
Seizures of heroin, shipped into Germany from the Middle East via the
Balkans rose 90 per cent last year and the number of drug-related deaths in
the country exceeded 2,000.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Portuguese slowdown worse than expected
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGUESE economic growth was smaller than expected last year, with
investment and industrial activity showing clear signs of slowing down,
according to Portugal's National Statistics Institute (INE).
The INE figures were published at the weekend in Semanario Economico, the
leading economic and business weekly newspaper, which will publish a full
report on the economy later this month.
The figures suggest that gross domestic product grew by only 2 per cent in
1991, compared with previous official estimates of 2.7 per cent. The new
figure is markedly lower than the 4.2 per cent growth achieved in 1990, and
while it remains above an estimated 1.3 per cent average growth for the
European Community last year, the extent of the slowdown is more pronounced
than had been thought.
There was a smaller than expected rise, of about 2 per cent in real terms,
in investment, down from a rise of 7.3 per cent in 1990, while the use of
industrial capacity is calculated to have declined by between 2 and 3
percentage points.
According to INE, exports grew by only 1 per cent, while imports rose by 6.4
per cent with a strong increase in consumer goods imports.
These latest figures underlie Portugal's difficulties in maintaining a high
growth rate when its most important trading partners are in recession. They
will worry the authorities, whose aim is to maintain growth well above the
Community average while sharply cutting inflation  - which was 11.4 per cent
last year  - in an effort to bridge the gap between Portugal and its richer
EC partners.
Central bank officials said at the weekend they were maintaining their
estimate of 2.7 per cent growth for last year, though other economists
suggested growth could turn out to have been even lower than the 2 per cent
envisaged by INE.

FT  17 MAR 92 / France divided on Arab links: The reformulation of a 'ball
and chain' relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE has appeared much more sympathetic to the engineers of the coup which
two months ago interrupted Algeria's first multi-party elections since the
recent visit to Paris of Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the Algerian foreign minister.
It has underlined this support by increasing a revolving line of credit,
granted in 1990, from FFr3bn (Pounds 300m) to FFr4bn. However, such gestures
cannot conceal the very contradictory reactions of the French political
establishment to events in Algeria.
This confusion stands in contrast to the reactions of some leading French
industrialists and of the former prime minister Raymond Barre.
Mr Barre believes that France should consider a bold gesture, such as
deferring payments on Algeria's FFr33bn French state guaranteed debt for two
years. This would give the country breathing space at a time when a 74 per
cent debt service ratio is throttling its economy.
According to Mr Barre: 'We (France) could play an active role, together with
the Japanese, who are Algeria's second largest creditor, and the IMF to help
the Algerians implement the economic reforms aimed at liberalising the
economy and creating jobs which they have already set in motion.'
However, France's leaders are facing the most serious domestic crisis in a
decade and President Francois Mitterrand appears disinterested in foreign
affairs beyond Europe.
The authorities are further hamstrung by the growing popularity, in the run
up to next Sunday's regional elections, of the extreme right-wing National
Front led by Mr Jean Marie Le Pen, who was an active fighter for the
'Algerie Francaise' 30 years ago and makes no secret of his anti-Arab
feelings.
The illusion that France still had an 'independent' Arab policy was
shattered by the war which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 18 months ago.
Recent events in Algeria have underlined how important it is for France to
reformulate what can only be described as the 'ball and chain' relationship
it maintains with its former African colonies.
Nowhere is that need more urgent than with regard to Algeria  - yet with no
country is it more difficult. A love-hate relationship, born of a 132-year
history, encompassing a cruel war of independence which toppled the French
Fourth Republic in 1958, makes it difficult for the French to treat Algerian
issues on their merits.
It was Mr Mitterrand, then Minister of the Interior, who ordered that the
Algerian 'rebellion' of November 1954, be ruthlessly suppressed. Many of his
ministers were among the 2.5m French officers and conscripts sent out to
fight a war to 'maintain order'.
French officials and businessmen are, however, split into two camps. Some
evoke the rank France holds in the world in words which sound like Gaullism
writ small. They strongly resent what they feel is the intrusion of Italy,
Spain, Japan and the US into their former colonies.
Others are convinced that now is the time, with Algeria in desperate need of
support, that France should be lending a helping hand.
Leading French companies such as Total and Peugeot are convinced that the
stability of Algeria, one of the few middle-ranking third world countries
where French attitudes might influence other leading western players, is
vital to French strategic interests.
For the other camp, the French ambassador to Algiers, Mr Jean Audibert, four
months ago publicly dismissed Italy's decision to refinance its
state-guaranteed debt with Algeria as akin to a 'diplomacy of trinkets'.
Italy's action enabled Algeria's policy of refinancing its Dollars 23.9bn
foreign debt rather than rescheduling it to get off the ground. Mr
Audibert's views reflect that of an older generation in France, some of them
former colonial administrators, who appear to regret the days when France
ruled the roost.
A younger generation of officials and France's larger and more successful
companies have no such worries. They recognise that France must work with
Italy and Spain to promote Mediterranean interests in the EC as Germany will
fight for the east European countries. They feel that North Africa is as
important to southern Europe as Mexico is to the US. They know that Algeria
has not been an easy customer, but are convinced that if France succeeds in
formulating a more focused regional approach, it will avoid the kind of
sudden crisis it is all too prone to in its relations, notably with Morocco
and Algeria.
The so-called Five plus Five meetings, which bring together south European
and north African countries, were launched a few years ago, at France's
initiative, but it is only recently that other European participants have
begun to see a French desire to break with the past.
French businessmen are mindful of Algeria's vast reserves of natural gas,
and the fact that, if economic reforms meet with even partial success, the
Algerian market in cars, pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs is well worth
fighting for. Nor are they unaware of the presence in France of at least
1.5m north African immigrants and of the strong pressure to emigrate from a
country where unemployment among the 16-24 age group is running at 48 per
cent.
They accept that deferring some of Algeria's debt payments will not be cheap
but suspect it might be a lot less expensive than the fall-out which
economic breakdown in North Africa's largest country would produce.

FT  17 MAR 92 / Nationalists gain in Catalan elections

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONALISTS made significant gains in Sunday's elections to Catalonia's
autonomous parliament, which returned Mr Jordi Pujol to power for a fourth
successive mandate with an increased majority, writes Tom Burns from Madrid.
Mr Pujol's centre-right Convergencia i Unio (CiU) coalition gained 71 seats
in the 135-member Catalan parliament, two more than in the 1988 elections.
Meanwhile, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), a party that for the
first time was openly calling on voters to back independence for Catalonia,
doubled its share of the vote to 8 per cent and raised its membership in the
assembly from six to 11.
The Socialist party was the chief casualty of the poll, with the loss of
three seats and returning of 39 members its worst result to date in the
Catalan legislature. The ebbing support for the local socialists could
indicate a growing disillusionment with the Madrid government  - where the
socialists hold sway - in the wake of a succession of corruption scandals.
The Communist party, formerly the third force in Catalonia, lost two of the
nine seats it held four years ago, while the Madrid-based conservative
party, Partido Popular, won seven seats, one more than in 1988, and the
small liberal party, Centro Democratico y Social (CDS), which had three
members in the outgoing parliament, failed to return a single member.
The polls highlighted the growth of nationalism in Catalonia with the
locally based parties, CiU and ERC, obtaining 61 per cent of the vote
between them, up from 55 per cent in 1988's regional polls.
Mr Pujol now emerges a powerbroker in national politics, with general
elections due next year likely to rob the Socialists of their present slim
majority and elect a hung parliament. The CiU returns between 18 and 20
members to the Madrid parliament in general elections.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Defence Commission yesterday unveiled a far-reaching study, based
on two-years' work, advocating zero growth in military expenditure over the
next 15 years.
The commission's recommendation for military spending is 13 per cent lower
than that made last Friday by Admiral Torols Rein, the Chief of Defence. It
was based on an absolute minimum requirement enabling Norway to defend
itself against an invasion for between two and four weeks while awaiting
allied reinforcements.
The difference in expenditure between the two recommendations is about
NKr50bn (Dollars 7.8bn) from 1993, excluding Nato infrastructure costs. But
the commission's recommendation is based on its study of the perception of
future military threat to Norway and what is necessary for the country to
maintain a credible defence structure.
The commission's study calls for investment of NKr356.26bn in the period
1993-2008 while Admiral Rein recommends expenditure of NKr421bn during
1995-2012.
Mr Kaare Willoch, the former conservative prime minister who headed the
Commission, said 14 out of 15 members agreed investment in military hardware
should comprise 30 per cent of investment during the next decade. The
commission therefore sees a marked shift in military investment from
personnel and administration to hardware for the airforce and navy.
The two studies will be used as working documents by the Ministry of Defence
to plan long-term defence investment.

<TEXT>
IRAQ and the United Nations are expected to resume talks later this week on
the possible sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil but no definite date
has yet been set, a UN spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from New
York.
The spokesman also announced that the UN team would be led by Mr
Giandomenico Picco, the assistant secretary-general who led efforts to
secure the release of hostages held in Lebanon.
Mr Picco, an Italian national, will replace Mr Kofi Annan of Ghana, the
assistant secretary-general who headed UN negotiators at previous talks with
Iraq in Vienna in January but has since been assigned other duties.
The UN announced last Friday that the oil talks would resume this week, but
gave no precise date.
The announcement followed a meeting between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, who had
been taking part in a Security Council debate last week on Iraq's alleged
failure to comply with council resolutions requiring the scrapping of its
weapons of mass destruction.
Iraqi sources in Baghdad said earlier yesterday the Vienna talks might begin
next week rather than this week, since Mr Aziz had not yet returned home and
reported to his government.
Iraq is bound by UN economic sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990.
The Security Council last September authorised the sale of Dollars 1.6bn of
oil over a six-month period to enable Baghdad to buy nearly Dollars 1bn
worth of humanitarian supplies, to begin feeding a UN Gulf war reparations
fund, and to pay for the destruction under UN supervision of Iraq's weapons
potential. Baghdad has so far rejected the plan on grounds it would be of
limited benefit while violating the country's sovereignty.
Some council members have expressed readiness to renew the oil sales scheme
in some form, after it expires on March 18, but may first wish to await the
outcome of the next round of talks in Vienna.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (29): An enigmatic survivor / Profile of
General Ibrahim Babangida
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE combination of an engaging but enigmatic personality, a soldier's
ruthlessness and a politician's adaptability, have kept General Ibrahim
Babangida in one of Africa's toughest jobs for nearly seven years. It is too
soon for a definitive assessment of the man who seized power in a palace
coup in August 1985.
But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that he and his government have
fallen far short of the admittedly ambitious objectives the president set
himself not long after taking office: the inculcation of a 'new
socio-political order' and the implementation of a structural adjustment
programme that would transform the economy. Corruption remains endemic, an
attempt to create a so-called 'new breed' of politicians has failed, and the
adjustment programme is in serious difficulties.
The creation of nine new states last year seems ill-advised. The move may
have some benefits: it continues the fragmentation of ethnic and regional
blocks and further blurs the potentially dangerous north-south divide. But
the country cannot afford nine new state administrations and the necessary
infrastructure. To many observers, the decision smacked of patronage.
In one respect, at least, few Nigerians could be better equipped to lead a
country with such a turbulent history. No-one knows more about coups than
the president, and few officers have enjoyed as much respect from peers and
other ranks alike.
Born in 1941 in Minna, President Babangida joined the army as an officer
cadet in 1963. After graduating from the Military Training College, Kaduna,
he went on to attend military courses in India and Britain.
But it was in the Biafran civil war in the 1970s that he won his spurs and a
reputation as a 'soldier's soldier'.
It is said that he has played a key role in most of Nigeria's coups.
Certainly he had an important part in ending the coup attempt in February
1976 in which the head of state, Gen Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated. He
was also prominent in the overthrow of President Shehu Shagari at the end of
1983; within a year he was preparing to take office himself.
His deft political footwork and resilience under pressure won him the
nickname 'Maradona of Nigerian politics'. Time and again he has emerged from
the fray with an unexpected goal, or at least still on his feet after some
rugged tackle. Perhaps the best example was the debate in 1986 on the merits
of seeking an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan.
The country vigorously opposed it; the president adroitly treated this as
support for an economic reform package as stringent as the Fund would have
demanded; the Fund then endorsed the reforms, thus paving the way to
external debt rescheduling. The president kept faith with the electorate by
not borrowing from the Fund, although entitled to do so  .. and all parties
were satisfied.
Sometimes he scored an own goal. The administration remains saddled with
what most observers believe was a serious misjudgment: the decision in
August 1985 to change from observer status to full membership of the
Organisation of Islamic States which had the effect of exacerbating
religious tensions between the country's Moslem and Christian communities.
But it is in recent years that the president seems to have lost the
country's respect and affection which partly inspired the Maradona tag, now
seldom used.
The imposition of a two-party system and the arbitrary decrees which
regulate the transition to civilian rule (discussed elsewhere), the other
abuses of human rights documented in a report last year by Africa Watch, an
independent monitor of civil liberties on the continent, and pervasive
corruption, have eroded his popularity.
The process has been hastened by the prominent role of his wife, Maryam,
founder and patron of the Better Life for Rural Women programme. Its aims
may be admirable, but its budget, accounting and evaluation procedures are
not entirely clear. It has won the enthusiastic support of wives of state
governors and other dignitaries, prompting the suggestion from Nigerian
sceptics that the programme should be renamed 'Better Life for Ruling
Women'.
But President Babangida nevertheless retains a political flair that can take
everybody by surprise, and retrieve a seemingly hopeless situation. This
flair was dramatically demonstrated earlier this month: he bit the exchange
rate bullet, bringing within reach a vital IMF agreement which many
observers thought might prove impossible. After nearly two days of
consultations at the presidency in Abuja, the new federal capital, Mr
Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of the Central Bank, was authorised to make a
nationally televised broadcast announcing the float of the naira.
It stunned Nigerians. So much so that, far from outrage as the official rate
of the national currency fell from 10.5 to 18 to the dollar, the news was
received with what seemed like bewildered acquiescence. Equally astonished -
and also mightily relieved  - were the diplomatic community and western
creditors.
The man many were starting to write off had dramatically come good.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (30): Inconsistencies' in state funds / A
look at a World Bank report on the oil 'windfall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS become known as the Gulf war 'windfall', and questions about what
happened to it go to the heart of Nigerian politics and economic management.
The 'windfall' - Nigeria's higher-than-expected export earnings in 1990,
after world oil prices rose amid fears that the conflict would disrupt
supplies - is a sensitive subject. The Financial Times's correspondent in
Lagos was deported last year after reporting that economists working for
donor agencies calculated that some Dollars 3bn in oil receipts during the
period July 1990 and May 1991 were not accounted for.
Reacting to the allegations, the federal government said 'categorically that
the estimates of 'oil windfall' contained in (the FT) story are without
foundation'.
The FT's reports were designed 'to deliberately mislead the public,
including our development partners' the statement said. 'The federal
government remains undaunted and unshaken in her determination to run an
open and responsible government,' it concluded.
The FT has since obtained a copy of an unpublished World Bank summary of the
findings of its report on public expenditure management in Nigeria. The
report, researched in early 1991, makes clear the Bank's concern about how
the windfall was disbursed.
'Oil receipts were some Dollars 2bn higher in 1990 than the Bank had been
projecting at the beginning of the year,' says the report.
The transition to civilian rule added to the pressures on government to
spend and 'led to a breakdown in fiscal and monetary discipline during 1990
. . . not only characterised by additional spending and monetary expansion,
but also by a major surge in expenditures bypassing budgetary mechanisms of
expenditure authorisation and control.'
The report continues: 'The practice of spending oil revenues through
dedication accounts and other devices outside the purview of statutory
budgetary and accounting controls has re-emerged on a large scale.
'In addition, significant domestic currency spending appears to have
occurred without any apparent budgetary authorisations,' says the report. In
an analysis that raises serious questions about government management, the
World Bank study makes these further points:
'Some Dollars 1.5bn equivalent of revenues was allocated under ill-defined
and poorly documented procedures outside of the usual accounting framework';
There are 'accounting inconsistencies' in the handling of crude oil revenues
paid into the Federal Government Account, for distribution by the Federation
Account Committee. 'One such inconsistency is the direct payment for certain
contracts from the offshore oil revenue accounts, and the diversion of the
gross proceeds from fixed volumes of sales of Federation oil to special
accounts for the use of the (state-owned) Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation - and perhaps other agencies - for certain project and other
expenditures. Certain obligations also appear to be met by direct shipments
of oil.'
Under agreements with the IMF and the World Bank in 1986, says the report,
'all but two of such 'dedication account' expenditures were supposed to be
discontinued.
'However, Bank staff attempts to account for the proceeds from oil
production in 1990 produced a shortfall of foreign exchange inflows
reflected in the official Central Bank cashflow of around Dollars 2.1bn, of
which only Dollars 0.6bn can be explained by the two continuing dedication
accounts';
In addition, the report goes on, 'there is evidence to suggest that some
N5.6bn counterpart of around Dollars 0.5bn of foreign exchange oil receipts
reported by the Central Bank did not pass to the Federation Account
Committee for distribution.'
'Transactions on the Federation Stabilisation Account for 1989 and 1990
suggest that non-budgetary expenditures of about N10bn have been financed
out of these accounts.' (Under an informal practice started in 1989 the
Federation Account Committee has been depositing a portion of its revenues,
including some of the 'windfall receipts' into a 'stabilisation' account.
'The exact status of this account remains unclear,' says the Bank report).
'These 'inconsistencies' are large,' comments the Bank report: 'To the
extent that they represent actual expenditures, they imply spending outside
normal accounting and budgetary mechanisms which exceeds total budgetary
non-debt service spending of the Federal government in 1990.'
The report's findings will, say diplomats, be taken into account when issues
such as aid to Nigeria and debt rescheduling are under discussion. And it
seems appropriate that Mr Barber Conable, then World Bank president, last
year chose the new Nigerian capital of Abuja to warn: 'Accountability,
transparency, predictability (and) adherence to the rule of law' were
fundamental to development.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (25): Will the soldiers return to
barracks? / A look at the political scene in the run-up to the elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY concern that Nigeria's transition to civilian rule is going badly tends
to be tempered by astonishment that it is going at all.
Many Nigerians doubted the soldiers' promise to return to the barracks by
the end of 1992. Indeed, some still wonder if General Babangida will find a
way of staying on. But, as the president observed in his New Year address,
'events so far have proved the cynics wrong'.
If the election timetable is followed, presidential primaries begin in May.
National assembly elections take place in November, followed by the
presidential poll on December 5. On January 2, 1993, General Babangida
presides over a formal handover and Africa's most populous nation, under
military rule for 22 of the years since independence in 1960, will become a
democracy.
It is perhaps not surprising that concern about the nature of the transition
is usually expressed with caution or circumspection.
Decree 19 makes it a serious offence, punishable by a five-year jail
sentence, to oppose the transition programme. This has not deterred all the
critics. Some voices have been raised - notably from the Civil Liberties
Organisation and the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, both
Lagos-based, and there have been some outspoken commentaries in the Nigerian
press.
They have had targets aplenty, for the transition has been flawed from early
on.
In 1987, thousands of former politicians and government office holders were
banned from politics, in the hope of creating a 'new breed' of legislators
unsullied by the corrupt, pork-barrel and outright vote buying that had
characterised Nigerian politics.
Later in the year, the government decided that it would recognise only two
political parties, in an attempt to prevent the resurgence of parties which
depended heavily on an ethnic base - Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba or Ibo.
In October 1989, the government turned down all 13 organisations applying
for recognition, on the grounds that 'old lines of cleavage - ethnic,
geopolitical, religious and class - surfaced in bold relief', as President
Babangida put it.
Instead, government presided over the creation of two new parties - the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) 'a little to the left', and the National
Republican Convention (NRC), 'a little to the right.'
Baba Gana Kingibe, an articulate former ambassador from Borno, SDP chairman,
and Chief Tom Ikimi, a Lagos-based architect who heads the NRC, do their
best to make this distinction apparent. Yet the manifestos of the two
parties, drawn up by government officials, are almost identical.
Both support the structural adjustment programme - although few candidates
for any office, from either party, can bring themselves to say so on the
hustings. Both propose pressing ahead with the Ajaokuta steel project, a
multi-billion dollar white elephant.
Both advocate self-sufficiency in agriculture. The NRC offers free primary
and secondary education, the SDP says it is committed 'ultimately' to free
education at all levels.
The result is that Nigeria's election campaigns so far have had little if
any ideological debate.
There are no substantial policy differences, nor are there clear regional or
religious boundaries between the NRC and SDP. Although sometimes labelled
'north and Moslem' - the NRC  - and 'south and Christian' - the SDP - the
results of the gubernatorial election show how misleading this would be.
Lagos, for example, would have been a comfortable win for the SDP had this
been the case.
It would be fair to say that the NRC has a northern slant, its opponents a
southern bias. But to win the presidency, both parties must demonstrate
countrywide support: present rules demand that the successful candidate
requires not simply a majority of the vote, but 25 per cent of the poll in
two thirds of the states.
Government officials maintain that this clause (which applied in the 1979
and 1983 presidential elections), coupled with the imposed two-party system,
has helped break the traditional mould of Nigerian politics.
This seems optimistic. 'Ironically, the coalitions and alliances formed
under the party umbrellas are influenced by the very factors - including
hidden loyalties to old parties - which disqualified the 13 political
organisations in 1989,' notes a Kaduna lawyer.
Recent developments have further undermined the credibility of the process.
Government officials insist that the only way to prevent electoral fraud is
to continue with the open ballot system (tried and abandoned by Kenya) under
which voters line up for counting in front of a poster of their favoured
candidate.
Nor was the credibility of the process enhanced last December, when
President Babangida lifted the ban on former politicians. Not because it had
failed, he said, but because 'the new leaders had adequately adapted to the
political setting and the parties had been adequately institutionalised'.
Many Nigerians believe differently: 'The banned politicians simply could not
be kept out of the arena,' says one 'new breed' politician. 'They have the
money, influence, and experience - better have them in the open than behind
the scenes.'
Why, then does he take part at all? His explanation probably reflects the
views of many participants: 'I know the transition is flawed,' he explains,
'and I know it could fail. But if I and others like me don't work for its
success, our fears could become self-fulfilling prophecies.'
It is from the ranks of the 'old breed' that most of the front runners for
the presidency have so far emerged. Of the dozen or more NRC candidates so
far declared, three are singled out by a senior northerner who will be
involved the selection process: Umaru Shinkafi, former internal affairs
minister and head of intelligence during the 1979-83 civilian government, Dr
Lema Jibrilu, a prominent industrialist, and Adamu Ciroma, a widely
respected former Central Bank governor and ex-minister. Still waiting in the
wings is Shehu Musa, former secretary to the 1979-83 Federal Government who
was in charge of last year's national census.
'I would tip Ciroma,' says one NRC stalwart, 'but he may have offended the
army' - a reference to some trenchant comments on the soldiers'
shortcomings. No fewer than 38 (at last count) presidential hopefuls have
thrown their hats in the presidential ring. Among those leading the field is
Chief Olu Falae, former cabinet secretary and ex-finance minister in the
administration, whose close involvement with the unpopular economic reform
programme may well prove an electoral liability.
Retired Major-General Shehu Yar'adua, an influential Kaduna based
businessman, may not win the nomination, but is seen as one of the
kingmakers. But just as Shehu Shagari emerged as a compromise candidate in
1979, so it might again prove with the current favourites for office. 'The
trouble is,' said one retired politician, reviewing a list of front-runners,
'those who are capable may have too many enemies, and those with few enemies
are not up to the job.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (28): Up to 30m may not exist - Census may
spring surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIANS are about to hear just how many of them there are. Prepare for a
surprise, say government officials, who will soon release the first results
of last November's national census. 'Africa's most populous nation' may well
have far fewer than the 110m to 120m generally estimated - nearer to 90m,
rumour has it.
Nigerians may react with equanimity to this revelation. What they
particularly wish to know is where they all live, for the 30 states' share
of Federal government revenue is partly determined by population.
'People are aware that they are going to gain more from the central purse by
falsifying the head count, and they do just that,' commented the weekly
magazine West Africa. How many live where, however, may not become public
information for many months, and the reception accorded those details will
provide the most difficult test of the census.
In the meantime, it seems, Nigerians will have to settle for a basic
population count. That in itself is no mean achievement, given the
controversies of the past. There have been 11 attempts at an acceptable
national census since 1863 and on each occasion the exercise has ended in
failure, the journal noted.
The 1952 census, which put the total population at 33m, was believed to have
been an underestimate because it was widely assumed the British were
counting heads to increase revenues. In 1962, the results were not published
because leaks led to political controversy.
In the 1963 count the then Western and Eastern regions alleged that the
Northern region had inflated its own figures to ensure the federal dominance
of the Northern People's Congress. The north responded angrily:
under-populated areas in the south had been overcounted to give the southern
regions an unfair share of federal revenue, it alleged.
Ten years later General Yakubu Gowon's military government had a go - and
failed. Nigeria by then had been divided into 12 states, and the count for
the six northern states - 51.4m  - hugely outnumbered the six southern
states' 28.4m.
It was decided that since the 1963 census had produced the least
unacceptable results it should provide the base for subsequent population
figures which have assumed a growth rate ranging from 2.5 to over 3 per
cent.
The man in the hot seat this time round has been Alhaji Shehu Musa, a former
secretary to the Federal government regarded as a potential presidential
candidate. His job as chairman of the National Population Commission has
been easier than that of his predecessors. The government defused potential
religious and ethnic tensions by omitting questions on these subjects from
the questionnaire.
It was nevertheless a monumental exercise involving  1/2 m staff during the
three day exercise across 225,000 enumeration areas.

Business Visitor's Guide

<TEXT>
LAST YEAR, shortly before Christmas, Nigeria fulfilled a 16-year-old dream
that had been cherished successively by six governments and four presidents.
On December 12 President Ibrahim Babangida cleared out of Dodan Barracks in
Lagos and took up his residence in the Presidential Palace in Abuja.
His move marked the official, and many say irrevocable, inauguration of
Abuja as the new administrative federal capital of Nigeria.
However, a shortage of housing and office space may hold back the pace at
which Abuja transforms itself into a fully-fledged capital.
Foreign embassies remain in Lagos for the time being, though many plan to
staff offices in Abuja by the end of this year.
The British High Commission has already established a rudimentary office in
the Sheraton Hotel where British businessmen can get advice.
While most banks and corporate head offices will stay in Lagos for the next
12 months, Abuja will increasingly become the place that foreign businessmen
have to visit to see officials.
Getting there
Driving is still recommended by many old Nigeria hands as an alternative to
erratic and often frustrating experiences when catching flights. The drive
from Lagos takes eight hours on fairly good roads. ADC, Concord, Okada and
Nigerian Airways all operate daily flights between Lagos and Abuja and the
new capital is also served by airlines from most of Nigeria's other main
urban centres.
If you are flying from Lagos it is not advisable to try to reserve or buy
your ticket beforehand. Go to the airport - beware of touts, if possible -
and confirm that the aircraft is actually going to fly and that you have a
definite confirmed seat before you buy your ticket. Friday can be a hectic
day to fly out of Abuja as many officials head home to Lagos for the
weekend.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (24): Learning lessons the hard way -
Julian Ozanne investigates the 'appalling' crisis in higher education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE libraries of Nigeria's universities most foreign periodicals stop
dead in the early 1980s. When the money ran out the subscriptions of all but
the most essential were cancelled. Few new books have been brought from
abroad in the past 10 years.
At Ibadan University, the oldest in Nigeria, a display in the library shows
mutilated books - partly, academics say, a result of the desperation of
students hunting critically short reading materials. The number of foreign
medical journals purchased has been slashed from 350 to 20-25.
On campuses across the country rooms made for two people are crammed with
four times that number.
Medical, science and technology faculties are equipped with outdated
equipment, much of which has broken down because of a lack of spare parts.
Chemistry departments are even short of reagents.
Many departments have also experienced a brain drain, especially at the
senior level in medicine, science and literature, as Nigeria's academics
have headed overseas, particularly to the Middle East and the US, in search
of better pay and conditions. At least Dollars 120m of unfinished projects
have been abandoned until better days.
A recent report by a government appointed commission into higher education
under Chief Gray Longe says: 'During their visits to the institutions, the
commission was appalled by the physical conditions of most of them.'
The origins of the crisis lie in an unplanned and ad hoc expansion in
universities and enrolments which grew faster than anywhere else in Africa,
followed shortly afterwards by a severe lack of funds caused by the fall in
international oil prices.
Between 1972 and 1982, student enrolment in universities increased almost
fivefold from nearly 21,000 to nearly 98,000. By 1990, the figure had
increased to 180,000 students in 31 institutions and graduate unemployment
was rising dramatically as universities failed to match manpower needs. The
rapid growth in the Nigerian university system took place with little regard
to costs and with particularly high proportions of expenditure devoted to
administration (currently more than 50 per cent of recurrent expenditure)
and post-graduate programmes.
According to a World Bank report, recurrent expenditure per student fell by
38 per cent between 1982 and 1986 alone.
Devaluation of the naira throughout the 1980s has had a particularly severe
effect on the ability of universities to pay expatriate academics and to buy
books, spare parts and western technology. According to one educationalist,
the naira cost of an imported book today is at least 25 times what it was in
1981.
'We have been in a severe crisis for the past decade and inevitably there
has been a drop in the quality of higher education,' said Professor Ayo
Banjo, the former chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors.
'There must be a restriction on the numbers of students but this is not what
the politicians want to hear,' he says.
Combating costs, restructuring the expenditure priorities and limiting
further expansion of enrolment and institutions have been identified as the
critical factors for the development of higher education in Nigeria.
Some economists also say the government needs to reorientate its budgetary
expenditures away from defence spending and questionable large projects to
education and health.
Within the education budget, a greater proportion of resources should be
devoted to the 13.5m primary school students and the 4m secondary education
students.
In its recommendations, the Longe Akinkube Commission called for the
declaration of a 10-year period of emergency to restore higher education, a
freeze on new university establishment at least until 2000, the development
of an open university and distance learning, the establishment of a higher
education fund, cost reduction and prudent management and a minimum of 15
per cent of budgetary expenditure to be devoted to education. (In 1988 the
Federal government only devoted 3.7 per cent of total budget directly to the
sector.)
Some steps have already been taken by the government, including much greater
cost recovery measures. Students in Nigeria now pay for their meals and
contribute N90 a year for accommodation - a sum which most economists say
needs to be raised dramatically.
But much greater reforms will have to be undertaken to try to restore
standards and rehabilitate the decimated infrastructure. 'Universities are
at a key stage,' says the World Bank. 'Either they can cling to history
which no longer exists and . . . face a drastic fall in the quality and
effectiveness of education they provide or they can carry out a major
reform.'
Among the reforms agreed by the Federal government are deregulation of
postgraduate fees for full cost recovery; reduction of the student lodging
element in the government block grant; increased level of student loans;
serious cuts in administrative staff and a maximum ceiling of 60 per cent of
the block grant to be devoted to salaries by 1994-95.
However, there is a widespread acceptance that there is little hope for much
more resources to be provided by Federal government which must concentrate
on the serious crisis in the primary education sector.
To aid the cash-strapped university sector, the Bank has approved a Dollars
116.5m loan to stimulate the search for cost reduction measures in
universities.
The loan will be made available for book and equipment purchases and to
supplement expatriate salaries, especially in science and technology. The
loan is expected to provide about 17 per cent of total expenditure available
over the next four years.
To qualify for the access to the funds each university must meet eligibility
criteria, spread over three years, which include staff reduction, course
rationalisation, increased self-financing at hostels and increased revenues
from non-governmental sources such as consultancy services.
The Bank loan and greater cost recover will provide some financial relief
but unless the Federal government resists political pressures by the states
to create new institutions, which will almost certainly increase under
civilian rule, and puts some limitation on the amount of new enrolments,
further decline in standards will be inevitable.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (23): A national treasure plundered - Lack
of funds and international dealers are destroying a remarkable cultural
heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SADLY for Nigeria, her remarkable cultural heritage is being traded in the
markets of Amsterdam, Paris and New York.
A visit to the National Museum in Lagos provides an eye-opener on the
treasures Nigeria has to offer. The Nok terracottas from Zaria province,
dating back to the period 900BC-200AD, are the oldest pieces so far
discovered. The collection of elaborate Igbo-Ukwu bronze artefacts,
discovered in Anambra state, come from the 9th-10th centuries and the fine
terracotta busts from Ife, the city state of the Yoruba, are from the
11th-15th centuries. Probably the best known pieces are the Benin bronzes,
which depict life at the Benin court from the arrival of the Portuguese in
the 15th century to 1897, when a British force sacked Benin city.
As Professor Ade Obayemi, former director-general of the National Commission
for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), explains: 'We have to battle against
internationally financed speculators and dealers. As soon as you make an
announcement of a find, the places are cleaned out.' The thieves often
conduct their own digs and, as Professor Obayemi admits, are 'well connected
with the police and security systems'.
In many ways, the superb quality of Nigerian antiquities is their undoing.
In terms of monetary value, a Benin bronze head was sold at auction in
London by Christie's in 1989 for Pounds 1.2m. The provenance of pieces,
which appear at auction, usually dates back to the colonial period, and
auctioneers say they are reluctant to accept pieces which may have more
recently been stolen.
For the modern-day smuggler, the market is made up of a network of private
dealers and collectors whose financial muscle far exceeds that of the NCMM.
The smuggler is aided by the failure of some countries, notably the UK, to
sign Unesco agreements banning the illegal trade in antiquities.
However, the NCMM has scored some successes. In 1987, the museum in the city
of Jos was raided and a Benin bronze head, originally taken by the British
and returned at independence, was again stolen. In December 1990, it turned
up at the Rudolf Mangisch gallery in Switzerland and has since been
repatriated to Nigeria. However, the cost of guaranteeing security for the
piece in Jos museum is prohibitive and the head was placed in the NCMM
vaults, out of public view.
Inadequate funding of the NCMM is probably as great a threat to Nigerian
cultural heritage as the international dealers. The entrance fee to the
Lagos museum is all of one naira - a US nickel (five cents). A look at the
exhibits immediately reveals some of the problems to be faced. Litmus
humidity indicators are placed in each cabinet with the words 'examine
exhibit if pink' - indicating excess humidity. Nearly all the indicators are
pink, and have been for some time. The present director of Museum and
Monuments, Dr CK Gonyok, is acutely aware of the problem: 'We don't have the
laboratories, chemicals, specialised pins and microscopes to take adequate
care of these works,' he explained to a Nigerian newspaper which had
expressed its concern. While the exhibition at the National Museum is
magnificent, it is also permanent. Lack of money keeps more than 100,000
other pieces in the vaults.
The worst effects of under-funding can be seen at Nigeria's historic
monuments. The ancient city wall of Kano, once 15 metres high, can now be
stepped over and the walls of Zaria and Benin are also threatened. While the
cost of reconstruction is enormous, the federal budget for maintenance and
rehabilitation of national monuments has been derisory - in 1987, just
N3,000.
More recent buildings, such as the 19th century Brazilian-style houses built
in south-west Nigeria by emancipated slaves returning to Nigeria from
Brazil, are also being destroyed. Preservation orders are often ignored by
the owners of the buildings, who prefer to capitalise on the value of the
land for development. The nation's architectural heritage is fast being
replaced by western-influenced high-rise steel and glass blocks. The
protruding exhaust pipes of electric generators are often the only
architectural admission to the Nigerian context.
An adequate response from the government is essential, as is public
confidence that the government is sincere in its policy towards the nation's
heritage. As well as the vast public collection of antiquities, some of the
finest examples are those owned privately by Nigerians. Many owners want to
open private museums, but are restrained through fear that (in spite of
assurances to the contrary) once exhibited the items will be declared public
property. They also doubt the security of NCMM vaults. One collector admits
that 'the risk is sufficient for me even to keep some pieces abroad. It's a
dilemma similar to the Elgin Marbles; under present conditions, where will
these precious items be most secure?'
Until people trust government policy, funding for the NCMM is improved, and
the international community recognises the need to protect Nigeria's
cultural heritage, the future will remain bleak. The deterioration and
destruction of national monuments will continue. And Nigerian antiquities
will continue to become the property of international collectors, their
status degraded to that of expensive objets d'art to be displayed in the
living-rooms of Europe and America.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (21): Growing pains curb investors - Palm
Oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER this year, in the middle of Nigeria's blazing dry season, a bush
fire raged for four days across 450 hectares of oil-palm plantation.
For Presco, Nigeria's only fully private foreign investment in the palm oil
sector, it was a minor setback in an ambitious and taxing agricultural
venture, the outcome of which remains uncertain.
The sector, which 14 years ago was a foreign exchange earner, has been
identified by the government and foreign donors as an area for development.
But Presco's fully integrated palm oil project, in Edo State, demonstrates
the difficulties of successful investment in the industry in an inconsistent
government policy environment.
Experts say the sector's profitability is dependent on a ban on imported
palm oil, introduced in 1986 to stimulate domestic production. The
considerable investment now under way in the sector, by the World Bank,
European Community and private companies, is predicated on that ban being
maintained, at least until the naira is realistically priced.
Last October, however, the government succumbed to politically connected
businessmen, and allowed an 'import waiver' for 100,000 tonnes of palm oil.
Further pressure resulted in waivers being issued for as much as 260,000
tonnes, although it is expected that only between 140,000 and 160,000 tonnes
will actually come into the country. The move was a blow to investors.
'Agricultural investments of this kind don't show returns for at least seven
years - that is the gestation time,' says one investor. 'What really upsets
people is that you wake up on a Monday morning and the whole ball game has
changed. There is no consistency of policy so how do you plan for the
future?'
However, with the naira now floated the competitiveness of the local palm
oil sector with imports will have been considerably boosted and some of the
traders who obtained waivers hoping for quick profits may be caught out.
In the mid-1960s, Nigeria exported 400,000 tonnes of crude palm oil and a
number of countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, came to study the
successful industry and take away seedlings. Then came the three-year
Biafran civil war, fought across Nigeria's southern palm-oil belt, which
disrupted production and destroyed many of the mills and plantations.
The war was followed closely by the oil boom which made domestic production
uncompetitive with cheap palm oil imports from Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia. Last year, it was estimated that domestic production - about 70
per cent of which comes from wild palm groves and small backyard crushing
operations - was between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes, leaving a shortfall of
at least 300,000 tonnes against estimated consumer demand of 900,000 tonnes.
In spite of the ban on palm oil imports, 80,000-100,000 tonnes of smuggled
oil has continued to reach the market to plug part of the shortfall.
For more than a decade, the government has been trying to encourage domestic
producers. The World Bank has been active in funding the sector since 1982
and the ban was introduced in 1986.
As part of its drive to stimulate agricultural production, the government of
former president Muhammadu Buhari in 1985 instructed Nigeria's large trading
and manufacturing companies that they should invest in domestic food
production or face losing government allocated import licences.
Presco's palm-oil project, designed in 1985 by President Industries, a
textile company belonging to the Chandrai Group, is one of the few
agricultural investments undertaken under that policy which have not yet
been written off and which stand a chance of turning a profit one day.
Seven years and N148m later, Presco has just started production of oil. Half
of its 6,000-hectare concession has been planted with improved variety
Tenerra oil palms; the 10 tonnes-an-hour mill is fully operational and the
refinery is just about to be commissioned. A packaging plant is also
on-stream. Earlier this year President Industries sold 33 per cent of its
shares to a Belgium company, SEAT, which is managing the project.
If the project is successful, it will be because of its fully integrated
design, from raw materials to finished product. It will also be a result of
sound management. But the risks are considerable. Any big agricultural
project must start from scratch - clearing, planting, developing
infrastructure such as roads, housing and schools - and must then bear the
considerable foreign exchange risks of investment in machinery.
Other investments in the sector include:
A Dollars 70m World Bank project to increase annual production by 100,000
tonnes, by rehabilitating old oil palm plantations and oil mills, building
two new mills, encouraging small holder planting of 17,500 hectares and
assisting the development of improved seedlings by the Nigerian Institute
For Oilpalm Research;
A Dollars 138m European Community Project to reclaim 27,000 hectares of
land, plant 7,000 hectares of palm oil and rehabilitate and invest in new
oil mills and refinery.
Both projects depend on the government's policy of privatising the poorly
managed palm oil estates. A successful privatisation of Okumu Oil Palm
Company took place in 1990, with a Belgian company, Endofina, taking 40 per
cent of the equity. But privatisation of the other big palm oil companies -
Akwapalm, Risonpalm and Adapalm  - has been slow because of vested interests
in the state governments which own the companies.
Investors and foreign donors believe that, with the right domestic policies,
the palm oil sector will be a significant growth area during the next
decade.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (22): Not yet out of the woods - Julian
Ozanne ventures through a protected rain forest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFRICA'S blazing sun rarely penetrates the thick evergreen canopy of the
Okumu rain forest, one of the last protected areas of primeval rain forest
in Nigeria's southern equatorial belt.
Amid huge mahoganies, irokos and other tropical hardwoods which stretch up
to the light through dense green foliage, it is possible to imagine what it
was like before man walked the earth.
As you slash your way through matted vegetation, which appears to have
rioted in a frenzy of anarchy, the stillness of the forest is suddenly
broken by cracking branches. Baboons and monkeys, including the rare
white-throated monkey found only in Nigeria, scatter quickly at the sound of
human approach, swinging through the trees, some of which are over 150
metres tall.
Other animals - including buffalo, elephant, duiker and genet  - are equally
cautious of human encroachment. Insects, snakes and birds, including many
varieties of African parrot, are abundant and locals swear by the medicinal
properties of many trees.
Six years ago, logging was banned within 112 sqaure kilometres of the
forest, and the government and the Nigerian Conservation Foundation
established a sanctuary in the Okumu forest, in Edo state. The sanctuary
policy may be one of the last hopes for preserving an invaluable gene pool
of flora and fauna in the face of the ravages of timber merchants, farmers
and hunters.
Nigeria's southern states were once covered by rain forest. Fifty years of
uncontrolled exploitation, rapid population growth and land pressure have
taken a devastating toll on thousands of square kilometres of primary
forest. According to estimates, only 5 per cent of the original rain forest
cover is left today. The last 15 per cent disappeared in the past 15 years.
Many species of flora and fauna, perhaps vital to medical research, were
destroyed before they could be discovered.
About 150km south of the Okumu forest, in the timber town of Sapele, the
evidence of continued wanton destruction is starkly apparent. Along the lush
banks of the Jemeson river, hundreds of small saw millers, who account for
an estimated 90 per cent of total timber products, have set up operations in
corrugated tin shacks. In the water, hundreds of tropical hardwood logs,
tied together by rope and chains, have been floated down river.
According to a senior executive of African Timber and Plywood Company, a
division of United Africa Company (UAC), at least 40-50 per cent of the
small saw millers' throughput is illegally logged.
'We only take trees with a girth of more than 1.3 metres,' said the
executive. 'This gives the forest a chance to partially regenerate. But the
illegal loggers come in after us and cut down trees with much smaller
girths.'
A further problem is that government concessions are granted on a maximum
period of between five and 10 years - too short to encourage the operators
to have a sustainable logging strategy which would allow the forest to
recover. Many concessions were also granted, under the regime of former
President Shehu Shagari, to little-known operators without a proper analysis
of their economic impact.
Reports from Sapele and Warri also suggest that, in spite of a government
ban on timber exports, logs and sawn timber continue to leave the country
illegally.
Efforts by the big timber companies, such as A T &amp; P and Piedmont Timber, to
switch their raw material source to plantation forests such as Gmalina have
little impact on deforestation. Plans to start regeneration projects are
costly and unlikely to come into effect without significant funds from
foreign donors.
'The real problem is the massive, seemingly unstoppable population explosion
and the complete inability of the government to police the controls it has
established,' says one environmentalist. 'Its a very bleak picture for the
future of the environment.'
The continuing destruction of the rain forests of southern Nigeria has
already had serious effects on severe soil erosion - common in the southern
states of Edo, Anambra, Imo and Abia - and to the silting of rivers, which
threatens Nigeria's unique mangrove swamps with their rich ecosystem and
fish-breeding potential. The deforestation has also had unquantifiable
effects on the threat to the ozone layer and on biological diversity.
'In Nigeria now, the situation with rain forests is a stop-gap
backs-against-the-wall conservation effort,' says Mr Philip Hall of the
Nigerian Conservation Foundation. 'We have to realise that there is no such
thing as successful sustainable managed forestry. It has not yet been
demonstrated anywhere.'
Mr Hall believes the remedy lies in conservation efforts which compensate
farmers in the surrounding areas, in return for denying them the
exploitation of the rain forest. In Okumu and Oban Hills, in eastern
Nigeria's Cross River state, the NCF is pioneering agricultural projects
such as bee-keeping and fish-farming for the local residents, as
alternatives to logging and hunting.
Destruction of the rain forests is one of the many severe environmental
problems facing Nigeria and its population of 110m, which almost tripled
between 1963 and 1991 and is still growing at an estimated 3.4 per cent a
year. In the arid savannahs of the north and middle-belt zones, rapid
deforestation for firewood and overgrazing is already causing
desertification, and could lead to an energy crisis.
A recent World Bank report said Nigeria was losing Dollars 5bn a year as a
result of environmental degradation caused by soil damage, water
contamination, deforestation, desertification, flooding, gully and coastal
erosion, inefficient sewerage, water hyacinth and fishery and wildlife
destruction.
The recent establishment of a Federal Environmental Protection Agency and a
National Resources Conservation Council are steps in the right direction.
But time is running out.
'The government must take more radical and politically difficult decisions
fast and enforce them rigidly,' said Mr Hall. 'Otherwise a major,
irreversible environmental crisis is just around the corner.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (20): Heavy rains hit crop - Cocoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S COCOA production, like that of other big West African producers,
appears to be heading for a significant slump.
Production for the 1991-92 crop years is expected to fall to 105,000 tonnes
from 160,000 tonnes last year; and foreign exchange earnings are set to drop
from an estimated Dollars 190-Dollars 210m last year to Dollars 110-Dollars
120m this year.
Cocoa traders in Lagos say heavy rainfall in August and September, coming
after a large mid-crop which put the cocoa trees under stress, hampered the
drying of the new cocoa crop and hit pod survival. A significant increase of
black pod disease was also recorded and early assessments suggest quality is
very poor, particularly as farmers have been blending bad with good quality
beans.
This is the first appreciable decline in production since the structural
adjustment policy, introduced in 1986, spearheaded a revival of the cocoa
industry. Boosted by significant devaluation of the naira over the past 12
months on the parallel market, prices have already increased significantly
from an average of N10,000 a tonne last season to N17,000-N19,000 a tonne
this year - a function primarily of foreign exchange speculation before the
floating of the naira.
The setback in production has come at a bad time because of the continuing
uncertainty over whether the government intends to pursue its stated
long-term policy of banning the export of raw cocoa beans to force an
expansion of local value added processing. Moreover, one of the key
weaknesses in the sector - the failure to deliver adequate extension
services to the estimated 400,000 smallholder cocoa farmers - continues to
inhibit growth.
It is now beginning to appear that, failing a dramatic increase in world
market prices, Nigerian cocoa production may not be able to recover to the
300,000-tonne level of the late 1960s. However, the foreign exchange
liberalisation carried out earlier this month may at last have resolved a
fundamental problem in the sector - the absence of long-term stable price
signals which are established by demand and supply and accurately reflect
the world market price. Prices to farmers will increase from the recent
devaluation and cocoa should no longer be the object of speculators and
businessmen exploiting the commodity for capital flight and foreign exchange
profiteering.
Since 1986 the abolition of Nigeria's inefficient state marketing boards,
price and trade liberalisation and devaluation have all significantly
reversed the local terms of trade for cocoa and boosted production, exports
and foreign exchange earnings. With the recent real devaluation, the
macro-economic climate for Nigeria cocoa producers is favourable.
But on the micro-level there has been no improvement in the lack of proper
extension services to farmers to encourage them to replant old trees, use
adequate fertiliser and pesticides at the right time or improve the quality
of their drying operations.
Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the government will or will not
introduce the ban on the export of raw beans it threatened 18 months ago.
The aim of the ban, as stated by Alhaji Abubaker Alhaji, now finance
minister, was that semi-processed and processed forms of cocoa were more
economically advantageous to the country in creating value added to raw
materials, more employment opportunities in agro-processing and enhanced
foreign exchange earnings.
However, at the time the ban was announced Nigeria had a total processing
capacity of 90,000 tonnes. The ban was suspended but in response at least
eight companies have gone ahead with plans to build processing plants; two
new ones have already started operations. Most of the new plants have
benefited from about Dollars 160m-Dollars 200m of concessional African
Development Bank loans disbursed through the import-export arm of the
Central Bank.
Dr Christopher Kolade, managing director of Cadbury Nigeria, says his
processing plant will come on stream within the next year and that some sort
of an export ban on beans will be introduced next year. 'At the time I was
against the ban because we did not have the processing capacity we needed,'
he said. 'But by the end of this year we will have installed capacity of
147,000 tonnes so that is the time to put the ban into effect and make sure
that cocoa prices are determined by local conditions and not speculation and
terminal prices for raw materials.'
However, the ban has stimulated fierce debate. Many traders argue the ban
will force down prices paid to farmers. A report prepared by a leading cocoa
trading company argues value added in local processing in countries of
origin does not cover the costs of processing.
Among the other criticisms of the policy, the report argues:
Local processors may have difficulty meeting stringent world quality
standards; Processing requires substantial investment in sophisticated
machinery and recruitment of skilled staff;
Proximity to main markets and ability to supply a consistent product at
short notice gives processors in consuming countries a competitive edge;
A high level of working capital is required to purchase the necessary beans;
Local producers cannot mix origin beans according to taste and colour
specifications of consumers, or draw beans from cheapest sources or those
with best quality/price ratio.
Dr Kolade says most opponents of the ban are speculators who fear their 'get
rich' trading operations are threatened by a viable processing industry.
Nigerian processors, he says, have been exporting cocoa products for years
and have achieved good quality and found a market.
Whatever the merits of the ban, many analysts believe ultimately the
government will go ahead with a restriction on raw bean exports.
'The government is thinking about socio-economic development so it is
strategic for me to start up processing because the government will
inevitably protect processors either through a levy on exports or a complete
ban,' says one trader turned processor. 'The government will have to find a
way for processors to make money.'
The effect on Nigeria's cocoa industry remains questionable but the
uncertainty about the ban and whether there will be sufficient demand for
farmers' beans from local processors remains a powerful constraint to
growth.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (19): Wheat controversy - Food
Self-sufficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, an issue that is central to Nigeria's attempts to reach food
self-sufficiency has become an object of intense debate and speculation this
year: whether the government will lift the import ban on wheat and wheat
flour in advance of the transition to civilian rule next January.
Import bans on wheat, maize, rice, vegetables, roots and tubers, combined
with devaluation and price liberalisation, have been critical over the past
six years in radically boosting domestic food production to about 20m tonnes
of grain equivalent food staples. New varieties of disease-resistant and
high yield cassava, better investment in roads and rural infrastructure and
wider applications of fertiliser have also had a tremendous impact on food
self-sufficiency.
Taken together, these factors, combined with good rains throughout 1991,
produced a record crop of food staples. Some agriculturalists are now
beginning to talk about the serious possibility of limited exports of
cassava, fruits and vegetables.
Few doubt the positive impact the import bans have had on boosting
incentives to farmers and fundamentally changing the dietary habits of
Nigerians who, in 1983, consumed 3m tonnes of food imports worth about
Dollars 2bn. The ban on maize, a crop which does particularly well in
Nigeria, has been successful with production now estimated at about 1.8-2m
tonnes annually.
Locally produced rice continues to be about 20-30 per cent more expensive
than international prices, which has stimulated about 150,000 tonnes of
smuggling annually. But milled rice production has expanded to about 570,000
tonnes, quality and processing techniques are improving and costs are
falling.
No such progress has been made in wheat. The ban remains an object of
nagging controversy and threatens to overshadow the considerable gains of
the past five years
Western donors believe the government is now facing up to what they describe
as the 'failure' of the wheat ban and have already conceded it is costing
the economy dear.
The ban was designed to stimulate domestic production of wheat and to
encourage Nigerians to substitute bread for other staples. For the past five
years huge sums of money have been poured into the wheat farmers of the
northern and middle belt of the country, who represent an influential
political lobby. Government officials maintained wheat production had more
than doubled to about 250,000 tonnes.
Now, however, senior officials in the ministry of agriculture admit maximum
production is 60,000-90,000 tonnes annually as a result of poor yields and
an unfavorable climate. The high cost of subsidies and unstoppable smuggling
of wheat and flour has forced the government to re-examine the economic
costs and benefits of the wheat ban.
Smuggling is draining the economy of millions of dollars of foreign exchange
and the benefits in terms of jobs and incomes of a productive milling
industry.
According to the US, which supplied 1.5m tonnes of wheat before the ban and
has been putting pressure on the government to rescind the policy, smuggled
imports of wheat and wheat flour increased from 350,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to
480,000 tonnes in 1990-91. The US argues this figure will increase to
550,000 tonnes in 1991-92 and that Nigerian wheat output slumped to
30,000-50,000 tonnes last year. The local production cost - N6,000 a tonne -
is almost two and a half times the international price of Dollars
130-Dollars 140 a tonne. Not surprisingly, the price of a loaf of bread -
about N20  - is more than double the price in neighbouring Benin and
Cameroon, whose bakeries provide the bulk of smuggled imports. Cameroon, for
example, imported 310,000 tonnes of wheat last year for a country with a
maximum domestic demand of 150,000 tonnes.
The flour millers, too, who have a combined capacity of 4m tonnes a year,
have been putting pressure on the government to rescind the ban and ensure
the value added from milling and baking is restored to the Nigerian economy
rather than given to its neighbours.
Last year, the National Association of Flour Millers, faced with a shortage
of locally available wheat, the high cost of smuggled imports and capacity
utilisation of less than 10 per cent, presented a plan to the government.
The plan called for an official import quota of 500,000 tonnes, with
allocations given to each mill based on existing capacity. A levy of N1,000
a tonne would be raised on all imports and the total, about N500m, put into
an Agricultural Development Fund to stimulate local wheat production and
provide extra resources for the sector. Millers argue this policy would
boost local industry, provide hundreds of jobs and produce bread at lower
prices.
Relaxing the import ban on wheat will be difficult for a government which
believes that imported wheat is highly subsidised and has stressed the
dangers of a developing country relying on imported foods.
However, western donors who support the millers plan say it is time the
government concentrated resources on promoting food crops which are
profitable and have a comparative advantage, such as maize, rice and
cassava, and on boosting exports of livestock, cocoa, rubber and cotton.
The wheat import ban is no longer viable, they say, and is draining the
sector of money which could be more wisely invested. Furthermore, as import
bans raise local food prices they also dampen demand for more expensive food
items such as meat, chicken and eggs.
If food production is going to keep pace with a population of about 90-100m
growing at more than 3 per cent a year, greater attention and resources must
be given to the development of small-scale, low-cost private irrigation and
tackling other problems including severe environmental degradation;
inadequate use of fertiliser; low levels of investment; appropriate
technological dissemination and better research and extension.
The tremendous gains in food production over the past five years have laid a
foundation for Nigeria's goal of food self-sufficiency.
But it may be that absolute self sufficiency is not the most economic way to
exploit the considerable energies of Nigeria's farmers.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (17): Flaring monuments to a wasting
resource / Review of the gas industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS promises to be an active year for Nigeria's gas industry. But much of
the activity remains in air-conditioned offices in Lagos and the world's
financial centres while most of the gas produced burns away in solitary
flares, monuments to the wasting of a resource the country desperately needs
to exploit.
Nigeria has proven gas reserves estimated to be more than 2.8m cubic metres,
with a further 1,800bn cu m of probable reserves. Nearly two thirds of the
gas reserves are in the Niger delta, the heart of the oil industry.
Yet the oil companies do not actively explore for gas. Discovered fields are
left untouched; while the associated gas produced as a by-product of the oil
industry is burnt away. Production in 1990 was estimated to be 27.6m cu m,
of which 77 per cent was flared.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has been trying for some years
to persuade the oil companies to tap this natural gas production for export
or to supply the domestic market. So far, only Shell has done so. But the
final decision on a number of large-scale projects will be made over the
coming months.
The Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) has a monopoly for buying gas from producing
joint ventures. About 72 per cent of its sales are to the four thermal power
plants of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). The other main
customer is the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria (NAFCON).
Commissioned 1988, NAFCON is highly profitable and plans are afoot to build
a Dollars 500m replica of the existing plant. NAFCON will remain an
important consumer of domestic gas.
The main obstacle to supplying gas to the domestic market has been the very
low price of gas, set by the government at N5.24 per thousand standard cubic
feet. This price, the oil companies have traditionally argued, has acted as
a disincentive for the oil companies to invest in gas facilities.
Yet the government policy remains to exploit the gas reserves. Over the past
year the Shell joint venture, which supplies non-associated gas from two gas
plants, has negotiated new 20-year sales agreements with NGC, replacing an
earlier informal understanding.
The agreements have rationalised the existing gas contracts and supply
arrangements, explains Philip Watts, managing director of Shell's Nigerian
subsidiary. 'We are going to get the gas business on to a proper commercial
footing,' he says.
But the terms on which the gas will be sold are still being negotiated.
Shell expects an agreement to be forthcoming over the next few months with
fiscal concessions compensating for the low supply price. 'People will only
invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the utilisation of associated gas
if there is a stable fiscal framework,' says Mr Watts.
Chevron also expects to agree terms with the government which will enable it
to go ahead with a Dollars 500m project to build a plant at its Escravos
terminal. The plant will recover 300 cu ft per day of associated gas which
is currently being flared. NNPC has been keen for Chevron to tap this
associated gas, but the project has been held up for more than a year
because the supply price on offer did not make it profitable to recover the
gas, a more expensive process than tapping non-associated gas wells.
Chevron is already doing preliminary work on the proposed site and hopes to
draw up a short-list of six construction companies, with engineering work
beginning by June. The plant would begin production in 1995.
But the project is premised on a favourable deal with NNPC. 'Neither NNPC
nor Chevron is willing to get into a project that is not economic,' says
Donald Mahura, managing director of Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary.
Nigeria has also pursued plans to use its gas reserves for export. Mobil is
believed to be considering a gas project to follow its successful Oso
condensate venture.
There are also plans to use some of the gas produced by Chevron as a
feedstock for an export-orientated Dollars 400m methanol plant. Chevron says
that its plant should still be economically viable if it supplies the
domestic market only.
The methanol plant, with a daily output of 2,000-2,500 tonnes, would be a
joint venture between NNPC, the UK-based company Penspen and the German
company Mannesman. Chevron has also been invited to become an equity
partner, but Mr Mahura says the proposal is still under consideration.
Sources close to Penspen say that ICI, the UK chemicals company, has
guaranteed to buy the methanol for at least 10 years after production begins
in 1995. The methanol will be used to make MTBE, a replacement for
tetra-ethyl lead in petrol, with the US the main final destination.
Nigeria's largest and most ambitious gas project, however, is a
multi-billion dollar plan to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export
to the US and Europe. In 1989, Nigeria LNG (NLNG) was established to
construct and operate the plant and market the gas. The company is owned by
NNPC (60 per cent) Shell (20 per cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (10 per
cent).
The project is now reaching its critical stage. Cost projection over-runs
and the difficulties of negotiating buyer contracts in the highly
competitive world LNG market have delayed the project. If a financing
package can be agreed by the end of this year then production could begin in
1997.
The central issue on which the success of the project depends is the price
agreements that NLNG can negotiate with its buyers. Last September, the
company agreed a memorandum of understanding with each of its four potential
buyers: ENEL (Italy, 3.5 cu m per year), ENAGAS (Spain, 1.0 cu m), Gaz de
France (0.5 cu m), and Distrigas Corporation (US, 0.7 cu m). But the precise
terms of the contracts, which will fix the formulae linking the LNG price to
the world crude oil and crude product prices, have yet to be signed.
NLNG sent an information memorandum to selected financial institutions last
November. But the institutions were not provided with any information about
the likely supply prices for the LNG. A source close to the institutions
described the project as 'unbankable' until this information is supplied.
NLNG hopes to sign two of the four contracts this month, and the rest in
April. This would enable the International Financing Corporation, the World
Bank's private sector finance arm, to complete an independent assessment of
the viability of the project by April to be sent to the institutions.
A positive response from the IFC report is crucial for the success of the
project. If all goes well, construction could begin by the end of the year.
Two international engineering consortia have been invited to bid for the
contract.
But if the IFC concludes that the supply price agreed with the buyers is too
low or uncertain, the Dollars 2.4bn financing package will not be
forthcoming and the project will fold.
'We need some encouragement for the financial community,' says Mr Giovanni
Pedaci, corporate planning manager at NLNG. 'Our project is complex, it is
difficult; but in the end it will be worth it.' Whether the banks and
export-credit agencies agree with his assessment will be revealed over the
coming months.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (18): Age-old problems remain - Julian
Ozanne examines the progress of the agricultural sector / A look at the food
industry, cocoa plantations, the palm oil industry and the timber industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE is the barometer of the depth and successes of the past six
years of structural adjustment, more than any other sector of the economy.
As the government repeatedly says, growth in food production and stimulation
of agricultural exports are critical to efforts to raise the low standards
of living of Nigeria's expanding population.
Agriculture's central economic importance cannot be overstated. It continues
to provide jobs and livelihoods for at least 70 per cent of the estimated
population of 110m.
However, in spite of some impressive initial gains in macro-economic
adjustment, most notably in food crop production and cocoa exports, many of
the underlying structural weaknesses in the sector have not been addressed
by the government. Partly, this can be explained by poor policy analysis and
implementation. Yet it is the continuing powerful and negative influence of
vested interests with political muscle that obstructs more concentrated
reform.
Eight years ago, before the introduction of the reform programme, the
Financial Times survey of 1984 set out the devastating agricultural legacy
of the oil boom years and the challenges facing the sector.
Agriculture, it said, was suffering from stagnating food production,
declining exports, a low level of investment and inadequate rural
infrastructure and extension services to farmers. In 1984, the crippling
cost of food imports was Dollars 2bn and traditional exports of rubber,
cocoa, ground nuts and palm oil had slumped to pathetic levels. The sector
was inefficient and heavily subsidised. It had been hit by an overvalued
exchange rate which gave poor price incentives to farmers and meant costs of
production were 50 per cent higher than those of other international
producers. 'Regular and adequate inputs of fertiliser are probably the
single most important factor in Nigeria's attempt to boost agricultural
production,' the FT said.
These concerns were at the heart of government thinking when President
Ibrahim Babangida launched the structural adjustment programme in August
1986 and, since then, agriculture has been at the heart of the government
stated policy rethink.
Some of the problems identified in 1984 have been addressed. Devaluation,
the abolition of state-run marketing boards, the introduction of import bans
on grains, rice, meat and poultry, export prohibitions on food staples and
price liberalisation have created impressive early gains.
The World Bank-funded Agricultural Development Programmes (ADP), now set up
in every state, have made some significant, if uneven, progress in extension
services and developing research linkages to the farmers. A steady growth
rate of 2.5-3.5 per cent a year over the last five years has reversed the
sector's previous decline. According to President Babangida, agriculture
grew 4.35 per cent in 1990 and 5 per cent in 1991 as a result of improved
domestic terms of trade, government funding of extension and rural
infrastructure and easy access by farmers to rural credit. Good rainfall
throughout the past 12 months considerably improved production of food
crops, especially cassava and maize.
However, many of the age-old problems remain as strong today as they were
eight years ago. The large gaps between the official and parallel rates of
exchange before the floating of the naira, restricted investment in
productive activity and has been a serious constraint to growth. Inefficient
and costly subsidies on fertiliser (which consumes most of the federal
agriculture budget), poor research and extension services, inadequate access
to credit and the lack of a consistent policy environment for investment in
commercial farming all combine to curb production. New investment in
agricultural processing industries over the past five years has been minimal
with a handful of new projects in soy milk, baby food, cotton, palm oil and
vegetable processing.
In the longer term, the government must develop urgently a coherent and
comprehensive policy to stem severe environmental degradation which,
according to a recent report by the World Bank, is costing the country
Dollars 5bn a year. Soil erosion, water contamination, deforestation,
desertification, flooding, gully and coastal erosion, inefficient urban
sewerage systems, water hyacinth and fishery and wildlife destruction are
only some of the factors held to blame. Food self-sufficiency will also
depend on how effectively the government harnesses its considerable water
resources, particularly in the arid and semi-arid northern and middle belt
states.
Three policy issues stand out:
Fertiliser policy. Last year Nigerian farmers applied about 800,000 tonnes
of fertiliser - an average of 9kg a hectare. This rate of application is 10
per cent of what farmers in the US use and only 5 per cent of what is
applied in Europe. Agricultural experts say the government's continuing
refusal to solve the fertiliser problem severely holds potential growth in
the sector from higher yields, particularly in maize, rice and vegetable
production.
The price of fertiliser was increased last year from N20 to N40 a bag as
part of the government's long-stated goal of phasing out subsidies and
attempting to streamline fertiliser distribution through state governments.
However, in practice about half of the fertiliser falls into the hands of
middlemen and traders who smuggle it to neighbouring countries or stockpile
it and sell it on the domestic black market at prices between N80 and N100.
This leads to shortages and most farmers, particularly smallholders, end up
short of sufficient fertiliser at critical times.
Economists argue that since farmers are prepared, within existing producer
price incentives, to pay between N80 and N100 a bag, that shows the ability
of the market to respond to privatisation of the procurement and
distribution of fertiliser and a reduction in the N1.5-N2bn a year federal
and state government subsidy. Opposition to this policy from powerful
politically connected northern businessmen is the greatest obstacle to
reform.
The Exchange Rate. No sector will be more grateful to government than
agriculture for this month's floating of the naira. Previously, any
investment in agriculture and particularly agro-industry was unattractive.
The foreign exchange risks for machinery and spare parts imported from
abroad, high local interest rates and the long-term nature of agricultural
projects far outweighed the 15-20 per cent returns on capital possible in
the sector. Failure to devalue adequately also encouraged trading rather
than production, considerable naira speculation and capital flight via
commodity exports. If the Naira now floats freely and remains stable,
productive investments in agriculture will once again become serious
options.
Water resources. Agriculture in the northern and middle belt states will
continue to remain vulnerable to rainfall. Nigeria has an estimated 2m
hectares of irrigable land but so far experiments in irrigation have failed
to take off. The World Bank is planning a Dollars 68m loan to promote the
use of 40,000 small-scale irrigation pumps in the northern valley bottom
(fadama) areas. However, donors and farmers are waiting for the government
to develop a master plan to harness the country's water resources and
promote low cost, small scale, private irrigation.
It will be more difficult to develop extension services, appropriate
research and technology transfer and combat environmental degradation
although new policy directives on these issues will be critical to more
rapid growth.
The past six years of structural adjustment have demonstrated that Nigeria's
small-scale farmers are dynamic and responsive to market-oriented reforms
and price signals. But if Nigeria is going to meet the agricultural
challenge presented by its expanding population, the policy programme has to

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (16): Hottest place in the world - Edward
Balls visits Chevron's oil terminal on the Niger delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONSTROUS ham sandwiches, Folger's coffee and the singing drawl of southern
US accents are a rare combination, seldom found more than a few hundred
miles north of Jackson, Mississippi; apart, that is, from the rig control
room of Chevron's main Nigerian oil terminal at Escravos, perched on the
mouth of the Niger delta.
It is more than coincidence that so many of Nigeria's expatriate oilmen hail
from the south-eastern states of America. Many of them, including the
terminal's new production manager, Mr Guy Hollingsworth, learned the oil
trade in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico: perfect training for the
hot, tranquil and oil-rich seas off the west African coast.
'Nigeria has one of the most benign offshore environments in the world,' Mr
Hollingsworth says. With no hurricanes, no big winds and platforms very
close to shore, the average North Sea oilman might be forgiven for thinking
these Nigerian-based guys have an easy life.
Yet while offshore Nigeria may be tranquil, things are far from benign back
on land. 'The biggest difficulties we encounter here are the logistics of
getting supplies in and out, and security - theft, threats and violence,' he
explains.
Security at the terminal is very tight. Armed guards now patrol 24 hours a
day after a riot last autumn. That followed the swamping, by a
terminal-bound supply ship, of a canoe full of villagers early one morning.
Fourteen people drowned, and the local inhabitants took their revenge.
Chevron's Nigerian employees fled and most of the expatriate staff were
helicoptered out to a platform at sea, while Mr Hollingsworth's predecessor
cowered in an attic. The scars of the disturbance - boarded-up windows and
damaged vehicles - remain.
It is not only security and the difficulty of getting a really cold beer
that differentiates producing oil in the Niger delta from the Mexican Gulf.
On almost every score - facilities, safety, environment, food - Chevron's
Nigerian operation falls short of its US standards.
Chevron's corporate policy, I was regularly informed, is to maintain the
same standard across its entire global operation. But the company readily
admits that this remains an aspiration rather than reality in Nigeria.
The sun danced across oil-skimmed water as our helicopter swooped over the
Okan field to land on Nigeria's oldest offshore platform.
This, I was informed, was the least well maintained, most uncomfortable to
live on and most environmentally unfriendly platform Chevron maintains; it
showed.
Nigerian government regulations permit only 100 parts of oil per million
parts of water per day, and an average of 75 parts per month, to be pumped
into the sea as the oil is filtered on the platform before being piped
ashore. That day the Okan platform was pumping anywhere between 90 and 150
parts per million.
Not that the government is particularly stringent about monitoring the
standards it sets. 'We could lie about it,' explains Chevron's young
American safety and environment manager. 'But I want to tell the truth; and
the truth is that we are not complying.'
Chevron's problems stem in part from the way in which the Gulf oil company
neglected necessary maintenance work before Chevron took it over in 1985.
But the depressed state of the whole oil industry in the mid-1980s and the
subsequent rush to squeeze out as much production as possible during the
Gulf war means that all companies face similar problems. Okan's capacity is
50,000 barrels a day, but it is currently producing 70,000 a day including
15,000 barrels of (oily) water.
The company is now taking steps to improve its safety and environment
record. It has a Facilities Upgrade Project in place which will consume
Pounds 125m a year over the next five years to upgrade the decaying
infrastructure.
Oil filtration units will be installed at all platforms. Already, the
Escravos operation is complying with environmental standards 40 per cent of
the time, up from 20 per cent last year.
But maintenance must go hand in hand with production and expansion. Chevron
has responded smartly to the incentives to increase reserves embodied in the
new Memorandum of Understanding, signed last year. Three drilling rigs were
working out of Escravos last year. Now there are five, with plans to add two
more. 'Nigeria is one of the hottest places in the world in the oil
business,' says Mr Hollingsworth, 'and for Chevron it is the hottest.'
Oil is not the only valuable resource concealed within the Delta. Flying to
Escravos from Lagos, the first signs of industry below are the associated
gas flares which continually burn off the gas produced as an offshoot from
the oil production process.
Nigeria is rich in natural gas; but more than 70 per cent of gas produced
each year is burned away. 'There are very few places in the world where
associated gas is flared,' explains Mr Donald Mahura, managing director of
Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary. One important reason why so much gas is
wasted in Nigeria is the low level of prices set by the government which
removes the incentive for the companies to exploit these gas reserves.
The government has been trying to persuade the joint ventures to exploit
this gas. Chevron is planning to build a terminal at Escravos to tap this
associated gas and sell the bulk of it to the domestic electricity industry.
Construction should begin in 1993 with production on stream by 1995. But the
scheme will go ahead only if the company's Lagos-based executives can
negotiate a sufficiently attractive supply contract with the government.
So the problems faced by the oil and gas industry in Nigeria are very
different from those thrown up by the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea. The
challenges which animate the conversation of Chevron's US oilmen are to
found onshore: security at Escravos, politics in Lagos. 'Sometimes these
guys might think this is Mississippi,' Mr Hollingsworth says. 'But it sure
ain't' In Nigeria, finding and extracting the oil seems to be the easy part.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (15): 'We would like to retain our
dominant role' - Dr Thomas John, head of Nigeria's National Petroleum
Corporation, talks to Edward Balls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward Balls: What progress has been made in restructuring and
commercialising the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation?
Dr John: After many years of operating as a government agency, it cannot be
easy suddenly to change into a commercialised institution - certainly not
merely by government declaration. A lot of work has to go into changing the
attitude of the management staff in the first instance and then all the way
down to the shop-floor worker. We believe we have made substantial progress.
Does NNPC intend to retain its dominant position in the oil sector?
I believe that so long as we contribute 60 per cent to the funding of the
joint venture companies, we will continue to play a dominant role. We have a
Joint Operating Agreement (JoA) which recognises the rights of both parties
and enables us to operate in a manner which does not subjugate the interests
of either party to the other. We have a dominant role in the industry and we
would like to retain it.
The new JoA, which allows NNPC to take full control of its existing fields
if it wishes, suggests NNPC wants more control. But at the same time you are
negotiating production sharing contracts for the newly-allocated oil fields.
Does this mean a less active role for NNPC in the future?
No. It has all to do with how we use the limited resources at our disposal.
For the next 30 to 40 years, we shall still be working on existing fields
and operating the existing contracts guided by the JoA. If we can
successfully take over a great portion of the existing fields, and there are
many still undeveloped, then we will have made satisfactory progress.
With the production sharing contract arrangement we do not have to invest
money up-front. We leave that to the major oil companies, who will invest
100 per cent of the money required for exploration, appraisal and
development. The terms, of course, will be made in such a way that it is
attractive to them to take this front-end risk.
How can you assure the foreign participants, who are considering signing
these contracts, that you are not going to let them spend the money to find
the oil and then take it all for NNPC?
How can I assure anybody of anything in this life? It will not be this
managing director or this government which comes up with a new idea about
how the industry should be operated. A future government cannot be denied
its freedom of action. What you are asking me is that I should make a
commitment on their behalf. I will say I don't have the power.
How successful has NNPC been in encouraging the development of indigenous,
private sector Nigerian oil companies?
Very successful. Two of these indigenous oil companies have made discoveries
and are poised to move on to appraise the oil fields they have discovered.
We believe that in the next three years they should be in production. Others
have brought in foreign partners. I would say about 60 per cent of those
allocated acreages are actively working on them.
The record suggests that managing the oil refineries is a weak spot in
NNPC's activities. What is being done to rectify matters?
The problems in the management of the refineries arose out of the shortage
of foreign exchange with which to procure the spare parts necessary to
maintain them, and the very rapid development of the refining sector in the
country. Within a period of eight years, we built three refineries and three
petrochemical plants. But we were not able to train staff as quickly as we
built the refineries.
In the last three years we have not built any new plant and we have had the
opportunity to train personnel. And we now have access to the foreign
exchange we require to bring in spare parts quickly. Our operation of our
refineries has improved considerably.
Have you considered foreign participation in the refining industry? Has NNPC
given up its aspirations to participate in the downstream refining of its
crude oil in Europe or North America?
For some time now we have nursed the idea of a joint Nigerian-foreign owned
export refinery to provide jobs for our people and refined products for our
sub-region. We are anxiously looking for partners who are willing to invest.
We still have open the idea of investing in a foreign refinery, to secure a
guaranteed outlets for our crude oil and also to share in the profits
obtainable at the pump station. That adds value to our crude oil. We are
still searching for the right buyer.
You have been looking for some time now?
Yes. We have been searching for some time now, and let's say we have not
been lucky enough to find what we want.
How successful has NNPC been in exploiting Nigeria's gas reserves?
We have several plans for gas development. The only limitation we have is
the financial resources to execute all the projects we have identified.
The liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is one major project. We also plan
to produce methanol, MTBE and NGL. These are being looked at by our joint
venture partners, namely Shell, Chevron and Mobil.
Locally we now supply gas to some of our thermal electric plants and there
are several projects to bring gas to the Lagos industrial area. In another
two to three years, we should have several industries supplied with gas from
the Escravos-Lagos trunk line.
The gas price that suppliers receive is set by the government at a very low
level. Is liberalising the domestic gas price a necessary step in nurturing
a flourishing domestic gas industry?
At present, those companies which supply gas to the grid do so from
non-associated gas sources. I don't think they have complained yet about the
return on their investments. They supply it because they are making money.
They are not missionaries.
But we do not believe we should go ahead with exploiting non-associated gas
while we flare associated gas. So the policy now is preferentially to
exploit associated gas which costs a lot more to produce. To enable these
companies to provide gas from associated gas sources, the government is
seriously considering fiscal incentives which would make it profitable for
them to do so, without increasing significantly the price of gas the
government has fixed.
Does Opec matter as much to Nigeria as it once did?
Nigeria is committed to Opec - what else can I say when a Nigerian is
president? It is still a useful organisation and there are times, I think,
when consumers also value the assistance of Opec. After all who else would
be there to make the sacrifices if Opec were not there?
So Opec are being missionaries, are they?
Well, that's what it would look like. The only true missionaries]

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (13): Ambitious programme of investment -
The new Memorandum of Understanding has placed the oil industry on a more
secure financial footing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA HAS two distinct economies: the oil industry, which constitutes the
nation's economic core; and the rest of its manufacturing, agriculture and
service sectors, which together form its struggling hinterland.
More than ever, these two economies appear to be going in opposite
directions. The non-oil economy is limping along, dogged by slow growth, low
investment and heavy debts. But the oil sector, source of the bulk of tax
revenues and foreign currency export earnings, is flourishing.
Indeed, the outlook for Nigeria's oil industry looks better now than at any
time in the past decade. The signing, last July, of the new Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the government and the foreign oil companies has
placed the industry on a more secure financial footing.
The MoU, replacing the original agreement signed in 1986, has restored the
real value of guaranteed profit margins the foreign companies receive on
their investments, and put in place a series of further fiscal incentives
for new investment.
The MoU also maps out a new five-year plan of exploration and capital
investment designed to increase production and reserves. The government aims
to increase the potential output of the industry from its present estimated
level of 1.95-2m barrels a day to 2.5m b/d by 1995. It also plans to
increase Nigeria's proven oil reserves to 20bn barrels from their present
18bn.
Output last year averaged 1.893m b/d. The new Opec quotas, agreed recently
in Vienna, would reduce Nigeria's production to 1.751m b/d. But the
government and the oil companies are confident that if Nigeria can increase
its production capability, its quota share will be increased accordingly.
The foreign oil companies and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC), the majority partner in all oil ventures, have embarked on an
ambitious programme of capital investment.
Shell, the largest foreign company, plans to increase the average daily
production of the joint venture it operates from 900,000 to 1.3m b/d by the
late 1990s, and has increased annual capital expenditure from Dollars 500m
to Dollars 1,500m a year over the past three years. Philip Watts, Shell's
managing director in Nigeria, describes the government's expansion targets
as 'entirely realistic'.
Alfred Koch, managing director of Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN), agrees. He
dismisses suggestions that NNPC will not be able to come up with its 60 per
cent share of the necessary capital investment. Mobil plans to raise the
crude oil production of its joint venture to 425,000 b/d by the end of 1995.
It had already increased its average daily production to 310,000 barrels in
January, displacing Chevron to become the second largest foreign producer in
Nigeria.
Moreover, Mobil's total production will increase by a further 100,000 b/d
once its Dollars 885m project to produce a high-quality hydrocarbon
condensate comes on stream in December. Condensate falls outside the
definition of crude oil governed by Opec quotas. Financing for the plant was
secured last year, and the plant is already 77 per cent complete. It should
be running at full capacity by the end of March 1993.
Chevron is determined not to be left behind. Having more than doubled
capital expenditure between 1990 and 1991, it plans to do so again in 1992.
Over the next five years, total gross capital expenditure will reach Dollars
3bn with the aim of increasing production to 320,000 b/d this year and
400,000 b/d by 1995.
Nigeria, then, is a priority location for many of the world's largest oil
companies, and their commitment to Nigeria is long-term. Both Mobil and
Chevron have recently moved to smart new office complexes around Lagos,
while Shell is planning to shift its corporate headquarters to Abuja, the
new federal capital.
Why Nigeria? The oil industry there is relatively young and undeveloped, the
oil is light and of a high quality, the climate is relatively benign,
keeping operating costs low, and Nigeria is not in the Middle East. The
risks of political instability disrupting production appear to be low.
This year's election, and the shift to civilian rule, might be expected to
make foreign investors nervous. But the oil industry executives are
nonplussed. 'If you review the history of the past 30 years,' says Mr Koch
of MPN, 'every time there was a change of government there was not a
substantial shift in oil policy. Our best guess is that that will continue.'
This sentiment is shared by all the companies.
The relationship between the Nigerian government and its foreign partners is
clearer than ever before. Each company was required to sign a Joint
Operating Agreement (JoA) with NNPC last year which documents, often for the
first time and in precise detail, the rights and obligations of each party.
The JoAs spell out, for example, procedures for making capital spending
decisions and the foreign companies' obligations to train their Nigerian
nationals. They are also believed to grant NNPC the right to become the
operator of fields if and when it so chooses.
Are the foreign companies concerned that their assets could be nationalised
at any time? Apparently not. 'If the government decides it wants to take
over operations, that is its prerogative,' says Donald Mahura, managing
director of Chevron's Nigerian subsidiary. 'But I don't think that the JoA
gives them any more or less right to do that.'
The truth is that the government is dependent on the foreign companies for
investment funds and technical skill. As Mr Koch of MPN points out, 'there
is nobody in Nigeria who is foolish enough to nationalise the oil
companies'.
Far from taking a more active role in the oil industry, NNPC looks set to
become less involved in day-to-day operations as a result of the government
decision to shift away from the joint venture model that has dominated the
Nigerian oil industry.
In 1990, the government announced the largest round of licensing of new oil
fields since the 1960s. A total of 136 blocks, covering 421,000 square
kilometres of unexplored territory, were thrown open to bids due in November
1990. A number of new concessions have since been allocated, although the
process is not yet complete.
The new MoU will not apply to oil discovered or produced from these fields.
Instead the government is offering production-sharing contracts which
require foreign operators to undertake 100 per cent of all exploration and
development costs. If oil is discovered, the foreign company then sells a
portion of the output, known as 'cost oil', to cover its outlays. The
remaining 'profit oil' is then distributed between the government and the
companies on terms which compensate the operators for the higher risks they
bear.
The exact terms of the production-sharing contracts are still being
negotiated. The advantage for NNPC is that the foreign company bears the
initial capital cost and the up-front risk. NNPC only becomes involved once
oil is discovered, which could be 10 or more years after exploration begins.
'With the fiscal terms in place in Nigeria there is not really a big
incentive for the government to be a direct equity partner in the oil
sector,' explains Mr Mahura of Chevron.
Yet the foreign companies have not been deterred from bidding for the new
acreage, either by the JoA or by these new financial arrangements. All the
leading companies have been allocated new concessions, while some old faces
have returned, notably BP.
BP, and its Norwegian partner Statoil, have been allocated two off-shore
blocks and have a preliminary investment budget of Pounds 250m over the next
five years. BP is returning after an 11-year absence. In 1979, the company
had its assets seized, notably a 20 per cent stake in Nigeria's largest
joint venture, after allegations it was shipping oil to South Africa.
NNPC has also made discretionary allocations to 18 newly-created Nigerian
companies, although most are expected to enter into joint venture agreements
with foreign partners.
So, while the Nigerian macro-economy looks to be in a fragile state, and its
politics face an uncertain few years, the oil industry continues to expand.
The foreign oil companies do not seem worried by the domestic instability
that surrounds them. Indeed, the suspicion is that the foreign oil companies
secretly thrive on it. The more unstable the domestic political situation,
the less likely it is that the government will try to interfere with its one
dependable source of revenue. At least that has been their past experience.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (14): Sharpening fiscal incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed by the Nigerian government
and its foreign joint venture partners last July, guarantees minimum profit
margins to the foreign joint venture partners of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) over the coming years depending on their levels
of capital investment and cost efficiency.
The original MoU was signed in 1986 at a time of falling oil prices and
production, dwindling reserves and low capital investment by the foreign oil
companies.
It guaranteed a minimum after-tax profit margin of Dollars 2 per barrel in
exchange for stipulated exploration commitments. This guaranteed profit
margin was subject to NNPC's operating partners keeping to minimum standards
of cost efficiency. When costs rose above a notional technical cost of
Dollars 2 per barrel, the guaranteed profit margin was reduced.
The original MoU also obliged the foreign companies to purchase the
government's crude oil share at 45 days' notice if it was unable or
unwilling to sell it on the open market because of adverse market
conditions.
Negotiations to update the original MoU began in early 1990, the year in
which the original five-year exploration programme ended. The real value of
the guaranteed profit margins had been eroded by inflation.
Moreover, the government was keen to sharpen the fiscal incentives for the
foreign companies to increase their oil reserves to meet its declared aim to
increase total reserves to 20m barrels by 1995.
After some delay, the new MoU was signed last year, detailing a new
five-year plan for exploration and production and containing a number of new
features designed to increase capital investment in the oil sector.
It guarantees a profit margin of Dollars 2.3 a barrel so long as technical
operating costs do not exceed Dollars 2.5 a barrel. But the minimum
guaranteed margin increases to Dollars 2.5 a barrel if capital investment
exceeds Dollars 1.5 a barrel with total operating costs less than Dollars
3.5 a barrel.
In addition, the new MoU provides bonuses for companies that increase their
reserves by more than they produce in any given year, thereby adding to net
reserves. It also reduces the required notice period for purchasing unsold
government crude to 15 days.
The terms of the MoU do not apply to the new oil fields that have been
allocated by the government over the past year. For these fields, the
government intends to shift to production-sharing agreements, the terms of
which are still being negotiated.
The foreign oil companies appear satisfied with the new agreement and have
stepped up their capital spending plans accordingly. Mr Philip Watts,
managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, says that having the new
MoU has made a big difference by providing a 'proper financial underpinning'
for Shell's Nigerian operations.
'Its not that the deal is marvellous. But the proof of the pudding is in the
eating; and all the major players are gearing themselves up for major
capital expenditure.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (1): Risky path to reform - The floating
of the naira is the most radical, if belated, initiative since the recovery
programme was launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA is facing its greatest challenge since General Ibrahim Babangida
seized power more than six years ago. Disliked at home, distrusted abroad,
the country's military government is attempting to revive a flagging
economic reform programme while implementing a flawed transition to civilian
rule.
Events over the next few weeks may well determine the outcome on both
fronts. Will the military government buttress this month's bold decision to
float the naira, and implement the accompanying tough fiscal and monetary
measures as promised? Or will it lose its nerve as consumer prices increase
following the naira's plunge from its manipulated official rate of 10.5 to
18 to the dollar?
Either course is painful, although the former offers a way out of the
economic crisis; the latter will take Nigeria down the path of Zaire or
Zambia.
The decision to float the naira is the most radical policy initiative since
President Babangida launched the structural adjustment programme in 1986,
less than a year after seizing office in a palace coup. Within 24 hours of
Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of the central bank, breaking the news in
a nationally-televised broadcast, the 80 per cent spread between the rigged
official rate and the market value almost vanished.
Reactions have been muted. Government spokesmen made much of the fact that
the easy profits made by many of the smaller banks, who sold their share of
the weekly foreign exchange allocations at a wide margin, now go into the
state's coffers. But prices will inevitably rise - how much depends on the
effectiveness of a liquidity squeeze - adding to a catalogue of complaints.
Many of the new civilian governors (who took over from their military
predecessors last December) are now discovering that they have inherited
over-spent treasuries and dubious business contracts.
Disclosure of a recent government decision to provide middle ranking army
officers with private cars on nominal repayment terms infuriated Nigerians,
who have seen their per capita income fall from Dollars 1,000 (calculated on
an overvalued exchange rate) to around Dollars 250. 'It's as if the army's
view of structural adjustment is 'do what we say, not as we do',' says an
angry businessman.
But there are many Nigerians who also look with misgivings at the prospect
of a civilian government in January 1993.
President Babangida's imposition of a two-party system, both parties created
by government with manifestoes written by civil servants, does not inspire
confidence that the Third Republic will have firm foundations.
Yet the continuation of military rule would, most Nigerians believe, be the
greater of two misfortunes, and the soldiers' renewed commitment to reform
is treated with scepticism.
President Babangida, however, will be looking for a positive response from
western partners. The devaluation removed the biggest obstacle in
negotiations with a visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team at one
dramatic stroke. No doubt the Fund, like a probation officer confronting a
hardened recidivist, will be wary. But most observers believe that a new
stand-by agreement could now be in reach, paving the way to further
rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt.
'It was a coup de theatre,' declared a diplomat, 'and the Fund was in the
audience.' It is evidence, say some observers, that government commitment to
Nigeria's reform programme has been restored.
Essential principles have been reaffirmed by the Central Bank governor in
his broadcast: fiscal restraint, prudent monetary policies, public sector
rationalisation, curbs on state spending. 'It is imperative,' he declared,
'that these actions be taken in order to consolidate and enhance the gains
of the structural adjustment programme' - words addressed, one suspects, as
much to profligate soldiers as to donors and creditors, anxious for
assurance that the past year's drift is ending.
But a look at the track record of the military government suggests that
caution would be in order. As far as back as February 1986, President
Babangida spoke of floating the naira, after delivering a budget that
promised a 'realistic' exchange rate.
Just under three years later, with inflation running at 50 per cent and the
naira overvalued by about as much, government attempted to make up lost
ground. The January 1989 budget paved the way to a new agreement with the
IMF. Yet one of the key conditions - the establishment of a market rate for
the naira - was broken before the ink of the government letter of intent was
dry. Looking back, the concessions seemed only to have postponed the
inevitable.
Doubt about the government's renewed commitment to reform is based on more
than a failure to bite the foreign exchange bullet. There is evidence of
mismanagement and wasted resources on a scale that has done great harm to
Nigeria.
Some of the most disquieting concerns are set out in a hitherto unpublished
World Bank report. It presents the findings of a Bank review of federal
government expenditures, carried out in early 1991. The report notes that
Nigeria's oil export receipts were some Dollars 2bn higher in 1990 than the
Bank had been projecting.
Pressures created by raised expectations, demands from state and local
governments, and the transition to civilian rule (due to culminate in
presidential elections this December) 'led to a breakdown in fiscal and
monetary discipline during 1990,' says the Bank.
The report notes that 'the practice of spending oil revenues through
dedication accounts and other devices outside the purview of statutory
budgetary and accounting controls has re-emerged on a large scale'.
The report continues: 'Some Dollars 1.5bn equivalent of revenues was
allocated under ill-defined and poorly documented procedures outside of the
normal accounting framework.'
These concerns, shared by creditor governments, have yet to be eased. At the
very least, they provide grounds for closer monitoring of government policy,
both by internal and external agencies, than provided for by current aid and
rescheduling terms. One early test of the government's fresh resolve will be
whether it continues to support unsuitable projects.
'A large number of projects are far from least cost', points out the same
World Bank report, 'either because of inappropriate choices of technology or
location, or because of overcharging by foreign suppliers.' The Ajaokuta
steel plant on which Dollars 3bn has been spent requires a further Dollars
2-3bn for completion, and will be a net loser of foreign exchange even after
capital costs are written off. The Dollars 1.4bn Ikot Abasi aluminium
smelter 'has capital costs well in excess of clearly competitive green field
plants in other countries', says the Bank report.
Nigeria has reached this critical stage largely through government
shortcomings. But the record also suggests that Nigeria's western partners
have been prepared to turn a blind eye to policy failures. The motives have
been mixed: commercial interests in the booming multi-billion dollar oil and
gas sector; a genuine belief in government's good intentions; an equally
genuine fear - often exploited by Lagos - that pressure would destabilise
Africa's most populous nation.
All will come into play as President Babangida presses his case for external
debt relief. He will argue that the success of his reform programme depends
on it; creditors will ask whether they can depend on the president to keep
the promises Governor Ahmed made on his behalf.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Shrimps to global strategies - Minoru
Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, talks to Robert
Thomson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contemplating his promotion to president of Mitsubishi Corporation, Mr
Minoru Makihara smiles as he considers the blend of skill and serendipity
that has carried him from the shrimp import division of Japan's largest
industrial group to the helm.
But Mr Makihara, 62, born in Hampstead in the UK and Harvard-educated, has a
clear and confident vision of the changes needed at the trading house,
including reforms to a management style that has brought Mitsubishi
remarkable success.
At the same time, the new president wants to make transparent the often
opaque connections of Japanese corporate groups, known as keiretsu, and
their alleged collusion, which is a matter of serious trade dispute with
Washington and European governments. 'The mystique should be erased.'
For example, Mr Makihara says foreigners have the wrong idea about the
monthly meetings of Mitsubishi company heads, whom they perceive to be
creating monopolies and cornering international markets. He would like
journalists to attend the Friday Club, as the gathering is called: 'I will
probably be outvoted, but by not disclosing what is happening we build up
unnecessary mystique.'
As president of Mitsubishi Corp, Mr Makihara will share the inner sanctum
with 28 other Mitsubishi men, including the presidents of Mitsubishi Bank,
the world's seventh largest, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors,
Nikon, the camera maker, and Kirin, the brewer. In all, about 190 companies
are members of the Mitsubishi family, in relationships characterised by
strategic cross-shareholdings and exchanges of executives.
In the case of Nikon, for example, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking holds 6.9 per
cent of the company's shares, Mitsubishi Bank, 4.7 per cent, two
Mitsubishi-linked insurance companies hold 9 per cent, and Mitsubishi Corp
has 1.9 per cent. For Mitsubishi Corp - the core company - the two insurance
companies, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire and Meiji Mutual Life, hold 13.9 per cent
between them, Mitsubishi Trust 5.3 per cent, Mitsubishi Bank 4.9 per cent,
and Mitsubishi Heavy 3.1 per cent.
US trade negotiators claim that these 'horizontal' keiretsu, by their
nature, tend to exclude newcomers, both Japanese and foreigners, by
monopolising markets and dealing exclusively with each other. Separately,
the US has condemned the 'vertical' keiretsu - families such as that run by
Toyota Motor, which has several layers of sub-contractors supplying parts to
the parent company or selling its products.
'I sense that in the US, at least in informed circles, and not necessarily
the political circles, there is a better understanding that the horizontal
relationship is much looser than the vertical one, and that it is not a
relationship that tries to exclude outsiders,' explains Mr Makihara, whose
unhurried answers are tinged with a gentle irony.
'In this global economy, the closer the partnership you can establish with a
company, the better, and it doesn't have to be a Japanese company. The
popular word, I suppose, is strategic alliance. Establishing a strategic
alliance with Mitsubishi Electric will be as useful as establishing an
alliance with General Electric, which we are trying to do.'
But the US Trade Representative's office argues that sometimes it is not
just the shareholdings, but the psychology of keiretsu that makes life
difficult for competitors - Mitsubishi people know and prefer to deal with
Mitsubishi people, and drink only Kirin beer, not Asahi or Heineken. After a
smile, Mr Makihara confesses: 'I prefer Budweiser.'
Mr Makihara, who will formally take control in June, often uses the word
'global', and his own global perspective has come from spending 22 of his
Mitsubishi years abroad and 14 in Japan. In 1956, he began in 'marine
products', which involved overseeing imports of shrimp and tuna, and was
transferred in 1959 to London, where he spent eight years. He then returned
to Tokyo and marine products.
Since 1985, he has lived in Washington and New York, and in October 1990 was
appointed chairman of Mitsubishi International. During that period,
Mitsubishi Estate bought a 51 per cent stake in the Rockefeller Group,
giving it control over prime New York properties and stirring controversy
over a perceived Japanese takeover of US cultural icons. He suggests that
controversy is 'bound to happen', given the inclinations of 'some of the
media'.
While Tokyo business leaders have noted that Mr Makihara will be an eloquent
spokesman for corporate Japan, his first concern is to strengthen the
trading house's operations. The appointment, he made clear, was a business
decision, not a political response to US criticism.
'It was probably a sense that my understanding of international affairs
would be useful in the global economy, and that we have to do more non-Japan
oriented business. For example, US-Brazil or US-Russia business, taking
advantage of our networks and expertise. I want to open our channels up -
New York to Brazil, instead of Brazil to Tokyo, Tokyo to New York and,
eventually, New York to Brazil.'
The changing relationships between overseas operations are part of a
necessary reform of Mitsubishi management and philosophy, if the company is
to ensure its competitiveness in the global market, Mr Makihara says.
Delegating authority to offices outside Japan and encouraging Tokyo
executives to accept the reduction of their power will not be easy to
accomplish. His plans essentially mean an overhaul of the company's entire
management structure, as he also intends to replace the promotion path on
which merit is often not as important as time-serving.
In changing the culture of the group, which traces its origins and
three-diamond logo back to 1870, Mr Makihara admits that he will face strong
opposition. Traditional nemawashi, or consensus building, will be done to
ensure that the changes are neither too fast, nor too disruptive.
'It will take a long time, and probably luck, too. People say that we are
like an aircraft carrier, and that it's difficult for us to change
direction,' he said. 'Some Mitsubishi people think that the way we have run
the business so far has been successful, so it would be dangerous to change
dramatically. I agree with the bit about 'dramatically', but I do think
change is necessary.'
The success or failure of Mitsubishi's foreign ventures has been closely
tied to the character of the individual chosen to handle that project,
almost regardless of the project's potential, says Mr Makihara, who regards
his 'ability to listen' as an important asset.
'We have several subsidiaries and investments in the US. Some are having
problems, often stemming from who is running that corporation. To cope with
that, we have to adjust our thinking, and not send the person who is
scheduled to go, but send in the right person, whether he or she is
Japanese, American, British, or whatever.'
Mr Makihara, who is in the process of moving back to Tokyo from New York,
has enjoyed his time in the US. Apart from detective novels, he likes
American theatre and the diversity of US culture. He also has a deep respect
for the country's economic prowess and in its 'power to recover and return
to the right place', a power not much in evidence in recent years.
'In the auto industry, once restructuring takes place, there are definite
comparative advantages for US companies. They have a large market, and have
more talent compared to a Japanese manufacturer in Japan with mostly
Japanese designers. That comparative advantage will show out in the long
run, provided the US makers put in a concerted effort.'
He also suggests that US executives have an advantage in being able to
escape from work concerns. In New York, he sought the company of a
'non-business' circle of friends and developed an ability to relax, a
quality he would like to cultivate at Mitsubishi Corp.
'In Japan, day and night, you are more or less with business associates. We
Japanese have been living in an environment which is very labour-intensive.
But we have to change because we are moving into a world that is
idea-oriented. Just thinking for 12 hours doesn't necessarily generate a
better idea than thinking creatively for one hour.'

AEGON, the second largest Dutch insurance group, is to take a 75 per cent

reported Dollars 50m, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Aegon said the Hungarian acquisition was a logical step in its strategy of
expanding from a north-west European and US base into southern and eastern
Europe. Aegon has said that it is in talks with Tirrena, the Italian
insurer.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rockwell to take Dollars 1.5bn
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROCKWELL International, the US aerospace and automotive group, is to take a
Dollars 1.5bn charge against net income to cover the cost of moving to a new
accounting standard for retired employees' health benefits.
All US companies have to adopt the new accounting method by early next year.
Many leading corporations have already announced plans for multi-billion
dollar charges.
Rockwell said it would take the charge in the second quarter, ending March
31, and would restate its first-quarter figures. The restatement would mean
a net loss for the first quarter, and for the full 1992 fiscal year.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said the group did not see any significant
improvement yet in its markets. It expected earnings per share in fiscal
1992 to be about 15 per cent below 1991's total of Dollars 2.57, before the
special charge.
Mr Beall had previously restricted himself to saying that because an
economic turnround had not materialised, it would be increasingly difficult
to match 1991's figures.
The company earned Dollars 600.5m in the year to September 1991, on sales of
Dollars 11.93bn, and Dollars 123m on sales of Dollars 2.56bn in the first
quarter of the current year.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Vote on 'demutualising'
Equitable Life starts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE formidable task of 'demutualising' the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
the large US insurer, got under way this weekend with the mailing of 2.2m
ballots to eligible policyholders.
Two thirds of policyholders voting must be in favour for the
'demutualisation' plan - that is, a scheme which will turn the company from
one belonging to policyholders to one owned by shareholders - to go ahead.
The vote is scheduled for May 6.
A hearing by the New York Insurance Department has also been arranged for
April 21; approval by the New York Superintendent of Insurance is a further
pre-condition to the move.
The Equitable has been struggling financially following over-aggressive
expansion in the 1980s and heavy exposure to junk bonds and property-related
investments.
Last year, Axa, the French insurance company, provided a much-needed Dollars
1bn capital infusion, which will convert into an equity stake of between 40
and 49 per cent when demutualisation occurs.
The demutualisation scheme will allocate ordinary shares among Equitable's
policyholders, and is being combined with an initial public offering, which
will involve selling shares to outside investors. The offering must raise at
least Dollars 300m. Part of this money will go towards providing alternative
cash payments or policy benefits to policyholders receiving a small number
of shares under the demutualisation scheme; up to Dollars 220m may be used
to pay operating expenses and dividends.
In the demutualisation documents, Equitable revealed that individual
insurance and annuity policy surrenders and withdrawals increased by 53 per
cent to Dollars 1.88bn in the first nine months of 1991 over the comparable
1990 figure. It also says that equity real estate and below investment grade
debt and equity interests comprised 12.6 per cent and 14.2 per cent
respectively of the Dollars 41.3bn general account and GIC segment
investment portfolio.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rural growth helps lift
Hindustan Lever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HINDUSTAN Lever, India's largest foreign-owned group, has reported sharply
increased profit and turnover for 1990-1991 despite political upheaval and
the slowdown in economic growth during the year.
Hindustan Lever, a subsidiary of Unilever with interests in soap,
detergents, toilet goods and chemicals, said gross sales had grown 22 per
cent to Rs17.7bn (Dollars 648.6m), with pre-tax profits rising 24 per cent
to Rs1.3bn.
The company said profit growth had come from core products, including soaps,
detergents and toilet products. All had benefited from the introduction of
new brand names. Strong growth in rural demand thanks to good monsoons and
the rise in rural incomes has also proved a boon for the group. In some
products, rural demand now accounts for a half of sales.
Hindustan Lever's performance was above market expectations in a year that
included the assassination or Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister,
and probably negative industrial growth.
However, the trend among other companies to have reported 1990-91 earnings
is also better than expected. According to the Economic Times research
bureau, the first 64 companies to report showed a 22 per cent rise in sales
and a 25 per cent increase in profits before tax and depreciation charges.
Hindustan Lever says its higher profits included financial savings,
reflecting its low debt burden. But the deep indebtedness of most companies
was reflected in a 65 per cent increase in interest charges among the first
64 companies to report.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Hard-headed Italian bank sets the pace: Haig Simonian
reports on San Paolo's flotation today and its plans for tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With around L250,000bn (Pounds 116bn) in total group assets, 800 domestic
branches and a significant presence abroad, San Paolo bank does not fit the
description of a typical Italian public sector bank. It is far from
undersized and not over-dependent on its home market.
After today's L1,525bn flotation of 20 per cent of its shares, San Paolo
will stand out even more from the pack. One of Italy's more dynamic and
better-run financial institutions, its decision to go public marks a high
point for the bank and the biggest leap so far in Italy's 18-month-old bank
liberalisation process.
Under the 1990 Amato law, public sector banks received the green light to
become joint stock companies and float up to 49 per cent of their shares.
San Paolo is only the second Italian bank to take advantage of the change,
but the flotation dwarfs the L400bn raised by Banco di Napoli last November.
Today's issue will be Italy's biggest initial public share offering, and the
second-largest capital raising on the bourse after last year's L1,750bn
rights issue by the Generali insurance group.
Some analysts have complained that the L12,200 price tag on San Paolo's new
shares is dear compared with other quoted Italian banks. The issue price
puts San Paolo's price-earnings ratio at around 11 - above those of Credito
Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), two big, well-regarded public
sector banks which are already partly quoted. Mr Gianni Zandano, San Paolo
chairman, disagrees. 'We think the pricing is competitive,' he says. The
price/earnings ratio for Credito Italiano and BCI is distorted by the
special five-year tax breaks they gained after buying out loss-making
public-sector companies in the late 1980s, which reduced their tax levels to
between 25 per cent and 31 per cent, compared with 42 per cent for San
Paolo.
Many bankers suggest the best comparison for San Paolo is not with a top
public sector bank, but with Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's
biggest private sector financial institution, which trades on a p/e of
around 13. Ambroveneto is also a model of independence from politicians. To
emphasise its autonomy, San Paolo will shortly announce the appointment of
three leading private sector businessmen, including Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, head
of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group, to the board of its banking operation.
Freedom from political influences should allow the bank to continue its
hard-headed business practices, which have seen net earnings, restated for
the revaluations involved in the restructuring process, reach L540bn last
year. Profits should rise by around 10 per cent in 1992, and the bank has
already indicated it will pay a dividend of at least L400 a share for 1991 -
its first year as a joint stock company.
Earnings will also gain from tougher cost control. Mr Zandano says the 21
per cent surge in staff costs last year on account of a new three-year wage
contract and a sharp increase in pension fund payments was an exception.
A string of foreign and domestic acquisitions over the past two years has
prepared San Paolo better than Italy's other big banks for the freer
competition in European banking in the 1990s. It now has the biggest network
of any foreign bank in France, with 45 branches, and operates almost 135
branches in Spain through stakes in two domestic banks.
The group has also taken smaller holdings in other foreign banks. San Paolo
is the biggest shareholder in Hambros, the UK merchant bank, with just over
14 per cent.
But San Paolo's biggest expansion has come at home. Last September, it paid
L2,100bn for 50 per cent of Crediop, the big Rome-based medium and long-term
lending institution, taking its stake to 90 per cent.
Crediop completed San Paolo's structure as a full-service bank. Commercial
banks are forbidden under Italian law from making medium to long-term loans
to industry, which is reserved for specialist institutions. 'Buying Crediop
means nothing important is now missing for the group,' says Mr Zandano.
San Paolo is now entering a consolidation phase, says Mr Zan-
dano. Though takeover opportunities will not be overlooked, the stress is
now on organic growth. Tying Crediop more closely with the San Paolo group
will allow it to extend its activities beyond traditional big corporate
clients to medium and smaller-sized companies.
The group will also continue to build up its branch network to strengthen
its deposit base. The slowdown in Italy's traditionally high private savings
rate at a time of high lending has forced San Paolo to turn increasingly to
relatively expensive interbank finance to bridge the funding gap, affecting
earnings in 1991. This year, it has decided to limit lending to the rate of
deposit growth. 'It's a complete policy shift. Now our most important
variable will be deposits,' says Mr Zandano.
The bank's concentration in Italy's wealthy north, especially means it
already has a strong geographical advantage. San Paolo has an uncontested
position in its native Piedmont, while it is strongly represented in
neighbouring Lombardy, the country's industrial powerhouse, through two big
regional subsidiaries, Como-based Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale
Lombarda, headquartered in Bergamo, which have also been opening new
branches.
The rest of the bank's cash from the flotation will go towards rebuilding
liquidity, depleted after the Crediop purchase. Large cash balances should
also boost this year's profits given the huge spread the bank can make
between the 4 per cent its new equity will cost in terms of dividends and
the 12 per cent or more to be made on the money markets.
San Paolo's cash balances will balloon further once it floats part of its
Crediop stake, probably next year, leaving it with a bare majority of the
shares. 'It's not our business to keep money tied up which could be used
better elsewhere,' says Mr Zandano.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Royal Mail plans to consult unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, is to give union
representatives a say in a wide range of business issues, including prices,
standards of service and new technology.
The move is the first by a large UK employer to set up a formal national
worker participation scheme since experiments in industrial democracy in the
late 1970s. Employee consultation has been out of fashion for over a decade.
Employers have generally sought to restrict union influence to pay and
conditions.
Royal Mail's unusual step is part of an industrial relations shake-up
affecting about 180,000 employees. The agreement has been hailed by union
leaders and management as a blueprint for other parts of industry.
A new national joint committee will be attended each month by senior Royal
Mail managers and national union officials. It is expected that Mr Bill
Cockburn, Royal Mail managing director, and Mr Alan Tuffin, general
secretary of the Union of Communication Workers, will regularly take part.
Mr Jerry Cope, Royal Mail's director of personnel, said the framework
provided a 'third model' for industry in the UK. Old-fashioned public sector
organisations had been stuck with excessive levels of consultation and very
slow rates of change. Other employers went to the opposite extreme and
attempted to exclude unions altogether, he said.
Royal Mail did not believe either model was appropriate for the 21st
century, said Mr Cope. If unions were pushed into the corner, 'every so
often they come out and bite you'. The Post Office has suffered from poor
industrial relations in the past, though the number of unofficial disputes
has declined.
Both sides stressed that involvement of unions in business issues was not a
return to the short-lived experiments in industrial democracy in the Post
Office and British Steel Corporation in the late 1970s. There would be no
question of 'co-management', said Mr Cope.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Mather quits as head of troubled IEA think-tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GRAHAM MATHER has quit as general director of the troubled Institute of
Economic Affairs, after a new row within the faction-riven rightwing
think-tank.
Mr Mather, 37, took his decision yesterday after details of a private
agreement between him and the board, involving his departure at the end of
the year, were leaked to the press.
His resignation comes amid fresh evidence of renewed fighting between
factions - Thatcherite loyalists in the Conservative party, represented by
the anti-European Community Bruges Group, and forces more in tune with the
approach to Britain's EC membership taken by Mr John Major, the prime
minister.
Supporters of Mr Mather, who took up the post in January 1987, believe he is
the victim of a long-standing campaign to undermine him.
Last year, Lord Harris of High Cross and Mr Arthur Seldon - two founder
members - threatened to quit the board after Mr Mather endorsed publications
backing a more positive attitude to the EC.
In a compromise 'truce' between the IEA's two factions last September, it
was agreed that Lord Harris and Mr Seldon would remain on the board and the
general director would stay in his post.
But controversy continued to dog the institute following Mr Mather's backing
for new policy proposals, including the investigation of further proposed
market-oriented reforms of Whitehall and Westminster.
The revelation that Mr Mather planned to leave at the end of the year
prompted him to give three months' notice. 'There is clearly no long term
future for any think-tank riven by internal faction fighting,' he said last
night. 'I do believe that the work for which I have stood at the IEA - the
extension of market solutions to European political problems and the advance
of markets into government itself - is worthwhile and has a future.'
Mr Mather, a solicitor who first came to national prominence as head of
policy at the Institute of Directors, plans to start a new think-tank, the
London Institute for Economic and Policy Studies. It will take a positive
view of a decentralised EC, look at constitutional reforms of the machinery
of government and the extension of market principles into public services
and examine the economic powers of regulators.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Markets await grim week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKETS are braced for a week of more grim news on the UK economy as the
first full week of the election campaign coincides with the release of a
string of monthly economic indicators.
The release of the retail prices index on Friday is expected to show a fall
in the annual inflation rate from 4.1 per cent in January to 4 per cent last
month.
The main focus of the week, however, will be Thursday's unemployment
figures. These are expected to show that unemployment rose by 35,000 in
February, the 23rd consecutive monthly rise.
Uncertainty about the outcome of the election, with weekend polls continuing
to point towards a hung parliament, is again likely to affect financial
markets.
The FT-SE 100 index fell nearly 100 points in the wake of the Budget on
Tuesday to finish the week at 2,476.
Meanwhile, pressure on sterling, which closed at DM2.85 on Friday, its
lowest level for the week, has virtually ruled out any prospect of a cut in
interest rates during the election campaign.
Job prospects were highlighted yesterday in a survey by Manpower, the
employment agency, which found that more big employers were expecting to
shed jobs than create new ones this year.
While prospects in manufacturing appeared to be holding up, banking showed a
continuing deterioration, with a net 19 per cent of banking employers
forecasting job cuts, it said.
The survey of 2,074 employers showed that prospects were worst in London.
Employers in Scotland were the most optimistic.
Yesterday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that, while unemployment
would 'continue to rise for some months yet', jobs would result from last
week's Budget.
'Anything that helps us to fight inflation and assist recovery is a Budget
that helps to create employment,' he said.
Other figures this week will provide little respite for the government.
Industrial production is expected to show a further fall.
But there may be some comfort for the government in Wednesday's retail sales
figures for February. The City is predicting flat sales between January and
February. But a survey by the Confederation of British Industry last week
showed a slight rise in sales for the seventh month running.

FT  16 MAR 92 / On the road to righteousness / Assessing the Brazilian
economy two years after President Collor took office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outside the petrol stations along Rio's Atlantic coast road lies evidence of
a sea-change in Brazilian attitudes. Large discount signs mark the country's
first fuel price war. Those with the best offers are rewarded by queues of
cars outside.
The price war is a symbol of a trend President Fernando Collor has set in
motion during his first two years in office: one of the world's most
state-regulated countries is finally discovering the benefits of a free
market. A year ago, it was illegal to discount government-set pump prices.
Mr Collor may not yet have succeeded in bringing inflation under control or
in stimulating the world's ninth-largest economy, but he has persuaded the
people that Brazil can no longer resist the global move towards the market.
'Collor has succeeded in implanting a liberal agenda and this process is
irreversible,' says Mr Cesar Maia, an economist from the Democratic
Movement, the main opposition party.
It is now possible openly to suggest ending the monopoly of Petrobras, the
state oil giant - heresy a year ago. A project to deregulate the country's
inefficient ports is before Congress. Discussion on the Dollars 120bn
foreign debt focuses not on whether to pay it, but how. The once zealously
enforced ban on computer imports ends in October. The stock market has
opened to foreign investment. Regulatory discrimination against foreign
companies is being stripped away.
The most outstanding demonstration of the change is the acceptance of
privatisation. The first big sale finally got under way last October amid
bloody riots. Only five months later, Mr Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, leader of
Forca Sindical, a trade union, is asking the government to speed up the sale
of steel companies so that they can compete better.
The old Brazil is still visible. The car producers threaten mass
unemployment at every mention of reducing import tariffs. The airlines still
collude to reduce routes and decide prices, and manufacturers still tend to
react to recession by lifting prices. But these are the last gasps of a
dying animal.
The change of direction should not be underestimated. Until March 1990,
Brazil was one of the world's most closed economies. Imports represented
just 5 per cent of gross domestic product and 1,500 products were banned
altogether. Prices had been controlled for many years.
Moreover, this state-run model was accepted throughout society. Mr Mailson
da Nobrega, an economic consultant and one of many former finance ministers,
says: 'In Brazil, economic nationalism was not just the product of a small
elite but demanded by everyone - the military, intellectuals, politicians,
business, students, workers, fascists, communists, even liberals.'
And until the last decade it seemed successful. Brazil built a huge
industrial base while amassing the developing world's largest foreign debt.
From the 1940s to the 1980s it was one of the fastest-growing economies.
Even when inflation started spiralling upwards in the mid-1980s, wages and
prices were so highly indexed that the disruption experienced by its
continental neighbours was not felt in Brazil.
Consequently Brazil has been the last Latin American economy to face
reality. It is behind its neighbours in the reform process. While Mexico,
Chile, Venezuela, Argentina and Peru were putting their finances in order,
liberalising and deregulating over the past decade, the Brazilian government
was still spending. As a result, it now has the highest monthly inflation
rate, at 21.5 per cent, and highest import tariffs in Latin America. It is
in its third year year of recession.
As growth started to flag, the government looked outside for a scapegoat,
blaming the creditor banks and the International Monetary Fund. Mr Pedro
Motta Veiga, director of the Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'It was like
eating to one's heart's content in an expensive restaurant without the
money. Now we realise it means an awful lot of washing up afterwards.'
The big question is whether, having introduced a market model for the
economy, Mr Collor can go on to stabilise it. While his first two years were
characterised by maladministration and confrontation, there are some
indications that the 42-year-old former playboy has grown up. The Collor
government of March 1992 has changed greatly from that of March 1990 - all
but one of the original team has been replaced by older figures who are
skilled at negotiating with the business, political and religious
establishment.
Chief among them is Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the mild-mannered economy
minister, who in 10 months has restored the government's credibility at home
and abroad and is personally responsible for its recent accords with the IMF
for a Dollars 2.1bn loan and the Paris Club for the rescheduling of its
Dollars 21bn official debt.
He has freed prices and unblocked half the Dollars 80bn in savings frozen by
his predecessor, while managing to avoid the hyperinflation that
characterised the Brazilian economy for years. For the first time, monthly
inflation fell four percentage points last month in the absence of
artificial measures, such as price controls. Above all he has, for the
moment, convinced the nation that shock plans do not work and the only way
to kill inflation is by tight fiscal and monetary policy, and sacrifice.
There has already been some fiscal improvement. Domestic debt has been
almost halved and the annual budgetary deficit (high-spending states and
municipalities more than offsetting the central Treasury surplus) has been
brought down from 7.3 per cent of GDP to 2.5 per cent.
The country is seeing rewards for its new responsibility in terms of an
increased inflow of foreign capital. Last year gross inflows doubled to
Dollars 11.6bn and more than Dollars 1bn has entered the stock market since
last July. In five months, foreign exchange reserves have gone from
critically low levels to more than Dollars 12bn and Brazil is expecting a
total of Dollars 2bn in foreign credit from the Japanese Eximbank and the
World Bank following its recent accords with official creditors.
The aim now is to impose a further squeeze on state company spending, bring
in a new tax regime in April, and continue the privatisation programme. The
government is hoping for a 10 per cent increase in exports to boost the
trade surplus from last year's disappointing Dollars 10.6bn (33 per cent
down on 1989).
However, there are serious obstacles to the economy minister's objective of
reaching monthly inflation of 2 per cent by 1993. Although this is the first
time in recent years that a Brazilian government has really tried the fiscal
recipe, economists believe it is relying far too heavily on monetary policy.
There is a good reason for this in the form of political and constitutional
hurdles which impede fiscal adjustment. The 1988 Constitution was designed
to amplify the role of the state. It gives lifetime jobs to civil servants
and even lays down hours for freelance photographers. So constrained, Mr
Collor requires amendments to balance his books. He needs approval from a
Congress where the governing bloc holds a minority of seats and where he
must negotiate with 17 parties. With Congress more preoccupied by the
municipal elections scheduled for October, economy ministry officials admit
that the necessary changes will have to wait until next year.
In the meantime the government is relying on tight monetary policy to
suppress consumption - real interest rates are at 40 per cent. Industry is
bearing the brunt and last month saw a record number of bankruptcies in Sao
Paulo, the industrial heartland.
The government's efforts to balance its budget are also in jeopardy. Falling
tax receipts resulted in a 73 per cent drop in Treasury revenues last month,
to their lowest level since Mr Collor took office. Mr Roberto Macedo, the
economic policy secretary, admits: 'It would be crazy to continue just using
monetary policy - it would damage the economy and increase the domestic debt
 -but in the short term we don't have alternatives.'
Suggestions for holding down inflation range from an incomes policy, price
controls on basic products and indexing the economy to the dollar  - the
type of heterodox solutions that have been tried before, though never
alongside genuine fiscal discipline. Mr Maia complains: 'The situation is
like a war with the troops entrenched. You can hold tight for a while but
finally you must strike or the enemy will first. Our enemy is inflation.'
Nor is it clear that Brazil, with the world's worst income distribution, can
bear the social cost of a long adjustment programme. But Mr Macedo insists:
'There may be a social cost but think of the cost of non-adjustment - we
have already lost a decade through procrastination.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Modest monumentalism - Colin Amery applauds the
decision to restore Sir Edwin Cooper's building at No. 1, Princes Street /
Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Edwin Cooper (1873-1942) was a great Georgian architect. Georgian, that
is, in the style of King George V. His public buildings are archetypical of
Edwardian splendour and optimism which continued into the reign of King
George V, almost undimmed by the First World War. He laid some heavy loads
upon the earth. In his early career he won, with his partners, several
competitions - The Guildhall and Law Courts in Hull; the Royal Grammar
School in Newcastle upon Tyne; the Rochester Technical Institute; and the
Middlesborough Public Library. He reached the final stage of the important
national competition for the new London County Hall.
Although he started his life in Scarborough, Edwin Cooper is today best
remembered for his major public buildings in the capital. He was very much a
product of those competitive days, which produced such an opulent harvest of
municipal and government buildings. In the decade 1895-1905 an average of
about 70 competitions were advertised in the building press each year. In
the years 1900 - 1905 some 50 competitions were held for new public
libraries. It seems almost unbelievable in these recessionary times, but it
is worth remembering that this was the period that produced many of the
public buildings now still very much in use.
In 1911 (two years before Buckingham Palace was given its Edwardian Beaux
Arts re-fronting by Sir Aston Webb), Cooper hit London with his first solo
competition win - the new Town Hall for St. Marylebone on the Marylebone
Road. Only Cooper would have thought of the Mausoleum of Hallicarnassus as
adapted by Christopher Wren for the denizens of St. Marylebone. The great
tower remains a landmark today with is almost cyclopian detail and emphasis
on form as much as detail.
Another part of London dominated by Cooper is in the City, Tower Hill in
Trinity Square, where he built the Port of London Authority (PLA) from
1912-1922. This is a handsome, megalomaniac, vulgar and yet very splendid
creation. You can never forget its massive tower angled above the Corinthian
portico, the giant columns of which range with the side walls. He also
clearly loved giant statues. Sadly the great circular domed hall of the PLA
building was lost in the last war.
I think Cooper's best building is the Star and Garter Home on the top of
Richmond Hill in Surrey. He got the point of the site and somehow achieved
the sort of domestic grandeur in brick and stone that suits the lives of the
retired soldiers.
In the City, Cooper's buildings have suffered. His home for Lloyds with its
fine Oval Room and The Room for the underwriters has been demolished and
replaced by Richard Rogers's high-tech building. The interior of the PLA
might as well have been demolished because its adaptation was so
unsympathetic. So it comes as a relief to see the recent announcement by the
National Westminster Bank about their Sir Edwin Cooper building in the City,
No. 1, Princes Street, at the heart of the Bank of England conservation
area.
The Chairman of the National Westminster bank is that civilised lawyer, Lord
Alexander, and he says of the bank's decision to carry out a complete
restoration and careful modernisation of the building that 'it demonstrates
a commitment to high quality architecture.'
Cooper's building was constructed between 1929 and 1932 for the National
Provincial Bank. It occupies a very important site at the convergence of the
ancient streets of Poultry, Cornhill, Lombard Street, Threadneedle Street
and Princes Street. Its immediate neighbour is the Midland Bank on Poultry
designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1924. In fact Cooper's corner building is
practically embraced by Lutyens's Midland Bank. But Cooper got the better
site where he designed an edifice of not inconsiderable presence.
The building is listed Grade II (as are the buildings owned and possibly to
be demolished by Lord Palumbo across the street) and the listing citation
shorthand perhaps described Cooper's work better than I can:
'1929 by Sir Edwin Cooper. Classical, stone, 5 storeys and 2 attics the
upper one recessed. High channeled base with Doric frieze and cornice; large
round headed vermiculated openings with big scrolled keystones, rectangular
niches with statues. Mezzanine above cornice. Three storey channelled antae
over, recessed five bay centres between with giant detached Corinthian
columns, bracketed cornice over. Plain attic storey with simple parapet.
High recessed upper attic with band of swag decoration and simple coping.
Corner of Princes Street and Mansion House Street statuary group of five
figures'.
This does not quite convey the gravitas of this building nor the clever way
that Cooper handled the awkward corner site. There are some who would say
that the plainess of this elevation shows the collapse of real enthusiasm
for the classical style. But I would say that Cooper understood that this
sort of late 1920s classicism, clearly built on a steel frame, should be
more cubic and simple. He kept much of the splendour for the interior, where
Nat West and its architects the T P Bennett Partnership intend to restore
the fine banking hall with its glass domed roof. Part of the extenremoving
the insensitive additions made in the 1970s and the replacement of much of
Cooper's original design. Walls of Subiaco marble and the two great bronze
sculptures representing Prosperity and Integrity will be restored. Cooper's
panelled rooms on the upper floors are to be carefully moved to form a suite
on the first floor.
Sir Edwin Cooper's architecture is well worth the effort of sensitive
restoration. It plays an important part in the townscape of the City and is
a good neighbour to the Bank of England, the Mansion House and the Royal
Exchange. The decision to restore and rehabilitate is a wise one that
respects the fabric of the City where modest monumentalism is completely
appropriate.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Pharaoh Sanders Quartet - Jazz Cafe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You could hardly blame Sanders for asking the crowd not to smoke during his
set. The technique of circular breathing which he employs, where air is
drawn in at the same time as it is expelled continuously across the reed,
brings a whole new dimension to the problems of passive smoking. On a good
night, a fierce saxophonist like Sanders will exchange the entire volume of
a small club like the Jazz Cafe through his tenor many times over.
These have been good nights at the Camden club with John Coltrane's sideman
teamed up with his own favourite pianist, Bill Henderson III and drummer
Idris Muhammed. However, if the packed house was there to hear the wild
abstraction for which Sanders is famed, the night was not given over
entirely to screeching. Instead, Sanders delivered a set of bludgeoning hard
bop finished off with a touch of the avant-garde, and raucous but accessible
solos to satisfy the strongest appetite.
Opinions differ over the right ingredients for hard bop: if it is the harsh
side of bebop, with blue inflection, and some deliciously abrasive
improvisation on the side, that is what Sanders is up to nowadays. The
quartet came to the stand late and, judging from the pent up energy released
in the first number, had used that extra time in the dressing room getting
psychologically pumped up. While Russell Blake on electric bass uncoiled so
violently it seemed a string might be broken, Henderson yomped across the
keyboard with an exuberantly clanging blues march set to Muhammed's forceful
time.
Against this explosive rhythm, Sander's corrosive sound, cutting in and out
of the lowest registers, was bewitching in its strength. Towards the end of
what I took to be 'So What]', the magic extended to Sander's taking the
instrument away from his lips but continuing to play using the valves and a
still resonating bell.
To close, Sanders put down the sax and brandished a huge skein of shakers;
Henderson conversed with an African talking drum tucked under his arm and
Muhammed beat a little gong very hard.
With his broad, white goatee which seems glued to carved mahogany features,
Sanders cuts a striking figure. His association with Coltrane and Albert
Ayler has him pigeonholed with the 1960s improvisers. But with the stabbing
right hand of Henderson, the blistering bass of young Blake and non-stop
pounding of Muhammed behind him he sounds more contemporaneous with his
young audience suddenly.
Had Courtney Pine not been busy at Canary Wharf's Cabot Hall, he would have
enjoyed it.

<TEXT>
The Tuileries Gardens in Paris, neglected for so long they have become
little more than a dustbowl flanked by sick trees, are undergoing a FFr250m
(Pounds 25.67m) facelift to restore their former glory.
Three landscape architects - Jacques Wirtz, Pascal Cribier and Louis Benech
 -are working with Mr I M Pei, who is in charge of renovating the
neighbouring Louvre museum.
The project is due to be completion in 1995.
At the launch of the project, Jack Lang, the French culture minister, said:
'We shall be leaving the main avenues, ponds and terraces as they were
originally intended, while adding new touches to liven up the back of the
gardens (near the Louvre).'
The gardens date back to the 15th century but took on their present form
under Louis XIV's landscape designer Le Notre in 1664.
The Royal Palace of the Tuileries, where Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette
lived during the French Revolution in 1789, was burned down during the Paris
Commune in 1871.

The Jinja Bridge, across the Nile on the north shore of Lake Victoria, where
the river drains out of the lake over the Ripon Falls, was built as a
two-tier bridge in 1930. It originally carried a single-line 3ft 6in gauge
railway on the top deck and a 20ft roadway beneath.
RPT were the consultants for the substantial modification of the bridge
carried out in the 1950s when the Owen Falls dam was built nearby. This
raised the river level at the bridge by about 26ft. The roadway was diverted
across the dam.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Management: The French disconnection - Chairmen of
state-owned companies face an uncertain spring and summer in Paris as their
contracts run out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of France's top managers are bracing themselves for a spectacular game
of musical chairs, umpired by the government.
The game will open in the spring and summer and trickle on to December, as
the chairmen of some 45 state-owned companies reach the end of their
three-year terms.
At stake is the senior management of such international heavyweights as the
car-maker Renault, Bull, the computer group, Thomson, the electronics
company, the chemicals group Rhone-Poulenc and aluminium producer Pechiney,
among others.
Preparations are already under way. Over the next month or two, the small
circle of senior civil servants and cabinet ministers responsible will draw
up the list of those they think should stay, move to another state company,
or make way for new players.
The final decisions rest with President Francois Mitterrand, perhaps not the
ideal umpire for this game given his well-known lack of interest in
industrial matters.
All this might seem out of kilter with the increasingly competitive markets
in which these companies compete. Yet it is only the most startling example
of the public administration's role in who runs corporate France.
Its influence is almost as strong, though not explicit, in who gets the top
jobs in the private sector.
Here the decisions are made through the complex networks of public
administration elite, allied for life by their common education at the same
prestigious civil service colleges, or grandes ecoles.
Many senior French executives openly criticise the influence of the state
and its institutions in the top jobs, a reflection of the more liberal mood
in French boardrooms in recent years, as well as the pressure from talented
executives who did not happen to go to the right schools and colleges.
The extent to which the state bias in French management might be at a
disadvantage against foreign competitors is analysed in detail in a recent
comparison* of the method of selection of the chairmen of the top 200 French
and German companies.
It was carried out by Michel Bauer and Benedicte Bertin-Mourot of the CNRS
state research centre, for leading headhunters Heidrich and Struggles.
The study says that France's public service stars are better equipped to
play at corporate 'monopoly' than to be professional entrepreneurs. They
also tend to be hierarchically remote from their staff and have less
experience of their companies and industries than their German counterparts.
'For companies seeking economic efficiency in a competitive environment, the
French model looks like . . . a real handicap,' it concludes.
The study shows that just over 44 per cent of France's top managers come
from a predominantly state background, whether it be a grande ecole,
ministerial cabinet, grands corps - an institutionalised civil service clan
 -or political friendship.
This is six times the level in Germany, where a background in industry is
the dominant factor for nearly two-thirds of top managers.
The weight of the grande ecoles alone is impressive: the three top schools
produce more than half of France's top managers, yet the gilded trio - Ecole
Nationale d'Administration, the Polytechnique and the HEC business school -
produce only 800 graduates annually, a tiny sample from which to draw so
much of the business elite.
The study does not doubt that the grandes ecoles are good at producing
stars, but it points out that German companies by definition choose their
top people from a wider field and so have a better chance of finding
exceptional managers.
In Germany, no college domof the top managers have doctorates, equally split
between law, economics and sciences.
German companies are praised for favouring managers who have risen through
the business after an industrial apprenticeship, are matey with their
colleagues and know their industries. Senior German executives know they
have a chance of getting to the top if they do their jobs well, a healthy
system.
But their French counterparts' knowledge that the top job will probably go
to an outsider parachuted in from the public administration is a serious
drag on motivation. This has a knock-on effect all the way along the
hierarchical chain, it says.
On the whole, French public sector job allocations have in recent years been
made more on the players' management merits than was the case a decade ago.
Few would criticise the professionalism of such as Alain Gomez at Thomson,
Francis Mer at steel maker Usinor Sacilor, Jean Gandois at Pechiney, or Loik
Le Floch-Prigent at Elf Aquitaine.
Yet it is not unknown for political patronage to have some influence and
this is an especially dicey factor to predict today, when the Socialist
government is in serious trouble.
It is no surprise that many public sector chairmen privately detest the
three-year term rule, on the grounds that they hardly have time to get used
to the job before the next reshuffle. This, they complain, is no recipe for
inspired management at a time when their markets are dominated by decisions
made in the US, Germany or Japan, rather than in Paris.
Moreover, several state companies have recently picked up powerful foreign
partners, who find the French system odd.
So it is that Pehr Gyllenhammar, chairman of Swedish car-maker Volvo, is
proving one of the main sources of pressure for state-owned companies'
boards, rather than the government, to choose chairmen.
He argues that Volvo, as owner of 15 per cent of Renault since 1990,
deserves a say in the choice of successor to Raymond Levy after he retires
as Renault chairman in May. An interesting row could be in the making here.
A similar situation could be imagined at Bull, where NEC, the Japanese
electronics company, became a small minority shareholder last year, and
which is just about to sell another stake to IBM.
The French government, cautiously open to change, is reflecting on limited
reforms, like extending chairmen's contracts from three to five years,
increasing worker consultation and inviting more professionals to replace
the public worthies on state company boards.
The current chairmen's mandate is 'too short in relation to what is going on
in the rest of the world,' admits Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister.
One of the many other revealing comparisons in the Heidrich and Struggles
study shows that 36 per cent of the chairmen of France's top 200 companies
were catapulted straight into the job with no previous experience of the
company, as against 16 per cent in Germany.
Moreover, 32 per cent of Germany's top managers worked their way up from
junior executive jobs, as against just 7 per cent for France's top managers.
Of course, there are bound to be exceptions - and French management methods
are changing fast. The point is that French management is still more
different than many people think.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Cadbury panel may invoke SE listing rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES wishing to be listed on the London Stock Exchange should disclose
the extent to which they comply with best practice in corporate governance,
according to recommendations under consideration by a government-backed
committee.
The committee on financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir
Adrian Cadbury, recommends tying corporate-governance measures to listing
requirements in the second draft of its report to be circulated later this
week. The committee is due to meet at the end of the month to discuss the
draft and prepare a final version for public comment in May.
Although Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, sits on the
committee, some exchange members are concerned about using listing
requirements to force greater disclosure by companies or changes in board
structures. They believe that too many requirements could deter foreign
companies from seeking a secondary UK listing, so undermining London's
future as a financial centre.
The Cadbury committee, which includes representatives of the Bank of England
and various accountancy, industry and investor bodies, was set up to
establish a code of practice for public companies. Publication of its final
report, planned for December last year, is now expected in May.
Investor groups have issued several papers on best practice for companies
and shareholders and the Cadbury committee recommendation would be the first
effort to put teeth to those suggestions. The report will include a long
section on the responsibilities of directors, particularly their obligations
for the veracity of numbers in the audit report.
The recommendations, however, fall short of what some institutional
shareholders had hoped for. Sir Adrian has warned that there may be
disappointment over the scope of the report's final recommendations.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Fall in legal aid solicitors recorded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION to plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work
in magistrates' courts increased yesterday when the Law Society published
figures showing a sharp fall in the numbers participating in duty-solicitor
schemes.
In evidence to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice the society says
that on average the number of solicitors taking part in schemes to provide
emergency cover at police stations and courts has declined by between a
quarter and a half since they were set up in 1986.
The number of solicitors taking part in the Cardiff scheme has fallen from
65 in 1986 to 41 today. In Exeter the number has fallen from 45 to 25 and in
Norwich from 19 to 1.
The society says several schemes are now under severe strain.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, who proposed the standard-fee plan, has
said he expects those leaving the scheme to be replaced by young,
newly-qualified lawyers. The society says the age profile of duty solicitors
does not support this contention.
In Birmingham, where statistically the society would expect 16 per cent of
those on the duty rotas to be aged between 25 and 29, only 4.5 per cent are
in this age band.
In addition to the numbers leaving duty schemes, the society says solicitors
on 11 of the 120 schemes in England and Wales are taking industrial action
by withdrawing from rotas.
The society says the schemes were introduced after the 1984 Police and
Criminal Evidence Act because the government felt it was right that suspects
should have the benefit of legal advice from a solicitor in the police
station. It was therefore up to the government to keep the schemes viable.
It warns the Lord Chancellor that once solicitors leave duty rotas it will
be very difficult to get them back without putting a lot more money into the
system. A little more money now might avoid the problem.
Lord Mackay has given legal aid lawyers a 3 per cent increase in fees this
year. The society says with rising rapidly overheads this amounts to a pay
cut of 5 per cent in real terms.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Britons increase holidays at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH took more of their holidays in the UK last year and made fewer
trips abroad, according to a survey published today by the British Tourist
Authority.
The number going on more than one foreign holiday, however, rose to its
highest level ever.
The number of holidays taken abroad fell 2 per cent to 20m last year. The
foreign holiday market was hit both by the recession and by the Gulf war.
The number of holidays taken by people who make more than one foreign trip
was 5.3m, up 5 per cent on the previous year.
The number of Britons taking holidays in the UK of four nights or more rose
5 per cent to 34m.
British spending on UK holidays rose 13 per cent to Pounds 4.7bn. Spending
on foreign holidays rose 6 per cent to Pounds 11.3bn.
The average cost per person of a foreign holiday was Pounds 550, compared
with Pounds 137 for a holiday in the UK.
The number of holidays taken in the UK fell in the late 1970s, but has
remained fairly stable throughout the past decade. In 1975 40m holidays were
taken in the UK by Britons. This had fallen to 36.5m by 1980.
Holidays abroad increased from 8m in 1975 to a high point of 21m in 1989.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Mortgage lenders are criticised by valuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME mortgage lenders are requiring valuers to pass them mortgage business
as a condition of being placed on the lender's valuation panel, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today.
In its response to criticisms from the Office of Fair Trading about the way
the valuation market is working, the institution warns that the quality of
valuation advice could be at risk.
It says a voluntary code of practice will not work as it is often impossible
to prove claims that a lender has asked for mortgage business and it would
be difficult to enforce the code. The panels of valuers used by lenders,
however, are falling dramatically in size and some lenders will not accept a
valuation unless it comes from a valuer on their panel.
The institution says new legislation is the only solution. It is seeking
backing from the Office of Fair Trading to get a change in the law.
Up to Pounds 5m is to be raised by the London Repossessions Fund, a Business
Expansion Scheme company, to increase the number of student beds in London
while taking advantage of the changes to BES regulations in the Budget.
Until now BES companies have not been allowed to buy houses where the tenant
is known in advance, making it impossible for them to participate in
mortgage rescue schemes.
The BES will buy some homes from their owners and operate a tenancy
agreement with them, allowing the owner to buy back the house after five
years.

FT  16 MAR 92 / National Savings up Pounds 393m last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of National Savings as a source of government funding for the
budget deficit doubled in the past year according to figures published
yesterday.
National Savings contributed Pounds 2.64bn in the first 11 months of the
financial year, up from Pounds 1.24bn in the same period a year ago.
There was a substantial increase last month, with National Savings
contributing Pounds 393.2m to government funding, up from Pounds 334.7m in
January.
The best-selling product was, as in previous months, fixed-interest savings
certificates, which contributed Pounds 198m net, but there was also a net
addition of Pounds 82.4m from index-linked savings certificates.
Four products - investment and ordinary accounts, and yearly and
save-as-you-earn plans - reported a net withdrawal during the month.
The rise in savings follows an advertising and marketing campaign by
National Savings. Sales through the two main agents of National Savings, the
Post Office and Girobank, increased in the wake of the campaign.
The chancellor drew attention in the Budget last week to the important role
that National Savings would play in helping fund the Pounds 28bn public
sector borrowing requirement next year. He said he would launch a new
National Savings product, a guaranteed growth bond, in the summer.

A LARGE proportion of UK companies are putting audit contracts out to
competitive tender, according to a survey by European Accounting Focus, a
monthly newsletter, Andrew Jack writes.
Many changed auditor as a result, and all which did so secured a reduction
in fees.
The findings come as auditors face increasing criticism for cutting fees.
The survey covered 26 large companies, audited by one of the six biggest
accountancy firms. A quarter had annual audit fees exceeding Pounds 1.5m.
Nearly one third had put the audit contract out to tender in the last few
years, and two thirds changed auditor as a result.
Half the companies gave their firm a score for overall performance of at
least eight on a 10-point scale. Half the companies also said the legal
responsibilities of auditors should be clarified by statute.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Bar sets up probe into sex discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRISTERS' chambers which fail to recruit and promote women are likely to
come under pressure from the bar council to improve their record following
the launch today of government-funded research into sex discrimination in
the profession.
Women account for fewer than 9 per cent of the nearly 7,000 practising
barristers in England and Wales. Men and women now gain legal qualifications
in roughly equal numbers.
The bar council has already taken action in an attempt to reduce racial
discrimination. In a move considered radical for any of the professions, it
last year told barristers' chambers they should aim for at least 5 per cent
of their members to be drawn from ethnic minority groups.
The sex discrimination research, which will be carried out by external
management consultants, is being funded by a Pounds 5,000 grant from the
Lord Chancellor's department.
Questionnaires are being sent to practising and non-practising women
barristers asking them about all stages of their career.
The bar council said the research would aim to find out:
Whether women experienced difficulties obtaining pupillages or tenancies at
the start of their careers.
How women were treated in chambers.
Whether chambers made provision for maternity leave.
Whether women could come back into practice easily after having children.
Whether women tended to specialise in areas of law such as crime and family
law.
Mr Stephen Sedley QC, chairman of the bar council's sex discrimination
committee, said the findings would 'enable the bar to develop a code of
practice to eliminate and redress any disadvantage experienced by women
barristers'. Results of the survey are expected in the summer.
Whose Flexibility? Discrimination and equality issues in atypical work. Prof
Linda Dickens. Institute of Employment Rights, 20 Durand Gardens, London SW9
OPP. Pounds 5.50 (Pounds 20 for commercial organisations).
ONLY 'honorary men' - women who conform to male patterns of working and
domestic responsibility - are currently likely to be able to gain promotion
at work, according to a study published today by theInstitute of Employment
Rights, the labour-law think-tank.
The report's author, Professor Linda Dickens of Warwick Business School,
argues that male work is taken as the norm, yet for many women 'atypical'
work, particularly part-time work, is the norm. Systems of labour law and
social security 'have similarly taken the male as the neutral standard of
the worker, to thedisadvantage of women who ..fall outside various
protections,' she says.
The best that equal opportunities legislation has achieved is 'opening up
male structured employment to women on the same terms as men and ..this
underpins discrimination and inequalities in atypical work,' the report
finds.
There is strong evidence that the extension of legal protection and
occupational benefits to part-time and temporary workers would not have an
adverse effect on job opportunities for those groups, Prof Dickens argues.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Casino owner attempts to assure backers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON CLUBS, the owner of six London casinos facing the loss of gaming
licences, is in talks to reassure its backers, which include banks,
institutions and private investors.
The casino group intends to make a vigorous defence of its record before
South Westminster Licencing Magistrates next month. It can only do so,
however, provided its financial backers - led by the Royal Bank of Scotland
 -stand firm.
The management of London Clubs is confident that the allegations made by the
police and the Gaming Board, in declaring the company 'not fit and proper'
to hold gaming licences, can be answered.
The immediate danger facing the company is that investors may attempt to
dispose of the properties to another operator rather than run the risk of
cancellation of licences and the loss of all London Clubs' casinos.
Given the uncertainty over their future, selling the casinos would be likely
to realise only a fraction of their real worth. Investors may stand a better
chance of saving their money if London Clubs has the opportunity of
defending its licences, as it believes it can, in open court.
If London Clubs was successful in securing renewal of its licences, either
at the magistrates' hearing or on appeal to the Crown Court, its future
would be very bright.
The action by police and the Gaming Board in applying for cancellation and
non-renewal of licences comes as a further blow to the already beleaguered
British gaming industry. There is a shortage of the 'high rollers' created
partly by recession and partly by uncertainty in the Middle East, where many
such gamblers come from.
The provisions in the Budget to speed up payment of taxes are a further blow
to cash flow.
There is a sense in the industry that the Gaming Board - with a new
secretary and about to have a new chairman - is no longer as closely in
touch with the industry.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Pledge on value of pound rejected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS executives appear unconvinced that Labour's oft-stated
determination to maintain the value of sterling would be sustainable once it
secured power.
Three quarters predict that a victory for Mr Neil Kinnock would lead to a
rise in interest rates as sterling's value fell against the D-Mark - a fall
predicted by the same number.
In spite of Mr Kinnock's pledge that he would hold sterling's present parity
within the exchange rate mechanism, 71 per cent forecast that a devaluation
would be 'very likely' or 'fairly likely'.
Only 25 per cent believe that the foreign exchange markets would allow Mr
Kinnock to keep his pledge.
By contrast, only 8 per cent predict that Mr John Major would devalue, with
89 per cent expecting a Conservative government to stick with the present
ERM parity.
The view that Mr Major's return to Downing Street would be good for sterling
 -46 per cent believe its value would increase and the same number that it
would stay about the same - translates into a similarly optimistic
assessment of prospects for borrowing costs.
Some 57 per cent believe that a newly elected Tory government could cut
interest rates, with 35 per cent anticipating they would stay the same and
only 7 per per cent forecasting an increase.
The stark division between the two parties narrows when businesses are asked
how the election might affect their companies' investment intentions, but
the Conservatives still retain a strong advantage.
With Mr Major re-elected, 31 per cent would anticipate investing more in
Britain against the 63 per cent expecting investment to stay the same.
Some 65 per cent say their plans would be unaffected by a Labour victory,
but only 4 per cent would increase investment spending.
For 26 per cent, Mr Kinnock's entry into Downing Street would be a signal to
cut investment.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE survey's clear message is that business leaders believe a Labour
government would be bad for the country - 88 per cent said it would be 'very
bad' or 'fairly bad' - but not quite as damaging for their businesses (58
per cent). Respondents were equally unenthusiastic about any coalition which
might be formed in the event of a hung parliament.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: How companies share in parties' political
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT will publish an index of politically sensitive share prices every day
during the election campaign. It is as much an aid to thought as a serious
stock market index, and consists of 10 stocks which might outperform in the
event of Mr Neil Kinnock's arrival in Downing Street; and another 10 stocks
which could benefit from a Conservative victory and the removal of the
threat of a Labour government.
The base for the index is the closing prices on the day the election was
announced, Wednesday March 11. Both the 'Labour gainers' and the
'Conservative gainers' sections of the index are set to 100 at that date.
On Thursday the Labour gainers fell 1.2 points - in line with the market -
and the Conservative gainers dropped 2.3 points, nearly twice as far. The
Labour gainers closed on Friday at 98.7, with the Conservative gainers at
97.4.
The shares in the index are based on stock market analysts' expectations of
shares that stand to gain or lose if there is a change of government. A
detailed study by James Capel, the stockbroker, has been particularly useful
in assessing these expectations.
Shares that analysts reckon might gain, relative to other UK shares, from a
Labour government include:
Companies which derive most of their profits from overseas and thus suffer
less from domestic political upsets, such as the tobacco company BAT.
Companies in Labour's favoured manufacturing sector, such as ICI, the
chemicals giant. Companies that might benefit from higher infrastructure
spending, such as GEC, the electrical and electronics giant; BICC, another
electrical business; and Taylor Woodrow, the builder and civil engineer.
There is also Zetters, the pools promoter, which might gain if the
Conservative threat to introduce a national lottery were lifted; and Land
Securities, the big property company, which would see the value of its
existing holdings rise if Labour adopted more restrictive planning policies.
Analysts reckon that gainers from a renewed Conservative mandate would be
those companies which would benefit from the removal of the threat posed by
individual Labour policies. Labour's promised policies will not be known for
certain until the manifesto is published this week, but on the basis of past
party proposals, losers might include:
Companies affected by Labour promises to reverse privatisation, such as the
water utilities, or step up regulation of privatised businesses, such as BT.
Companies likely to suffer from any discouragement of corporate takeovers,
such as Hanson, the acquisitive conglomerate, or SG Warburg, the investment
bank
Companies with many relatively low-paid employees which might be affected by
a minimum wage, such as BET, the business services supplier, or Courtaulds
Textiles.
Prudential represents life assurance companies likely to face tougher
consumer protection rules for retail financial products under Labour.
The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index
 -which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price movements and
unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour fails to win business hearts - FT/Mori
Poll Of Leading Company Executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S intense campaign to win the hearts and minds of British industry
and finance appears to have failed. A survey of board-level executives at
leading British companies carried out by MORI for the Financial Times in the
days after the general election was called shows that overwhelmingly they
believe a Conservative victory on April 9 would be better for Britain and
for their business. Nearly four fifths say a Labour victory would be bad for
the country and industry, and five sixths say it would hurt their business.
The single bright note for the Opposition is that for all their distrust of
Labour, business leaders would prefer Mr John Smith to Mr Norman Lamont as
chancellor of the exchequer.
Otherwise they predict that Mr Neil Kinnock's arrival in Downing Street
would be the signal for a fall in the pound's value, higher interest rates
and lower investment.
The 235 executives canvassed by MORI - drawn from the banking, finance,
insurance as well manufacturing and construction industries - are
self-admitted partisans. Nine in 10 say they intend to vote for Mr John
Major against the 1 per cent who support Mr Neil Kinnock, and the 7 per cent
who back Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats.
Understandably in view of their incomes, 94 per cent preferred the
Conservatives' personal tax policies against the 3 per cent apparently
willing to pay more under Labour.
Business leaders are not convinced that a Tory victory on April 9 will
signal the end of the present economic recession - two thirds say it will
make little difference. Nor do they give an overwhelming vote of confidence
to the Conservatives' management of the country. Fractionally under half (49
per cent) are satisfied with Mr Major's government while 45 per cent are
dissatisfied and 6 per cent offer no view.
Mr Kinnock and Mr Smith are likely to be disheartened by just how few have
been convinced by Labour's drive for economic respectability. Nearly nine
out of 10 (87 per cent) believe the Conservatives have the best policies to
manage the economy, while just 3 per cent back Labour.
Only when the executives are asked about technology and innovation, or
education and training, does Labour come any where near closing the gap. The
Conservative approach to those issues wins the support of 36 per cent and 49
per cent respectively, against the 22 per cent and 28 per cent preferring
Labour's alternatives.
More worryingly for the Labour leadership, the executives appear to believe
that a Tory defeat would signal a flight of capital, leading to a
devaluation of the pound and higher interest rates. Seventy-one per cent
predict that he would devalue.
The survey, carried out by Mori exclusively for the FT, was conducted among
executive directors drawn from the FT UK Top 500. In total 235 interviews
were carried out by telephone between March 11 and 13 1992. The response
rate was 69 per cent. A second wave of the survey is due to take place
immediately prior to the election. Copyright: Mori/Financial Times.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Lamont loses out to his shadow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Assessment of the relative qualities of the two party leaders is just how
overwhelming is the backing for Mr John Major.
The prime minister is preferred by 93 per cent against the 1 per cent
backing Mr Neil Kinnock.
But there is an unwelcome message in the survey for Mr Norman Lamont. Only
39 per cent believe he is the best choice for Number 11 Downing Street
against the 46 per cent prepared to forgive Mr John Smith his party
affiliation and say that he would make the better chancellor.
Mr Smith is particularly popular among executives of companies with a
turnover of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 2bn, where his rating jumps to 56
per cent, while the very biggest companies are kinder towards Mr Lamont.
Mr Michael Howard scores for his implacable opposition to the minimum wage
and to any increase in the powers of unions by winning the preference of 69
per cent for the job of employment secretary. Mr Tony Blair, the young star
of the Labour front bench, gets the vote of only 14 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Scots mark out the battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND is almost a separate battleground in this general election. In the
four-party cauldron of Scottish politics, several conflicts rage, cutting
across each other on an electoral map where, even by UK standards, the
number of seats won is often far out of line with the votes cast.
These are the two main battles: first, the Conservatives, who have ruled
Scotland for the last 13 years with a dwindling minority of the country's 72
MPs, are fighting to preserve their last nine seats against both Labour and
the Scottish National party.
Second, the Labour party, the largest with 48 seats, is facing a challenge
from the SNP which, holding only five seats, hopes at last to seriously dent
Labour's power in the central belt of the country.
Both Labour and the Conservatives need every Scottish seat they can get in a
close UK election. Meanwhile along the rural fringes the Liberal Democrats
are defending 10 seats, mainly against the Tories.
The most clear-cut issue north of the border is the question of Scotland's
constitutional future. Although to most individual voters it is less
important than unemployment, health, education and the economy, to some it
offers the solution to all these things. Scots are being offered
independence by the SNP, a devolved Scottish parliament by both Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, and the status quo by the Tories.
Though the constitutional issue could decide the outcome in several seats,
the election in Scotland will not in itself decide the constitutional
outcome. That will be determined by who wins the election at the UK level,
with the important exception that if the SNP wins a majority of the Scottish
seats (37), it will claim a mandate to negotiate independence.
The Scottish Conservative party could easily suffer disaster. It is
unpopular because it has ignored its minority position and imposed on
Scotland policies which most Scots did not vote for, notoriously the poll
tax. It is seen in Scotland as the English party because it has always
opposed devolution.
Last November the Tories, after losing Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal
Democrats in a by-election, began a high-risk strategy aimed at dividing the
opposition.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, insisted that the only constitutional
choice was between the status quo and independence. He attacked Labour and
the Liberal Democrats and largely spared the SNP. He calculated that if
support for the SNP rose, the anti-Tory vote would be redistributed and the
Tories, who do not hold a majority of the vote in any of their
constituencies, could save seats or even win some from Labour.
A switch from Labour to the SNP could enable the Tories to hold their two
most vulnerable seats, Ayr, where they defend a majority of only 182, and
Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education and health
minister, has a majority of 548, and even win others.
But the cost of boosting the SNP is that it puts rural Conservative seats at
risk. The ripest plum is Mr Lang's own seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale
(majority 3,673). Next come Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's in Perth and Kinross,
and then Mr Bill Walker's Tayside North. At the end of January an ICM poll
showed support for independence at 50 per cent, with Labour down to 38 per
cent and the SNP on 26 per cent. But backing for independence has since
fallen and Labour has recovered to 42 per cent. Last week ICM put the Tories
down five points at 18 per cent. If that poll were replicated on April 9,
not only would Labour would win Ayr and Stirling, but the SNP would take the
three rural Tory seats.
Yesterday's Mori poll for the Sunday Times was slightly more encouraging for
Scottish Tories, putting them on 23 per cent, one point below the SNP. On
those figures there could be fewer gains against the Tories (they won 10
seats with 24 per cent of vote in 1987).
Labour enters the campaign with confidence. Backing for a Scottish
parliament has recovered to around 45 per cent.
The electoral arithmetic is against the SNP in Labour's heartland. Because
Labour has vast majorities in most of its constituencies, the Nationalists
need to win around 35 per cent of the vote before they start winning many
Labour seats.
Labour's nightmare is if Mr John Major returns to Downing Street on the
strength of English votes. Labour voters might then flock to the SNP.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour ready to launch its largest billboard
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party in Scotland, which today launches the biggest billboard
campaign in its history, says it is aiming almost its entire election effort
at removing the Conservatives from their remaining nine Scottish seats.
Labour says it will not direct much campaigning resources against the
Scottish National Party because it believes the nationalists stand little
chance of winning seats from it.
The Labour party in Scotland, which holds 48 of the 72 Scottish
parliamentary seats, reckons that only by removing the Conservative
government from Westminster can Scotland achieve a devolved parliament. The
SNP, it argues, is largely irrelevant in this general election because it
cannot form a government at Westminster.
Labour believes that the SNP, in spite of standing at about between 24 and
28 per cent in the Scottish opinion polls, will not win many Scottish seats
on April 9. 'The only threat the SNP pose to us is that they could let the
Tories through by taking votes away from us in marginal constituencies,' the
party said. 'But on the whole they're just a distraction.'
However, a sizeable part of Labour's effort is being devoted to the Glasgow
Govan constituency which Mr Jim Sillars, deputy leader of the SNP, won from
Labour in a big by-election upset in 1988.
This is one of four places where Labour is unveiling an 'ad-mobile', a truck
carrying a large advertisement. The others are Ayr and Stirling where the
Tories have slim majorities and Edinburgh, where Labour hopes to win two
seats.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: A family open to persuasion - At least a
quarter of voters have yet to make up their minds, or say they might change
their minds. Among them is the Martin family who live in the heart of the
West Midlands, one of the election's pivotal regions. Paul Cheeseright will
write throughout the campaign about how the Martins see the politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Martins need to be persuaded. They owe no allegiance to any political
party. Their voting has shifted from election to election. They do not even
agree with each other. In 1987, Lyn and Tony went to the polling station in
amiable argument: Lyn voted Conservative, Tony went for the Alliance.
This time it looks as if the family again will make up its mind at the last
minute. But there is a new element in the TV watching and political
discussion at their home in Keswick Road, Solihull, near Birmingham. Lyn and
Tony's eldest son, Russell, votes for the first time. 'I'm open to
persuasion too,' he said.
While Solihull is a safe Conservative seat, the family is typical of those
in the West Midlands who, because of its number of marginal constituencies,
will help to decide who forms the next government. Among the Martins, it
looks so far that, of the main party leaders, Neil Kinnock looks as if he
has the most persuading to do. Tony finds him 'brash'. Lyn reckons that even
Mrs Thatcher didn't wind her up in the way Mr Kinnock does. Tony said:
'There was a party political broadcast the other night and it was the shadow
chancellor, John Smith. He, to me, came over 100 times better than Neil
Kinnock has ever done. There'd be more votes for Labour if he was leading.'
The low-key approach of Mr Major has gone down best with the Martin
household. Tony observed: 'I don't dislike him, to be honest. He was thrown
in at the deep end. He was lumbered with the poll tax. If he doesn't get
back, a lot of it will be down to the poll tax.'
Lyn added: 'Like that Mr Smith I watched the other night, Mr Major talks to
you, he doesn't dictate to you.'
For the moment, Russell, who is 18, used only to government by Thatcher and
heir of Thatcher, is a little bemused. 'I can't see what it would be like to
have Labour or the Liberal Democrats in.' He keeps up with the news via the
television and the Daily Express but he confesses that he does not have that
much interest in politics. 'Not particularly. No. To be honest, I don't. I
don't think many girls or lads of my age are interested in politics.'
Lyn and Tony cannot afford to be detached. The recession has hurt during a
period of rising family costs. They both work - Tony is a driver and
warehouseman at Michelin, the tyres company, and Lyn is a ward clerk at East
Birmingham Hospital. Between them, if Tony works overtime, they earn about
Pounds 20,000 a year.
Russell is a police cadet - 'Ever since I was about five I wanted to be a
policeman; I suppose it's every little boy's ambition.' - Westley, the
second son, is 14, and Keeley, Lyn's and Tony's daughter, is 10. The
semi-detached house is getting cramped.
Lyn and Tony, in their early 40s, have always lived on the south-east side
of Birmingham. They started in a council flat, saved for a house and took
out a mortgage of Pounds 2,500. They took another house and trebled the
mortgage, bought their present home and trebled it again.
Interest payments on the mortgage have been the worst part of the recession.
Lyn and Tony have also been caught up in changing economic conditions. Tony
was made redundant in 1989 although he was never out of a job. The part of
East Birmingham Hospital that Lyn works in is taking trust status next year
so her job, but not her pay, is being revamped. With all this in the
background, Mr Lamont's Budget was significant, but not necessarily
significant enough.
'The Budget did us no favours,' said Tony. 'I admire him (Mr Lamont) in one
way in that it wasn't an election budget, but there wasn't enough in it for
me personally.'
'They give you money in one way and take it back in another,' rejoined Lyn.
True, there was some help for businesses. 'They've done it too late,'
asserted Tony.
'But at least they're helping them before it goes any further,' argued Lyn.
'Yes, but even the big firms are struggling,' Tony came back. 'There's not
enough in it to influence the way we'd vote.' But he is not leaning towards
Labour either.
The Martins have a problem. Lyn says she is not leaning towards Labour at
the moment, 'I suppose because my dad had his own business, only the
Conservatives helped them out. My mum and my brother-in-law had council
houses. The Conservatives enabled them to buy them.'
Yet, looking back over the years since Mrs Thatcher took power her approval
of what has been done in the economy is qualified. 'We've got our moans and
groans, but we could have been worse off.'
The 'moans and groans' go to the heart of the election debate. They concern
health and education and spill into issues such as social discipline.
Lyn has a personal interest in health, not just because she works in a
hospital but because she had an operation last November and has been on sick
leave since.
'When I was in hospital,' she recalled to Tony, 'you went mad when I was
discharged because they needed the bed for somebody else.'
There are also fears about schools. 'Schools at one time had a sixth form,'
said Lyn. 'Westley has just taken his options. He's not sure what he wants
to do but I think he's going towards being a teacher. But the opportunities
 -there not being a sixth form at his school - are limited.'
Everything in the election debate is, of course, for the good of the
country: high taxes, low taxes, more individual freedom, less individual
freedom, soft on law and order, hard on law and order - the words cascade.
'We've started to listen to them all,' said Tony. 'At the moment we're a bit
like this . . . ' and his hands waved vaguely.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Waiting for a big event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City can call off its panic this morning. There is no certainty that
Labour will win the election. That was last week's fashionable whisper; this
week's is that the contest could be won by anybody, or nobody at all. Right
now, my money is on nobody. If any single party is to win, something will
have to happen. If nothing does - if there is no big event, or no
overwhelming argument in favour of voting one way or another - the result on
April 9th will reflect the national division of opinion indicated by the
polls since well before Christmas: stalemate.
The Conservatives tried to produce a big event/overwhelming argument with
last week's Budget. So far it has had no effect on the balance of support
for the parties. This could be because its up-front tax-cutting bribe is
hardly worth a couple of pints of beer a week to the average voter. There
may, however, be a delayed effect. The underlying message of Mr John Major's
Budget was defined by the prime minister in a competently-delivered speech
in Torquay on Saturday: 'We want low tax and personal choice,' said he;
'they' - meaning Labour and the Liberal Democrats - 'want high tax and state
choice.'
We and they will not be able to take the measure of a cumulative repetition
of this message for at least another week. The opinion poll results
published yesterday reflect polls taken three, four or five days previously.
Our FT 'what the polls indicate' chart, presented below this column, shows
the weighted average of the six polls with the most recent field dates. It
is recalculated every time there is a new poll. On this basis, Labour was
about 1 1/4 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives on Friday - half a
point down on its pre-budget lead. (Since telephone polls are excluded, the
indicated Labour position takes no account of the 2 1/2 -point Conservative
advantage suggested by Gallup in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph.)
In short, the campaign really does matter. Take the well-remembered events
of the final week of the June 1970 election, for which the then Mr Harold
Wilson's Big Argument was that the balance of payments had been put right by
his government. Now that Britain was strong, it was time to make Britain
great, he proclaimed. At first it seemed to work. On the Sunday before the
voting the Labour government was about 7 points ahead; one poll gave it
something like a 13-point lead.
On that same day Britain fell out of the World Cup. Next morning there was a
slight break in what had been excellent early summer weather. Then the
balance of payments figures appeared, showing (erroneously, it later
emerged) a sudden sharp move into the red.
By the Thursday what had been a 2 1/2 -point Labour lead at the start of the
campaign had been converted into a 2 1/2 -point lead for the Conservatives,
whose campaign message was not unlike that of Mr John Major today. To
everyone's surprise Mr Edward Heath became prime minister. He asked the
previously unheard-of Mrs Margaret Thatcher to be his education secretary.
In the February 1974 election the big deciding event may have been the
production of an official report saying that the miners, whose strike had
caused Mr Heath to call the poll on the wrong day, were in fact underpaid.
This was allowed to run on news bulletins for a whole night before the
government refuted it. The Conservatives, who had started 5 1/2 points ahead
ended up marginally in front of Labour in terms of votes, but fatally behind
in seats won.
So far, most of the potential deciding events of this campaign have been
predictable, which rather spoils their effect. Today's example is expected
to be the alternative budget prepared by the Labour shadow chancellor, Mr
John Smith. Its purpose is to vanquish Mr Major's argument. Labour, it will
say, doesn't really want high taxes, except for high earners, and what the
Conservatives call state choice Mr Smith will call investment. If the
advance notices are right, it hardly sounds like a decider to me.
I can think of two other possibles. One is the movement in the Liberal
Democrat vote. Many disgruntled Tories seem to be hiding there. They may
come back to the government if their transfer of allegiance is seen to be
likely to put Labour in. The other is our FT-Mori poll of executives, whose
results are published today. This shows how big business totally mistrusts
Labour. At a time of economic uncertainty, even Britain's soft electorate,
which is distinctly iffy about business, may be swayed by this.

<TEXT>
LABOUR'S alternative Budget today will be followed this evening by a
televised confrontation on BBC's Panorama between Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal
Democrats' economic spokesman.
The three main party leaders will appear separately on subsequent Panorama
programmes up to the election, starting with Mr Paddy Ashdown for the
Liberal Democrats, Mr Neil Kinnock for Labour and finally the prime
minister. The party leaders will also be interviewed separately by Sir Robin
Day on Sky News, but with Mr Kinnock, rather than Mr John Major, the last to
appear.
BBC1's flagship Nine O'Clock News has been extended by 15 minutes and will
feature foreign affairs editor John Simpson assigned to cover Mr Major,
foreign affairs correspondent Brian Hanrahan with Mr Kinnock and Carole
Walker with Mr Ashdown.
Sir Robin Day is back three mornings a week on BBC1's Breakfast News to
debate the campaign issues with a panel of 'three wise men' - Lord Jenkins
of Hillhead, Mr Denis Healey and Mr Norman Tebbit.
At 9.05am there is a daily Election Call hosted by Jonathan Dimbleby and
carried simultaneously on radio and television. The number to ring is
071-799 5000.
Campaign Report will go out three times a day on Radio 4's long-wave network
with the latest campaign updates at 10.30am, 3pm and 8pm. David Dimbleby
will conduct 40-minute interviews with the party leaders on the three last
Mondays of the campaign.
On BBC1 on Sunday evenings, Olivia O'Leary will present The Vote Race, a new
series designed to investigate what the party managers and manipulators are
up to. A studio audience linked to vote-meters will say whether they like or
believe the campaign messages.
The main ITN programmes will feature everything from live satellite links
from the constituencies to trend polling, focus groups and special reports
Channel 4 will also offer four critiques of the electoral process in its
Dispatches documentary series.
The network will also offer a special edition of the Channel 4 Debate on the
Sunday before polling day, an extended review of how the campaign is going
on Midway Sunday by the team from A Week In Politics and an election edition
of Hard News on press coverage of the campaign.
On every weekday evening Comment will be devoted to ordinary voters from
around the country discussing the campaign.
Sky will cover the daily morning party press conferences live in Sky News
Sunrise.
Sky News Phone-In will be extended daily to question politicians on the
issues dominating that day's campaigning, and throughout the day Sky news
crews will shadow leading politicians.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: BBC criticised after changes to talk show
format
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday challenged the impartiality of the BBC's election coverage
following changes to next week's edition of the Money Programme made after
the Conservative party threatened to withdraw its participation.
Government and opposition treasury and trade spokesmen were to face a
five-strong panel of senior industrial, city and trade union figures, with
Mr Peter Jay, the BBC's economics editor, in the chair.
The Conservatives said the make-up of the panel was biased towards Labour.
The programme will now go ahead next Sunday in a different format without
the panel, which was to have appeared in a total of three pre-election
programmes.
The changes follow the cancellation of last week's Panorama film, also
presented by Mr Jay, which focused on the government's economic record.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign coordinator, said: 'It is now clear
that the BBC is being subjected to intolerable pressure from the
Conservative party.' Labour accused the BBC of succumbing to Tory meddling
over Panorama.
A panel member, Mr Martin Taylor, vice-president of Hanson, the
multi-national group, said: 'I regret that the series of programmes is not
now to take place.' It is understood that Mr Taylor, a Conservative
supporter, believed the panel was balanced.
Conservative Central Office said yesterday: 'Two members of the panel have
been publicly identified with the Labour party. The political balance was
not right.'
Both Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and
industry secretary, are prepared to take part in the programme in a
different format.
Tory objections centred on Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU
engineering union, and Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods,
the food manufacturing company. Both are broadly sympathetic to Labour.
Central Office said it only knew of one member, Mr Taylor, who could be
described as sympathetic to the Conservatives.
Central Office said it did not know the politics of the other members of the
panel; Ms Janet Cohen, corporate finance director of Charterhouse bank, and
Mr David Sainsbury, deputy chairman of Sainsbury, the supermarket group.
The BBC said it regretted the Conservatives' stance but would not change the
panel. 'We believe the panel would have rigorously tested all three parties.
'The majority of the panel and the BBC felt it would be wrong to subject
only Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives to scrutiny.' The
corporation had therefore reluctantly changed the format.
Mr Laird said: 'The Tories are clearly on the run and not interested in
independent views such as the panel that the BBC put together.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Ashdown will unveil manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats will today unveil a manifesto backing a Keynesian
programme of public investment, funded partly out of higher income tax,
which threatens to overshadow the party's commitment to a free-market
economic policy.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, will try to set his party apart from
Labour's spending pledges with what senior party strategists describe as an
'honest costing' of its economic recovery package - including a penny on the
basic rate of income tax. The party would also abolish the government's new
20p band on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
The 15,000-word manifesto, 'Changing Britain for good,' also includes a
pledge that the Liberal Democrats will not support any government which
'turns its back' on electoral reform.
'Any minority government which tries to play games with the constitution in
order to cling to power, providing instability and dodging the moral
challenges of democracy, will have to contend with us,' its conclusion says.
The extra spending planned for housing, transport infrastructure, energy
conservation, hospitals and schools will create 400,000 jobs this year, the
party estimates.
The manifesto will also include a series of measures to promote competition
 -including plans for private rail operators to use British Rail's tracks -
reflecting Mr Ashdown's determination to steal some Conservative clothes
with his liberal radicalism.
Addressing Liberal Democrat candidates yesterday Mr Ashdown said the party
was committed to public investment, private enterprise and social justice.
'If we have to risk our vote by saying what really needs to be done then we
have the courage to do that,' he told the packed London rally.
'This party does not believe in high taxation. Believe me, Liberal Democrats
want taxes to be as low as they possibly can but we will not stand aside
while our economy is still stuck in decline.'
He dismissed Labour's alternative Budget as 'Mr Kinnock's hall of mirrors'.
Liberal Democrats officials claimed a victory in forcing Mr John Major to
take on proportional representation as an election issue.
Mr Ashdown said: 'A vote for Mr Major is a vote against reform, against a
modern system of democracy and in favour of a return to the constitutional
dark ages.'
About 50,000 copies of the Liberal Democrat manifesto have been printed,
excluding Scottish and Welsh versions.
Underlining the party's determination to change the political system, as
well as its leaders, the manifesto shuns usual conventions to present a
'World Bank-style' report on Britain's economy.
The opening page reads: 'Be warned: this manifesto may not be what you
expected.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Lib Dems form dawn patrol for campaign raids -
How the party hopes to capture the initiativeeach day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTLY after dawn each morning until April 9 the small, disciplined Liberal
Democrat high command will launch the first salvoes in the day's
campaigning.
A brisk review of events will be followed by a 7.15am press conference. The
8am news bulletins will carry the Liberal Democrats' theme for the day. The
others will have to catch up.
That, at least is the theory. Mr Des Wilson, Liberal Democrat campaign
director, has constructed a slim, but not tiny, strategy team to force the
minority party's message into voters' consciousness while others sleep. The
number of decision-makers is minimised and resources targeted.
The vanity of parliamentarians has not been pampered - Mr Paddy Ashdown,
party leader, is the only MP on the inner strategy-making circle.
It is a high-risk strategy, dependent on a few people getting on together
and working effectively through an exhausting schedule. Although experienced
and enthusiastic, the strategy team has yet to prove it is cohesive and able
to stand back from the campaign to see how effectively scarce resources are
being deployed.
The danger is of internal disputes, burn-out, or of being squeezed into
simply responding to the far larger campaigns of the Conservatives and
Labour, which will be dominated by ranks of ministers or their shadows.
Much has been invested in Mr Ashdown who, to outsiders, will appear to be
running the campaign single-handedly. He will travel from one end of the
country to the other for photo-calls and rallies.
Mr Wilson has a campaign budget of Pounds 1.5m - compared with about Pounds
7m expected to be spent by Labour and Pounds 20m by the Tories. He might be
able to spend more if fund-raising allows but is already assuming that
Pounds 500,000 will be raised during the campaign.
The biggest costs are the leader's tour, the evening rallies and the morning
press conferences. Precise figures are not being released but the
advertising budget will be small.
The focus will be on 'strategic' adverts in quality newspapers, by the TBWA
advertising agency, to grab the attention of opinion formers to the agenda
the party is trying to set. With television advertising illegal, the
financial disadvantage is not as great as it would otherwise be.
Yet with limited finances, the party's strongest card could prove to be the
campaigning prowess of its strategy team. The example to be avoided is the
1987 election campaign of the former Alliance parties.
Then, as much energy was expended on co-ordinating the SDP and Liberal
parties, and on soothing bruised egoes, as on the campaign itself.
Logistical and policy clashes were inevitable.
Veterans of 1987 recall with horror the day it was discovered, within hours
of transmission, that an already-weak party election broadcast featuring Mrs
Rosie Barnes, the SDP MP, should have been 10 minutes long, not the five
minutes prepared.
This time the strategy team will be dominated by Mr Wilson and Mr Ashdown.
It will assemble before and after the morning press conference and again
late at night, moving between the National Liberal Club in Whitehall, the
Horseguards Hotel next door and party headquarters in Cowley Street.
Gregarious and bubbly, Mr Wilson is a campaigning legend with a curriculum
vitae dating from his formation of, Shelter, the charity for the homeless,
in 1966.
In 1987 he ran the Alliance party's overnight operation. He has been
planning the present campaign for two years.
His deputy is the calmer Mr Alec McGivan, once a Labour supporter and
formerly SDP national organiser, who brings experience outside elections as
a full-time communications specialist for a campaigns consultancy. His job
will be day-to-day logistical 'crisis management'.
The 'intellectual' - and the nearest the strategy team has to an elder
statesman - is Lord Holme, the 55-year-old former president of the Liberal
party, who has written most of the party manifesto.
Responsible for Mr Ashdown's speeches will be Mr Alan Leaman, a researcher
who has also acted as press liaison officer in the four years since Mr
Ashdown became leader.
Ms Olly Grender is the chief press officer with responsibility for trying to
control the images presented on television which the party hopes both to
feed and fool.
Mr Tim Clement-Jones, former Liberal party chairman, will be responsible for
constituency associations and local candidates. Some of these are
well-organised, but others may well be founding wanting in the basic tasks
of securing the local vote.
The two other members of the strategy team are Ms Alison Holmes, assistant
to Mr Wilson, who will take charge of arranging party election broadcasts,
and Mr Chris Rennard, a veteran of Liberal Democrat by-election campaigns,
who will have particular responsibility for hard-nosed tactics in target
seats.
Of the nine members, only Mr Ashdown, Mr Wilson and Lord Holme will take a
high profile during the campaign. The main spokesmen - the party's MPs -
will be slotted into a schedule drawn up by the strategy team. Whatever the
frenzy behind the scenes, the public faces of the party must always be calm.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Hattersley promise on incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROY HATTERSLEY yesterday promised to reverse the redistribution of income
brought by 13 years of Conservative rule, as he rejected the notion that
Labour has turned its back on its traditional beliefs.
Addressing a star-studded London rally, the shadow home secretary played up
the constancy of Labour's guiding principles over the years and said that
the party would continue to fight for 'a more equal society'.
The 'great divide' between the parties had neither narrowed nor changed, he
said. He proclaimed Labour to be 'the party of the community.'
Mr Hattersley pledged that Labour would implement radical constitutional
reform, including replacement of the House of Lords by an elected second
chamber, and would refer concentration of newspaper ownership to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Promising to bring integrity back to government, he said that all senior
Labour appointees would appear before an all-party Commons select committee.
'We shall fight the election from the high ground of politics.'
Mr Hattersley said that a freedom of information bill would be the first
piece of proposed legislation presented by a future Labour government.
Three weeks ago he unveiled a right-to-information bill - almost identical
to a blueprint drawn up by the Campaign for Freedom of Information lobby
group - designed to replace the Official Secrets Act with a general right of
access to official records.
Developing the main theme of his speech, Mr Hattersley said he had grown
weary of hearing the Tories talk of freedom 'as if it were their invention
which they have bottled, patented and marketed under their exclusive label'.
He added that the Tories did not know what real freedom was. Labour would
build 'the free society that equality brings'.
The great choice faced by the country in future years would be how to spend
its wealth once the economy has moved out of recession.
'We shall not spend it on tax cuts that most benefit the highest earners,'
he said. 'We shall spend it on building a fairer and freer society, the more
equal society that most in this room joined the party to create.'
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow health minister, published figures showing that 16
per cent of National Health Service beds for elderly people needing
long-term nursing care had been cut since 1986.
'Under a fourth term of the Tory government there would be no place in the
NHS for the people needing long-term nursing care.' She hinted that Labour
would 'change' current arrangements regarding public subsidies for private
nursing homes.
BESIDES the big names and razzamatazz, Labour unveiled a secret weapon at
its lively weekend rally.
Two Real People - one a commuter, one a doctor - were dragooned in to share
the limelight. Set against the purple prose and set phrases of the various
shadow cabinet members, the voice of personal experience that they
represented left a deep impression and perhaps provided a pointer to future
campaign initiatives.
Coyly described as working for 'a major financial institution in the City',
Mr Alan Bartlett (the commuter) detailed the horrors of the daily trek in by
rail from suburban Chislehurst. 'My family are getting a bit fed up with the
stories I tell them,' he said.
Ms Iona Heath, a Kentish Town doctor, described her frustration at getting a
recorded message on the 999 ambulance service, while with a seriously ill
patient. She condemned fund holding for general practitioners for 'giving
GPs an incentive to refer their patients privately for the first time in the
history of the NHS.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: PM's first 'talkabout'with party faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAWTRY VILLAGE hall near Huntingdon was the venue for the first of the prime
minister's shirt-sleeved, one-man shows, or 'talkabouts' across the country
that will be a new element in the Tories' election campaign.
The day after officially launching the Tories' election effort with a speech
to a party rally in Torquay, Mr Major informally launched the campaign with
a 45-minute question and answer session. Selected members of the local
Conservative Association and some of their friends were invited to meet the
man who has represented them for 13 years and who received a majority of
27,000 in 1987.
Conscious that public speaking is not the prime minister's greatest
strength, party officials sounded faintly defensive about the new tactic,
emphasising that such meetings would be in addition to the set-piece
occasions and not instead of them. They had expected questions to be
difficult, as they had been in two dry runs, in Bristol last summer and at
York in January.
Such expectations were dashed by the automatic standing ovation and the
respectful atmosphere, in part engendered by a rousing introduction from Mr
Jeffrey Archer.
The prime minister, sitting on a bar stool and choosing his own questioners
from the 300-strong audience, looked at ease and relaxed, even if one or two
phrases such as 'savings ratio' and talk of buying 'that new consumer
durable' seemed to owe more to Westminster than to the common touch.
The questions, mainly on the economy, education and health, gave Mr Major
plenty of choice and opportunity to develop his themes of greater choice and
opportunity in the Britain he wanted to see in the 1990s.
Tory party officials have billed this and the other five or so such
occasions which are planned as 'not press conferences but people
conferences.'
But although it was the people asking the questions, the television and
lights and cameras reinforced the point made by Sir Geoffrey Pattie, the
party deputy chairman, who acted as Mr Archer's warm-up man, that the
meeting with Mr Major would reach 15m to 20m television viewers.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Major focuses pact hopes on Ulster Unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is keeping open the option of a post-election deal with
Unionist MPs in Ulster after his flat rejection at the weekend of Liberal
Democrat terms for a pact in a hung parliament. In his speech to Tory
activists at the launch of the Conservative election campaign in Torquay,
the prime minister dismissed any suggestion that he would agree the move to
proportional representation which Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader,
has set as the price of his party's support.
Mr Major also set out an uncompromising stance against devolution for
Scotland, warning that an assembly in Edinburgh would lead inexorably to the
break up of the UK.
However, efforts to re-establish an assembly at Stormont could form the
centrepiece of a strategy designed to win the support of Unionist MPs if the
prime minister fails to win an outright majority on April 9. There are
currently 13 MPs representing the unionist cause in Ulster.
Senior ministers said last night that they had not drawn up formal proposals
to present to the Official Unionists (who hold nine seats) or to the smaller
Democratic Unionists (three seats) and Ulster Popular Unionists (one seat).
The cabinet agreed last week that there should be no public discussion
during the campaign of any deal that might be struck with minority parties.
Mr Major underlined that stance in an interview with BBC Radio's The World
This Weekend, when he stressed repeatedly that he was confident of winning
an overall majority.
But ministers believe that if the Conservatives fall just short of the 326
seats needed for a majority, a deal could be struck at least with the nine
Ulster Unionists.
The suggestion now being canvassed by cabinet members is that the current
all-party talks in Ulster would be accelerated with the aim of
re-establishing a measure of self-rule in the province. If the creation of
an assembly could be agreed with the Dublin government, the Anglo-Irish
agreement would fall into abeyance.
Mr Major's apparent flexibility on Ulster contrasts starkly with the
hard-line position he established in Torquay on both electoral reform and
devolution.
Pouring scorn on suggestions that the abolition of the first-past-the-post
voting system would lead to a fairer system, he said: 'There will be no
deals with those opportunists who stand for nothing except their own
political self-interest.' He added that instead 'we are going to show up
their PR campaign for the sham that it is'.
Mr Major was equally adamant in his opposition to the proposals for
devolution in Scotland advocated by the opposition parties. He said these
could put the UK on the road to a 'Disunited Kingdom'.

While Margaret Thatcher will be abroad for the last few days of the

Followers of the Staffordshire Regiment, destined for amalgamation with the
Cheshires if the ministry of defence has its way, have put county loyalties
on the electoral agenda. Each candidate in the county's 26 constituencies
has received a letter from the Save our Staffords campaign.
'What we are aiming to do is for the 26 selected candidates to go back (to
Westminster) knowing that retention of the regiment is a priority in
Staffordshire,' said Brigadier John Levy, running the campaign from his
headquarters in the Lichfield shopping precinct.
In the shop window is a board which will list where each of the candidates
stand on the issue: at their meetings, the candidates will face planted
questions about the future of the regiment.
The Staffords were part of the UN spearhead which liberated Kuwait. Less
well known is that the Lichfield shop headquarters is owned by the Kuwaitis.
St Martin's Property Corporation, part of the Kuwait Investment Office, made
the shop available.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: In search of distinction - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the Tory Party's problems is that so many of its ministers seem to
look and talk alike: all part of the same Cambridge mafia. There is no-one
distinctive like the old transport minister, Ernie Marples: even Norman
Tebbit, who had some claim to be different, is on his way out. Yet there is
a case for saying that every government needs a Marples.
Labour has one, also connected with transport, in John Prescott, the
pugnacious MP for Hull East. There was a time when he looked an
embarrassment to some of his smoother and more revisionist colleagues. But
Prescott has stuck to his task and almost everyone must now recognise his
blunt tones. In one way, however, he has trimmed, promising to spend money
'only when resources allow'.
At the weekend, Prescott pledged to take the eccentrically unreliable
Docklands Light Railway back into public ownership immediately after the
election. There would, of course, be handsome compensation for the London
Docklands Development Corporation, the government-sponsored body to which
the railway is supposed to be handed over shortly as a first step towards
privatisation. Prescott offered Pounds 2 instead of the Pounds 1 that the
LDDC is said to be paying.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Can Mr Major stand up? - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A KEY question in the election campaign is whether John Major will crack. He
does not always seem particularly relaxed when under pressure. There is a
strain in his voice that sometimes comes close to stridency.
Mr Major came through his interview on The World This Weekend on BBC Radio 4
yesterday well enough, though the questions were relatively soft. On TV
there is just a trace of the problem of the young Richard Nixon and the five
o'clock shadow: the prime minister sometimes looks as if he is trying to
grow a moustache, even quite early in the morning. Such details can matter.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Labour's Tory manifesto - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday repeated an old trick when it launched a document it said
was 'the real Conservative manifesto'. Entitled 'The Patten Papers', the
booklet purports to outline what the Tories would really do in a fourth
term.
Among the policies Labour predicts are: value-added tax up to 22 per cent;
private insurance schemes instead of employment benefits and pensions; and
introducing private 'high fee-paying' roads.
So how well-targeted was Labour's black propaganda five years ago?
Well, the party hit the bullseye with its projections of more pit closures,
more tax cuts for the rich, the privatisation of water boards, not to
mention a poll tax for the whole of Britain.
But in some respects, it flew wide of the mark. The domestic steel industry
is far from dead. The unemployment register has not been abolished. Nor have
we yet experienced 'the end of the National Health Service as we know it.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Balanced Budget 'may be delayed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives' objective of a return to a balanced Budget over the
economic cycle might take longer than the lifetime of a full parliament, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, acknowledged yesterday.
Defending the Pounds 28bn borrowing requirement announced in last week's
Budget, Mr Lamont insisted that he was 'pretty sure' about the prospect of
making progress towards a 20p basic rate of income tax over the next five
years.
Interviewed on BBC television's On the Record, however, he declined to give
specific target dates either for the elimination of the borrowing
requirement or for the Conservatives' income tax target.
Referring to the 20p basic rate, Mr Lamont said: 'We have a medium-term
objective and I have very clearly stated that it may take longer than one
parliament, very probably take more than one parliament.'
However, he then added: 'I'm pretty sure and hope that we can take some
steps towards it. There is every reason to believe that we can.'
The introduction of the 20p income tax rate band gave the government
additional flexibility because it allowed the chancellor to move in smaller
steps towards the end objective.
Mr Lamont said there was no inconsistency between the aim of balancing the
Budget and cutting income taxes. But pressed repeatedly on when the deficit
would be eliminated he refused to be be specific.
He said: 'Cycles vary in their length. The Red Book accompanying the Budget
sets out a series of assumptions and and path for borrowing. It shows
borrowing at a very low level at the end of a five - six-year period'.
The chancellor added that the tax cuts in the Budget amounted to only 0.25
per cent of national income and therefore posed no threat the budget
targets, although it might take 'some time' to get back to a very low level
of borrowing.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Japanese politicians urge interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan came under renewed pressure at the weekend to cut interest
rates to boost a slowing economy and revive a sagging stock market.
Thinly-disguised calls for a further cut in the Official Discount Rate, the
central bank's principal indicator of monetary policy, were made by Mr Shin
Kanemaru, the LDP's deputy president, and Mr Noboru Takeshita, a former
prime minister and key party boss.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, has insisted he will not bow to
political pressure.
But there is growing speculation in Tokyo that he will soon decide of his
own accord to cut rates, given mounting evidence that the economy is slowing
faster than the authorities had hoped.
On Saturday, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, said the next cut
in the discount rate could come this month.
Since the beginning of last year, the rate has been cut three times in 0.5
percentage point steps to 4 per cent. Economic data published since the rate
was last cut at the end of December indicates the slow down in economic
activity is spreading, with the initial decline in spending on property,
capital investment and luxury goods steadily extending to consumer markets.
The central bank's recent survey of short-term business trends showed
business confidence declining sharply. Mr Mieno thus has plenty of grounds
for action without appearing to bow to political pressure.
Mr Kanemaru's weekend comments were particularly significant because he
caused a minor storm last month when he suggested Mr Mieno should be sacked
if he did not cut rates. This time he was more circumspect, saying at a
private meeting that the economy was slowing and the risk of a fall 'into
the abyss' should not be ruled out.
The comment stands in sharp contrast to the oft-repeated view of Mr Mieno
that there is very little risk of the slowdown turning suddenly into
recession. Mr Takeshita, for his part, called for 'decisive' pump-priming
action.
Though neither politician mentioned the stock market, LDP leaders are known
to be very concerned about the health of the financial markets, not least
because many potential contributors to LDP funds have been starved of
profits from financial investments. The Nikkei index stands close to the
20,221.86 figure which marks the bottom of the range it has established
since the bear market started with sharp price falls in early 1990.
Investors were relieved that complex futures-related settlement trades were
carried out on Friday without a further decline in prices. Futures-related
trading has been blamed by some Japanese brokers and officials for eroding
confidence in the cash market, though foreign companies, which are heavy
traders of futures, say the fault lies in the general weakness of sentiment.
With little sign of foreign investors buying stocks as much as last year and
Japanese institutions and individuals staying clear of the market, there are
grave fears that the Nikkei index could fall below 20,000 - back to its
lowest levels since 1987.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Flood of refugees feared as Burmese army threatens rebel
base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BURMESE army redoubled its attacks against ethnic minorities on the
country's borders at the weekend, threatening the rebel base of Manerplaw on
the Thai frontier and prompting further concern in the region over an exodus
of refugees, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
According to Karen rebels and Thai army officers, Burmese troops loyal to
the ruling military junta captured the strategic Sleeping Dog Hill near
Manerplaw on Saturday.
Fierce fighting was continuing in eastern Burma yesterday, but if government
forces hold the hill they will be able to subject Manerplaw, long controlled
by the Karen National Union, to a sustained artillery bombardment. Opponents
of the junta say the Burmese army has been ordered to capture Manerplaw in
time for Armed Forces Day in Burma on March 27.
Manerplaw has taken on an added significance for the opposition and for the
junta because the Karen rebels have been joined there by monks and students,
and by politicians from Rangoon who won the 1990 elections but were deprived
of power by the military officers of the State Law and Order Restoration
Council.
On Burma's western flank, Moslem refugees from Arakan have been pouring into
Bangladesh in increasing numbers, with tales of killing, rape, forced labour
and other atrocities committed by Burmese troops. Burma says the Moslems,
known as Rohingyas, are illegal immigrants, but the regime's opponents
believe it is trying to curry favour with the Buddhist majority and distract
their attention from the country's domestic problems.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, the Bangladeshi prime minister, is due in the US this week
for talks with President Bush and with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
Secretary General, and the official Bangladeshi news agency said the refugee
issue would figure prominently in her discussions. Bangladeshi officials
said more than 4,000 refugees arrived from Burma on Saturday alone, bringing
the estimated total to more than 200,000.
The ferocity of the latest Burmese offensives against ethnic minorities has
begun to arouse anxiety about regional stability among even the most
pragmatic members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, which
accounts for many of Burma's contacts with the outside world.
Malaysia and Indonesia, with their large Moslem populations, have recently
expressed concern about the plight of Burmese Moslems. Thailand, whose
military officers have enjoyed lucrative logging concessions in Burma, is
engaged in border skirmishes with Burmese troops trying to attack Karen
rebels from behind by crossing the frontier.
Even Singapore, which sells weapons to Burma and acts as a broker for other
arms manufacturers, including North Korea, has been obliged to admit that
the situation in Burma has created 'a potential area of instability for the
region and human suffering'.
Burma, Thailand and Laos - the three 'Golden Triangle' states - agreed at
the weekend to increase co-operation on restricting drugs production and
trafficking.
A joint declaration issued after a ministerial meeting in Thailand also
called for greater international efforts to curb demand for drugs.
No details were released on what the three countries intended to do,
however, and sceptics pointed out that the ruling Burmese junta is said to
have struck deals with opium warlords. The US says Burma is the world's
largest source of illicit opium and heroin. Mr Ohn Gyaw, Burma's foreign
minister, denied this.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Bad health to force Manley out of office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICA'S prime minister Michael Manley announced yesterday he would resign
on March 28, ending a family political dynasty that led the Caribbean island
to independence.
Mr Manley, aged 67, will be stepping down two years before the end of his
third, non-consecutive term in office. He said he was leaving because of
poor health, after five major operations in the past eight years, and that
the demands of leading the government had become too taxing.
He said delegates of the ruling People's National Party on March 28 would
select a new president who would become the prime minister. His successor is
likely to be either Mr Percival Patterson, the party chairman and a former
deputy prime minister and finance minister, or Ms Portia Simpson, the labour
and welfare minister.
Mr Manley, a social democrat whose first two terms as prime minister in the
1970s were marked by widespread state intervention in the economy, has more
recently presided over extensive deregulation of the economy of the island
of 2.5m people.
He said yesterday that the party had agreed that there would be no change in
the government's move towards a market-driven economy, and that all his
likely successors had agreed to this. 'Continuity is assured and
guaranteed,' the prime minister said.
Mr Manley's father, Norman, founded the PNP in 1938 to represent trade
unionists, and served as party leader until succeeded by his son in 1970.
The elder Manley was a charismatic and populist figure who spearheaded the
nation's independence from Britain in August 1962, seven years after he had
become prime minister.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Irish ayes and the Chicago float vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS perfectly clear who could win the Democratic party's presidential
primary in Illinois tomorrow, writes Jurek Martin. His name is Pat O'Connor,
he comes from Chicago's 40th ward and he would win, if he were running,
because he had easily the largest float in Saturday's St Patrick's Day
parade.
National politicians are not really welcome at this celebration of Irishness
by Chicago's policemen, plumbers, pipefitters and social club members. The
three Democratic candidates stayed away, not only because none can afford
contracting pneumonia from Windy City at this stage. Pat Buchanan was going
to appear but spent the morning with Ukrainians instead.
Their supporters were out working the crowds, though hopelessly outnumbered
by those running for local office. By the number of placards seen and
leaflets collected, Bill Clinton will beat Paul Tsongas here easily, with
Jerry Brown nowhere, but this is hardly a scientific measurement.
More reliable was a weekend Chicago Sun-Times poll giving the governor of
Arkansas 48 per cent, the former senator from Massachusetts 21 per cent and
the former governor of California 7 per cent. It also had President Bush
overwhelming Mr Buchanan by 79-15 per cent on the Republican side. The
Mason-Dixon poll in neighbouring Michigan, which also votes tomorrow, told a
similar tale, with Mr Clinton at 48 per cent, Mr Tsongas 22 per cent and Mr
Brown 11 per cent. But most ward bosses were more interested in local races
for office.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Re-birth of UK monetarism in a European disguise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has suffered, survived and vowed never to repeat its early-1980s
attempts at pursuing precise domestic monetary targets. No mainstream
political party describes itself as monetarist; all parties are committed to
continued membership of the European exchange rate mechanism; and all appear
resigned to the current combination of high interest rates and rising
unemployment.
Yet the current framework of UK economic policy-making remains similar to
the one that prolonged the 1980-81 recession. UK interest rates are again
very high even though the economy has been in recession for over a year and
inflation has fallen to European levels. What distinguishes the new-style
monetarism is its international flavour. UK monetary policy is once more
determined by an elusive broad money target; but the target is now set in
Frankfurt.
German broad money growth determines UK interest rates, and not vice versa,
because of the Bundesbank's anti-inflation credibility. The D-Mark has never
been devalued within the ERM, and no member country has ever managed to
reduce its interest rates below those of Germany. The pan-European interest
rate floor, set by the Bundesbank, has risen over the past two years as
inflationary pressures have built up in Germany following unification. The
fiscal deficit, tax increases and the generous terms of monetary unification
have all fuelled bank lending and wage and price inflation. In December, the
Bundesbank raised German interest rates and revised its target range for
annual broad money growth to 3.5-5.5 per cent. Yet M3 rose by an annualised
9 per cent in January, up from 5.8 per cent in December.
Interest rates across Europe stay uncomfortably high as a result. Moreover,
Europe's monetary policy will remain tight for some time, despite sluggish
economic growth outside Germany. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, last week reaffirmed its commitment to the current monetary
target zone and demanded an immediate clampdown on German credit expansion.
But M3 is not expected to dip back into its new target zone this year, as
the right-hand side of the chart shows. Inflation in Germany and slow growth
elsewhere make German money supply an inappropriate target for European
monetary policy. Does the broad money target make sense for Germany?
Monetary targets are only a good guide for policy if the relationship
between money and inflation is stable and predictable. The relationship has
been more stable in Germany than in other industrialised countries over the
past decade. But the recent UK experience counsels caution.
Domestic monetarism in Britain collapsed because the government tried to
target broad money growth just when an apparently stable relationship
between money and inflation was breaking down. The abolition of exchange
controls and supplementary special deposits in 1979-80 raised the proportion
of national income that the public wanted to hold in broad money assets. The
growth rate of Pounds M3 duly shot out of its new target range, as the chart
shows, even though inflation had already begun to fall.
Could German broad money growth also be over-shooting because the
relationship between the money stock and nominal income is shifting? One
reason why this might be so is that the D-Mark is being used as a parallel
currency elsewhere in eastern Europe. That would increase the demand for
broad money without fuelling German inflation. But non-bank deposits have
risen at least as fast as currency in circulation.
Another reason why the demand for broad money might have risen is the
proposed change to the taxation of interest income later this year. This may
have prompted investors to sell non-money assets and hold their savings in
cash and other broad money deposits. Meanwhile, east Germans are still in
the process of switching their broad money holdings into other non-money
assets.
All of which makes German money demand unpredictable, and the Bundesbank's
current task particularly difficult. A slavish devotion to fixed monetary
targets would be risky, as the UK experience has demonstrated. The rest of
Europe has little choice other than to trust the Bundesbank's judgement.

<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday invoked special powers to cancel a proposed
strike by air traffic controllers called for today, Robert Graham reports
from Rome. Similar powers are likely to be invoked for another stoppage
planned by different air traffic control unions for tomorrow.
Mr Carlo Bernini, transport minister, ordered air traffic controllers to
report to work as normal; those defying the order could face up to five
years' jail. Strikes last Friday and Saturday by the air traffic controllers
forced cancellation of over 80 per cent of all flights in and out of Italy.
The stoppages were called as part of a dispute over work conditions.

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outgoing Thai government has reacted with satisfaction to the US
announcement it was deferring a decision on trade retaliation against
Thailand until a new government is installed.
Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, described a new Thai pharmaceutical
and agro-industrial patents law as 'deficient in several critical respects'
but praised the government for pushing through the legislation, and said the
US would seek the discuss the matter with the new administration after
Thailand's general elections on March 22.
Washington is critical of the new law because it does not protect 'pipeline'
products already invented but not yet distributed in Thailand, and because
of the way it allows the Thai government to force a patent-holder to issue
manufacturing licences to competitors if its prices are deemed too high.
Thai debate focuses partly on whether Bangkok should bow to US pressure on
matters likely to affect the cost of medicines. Mr Amaret Sila-on, commerce
minister, favours negotiating such matters under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Fear and optimism among the Democrats: Candidates'
differences are more shadings than broad colours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELL, 'if you could clone the best of each of them, you'd have a pretty good
candidate'. Thus the voice of eternal optimism, and underlying fear, in the
Democratic party, expressed by a young woman interviewed on TV after one of
the latest in the series of debates, from Chicago, on Friday night.
The point is valid. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown were
civilised and serious; they jabbed at each other, but they did not maul;
they tried to mix minutiae with message; distinctions between them did
emerge, but they were painted more in shades than broad colours.
Mr Bill Clinton, governor of Arkansas, as befitting the one with a formal
job other than running for the nomination, probably showed the best command
of detail. He certainly talked more than the other two. Whether the subjects
were taxation or industrial policy, which they were a lot, or even foreign
policy (there actually was a question about what to do about dictators
around the world), Mr Clinton spoke with the greater precision both about
his plans and what was wrong with the solutions offered by his opponents.
Mr Paul Tsongas, the former senator from Massachusetts, basking in the
endorsement of the Chicago Tribune that morning, kept emphasising that his
economic policies were the most realistic. He repeated over and again his
well-worn slogans that there was no longer a Santa Claus or candy store to
take the public mind off the real problems of economic competitiveness with
the likes of Germany and Japan. But he was constantly pressed by Mr Clinton
on the fine print of his tax and investment proposals.
Much the loosest of the three and much the most adept at the populist
anti-Washington one-liner, Mr Jerry Brown, the previous governor of
California, cheerfully bashed on with his message of the need for 'economic
and social justice'. To him, this meant stopping the export of jobs to
low-wage Mexico, introducing a flat 13 per cent rate income tax, a
comprehensive new energy policy, the creation of 50 new enterprise zones,
and the building of 'B2 bullet trains'.
On the foreign policy question, Mr Clinton asserted that General Norman
Schwarzkopf, the US Gulf war commander, was right and the allied troops
should have fought on another few days further to weaken capabilities of the
Iraqi Republican Guard. But, he added, 'we gave our word not to go to
Baghdad' and that was correct. Pressed by Mr Tsongas that his stand on the
war had been ambiguous, Mr Clinton insisted that whatever the prior mistakes
of US policies in the region, President Bush was right to go to war and
should not have been denied that right by the Congress.
response meant that Mr Tsongas was left only with the observation that the
US no longer needed as many troops as it now had in Europe. Mr Brown
regretted the slaughter of Shias and Kurds in Iraq and complained about
administration policy, but added that the real issue was the number of
unemployed in Michigan.
The state of the domestic economy is, relatively, Mr Tsongas' strong suit
and he reminded everyone that, when in Congress, he was one of the 11
Democratic senators to vote against the Reagan-Bush tax cuts of 1982. Now,
he said, the Democrats, by inference mostly Mr Clinton, were engaging in
their own form of 'voodoo economics' by blithely promising unaffordable
middle-class tax cuts.
This induced Mr Clinton to accuse Mr Tsongas of a 'kinder, gentler form' of
Reaganomics, and Mr Tsongas to charge that Mr Clinton refused to ask
Americans to make any sacrifices at all. Both then engaged in a vigorous
exchange about petrol taxes, leaving Mr Brown free to score most heavily by
pointing out that the average 'working stiff' was always losing out through
this sort of insider-policy debate.
Mr Clinton asked Mr Brown to reconcile his previous support of a north
American free trade zone with his vigorous opposition to it. Mr Brown
replied that a regulated common market, as in Europe, was fine but a regime
which merely allowed the export of American jobs to Mexico, because it was
cheaper, was not. Mr Brown must have mentioned Mexico at least half a dozen
times in the debate.
The closing statements covered well-travelled territory, Mr Tsongas invoking
Santa Claus and his own recovery from cancer, Mr Brown 'keeping the jobs
here' and not, of course, in Mexico, and Mr Clinton promising 'a new kind of
politics - putting people first'.
There was, it should be said, no mention of the 'character' issue dogging Mr
Clinton. Each was intent on putting his best foot forward - and into
President Bush. When not confronted with each other and dealing only in
soundbites, the reticence is less apparent. And they were due to go at it
again here last night.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Push to harmonise air traffic systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT ministers from the 28 countries in the European Civil Aviation
Conference (ECAC) will meet in London tomorrow to step up efforts to improve
Europe's fragmented and inadequate air traffic control structure.
Airlines and civil aviation authorities have warned that Europe faces an air
travel crisis in the next few years unless urgent action is taken to
harmonise and integrate European air traffic control systems.
Air traffic delays are estimated to cost European airlines Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.2bn)-Dollars 5bn a year, and airlines say the current air traffic
control system risks undermining Brussels' efforts to liberalise European
air transport.
The problem is highlighted in a report the transport ministers will
consider. The report says the work needed to harmonise and improve air
traffic control 'will be much greater' than first estimated.
The biggest deficiency of the present network is that the different European
air traffic control centres use computers from 18 different makers with 22
different operating systems and 33 different programming languages.
Two years ago, the transport ministers launched a long-term initiative to
enhance European air traffic control in response to the air travel crisis of
summer 1988, when Europe's system could not cope with heavy holiday demand,
with thousands of passengers stranded at airports.
The problem was acute in the UK where delays have been exacerbated by air
traffic congestion in continental Europe, as well as regular strikes by
continental air traffic controllers.
ECAC ministers will attempt to draw up concrete proposals to integrate the
different European air traffic control systems. They are also expected to
consider introducing new air routes and airspace structures, and new
facilities with common procedures.
Although last year's air travel slump caused by the recession and the Gulf
conflict eased some of the immediate pressures facing European air traffic
control, the recovery in traffic this year is expected to revive the
problem.
Figures for airline punctuality, released by the Association of European
Airlines (AEA), which groups 22 European carriers, showed little improvement
in delays last year despite the traffic slowdown.
The AEA said 19 per cent of airline departures in Europe were delayed more
than 15 minutes last year, only slightly better than the previous year.
The AEA also said congestion continued to grow in Europe last year with
54,000 aircraft hours lost because of congestion.
This was the equivalent to the annual workload of a fleet of 20 short-haul
jets.
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, the current AEA chairman and managing director of
Alitalia, recently warned that Europe's inadequate air traffic control
system could lead to another summer of delays and cancellations this year.

the Ukraine has once again raised hopes about the potential for large-scale
trade in electricity between eastern and western Europe.
The Austrian electrical utility, Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtshafts
(OEL), is to buy up to 800m kW hours annually from Interenergo in Kiev for
15 years. The total value of the contract could rise to ASch7bn Pounds
347.5m).
In return, the Ukrainian power authority has agreed to use part of the
proceeds from the sale to buy Austrian equipment and know-how to improve
control of emissions at three of its coal-fired power stations. It will also
buy gas turbines to increase their efficiency.
This deal echoes another a year ago between Czechoslovakia and Germany.
Then, Bayernwerk, a Munich utility, agreed to buy about 1,400MW of
electricity from the Mochovce nuclear power station being built in western
Slovakia.
Czechoslovakia has agreed to use the revenue from its sale to instal
instruments and control systems supplied by Siemens to bring the plant up to
western safety standards. Once the new plant is running, two older and more
dangerous nuclear plants elsewhere in the country will be shut down, much to
the relief of Germany and Austria.
These quasi-barter deals could become models for several others. It is
generally agreed that all the nuclear power plants in the former Soviet
Union and eastern Europe are in poor condition. Many are beyond repair and
must be shut down and others will require massive investment to bring them
up to western safety standards.
Mr Adolf Huttl, head of the KWU energy division of Siemens, said recently
that it would cost DM12bn (Pounds 4.1bn) to renovate all of the 63
pressurised water reactors in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. This
excludes the 16 Chernobyl type reactors. Like most experts, Mr Huttl
believes they are too badly designed to be worth repairing.
However, there are a number of practical obstacles to further large-scale
barter deals. For one thing, most eastern European countries are net
importers of electricity, and do not have surplus power to sell.
Some analysts have even raised their eyebrows over the Austria-Ukraine deal
on these grounds. The Ukraine would appear to be in a worse supply position
than some other east European countries because it faces the prospect of
having to shut down the two remaining 1000MW units at Chernobyl.
The Austrians say they are confident of power deliveries under the contract
because the Ukraine has so much other generating capacity, including four
less dangerous pressurised water reactor (PWR) nuclear stations. Privately,
they say they are counting on a substantial decline in domestic demand for
power in the Ukraine in the next few years as industrial output there falls
sharply.
There would also seem to be little potential for sales of electricity from
western European countries to eastern ones, even assuming that the eastern
countries could to pay for it.
Except for France, most western European countries have inadequate
generating capacity for their own needs.
Moreover, environmental lobbies would be strong enough to block or slow
construction of new power stations, especially those where output was
designed largely for export.
Another obstacle to trade is the lack of transmission capacity between
eastern and western Europe. Western European utilities do not want to
connect their grid to the Comecon grid because its voltage is not
stabilised.
The alternative is to move power on high voltage direct current lines.
However at the moment, there is only one such line, of limited capacity,
connecting east and west, between Austria and Hungary.
Austria will have to expand this capacity to get all the power it wants from
the Ukraine, and it remains to be seen if OEL can overcome opposition to new
power line construction from the substantial number of people in the country
who believe high voltage lines cause cancer.
Even if it does, it will not be able to take the volumes foreseen in its
contract with the Ukraine until at least 1996.
There is, of course, an even more fundamental obstacle to substantial
east-west trade in electricity. Both parts of Europe have virtually
identical weather and seasonal patterns, which severely limits the
opportunity for offsetting each other's demand peaks and troughs.
Perhaps the greatest prospects for energy trade between east and west are
still along the lines developed during the cold war, with the west buying
the east's oil and gas in return for hard currency.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Internal threat to Russian unity increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITY of the Russian Federation is increasingly being called into
question, with the issue of independence for autonomous republics now seen
to be as grave a threat to the government in Moscow as the economic crisis.
The extent of the problem was highlighted last Friday when two of Russia's
20 autonomous republics refused to initial a federative treaty aimed at
establishing relationships between these republics and the federal
government.
The two - Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia - are both relatively oil-rich,
and see their economic future as brighter with independence from Russia.
Tatarstan holds a referendum on independence next Saturday, amid warnings
from Russian politicians that a yes vote would spark off a dangerous
constitutional struggle.
Mr Valdimir Lysenko, a member of the constitutional commission, said:
'Tatarstan did not sign the treaty because I believe it plans to secede from
the federation.'
Of the other republics which initialled the treaty, a number - including
Bashkiria, Yakutia, Komi and Karelia - have raised strong objections to the
agreement, which is to be part of the Russian federation's new constitution.
The agreement must also be ratified by the parliaments of these republics,
in many cases now strongly independence-minded.
Critics of the government's policy - foremost among them, Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, the vice-president, are calling for a crackdown on the republican
authorities before the independence bandwagons become unstoppable.
The terms of the treaty allow for central control over most military,
economic and foreign affairs issues. The autonomous republics will have
control over mineral resources - an important concession, especially to a
republic like Yakutia with the largest diamond reserves in Russia.
The threat to Russian unity comes as nationalist and communist forces, now
formally united, plan a huge rally tomorrow in the centre of Moscow to
coincide with an attempt by former Soviet deputies to hold a session of the
USSR Congress of People's Deputies.
Both the demonstration and the session are aimed at providing a focus and a
sounding board for dissatisfactions over prices, national disintegration and
fears of increased violence and tension between the former Soviet republics.
Mr Rutskoi, speaking at a conference yesterday in Moscow warned that the
break-up of the army brought a risk of civil war.

FT  16 MAR 92 / UN troops fan out across Croatia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE commander of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia
yesterday warned of the perils awaiting his troops as advanced parties
prepared to fan out to the war zones in the now independent republic of
Croatia.
General Satish Nambiar of India told some 340 peacekeepers at a barracks
north of Belgrade: 'We must bear in mind that we face a difficult and very
delicate task of preserving peace.' He was speaking after eight people were
killed on Saturday and more than 20 wounded in fighting between Serbian and
Croatian forces.
Gen Nambiar said he was aware that 'some of you have been rushed to this at
a very short notice. The reason for this was to bring in the force as soon
as possible.'
The UN Security Council has delayed the deployment of the bulk of the 14,000
peacekeepers pending its approval of a scaled-down budget, probably by April
1. The original figure of Dollars 634m (Pounds 360.2m) encountered
opposition from the council.
Mr Fred Eckhart, the UN spokesman, said: 'We have been given the yellow
light, but not the green.' Agreement on a new budget would allow for the
despatch within three weeks of the remaining forces. British officials
yesterday confirmed the 'temporary postponement' of the despatch of some
1,200 British troops until after the UK general election next month.
But the UN peacekeepers on the ground yesterday appeared eager to begin
their mission despite the potential dangers.
Col Robert Meille, the commander of a French infantry battalion, said:
'We're confident of success because our mission is to assure all sides that
peace is the only alternative'. France is sending the largest single
contingent.
Many of the peacekeepers arrived at the weekend. 'We had received a
three-day notice before coming here,' said Col Yuri Levchenko of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, bearing the insignia 'Russia' on his
fatigues. Col Levchenko, a veteran of the Afghan war, is heading a
contingent of several hundred soldiers, the first ever force of UN
peacekeepers from the former Soviet Union. They will be deployed in
Croatia's eastern Slavonia, the scene of some of the worst fighting.
Both Croatia and the Serb-controlled army have welcomed the deployment of UN
peacekeepers, but there have been regular violations of the 10-week old
ceasefire. Gen Nambiar yesterday stressed the importance for the
peacekeepers to be impartial, warning of the 'sensitive situation' in the
field.
The Serb-dominated Yugoslav federal army yesterday handed over the main
border crossing with Greece to the defence forces of the breakaway republic
of Macedonia, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
The Macedonian forces took over the Gevgelija crossing and all other
frontier posts to the east on the Greek border 'in a dignified manner', the
Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said. The hand-over could deepen a crisis
between Macedonia and Greece, which is blocking European Community
recognition of the southern republic of about 2m Macedonian Slavs and ethnic
Albanians.
Athens has refused to let people identifying themselves as Macedonians cross
the border and accuses the republic of having territorial ambitions on
Greece's northern province of Macedonia. Gevgelija is the main crossing
point to the EC for Greek agricultural produce and other goods.
Mr Jose Cutileiro, the Portuguese ambassador whose country holds the
rotating EC presidency, met in the Macedonian capital of Skopje yesterday
with the republic's foreign minister, Mr Denko Maleski, to discuss the
dispute with Greece.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Business chiefs want decisive Tory win: FT survey indicates
fear of sterling devaluation within ERM under Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S business leaders want a decisive Conservative victory on April 9,
fearing that the election of a Labour government would lead to a falling
pound and higher borrowing costs.
In a survey of board-level executives conducted by MORI for the Financial
Times, seven out of 10 predict that Mr Neil Kinnock's entry into Downing
Street would be followed by a devaluation of sterling within the Exchange
Rate Mechanism. Three-quarters of those surveyed believe that interest rates
would rise.
Only 49 per cent, however, say they are satisfied 'with the way the
government is running the country'.
Asked to say who would make the better chancellor, 46 per cent opt for
Labour's Mr John Smith against the 39 per cent who prefer Mr Norman Lamont,
the present incumbent.
Some 8 out of 10 of the executives, drawn from many of the country's largest
companies, say that an inconclusive election resulting in a coalition
government would be bad for the country.
A slightly smaller proportion - 6 out of 10 - added that such an outcome
would also damage their business.
The business leaders are not in buoyant mood; nor are they entirely happy
with the present government.
Instead, their responses underline deep concern about the impact of the
recession. Only 29 per cent accept the Conservative claim that Mr John
Major's return to Downing Street would speed up economic recovery.
Nearly two-thirds believe that the prime minister's re-election would make
little difference to the pace of any upturn.
But the clearest message of the survey - published on the day that Mr Smith
plans to unveil in his shadow Budget a range of measures to boost industrial
investment and training - is that in the highly-charged atmosphere of a
general election, the business community is unwilling to give public backing
to Labour's economic strategy.
Mr Smith has been joined repeatedly by Mr Kinnock in emphasising that a
Labour government would not devalue sterling within the ERM. But the
executives appear to have concluded that they would be unable to resist
speculation against the pound.
On overall economic management, 87 per cent say they prefer the
Conservatives against only 3 per cent who are convinced by the alternatives
offered by the main opposition party.
Despite Mr Smith's promise of new tax incentives for investment projects -
which he plans to spell out in detail today - a quarter of the respondents
suggest their companies might reduce their investment spending if Labour
were elected. Some 31 per cent say Mr Major's return to Downing Street would
bring a rise in their companies' capital spending in Britain.
The respondents to the survey - drawn from the FT top 500 companies - are
avowedly Conservative supporters.
Only 1 per cent of those surveyed plan to vote for the Labour party on April
9 against the 92 per cent who say they will back the Conservatives.
Predictably perhaps, 93 per cent say that Mr Major would make a better prime
minister than Mr Kinnock.
Only Mr Smith among Labour holders of the main economic portfolios outpoints
his opposite number.
Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the trade
and industry secretary, both outpoint Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown,
their respective shadows.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Opposition'Budget' to offer tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will today try to 'trump' the Budget by offering an alternative
tax-cutting scheme under which personal allowances would more than double
and the National Insurance contributions (NICs) structure would be altered.
Party officials said its tax and benefits plan, due to be announced by Mr
John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will make almost nine out of 10 families
better off through changes targeted at the very poor and families on average
incomes. They also hinted that the proposed 50p top rate of income tax would
affect only those earning more than Pounds 40,000 a year.
Yesterday, Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a BBC radio interview to
accuse the Liberal Democrats and Labour of having a 'a fetish' for tax rises
with very damaging implications for individuals and business.
His claim was firmly denied by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader. While his party was ready to raise standard-rate tax by 1p to pay
for better education programmes, Mr Ashdown insisted: 'We want taxes to be
as low as they possibly can.'
Mr Smith's scheme is intended to counter repeated accusations by senior
Conservatives that his pledge to scrap the new 20p tax band amounts to
increased taxes for the low-paid.
It would raise allowances by more than double the 4.5 per cent annual
inflation rate taking 750,000 people out of tax at a cost to the Treasury
expected to be more than Pounds 800m. A central element in the scheme is the
proposed abolition of the first band of NICs which imposes a 2 per cent levy
on the first tranche of income of all those earning more than Pounds 52 a
week.
It is also understood that Mr Smith is reconsidering his plan to apply a 9
per cent National Insurance Contribution levy on unearned income above
Pounds 3,000 to allow a more generous tax-free threshold.
But Labour has abandoned a proposal to phase in the removal of the ceiling
above which taxpayers stop paying NICs, currently about Pounds 21,000 of
taxable income - the ceiling would be removed in Labour's first Budget.
A Labour party official said the 'unprecedented' plan was an
election-winning Budget that would kill the claim that Labour was the party
of high taxation. 'The average family is going to be better off than they
are under what Lamont offered last week,' he said.
Yesterday, Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, insisted: 'No Labour party
that I ever lead will disadvantage people who are on medium or on lower
incomes.'
But his claims in a TV-am interview that Britain would have been better off
had Labour won the 1983 election provoked derision from Tory cabinet
ministers.
'You simply cannot trust him when he says he really has abandoned all the
cranky notions that Labour argued so passionately for in their 1983
programme,' Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, said.
Tory campaigners were taking heart from the warm reception given to Mr Major
at a weekend party rally in Torquay. Addressing a Conservative central
council meeting, he ruled out devolution for Scotland and dismissed the
Liberal Democrats' insistence on electoral reform.
Gloomy economic news is expected this week as a string of monthly indicators
is released in the first full week of the election campaign. Markets await
grim week, Page 20

FT  16 MAR 92 / Pressure grows for North American free trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of the US, Canada and Mexico are due to hold a three-way
telephone conference today in an attempt to clear some of the remaining
obstacles to a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The conversation between President George Bush of the US, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister of
Canada, comes amid mounting pressure for a political decision to conclude a
deal.
The Nafta talks themselves appear to be close to a breakthrough, according
to Washington trade specialists, although differences remain over energy,
agriculture and cars among other things. Corporate advisers to the
negotiators have been told that something 'could break soon'.
Negotiators fear progress towards an agreement could be complicated by
political considerations, if candidates opposing Nafta make a strong showing
in primary elections in the industrial states of Michigan and Illinois
tomorrow. Mr Bush's rightwing challenger in the Republican ballot, Mr
Patrick Buchanan, has espoused protectionism as a central issue in his
campaign.
In Michigan, car workers and other unionised labour are fiercely hostile to
Nafta, which they believe would result in the transfer of US manufacturing
jobs to lower wage Mexican factories. The two frontrunners for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, are broadly in favour of the
Nafta talks. Their challenger, former Governor Jerry Brown of California,
has adopted the issue in his quest for working class votes.
Mr Brown has attacked the 'fast-track' authority by which Congress allowed
the administration to negotiate a Nafta deal which it could not then amend.
Mr Bush defended the Nafta talks in a campaign trip to Michigan. 'I do not
accept the wisdom of some that says that a free trade agreement is going to
result simply in an export of jobs. It is not going to do that, and I
believe that we ought to keep pressing for it. I don't care what the
politics of it are,' he said in a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit.
Some of the president's campaign advisers are less certain about the wisdom
of pressing ahead with Nafta. Some officials believe that it would be
dangerous to conclude either Nafta or a Gatt multilateral trade agreement,
either of which would face opposition in Congress and might be difficult to
ratify this year.
The Nafta issue is a two-edged sword. The prospect of free trade with Mexico
is welcomed in south-western states such as Texas, but generally unpopular
in old industrial states such as Michigan.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (12): Beware the artful dodgers - Michael
Holman's guide to Nigerian confidence tricks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOK OUT for Nigerian conmen: they are of 'world class quality,' warns a
western diplomat in Lagos, alarmed by scams which have raked in millions of
pounds from victims in Europe, north America and elsewhere.
He might have added:'. . . and they've found some world-class suckers.'
Anyone taken in by the offer of a 25 per cent cut if they would allow
Dollars 10m or more to be transferred from Nigeria via their bank account -
a common scam - would seem to be as gullible as they are greedy. Yet one man
lost nearly Dollars 500,000 this way, convinced by his Nigerian partner that
just one more bribe would release the funds.
The government is trying to crack down on what, in Nigeria, is known as
'419', the section in the criminal code which deals with obtaining money by
deception. At the same time, Nigeria's trading partners, and the four
inspection agencies which monitor on behalf of the government the price and
quality of imports, are stressing the importance of following the procedure
for exports to Nigeria to the letter.
Be on the look-out for the following confidence tricks:
THE VISA SCAM
Most business inquiries from Nigeria are bona fide. Some are bogus - an
attempt to get a visa under false pretences, by persuading the overseas
company to send a letter of invitation to support the visa application.
Advice: the commercial sections of the main embassies in Lagos will help
check the local firm's credentials.
AIRPORT SCAM
The conman copies the name of a passenger from the board held up in the
arrivals hall by the company driver meeting the flight. A fake driver, board
aloft, greets the passenger inside the customs hall, and offers help with
customs and immigration formalities. The visitor surrenders passport and
traveller's cheques, and the driver disappears.
COMMERCIAL SAMPLES
After establishing credibility through a succession of inquiries, the conman
asks for samples, either free or paid-for, when the main consignment
arrives. Advice: ship samples only after receipt of payment; and point out
that the price and quality of orders are checked by the independent
inspection agencies.
EXPORT-IMPORT SCAM
An exporter is persuaded to send goods to Nigeria before payment.
Alternatively, an importer agrees to pre-shipment payment, but asks the
exporter to pay a special 'import tax' imposed by government. There are no
such taxes. Advice: ship only under irrevocable letters of credit, confirmed
by a bank known to the exporter.
FINANCIAL DOCUMENT SCAM
A firm or individual receives a letter seeking help in transferring funds
from Nigeria, in return for 20 per cent or more of the amount involved. The
letter explains that the funds, Dollars 10m or more, are in a special
account designated by an earlier regime. The account has been overlooked in
the confusion surrounding the coup that brought the present government to
power. The letter sometimes suggests that some of the 'discovered' money
will be spent on the firm's products. It usually asks for blank headed
letter paper, and the company's address stamp on blank pro forma invoices
from the Nigerian company, all signed; and the company's bank account.
Advice: tear it up.
THE STING
There are two variants. One is based on a supposedly legitimate business
deal; the other proposes defrauding the Nigerian government.
It may involve an oil lease, or a share in oil shipment, often backed by
convincing documentation. The victim is persuaded to pay phoney fees or
taxes before the deal can be completed.
In both cases, the con may establish his credibility by flying to Europe or
the US to meet the victim or 'mark', or paying for a ticket to Lagos.
Once the victim is in Lagos, the trap starts to close, but the same becomes
more plausible. The con arranges VIP treatment at the airport, puts him up
at a hotel, and arranges meetings with fake or real officials, sometimes in
the ministry supposedly involved.
'Now the con closes the trap,' explains a western embassy official who
spends much of his time dealing with fraud. 'A problem will arise with the
inside man who wants an upfront bribe for his risk, or an unforeseen
government fee or tax is needed, or something else happens that requires the
payment of a large amount of money or the deal will fall through.'
The con usually claims that he can pay most, but not all, of the money
needed. 'The mark sees this deal of a lifetime slipping through his fingers
and pays up . . . the sting has succeeded.'
Until recently, the conmen relied on their guile. This is changing, warn
embassy officials, and there are an increasing number of cases involving
physical intimidation.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (10): Unfinished business - Privatisation
has slipped behind the timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY SUGGESTION that Nigeria's ambitious privatisation programme is stalled
is hotly denied by the national privatisation agency, the Technical
Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC). Its spokesman says
firmly: 'We are on track to finish the programme by the end of the year.'
But there is no getting away from the fact that the programme has slipped
way behind its original timetable and should have been completed by now.
Nigerian Airways, for instance, should have been sold by mid-1991 but
officials now say it will definitely have gone by the third quarter of 1992.
To date, 78 enterprises have been privatised  - compared with 71 a year ago
 -and N1.6bn raised from the sale of state-owned enterprises. The target is
to sell off another 30 before the end of 1992 which, if all goes to plan,
will push privatisation proceeds over N3bn.
The real test is yet to come in three respects; first, with the 'easy'
sell-offs behind it, the TCPC now has to tackle the heavies such as Nigerian
Airways, the federal government's stake in six vehicle assembly plants, the
Nigerian National Shipping Line, the National Paper Manufacturing Co and the
three steel rolling mills.
In an effort to speed up the process and improve the prospects of selling
off large, often highly unprofitable enterprises, the TCPC has changed its
strategy. Three of the most recent sell-offs, including the Dollars 50m sale
of the Lagos Federal Palace Hotel, have been on a deferred public issue
basis. This technique is being used where a parastatal has a strong asset
base but poor operational results that preclude it being offered to the
public through the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The TCPC identifies 'core group'
investors to whom it sells the equity on the understanding that a
substantial shareholding will be offered to the investing public within a
stipulated period.
In the case of the Federal Palace Hotel complex in Lagos, five interested
buyers, including Daewoo of South Korea submitted bids, but the hotel went
to the Nigerian-owned Ikeja Hotels which agreed to pay Dollars 26m before
the end of March 1992 with the balance, plus interest at 1 per cent above
the minimum lending rate, payable over five years. The buyer has agreed to
sell 40 per cent of the equity in the Federal Palace within five years by
way of a public offer to Nigerian investors.
A similar technique was used in the sale of the 60 per cent government-owned
Nigerian Engineering Construction Co (NECCO), though in this instance the
National Provident Fund, which is about to embark on a large home-building
programme with an initial investment of N100m at the new capital, Abuja,
bought the government's stake for N25.9m. Within five years, it is to offer
20 per cent of the shares to local investors.
The second looming challenge is that of commercialisation where very little
visible progress has been made. A year ago, the TCPC said it expected to
sign management contracts with 30 state enterprises during the first quarter
of 1991. The target date for the signings is now March-April 1992. A TCPC
spokesman says: 'We are fine-tuning various reform packages and five-year
corporate plans' for a broad range of public utilities, including the
Nigerian Railway Corporation, the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA),
the NNPC and the telecommunications authority, NITEL.
Telecommunications are to be deregulated to allow private sector companies
to compete with the state-owned NITEL, NEPA's electricity distribution
activities are to be privatised and the Nigerian Mining Corporation has been
instructed to stick to its knitting and sell off non-core activities, such
as brickmaking and ceramics.
NITEL is expected to retain control of telecommunications switching and
transmission equipment along with the existing infrastructure, but specific
business services, (such as cellular phones, satellite-paging networks,
digital overlay networks) will be opened up for private sector
participation.
Another possibility is that of allowing equipment suppliers to take some of
the equity in telecommunication activities in those regions where the
supplier's equipment is dominant. This would open the door to equity
participation by international groups such as Siemens, ITT and Marubeni,
though just how keen they are to take an equity stake is unclear. There are
several other parastatals where there is scope for core group investor
participation by either foreign or domestic investors, including Nigeria
Airways, the Nigerian National Shipping Lines and the Nigerian Railway
Corporation.
The TCPC, which is to disband at the end of the year, has recommended the
creation of a successor body in the form of an Enterprises Monitoring
Bureau. This would operate as an independent regulatory authority monitoring
the performance of those parastatals which the state will continue to own.
The third challenge arises from the uncertainties surrounding the return to
civilian rule at the end of the year. Given past slippage, it seems almost
certain that a number of significant privatisations will be left to the next
administration to handle. But if the TCPC does disband, there can be no
guarantee that the incoming government will complete the programme.
However the civilians play their cards, it will be some years before a
realistic assessment can be made of the contribution of public sector
restructuring to enhanced economic efficiency. Nearly six years into SAP,
the public sector continues to be a drag on development.
The TCPC's initial success in selling the government's minority holdings in
commercial and industrial businesses managed by joint-venture partners was
the easy part of the exercise. The hard part will be finding core group
buyers for the likes of Nigerian Airways, the steel mills and vehicle
assembly plants.
Similarly in commercialisation, signing management contracts is the easy
part - getting them to stick will be another matter altogether, especially
with a civilian administration tempted to treat parastatals as a vehicle for
political patronage.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (11): Welcome boost for private enterprise
 -Ecobank sponsors venture capital fund targeted at medium-size business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTERING private enterprise is one area of African economic endeavour where
there has long been more talk than action.
That is why plans to set up a west African venture capital fund targeted at
medium-size business have been welcomed by entrepreneurs and governments.
The proposal is the more welcome because it is unashamedly profit-motivated,
and envisages a close link between equity investment and managerial advice
and assistance provided by an independent management company.
The fund, Ecoventures, sponsored by Ecobank, which operates in five West
African countries, plans to invest in, manage and then divest high-growth,
medium-scale indigenous businesses.
Later this year, the sponsors hope to raise Dollars 20m, the bulk of it from
institutions and high net-worth individuals in the five target countries -
Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo. The target is to raise
Dollars 5m from donors or investment companies such as the Commonwealth
Development Corporation, Dollars 10m from African institutional investors
(pension funds, insurance companies and multinationals) and the remainder
from rich people.
Regional diversity is important, with the sponsors anxious to avoid
accusations of Nigerian domination from neighbouring states which are
hypersensitive on this issue.
Ecoventures will invest in a range of high-growth - and high-risk -
activities with assets of up to Dollars 1m. The trick is to catch a business
near the start of its growth curve and achieve above-average returns. Such
projects are easier to find than is often suggested: some successful African
businesses show internal rates of return of 50 to 120 per cent - adequate to
compensate for the likely combination of high inflation and currency
depreciation.
The key to such funds is the exit process. Ecoventures sees two main exit
routes - the sale of its equity through the stock market or to individual
shareholders in the fund who may wish to retain their shares in a thriving
business.
It envisages a 12-year closed fund with a three-tranche subscription
timetable in years one, three and five. The management services element will
be provided by a small group of young, aggressive entrepreneurial
professionals whose task will be to ensure that if management of the
companies in which the fund takes a minority stake does not measure up, it
is strengthened or replaced.
The project makes sense all round - capital gains for the investors,
improved management skills and profits for the target firms, greater tax
revenue, more jobs and increased exports for the government.
A second venture capital project - Risk Fund - is being sponsored by the
government-controlled Raw Materials Research and Development Council. It
hopes to raise Dollars 30m, mainly from the private sector (60 per cent) to
fund high-risk, high-return industrial projects.
Already, several banks have promised to join the scheme, along with a clutch
of prominent global companies - Mobil, Glaxo, Unilever, Volkswagen, Nestle,
Guinness, Cadbury and Dunlop. The promoters hope to attract support from
foreign institutional investors, including agencies such as the
International Finance Corporation.
Unlike Ecoventures, the Risk Fund will be targeted solely at Nigeria. The
government supports the scheme and has promised to promulgate a Venture
Capital Decree soon which will sweep away many of the obstacles currently
clogging capital market wheels, including one that bans insurance companies
from participating.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (9): True picture distorted / Assessing
business profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH REAL gross domestic product has increased by a third in the past
four years, Lagos businessmen say that trading volumes have fallen in many
activities, especially consumer goods.
It has become progressively harder to make profits in the domestic market,
other than by efficiency gains, cost-cutting and poaching market share.
In the consumer-goods sector, large companies report a fall in volumes at
the top end of the market, but a compensating increase for lower-priced
items. Consumers are 'downtrading', switching from detergents to laundry
soaps, and from larger to smaller (and cheaper) packages.
There is evidence, too, of slackening demand from the packaging industry.
Official statistics suggest that, since 1988, private consumer spending has
barely kept pace with inflation. Many shoppers have moved downmarket, too,
to lower-priced items or into the informal sector.
Nevertheless, the pre-tax earnings of publicly-quoted companies have powered
ahead, rising 27 per cent last year, after a 29 per cent rise in 1990 and
more than 60 per cent in 1989.
When deflated by the composite consumer price index, real turnovers have
risen 37 per cent over the past seven years, while pre-tax earnings have
increased by almost 65 per cent.
In fact, a retail price index - especially one heavily weighted with
downmarket basic necessities - is no way to measure real business
performance. A better yardstick is failure of naira earnings to keep pace
with currency depreciation.
In 1984, N1m of profits translated into Dollars 1.3m; but, by the end of
1991, the same naira earnings were worth little more than Dollars 100,000.
In other words, while the pre-tax profit index rose almost fivefold to 494
by 1991, when converted into US dollars, the index actually halved over the
period.
Both turnover expansion and profit growth slowed during 1991, reflecting the
fall in inflation in 1990-91 and tougher business conditions. Turnover was
up 32 per cent last year, down from 37 per cent in 1990 but still well ahead
of the trend rate for the past seven years of 22 per cent. Profit growth
slowed slightly, from 28.7 to 26.7 per cent, but this, too, stayed just
ahead of the trend growth rate of 25.6 per cent. Margins (pre-tax earnings
as a percentage of turnover) narrowed to 11.9 per cent during 1991, dipping
below the eight-year average of 12.5 per cent.
For most large businesses, access to foreign currency remains the key to
profitability. Over the past year, profits have been squeezed by the
combination of consumer resistance on the one hand and rising costs of
imported inputs on the other.
Although, the official rate for the naira depreciated only modestly during
1991 - from 12.4 US cents to 10.6, a fall of about 15 per cent - the real
cost of foreign exchange rose sharply. This was because companies were
unable to get much more than 10 to 20 per cent of their foreign currency
requirements from the official (first tier) market. Instead, they had to buy
their foreign exchange at various different premia from literally dozens of
banks. The naira float will change that but only at the expense of higher
inflation.
One of Nigeria's largest companies says it maintains accounts at more than
half the country's 120 banks. Until devaluation early this month, the true
cost of funds was somewhere between the previous official rate of N10.5 to
the dollar and the competitive rate, quoted by the banks for earnings from
non-oil exports and other inflows, of N18 to N20. Assuming an 80-20 split
between free market and official markets, companies were paying in the
region of N16 to the dollar.
The widening gap between the two markets in the first ten weeks of 1992 and
subsequent devaluation will mean sharply higher inflation in this heavily
import-dependent economy.
Between them, last year's rapid monetary growth and devaluation spell rapid
inflation in a market where import cost-plus pricing is the norm. Business
economists believe inflation is already running at 30 per cent  - double
last year's officially-estimated 15 per cent - and predict gloomily that it
will reach 50 per cent this year, unless the authorities tighten credit and
rein in the free-market exchange rate soon.
But when - rather than if - that happens, the official rate will have to be
allowed to find a more 'competitive' level, perhaps around N14 to the
dollar.
All this is playing havoc with business costs. One big importer says it
takes six to eight months to convert foreign exchange into delivered
imports. He estimates his working capital requirement at 30 per cent of
turnover, compared with 12 per cent in European markets. This is going to
mean tighter margins and slower profit growth during 1992, though inflation
will continue to make corporate results look better than they really are.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (8): Drive for local sourcing - Nigerian
investors are steering clear of manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIAN businessmen, complains a senior government official, 'are not yet
ready to invest in manufacturing - they prefer fast-moving, high-return
activities.'
This is hardly surprising. The incentive system has long favoured trade over
industry, and imported components for assembly rather than local sourcing.
Structural adjustment and naira devaluation were meant to change all that,
but progress has been disappointing. In a recent report, the Manufacturers
Association of Nigeria (MAN) notes gloomily that the extent of local
sourcing still falls 'far short of expectations'. In the first half of 1991,
MAN estimates, 47 per cent of raw materials were sourced within Nigeria -
primarily non-metallic minerals such as cement, food, textiles and wood.
These four sectors had local sourcing ratios in excess of 70 per cent, while
the remaining six averaged 33 per cent.
This year, the search for backward integration is being stepped up by the
Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC), launched by the
government in 1987. It is setting up five small model plants to process
cocoa, kaolin, talc, phosphate rock and soda ash. The council says it is
following Japan in establishing 'catalytic' plants, designed to demonstrate
that the use of local raw materials is both feasible and profitable.
The plants, financed by the council at a cost of Dollars 5.5m (the RMRDC
draws its financing from a 1 per cent government levy on imports) will come
on stream in the latter half of the year. Once markets are established and
the projects are seen to be working, the council will sell them to private
investors. Already, a large Nigerian investor, the Leventis group, has shown
interest in the soda ash plant, which is a potential source of supply for
its Coca-Cola bottling operations.
The catalytic plant project is one of three council initiatives designed to
boost local processing and exports. It has also set up 26 investor groups,
to investigate a broad range of projects utilising local materials.
The RMRDC funds the feasibility studies, providing details to investors who
sign a letter of intent to proceed with the scheme. The third prong is an
export drive for non-traditional products such as gum arabic and ginger, in
which Nigeria has a competitive advantage. The council plans to launch a
marketing drive in the UK later in the year.
There is more to local sourcing than economic nationalism. In metals, one
industrialist says it is simply not profitable to operate with an import
component that far exceeds 50 per cent of the final retail price. In foods
and in beer, the switch from imported to local cereals has worked to the
advantage of the multinationals such as Nestle, Cadbury Nigeria and
Guinness. The combination of the active search for local inputs, promoted by
the RMRDC, and further steep depreciation of the naira will enhance the
viability of backward integration on the one hand and non-traditional
exports on the other.
Lever Brothers is one of the most active multinationals in the field of
local sourcing, tackling the problem on several fronts. It has invested
N150m (Dollars 14.8m) in a 90-hectare tea plantation on the Mambilla plateau
in the north-east, and has plans to expand the project to cover 500ha.
Although it was keen to buy one of the privatised palm plantations, this was
not possible, and so a trade investment strategy has been used.
The country's largest user of palm oil, Lever has a 20 per cent stake in one
of the plantations and has put some of its management into the scheme, with
the result that output has doubled in the last 18 months.
Another strategy is to provide technical assistance to small and
medium-sized businesses producing essential inputs such as chemicals or
packaging materials, in return for buy-back agreements under which Lever
purchases its input requirements locally rather than relying on imports. A
member of the board is responsible for searching out local sourcing
prospects and developing backward integration opportunities, especially in
agriculture.
Devaluation has certainly boosted industrial exports, which rose from
Dollars 8m in 1985, before the naira was floated, to more than Dollars 80m
last year. But exactly how much is being exported is not known, with
estimates ranging from 10 per cent to as much as 30 per cent of total
turnover in an industry such as textiles. Industrialists say that the
renewed weakness of the naira has boosted unrecorded exports, especially
into neighbouring CFA franc zone countries where Nigerian goods are highly
competitive.
There is substantial unrecorded two-way cross-border trade in manufactures,
with smuggled imports undercutting local manufactures and legal imports.
'Unofficial' exports are, in fact, directly competitive with legal exports
of Nigerian manufactures. 'We are undersold by our own products smuggled
into neighbouring markets,' says one manufacturer.
But there is little doubt that manufacturing industry has underperformed in
recent years. Its share of gross domestic product fell from a high of 11 per
cent in 1981-82 to an estimated 8.3 per cent last year. Manufacturing
value-added (MVA), at constant prices, declined almost 30 per cent between
1982 and 1986. It has since recovered almost all the lost ground, but the
fact is that real industrial output last year was no higher than 10 years
ago.
While official figures suggest that capacity utilisation is no more than 30
per cent of installed capacity, industrialists emphasise that the effective
capacity has declined substantially in recent years. Actual capacity
utilisation figures are believed to be closer to 70 per cent in most
activities, according to one industrialist, though there are sectors, such
as vehicle assembly, where utilisation is 20 per cent.
Official estimates by the Central Bank of Nigeria put cumulative foreign
private investment in manufacturing between 1970 and 1988 at N3.6bn, or one
third of the total.
Nigerian manufacturing desperately needs injections of foreign capital and
technology if it is to break out of its existing straitjacket of
import-dependence. But with new investors required to submit more than 180
pieces of paper and deal with umpteen different government agencies in
Abuja, Lagos and the state where the investment is located, manufacturing is
unlikely to attract many new entrants.
Asian businessmen, especially from India, are showing more interest than
their EC or US counterparts, though in recent years three multinationals
have taken the plunge. They are: Coca-Cola; General Motors (a 30 per cent
stake in a joint venture with UAC, a Unilever associate, to assemble
commercial vehicles); and, still in the pipeline, Rothmans. Other
multinationals reportedly taking a fresh look at Nigeria include Procter and
Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, though they, and others, are likely to await
the outcome of the political transition before committing themselves.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (6): Tighter monetary and fiscal stance
needed - IMF negotiations will be important for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ECONOMIC performance this year will
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as always - depend primarily on oil prices, though the outcome of the
current IMF negotiations will also have far-reaching implications. Nigeria's
1990 International Monetary Fund standby agreement in effect lapsed last
year when domestic credit ceilings were overshot.
Since Nigeria does not draw on its fund facility, the main importance of the
current talks to secure a new standby is access to Paris Club debt relief.
Without the IMF imprimatur, not only will there be no debt relief but
funding big forthcoming projects, such as the Dollars 4bn needed for the
liquefied natural gas scheme, will be well-nigh impossible.
The fund programme fell apart because domestic credit rose 42 per cent last
year to N75bn, compared with an IMF-agreed target ceiling of some N52bn.
That was the result of a 26 per cent increase in private sector credit and
almost 70 per cent in government borrowing. An immediate consequence was a
widening of the gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel
market from 25 per cent in early 1991 to more than 90 per cent by February
this year.
By floating the naira and abandoning the artificial rate of N10.5 to the
dollar, the Nigerians have taken a decisive step towards a new Fund
agreement. At the first 'free' auction, the rate plunged to N18, though
bankers speculate that as and when liquidity is squeezed, there will be some
recovery possibly to N15 or N16 to the dollar.
But the IMF is going to want a good deal more, insisting that without public
spending cutbacks and a tight money policy, excess demand for foreign
exchange will continue to undermine the exchange rate. Last week, a new
tranche of stabilisation securities was issued taking an estimated N4
billion out of the system and with the first post-float auction draining at
least N10 billion from the banks, money market liquidity has tightened
considerably.
But the Nigerians, deeply concerned at the political implications of new
stagflationary measures - naira devaluation and increased petrol prices, if
the domestic petrol subsidy is phased out as demanded by the IMF, will mean
higher inflation later this year - have precious little room for manoeuvre.
They hope the IMF will take a lenient view, but its bottom line will still
be a far tighter fiscal and monetary stance than at present, in addition to
exchange rate liberalisation. All of which means that if a debt crisis is to
be averted, economic growth must slow, - even further than the oil
price-induced recessiuon - and interest rates rise as liquidity is squeezed
.
With such a scenario, growth would fall from 4.3 per cent last year and more
than 8 per cent in 1990, to no more than 1 to 2 per cent in 1992. Lower oil
prices are already having an impact on economic activity while
industrialists complain that capacity utilisation is falling once again, and
profits are being squeezed by higher import prices and interest rates.
Inflation, which reached 20 per cent at the end of 1991, averaging 15 per
cent over the year, is set to move well above 30 per cent in the first half
of 1992 as last year's monetary excesses and naira depreciation take their
toll of retail prices.
Even with an IMF package, inflation is likely to double to around 30 per
cent this year. Without one, it will be substantially higher - at least 40
per cent.
The balance of payments outlook hinges on oil and debt; the 1992 foreign
exchange budget projects total earnings of Dollars 8.9bn, of which Dollars
7.4bn would be oil revenue. This looks to be unduly low since, with a price
of Dollars 18 and exports of 1.43m barrels a day, revenues would come close
to Dollars 9.4bn.
The budget allocates Dollars 2.3bn for external debt-service (30 per cent of
'official' export earnings of Dollars 7.4bn), but since this is well below
the Dollars 5.8bn in scheduled obligations, the assumption must be either
than the authorities expect to conclude a debt-rescheduling agreement by the
end of 1992 or that oil earnings will be substantially higher than forecast.
In 1992, the provision of only Dollars 4.25bn to fund non-oil imports - less
than last year's Dollars 4.5bn - will constrain investment and output
growth, while maintaining upward pressure on prices. Given the binding
nature of the import and debt-service constraints, the only option open to
the authorities for stabilising prices and the exchange rate is demand
management. But after four years in which real private consumer spending has
been growing at less than 1 per cent while population increases at 3 per
cent a year, it is hardly surprising that the government should be so
reluctant to tighten its policy stance when output is already flagging.
If the authorities are serious about letting the naira find its own level,
there is now no alternative to decisive action on both the monetary and
fiscal fronts, but especially the former. .
If this is done, then an IMF agreement, and probably also Paris Club debt
relief, are within the government's grasp. But time is not on the
government's side, and if there is to be a debt agreement this year, the
Nigerians must settle their differences with the IMF by July at the latest.

TEN YEARS ago, a Nigerian import permit was a licence to print money. In the
early 1990s, industrialists say sourly, banking licences have assumed that
role, primarily because a five-tier foreign currency market provides endless
opportunities for profitable arbitrage.
Bank licences, issued so freely in 1989 (16) and 1990 (25), were cut off
last year, though not until another 14 banks had been approved, taking the
total to 120. Although the central bank (CBN) opposes the issue of new
licences, so intense is the political pressure from vested interests that a
further round of licence approvals is expected soon.
UntiI this month, the newer banks continued to thrive against a background
of rapid credit expansion and the wholly-artificial foreign exchange auction
system in which all are winners.
Before the naira was floated in the first week of March, all 120 banks
quoted the same buying rate. The Dollars 60m available weekly was allocated
among them on a pre-determined basis, which entitled the big three clearers
 -First Bank of Nigeria, United Bank for Africa and Union Bank of Nigeria -
to Dollars 2.5m each. A second tier of half a dozen banks got Dollars 1.1m
each, while at the other end of the spectrum, about 60 of the newer, small
banks were each allocated Dollars 242,000.
This combination of guaranteed access to foreign currency, a generous spread
between deposit and lending rates - estimated at six percentage points last
year, down from 7.3 points in 1990 - and easy access to funds, reflected in
rapid money supply growth, enabled many banks to report improved earnings
last year. But for some - notably the largest banks - the imposition of
prudential guidelines translated into a steep decline in profits.
Last year, Union Bank's assets rose more than 40 per cent to N13.2bn
(Dollars 1.3bn), but its profits collapsed to N14.4m from N127m in 1990
while at UBA profits fell almost N100m to N16.7m. Although UBA more than
doubled net earnings to N407m from N186m in 1990, the guidelines meant bad
debt provisions of N390m compared with only N69m the previous year.
Most of the older banks were forced to make similar, if less dramatic,
provisions. The blame for these should not be laid at the door of the
bankers. The fact is that the mature banks have long been treated as a kind
of political football - their chief executives appointed and removed by
federal and state governments and the quality of their loan portfolios
undermined by politically-dictated lending.
The young banks have the edge in several respects - very little political
intervention, and much smaller, more manageable workforces and loan
portfolios. Furthermore, they have not been in business long enough to get
themselves into the kind of problems that now threaten the viability of some
of the state-owned banks.
Deregulation, which began in 1987, was partially reversed last year when, in
an effort to lower the cost of borrowing, the central bank imposed a cap of
21 per cent on lending rates. It soon backfired; in a system where credit is
controlled by way of lending ceilings on banks (except those with advances
of less than N50m), credit growth overshot the official target of 10.6 per
cent growth by a huge margin, reaching 42 per cent.
While some mainstream banks stuck to the 21 per cent cap, many others did
not, using front-end fees, commissions and other non-interest charges to
lever up their effective return. The authorities ended up the worst of all
worlds, positive real interest rates in excess of 20 per cent in the first
half of 1991 while money supply was out of control, expanding more than 38
per cent.
In January, the CBN abandoned the cap - which it had always said was only
temporary - but is now trying to squeeze the spread between a bank's cost of
funds and its lending rate to 5 per cent. As a result, prime rates have
risen to around 23 per cent for the commercial banks and 27 per cent for
merchant banks.
With the year-on-year inflation rate having climbed sharply from 5 per cent
in the first quarter of 1991 to 20 per cent by the year-end, real deposit
rates are now negative, and the same will soon be true of real lending
rates. The signs are that inflation will accelerate rapidly during 1992,
mainly in response to last year's excessive credit creation and the resumed
slide of the naira.
A year ago, the CBN set targets of 10.6 per cent for credit expansion during
1991; because the budget was meant to be in surplus, there should have been
no public sector borrowing from the banks, while the ceiling for private
sector credit provided for growth of 13.2 per cent growth. In the event,
government borrowing surged 69 per cent during 1991 while private sector
credit was up 26 per cent.
In an effort to curb inflation and stabilise the exchange rate, the CBN says
it will tighten monetary policy in 1992. The private sector credit growth
target has been raised to 16 per cent 'to provide an appropriate stimulus to
the economy'.
With the public sector borrowing ceiling raised 7.7 per cent, aggregate
credit growth is projected at 12.5 per cent - up two percentage points on
last year's target, but well below the 42 per cent actually experienced. But
credit creation is not going to slow down unless public expenditure - and
inflation - are brought under control. Private sector borrowing is rising
sharply as working capital requirements increase with inflation and
devaluation.
During 1992, the CBN is committed to shift increasingly from direct controls
to market-oriented techniques for controlling the supply. The abolition of
the interest rate cap was a first step in this direction, as was the
requirement that banks now hold 20 per cent of their deposit liabilities to
the public in treasury bills and certificates.
Other instruments of indirect monetary control to be used more actively
during 1992 include the 30 per cent liquidity ratio, including treasury
bills, and the 3 per cent cash reserve ratio. The CBN plans to expand its
open-market activities and to that end - much to the disgust of some bankers
 -is calling for the creation of a discount market with up to five discount
houses, operating on the London model.
In spite of their distaste for discount houses - which banks see as an
unnecessary intermediary - some of the top banks are getting together to
establish a discount operation and the CBN hopes that at least three
discount houses, which it sees as essential cogs in the wheel of indirect
monetary management, will be open for business within a few months.
The much-predicted shake-out and rationalisation of the banking system will
not materialise - bankers say - unless and until the foreign currency market
is reformed. If the naira float is even remotely clean, then the new banks
are going to face a far tougher competitive environment. In the past they
relied on guaranteed access to foreign currency both as a source of profit
and a vehicle for attracting deposits. Precisely how the CBN is going to
manage the new system is unclear but it appears that it will sell dollars to
the market - not necessarily on a regular basis - at market-determined
rates. The conventional wisdom is that in the short-term, the naira will
stabilise around N15 or N16 to the dollar, but the medium-term prognosis for
the currency is grim, with substantial further devaluation probable in
1993/4.
Few of the new banks have a deposit base worthy of the name, implying that
with the liberalisation of the foreign currency market they will be have to
rethink their tactics. This will not be easy at a time when tight money will
be the order of the day.
Three developments will sort out the men from the boys over the next couple
of years - a competitive foreign exchange market, monetary restraint and
indirect monetary management. As and when these measures take root, so
banking in Nigeria will become more professionalised and traditional
virtues, such as a large deposit base, will start to count once again.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (5): An urgent need of debt relief - The
balance of payments constraint will tighten this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR's hopes that higher oil prices and a reduced debt-burden would
ease the balance of payments stranglehold on the economy were shortlived.
The re-emergence of the oil glut and the spectre of stalemate with the IMF
over domestic economic policy mean that the balance of payments constraint
will tighten this year.
Oil exports, which more than doubled between 1988 and 1990, fell sharply
last year, when the price of Nigerian crude averaged Dollars 18.8 a barrel,
compared with Dollars 23 in 1990.
A further fall in oil revenues seems inevitable in 1992; the authorities
have, as usual, estimated their oil revenues extremely conservatively, at
between Dollars 7.4bn and Dollars 8.9bn this year. These projections cannot
be reconciled with the budget assumptions of exports of 1.43m barrels a day
and a price of Dollars 21 a barrel, which imply earnings close to Dollars
11bn.
However, these are fragile assumptions, given the near-term outlook for the
world economy and Opec's quota cuts. If exports can be maintained at 1.43m
b/d with a price of Dollars 17, oil exports would be close to the higher of
the two budget assumptions at Dollars 8.9bn.
The break-even price for Nigerian oil - that is, the oil price that would
enable the country to balance its books without recourse to additional
external assistance - is estimated at Dollars 23 a barrel in 1992. Since a
fall of Dollars 1 in the price of a barrel of oil costs Nigeria some Dollars
500m annually, the Dollars 6 a barrel gap between the break-even price and
the widely-forecast 1992 price of Dollars 17 a barrel, points to a huge
financing gap of some Dollars 3bn this year.
Five years ago, the World Bank was projecting non-oil exports well in excess
of Dollars 1bn by the early 1990s. In fact, non-oil earnings of Dollars 425m
last year were well below their 1987-8 average of Dollars 575m, though the
latest Washington forecast projects a surge in non-oil exports, from Dollars
650m in 1995 to Dollars 2bn by the turn of the century, reflecting the
impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. In fact, non-oil exports are
substantially higher than the official figure, because an unknown - but
large - volume of cross-border trade is unrecorded.
Given the lacklustre performance of non-oil exports and the undesirability -
if not the impossibility - of further import compression, the Nigerians who,
just a year ago, believed they had slain the debt dragon, are now pleading
for Trinidad terms for additional debt relief.
Two significant debt-rescheduling agreements were reached last year - one
with the Paris Club of official creditors, and a debt-service reduction
agreement with the London Club of commercial banking creditors. This covered
some Dollars 5.8bn, or 17 per cent, of outstanding debt in 1990; and when
the agreement was activated in January, Nigeria's foreign debt was reduced
by Dollars 2bn.
Some 65 per cent of the holders of the bank debt opted to redeem their debt
at a discount price of 40 cents in the dollar, while the bulk of the
remainder was exchanged for collateralised 'par bonds', carrying interest at
5.5 per cent for the first three years and 6.25 per cent for the remaining
27 years of the 30-year maturity period.
In effect, this means that Nigeria has repurchased commercial bank debt with
a face value of Dollars 3.3bn for approximately Dollars 1.32bn - a 60 per
cent discount.
Accurate figures for Nigeria's foreign debt are hard to find. The central
bank estimated that the country's public (and public-guaranteed) external
debt at Dollars 33.4bn in October 1991. With the buy-back of London Club
paper, the debt stock is forecast to fall sharply this year to Dollars 29bn.
In spite of this, the debt-service situation is set to deteriorate, with
scheduled obligations this year of some Dollars 5.8bn and exports of no more
than Dollars 9.5bn - a ratio of approximately 60 per cent.
Clearly, this is not sustainable, which is why Nigeria desperately needs a
Trinidad-terms debt rescheduling agreement. But this is a non-starter
without a new IMF agreement, which looks remote at this juncture. Certainly,
there was little in the 1992 budget to encourage the hard-nosed men from
Washington to believe that Lagos is ready to bite the bullet on the core
issues of the exchange rate, the budget deficit and the domestic petrol
subsidy.
One source of partial relief has been the substantial inflow of foreign
direct investment, which has averaged Dollars 800m annually over the last
five years. Virtually all of this is targeted on the energy sector, but it
has played its part in offsetting at least some of the onerous burden of
loan repayment outflows, which averaged Dollars 1.6bn a year over the same
period.
As a result, the world's 13th poorest country has been a net capital
exporter to the tune of Dollars 4bn a year since the structural adjustment
programme was launched in 1986, underscoring yet again the urgent need for
debt relief.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (4): Spending peg untenable - Ministers
pleading for debt relief are told to clean up the budget act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN NIGERIAN ministers argue their case for debt relief and access to
concessional funds, they are bluntly told that until they clean up their
budget act, they cannot expect a sympathetic hearing. Nigeria's opaque,
convoluted and inefficient fiscal system runs counter to the new-found donor
criteria of accountability and transparency. Funds are fungible, and donors
want to know where and how their aid - or debt relief - is being used. The
1992 budget is not exempt from this criticism. In his presentation,
President Ibrahim Babangida forecast foreign currency revenues of Dollars
8.9bn; but budget and planning minister Chu Okongwu predicts earnings of
Dollars 10.4bn. Keeping track of revenue and expenditure is almost
impossible. The 1992 budget estimates last year's deficit at N19.5bn
(Dollars 1.9bn), but within weeks of this figure being released the Central
Bank of Nigeria published its estimate showing a N33bn shortfall. This 70
per cent discrepancy between two estimates, prepared within weeks of one
another, merely compounds donor frustration. A year ago, the government
tabled a balanced budget with expenditure of N38.6bn funded by expected
revenues of N38.8bn. The reality was very different. Spending was 76 per
cent above target at N68bn, while revenue fell almost 10 per cent below
budget, resulting in a deficit of N32.9bn. Apart from the N3.7bn revenue
shortfall, the deficit was largely the result of substantially
higher-than-forecast debt-service payments. External debt-service was
N18.7bn above budget, accounting for 57 per cent of the deficit. Last year's
budget had assumed debt relief similar to that achieved in earlier
reschedulings, but the actual outcome was less favourable.
While roughly half the oil revenue accrues to the state and local
governments, the federal government remains responsible for their debts.
During 1990-91, it tried to collect debt-service payments from the state
governments, but this is a slow process, given disagreements over the
amounts, exacerbated by the creation of the nine new states. Furthermore, as
economic performance began to slip behind IMF-stipulated targets, so aid
inflows slowed.
The 1991 deficit was partly funded by drawings from the various
stabilisation accounts built up by the government since 1989. These accounts
were designed to sterilise 'windfall' inflows of oil revenues, resulting
from higher-than-budgeted prices and exports.
Because half the stabilisation revenue belongs to the state and local
governments, the federal government has been unable to control their
spending, some of which was incurred in preparation for state and local
government elections.
At the end of last year, these stabilisation balances amounted to some
N32bn, and when the federal government receives its share along with loan
repayments from state governments, the actual deficit is likely to be
approximately N15bn, or 5 per cent of gross domestic product.
This year promises to be far more difficult on the revenue side, though  -
as usual - the ministry of finance bases its revenue projections on an
extremely conservative exchange rate forecast of N9.5 to the dollar.
The 1992 budget assumes oil production of 1.8m barrels a day, and exports of
1.43m b/d, with a selling price of Dollars 21 a barrel.
Opec quota-cuts and depressed oil prices suggest that not only will there be
no windfall this year, but that oil revenue could turn out to be
substantially lower than the projected N79bn.
Much will hinge on the exchange rate; by last week this had fallen to N18 to
the dollar which makes a nonsense of the budget arithmetic. Should the naira
settle at around N15 to the dollar this year, as some bankers expect, then
oil revenues should still stay ahead of budget, even if the price averages
Dollars 17 a barrel. Unfortunately, however, naira depreciation is a
double-edged sword, because it will also mean significantly higher external
debt-service payments.
On these assumptions, the budget remains in surplus provided non-oil revenue
holds up and public spending targets are met. The N8bn in extra revenue is
almost enough to cover a N9bn rise in external debt-service costs.
At the end of the day, neither scenario is likely to apply. There are bound
to be spending overruns, if only because inflation is now increasing
rapidly; and while there will be a beneficial fiscal drag effect on revenue,
the impact on spending will be substantially greater. The budget assumption
that public spending (excluding debt-service) can be pegged at 1991 levels,
at a time when inflation could well average 30 per cent, is clearly
untenable.
Unless the government gets a tighter grip on public spending than in
1990-91, the danger is that the incoming civilian administration will find
itself saddled with a sizeable 1992 deficit.
Almost before it gets its feet under the table, it will be forced either to
cut public spending dramatically - which will be politically impossible - or
to find new sources of revenue.
In his final budget, President Babangida outlined proposals for tax reform,
including the introduction in 1994 of a modified value-added tax; but far
more will be needed, especially on the revenue administration side, to
provide a broader fiscal base, reducing dependence on oil.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (2): A very partial success / Assessing
the Structural Adjustment Programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY WILL rate the Babangida government on its success, or otherwise, in
recasting Nigerian politics while restructuring the economy. Within a year
of seizing power, General Babangida launched the 1986 Structural Adjustment
Programme (SAP), then billed as a two-year exercise. Nearly six years later,
the jury is still out on both the political and economic counts, but there
is disconcerting evidence that when the ledger is finally written up, SAP
will be seen - at best - as no more than a very partial success. This does
not mean that reform cannot be resuscitated, but unless the government is
far bolder in the next nine months than in the past 36, it risks going down
in history with the end-of-term report: 'Should have tried harder'. A harsh
judgment? How else does one explain the absence of a World Bank lending
programme for structural reform, after all the time, energy and money it
invested in the late 1980s? How too does one account for the suspension of
the IMF programme, following the failure to meet public sector borrowing
targets? Above all, it is impossible to explain away ongoing policy
shortcomings - exchange rate management, public sector investment, excessive
dependence on oil revenues for exports and government revenue, the foreign
debt burden and the dismal performance of the public sector as a whole. Were
not all these problems the very ones that SAP was meant to solve? Yet they
remain as much a threat to future economic performance today as they were in
1986. Indeed, the experience under structural adjustment illustrates what
threatens to become the iron law of sub-Saharan economic reform. The
best-framed economic policies falter due to a combination of insufficient
political commitment, inadequate administrative capacity and the shortage of
external resources.
A kinder judgment portrays the glass as a third full, rather than two-thirds
empty, but there can be no escaping the fact that the momentum of early
reform during the 1986-88 period was not maintained.
First in 1988 and then again in 1990-91 public spending lurched out of
control and all sorts of non-market distortions were imposed on the system
to depress bank lending rates and maintain an unsustainable exchange rate
for the naira.
Nigeria's capacity to service its foreign - and domestic - debt while
maintaining politically-acceptable levels of public spending depends
entirely on the world oil market. In early 1992, with oil prices in retreat
and quota cutbacks, an economic crunch is imminent.
The plight of the new civilian governors who inherited debt-stressed state
treasuries and empty bank accounts at a time of crumbling infrastructure
highlights the federal government's limited room for manoeuvre.
It is a classic catch-22 dilemma; the government must have a debt relief
agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors if it is to hand over a
remotely clean balance sheet to the civilians in nine months' time, avoid a
debt default and yet another build-up of arrears. To satisfy the IMF, it
must merge the 'official' and 'competitive' market exchange rates, and
substantially reduce the budget deficit - estimated at 11.4 per cent of GDP
last year. It must also take effective steps to slow inflation and
(probably) reduce the domestic petroleum subsidy.
Indeed, the government has already agreed to raise domestic petrol prices to
'export parity' by 1994. But officials warn that the political cost of such
reforms could be widespread domestic unrest in the run-up to elections,
which is in no-one's interest. And even were an IMF deal to be bought for so
heavy a political price, only Britain currently supports debt-relief on
Trinidad-style terms for Nigeria.
Nigerians point to their experience in the last two rounds of debt
negotiations with the Paris and London clubs last year. Not only did they
receive less generous terms from the official creditors in Paris than they
had hoped but only two of some 400 banks that signed the London Club
agreement were prepared to accept the 'new money' option, which was
subsequently allowed to lapse.
Yet Nigeria continues to attract substantial inflows of foreign direct
investment - Dollars 1bn a year in the last three years, and more than the
whole of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa. But offsetting that is
the heavy amortisation burden of Dollars 3.8bn annually, including last
year's net repayment to the World Bank group of some Dollars 300m.
Disappointments aside, the glass is still one third full; quantitative
measures of SAP's performance must be interpreted cautiously, given the
extent to which economic performance is driven by oil market conditions.
Output did grow substantially faster in the post-SAP period than in the
preceding five years but the former was one of sharply declining oil prices
while the latter includes the short-lived Kuwait invasion boom.
Economic growth aside, there are three striking indicators in the table that
cast doubt on the success of SAP. As in so many African SAPs, investment
underperformed, averaging 6 per cent of GDP as against 12 per cent pre-SAP,
while inflation increased. Equally striking is the collapse in imports as a
share in GDP, itself a partial explanation of the poor investment record.
Qualitative yardsticks offer greater encouragement; the key achievements of
SAP include the abolition of import controls, the deregulation of prices and
interest rates, the shift towards indirect techniques of monetary
management, the privatisation of 78 enterprises, the commitment to
commercialise many others and the partial freeing of the exchange rate.
These add up to a very substantial shift in economic policy.
Sadly, there is another side to the coin; Nigeria, ranked as an aspiring
middle-income country at the time of the previous handover to civilian rule
in 1979, is today the world's 13th poorest country with a per capita income
of a mere Dollars 250, down from Dollars 1,000 in 1980. The social picture
is depressing too, with population growth of 3 per cent outstripping food
production, job generation and the provision of education and health
facilities.
The average daily calorie intake of 2,190 falls 7 per cent below the
international standard of 2,350, while infant mortality at 85 per 1,000
exceeds the world low-income average of 70. Sixty per cent of Nigerian
children under the age of five years suffer from protein energy malnutrition
while government spending on health and poverty alleviation has fallen under
SAP.
Yet it is hardly fair to blame SAP; the fact is that resource allocation
decisions in Nigeria reflect the control exerted by vested interests. The
'toys for the boys' syndrome means shiny new tanks for the military and 300
smart new Peugeot sedans for officers rather than better-equipped schools
and universities.
Roads and power infrastructure deteriorate while public funds are earmarked
for grandiose projects such as Ajaokuta steel and the proposed aluminium
smelter; petrol sells domestically at the absurd price of US4c a litre;
there is massive evasion of customs duties and no serious attempt has been
made to broaden the fiscal base so that essential public spending can be met
from taxes rather than the central bank's printing press.
The upshot has been pain without much gain. It is now too late for the
government to do much to alleviate the pain, but it can - and should -
finish as it started. In the past fortnight, after nearly two years of
policy drift, there are signs of a new determination to complete the job it
started six years ago. The decision to abandon the artificial foreign
currency auction system and float the naira was a crucial first step towards
an IMF deal. On its own, this will not be enough.
The government must raise domestic oil prices to help finance what threatens
to be an unsustainable budget deficit this year, cut public spending, clamp
down on smugglers and corruption at the ports, and impose more monetary
restraint, without which the exchange rate will continue to slide. Such a
package ought to satisfy the IMF, thereby opening the door to a Paris Club
debt relief deal.
The timetable is tight and the challenges formidable. The military has no
more than nine months in which to negotiate a new IMF agreement, secure a
debt-relief deal from the Paris Club, stabilise the naira and prevent
inflation from soaring above 40 per cent. But there is no viable alternative
to a virtuous end-game strategy. The present lame-duck policy of drift -
interrupted, if not abandoned, this month when the naira was floated -
carried no credibility at all, least of all in the markets where the gap
between the official and competitive exchange rates had widened to more than
90 per cent before the military accepted the inevitability of substantial
devaluation.
The government has no electorate to face, and nothing to lose by reverting
to the policies that were beginning to work in 1986-87 and again in 1990.
After all his efforts to recast the political system, President Babangida
has no wish to be remembered as the man who bequeathed a poisoned economy
chalice to his successors. Floating the naira gives him the chance to go out
as he came in, though only if the other shoe, in the form of spending cuts
and credit restraint, is allowed to drop.

FT  16 MAR 92 / New world disorder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with the collapse of communism is that it faces us with the one
question we never thought we would have to answer: what do we do now? The
familiar and predictable confrontation between east and west simply vanished
a couple of years ago; but the policy planners are still thrashing around in
search of a new strategy.
In Washington, it now emerges, the debate has crystallised into a straight
face-off between negotiators and unilateralists. President George Bush, the
traditional internationalist, has advanced the idealistic image of a new
world order. But across the river, planners in the Pentagon are advocating a
unipolar world, in which the US will make the rules, by force if necessary.
News of the Pentagon paper, as leaked to the New York Times, has set off a
mild international kerfuffle, since its prescriptions are deliberately
dismissive of the separate interests of America's allies. The president's
men have tried to reassure us, by declaring that the Pentagon position is
not administration policy. But the fundamental dilemma cannot be resolved
that easily, because we still do not know what is administration policy.
In recent months, Mr Bush has been keeping quiet about the new world order.
One reason is that the voters do not want to know: what interests them is
jobs and economic growth, not some airy-fairy conception of the world after
communism. So for the time being, President Bush is keeping his vision thing
to himself.
But there is a second reason which is just as compelling: there is not now,
and there will not be in any foreseeable time-frame, a new world order.
There is a new world, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union; but there
is no order, in the sense of a coherent and structured framework for future
international policy. Above all, there is no benign order, as Mr Bush has
seemed to assert.
With his tract The End of History, Mr Francis Fukuyama has argued that the
collapse of communism has united the world behind a new ideological
consensus, in favour of market forces and democracy. The thesis has made him
famous, but alas, it is palpable nonsense. The command economy may now be
irretrievably discredited, but democracy is not yet in favour with those who
can get away with autocracy. Ask the rulers of China, Singapore, Morocco,
Mexico, Kuwait, Iran, or Pakistan, to name but a few.
The central innovation of the new world is not the revelation of a universal
consensus, but the removal of the harsh organising principles represented by
the Soviet system and the east-west conflict. There is no reason to assume
that these organising principles can be replaced by others which are more
benign. On the contrary, the defining characteristics of the new world will
probably be disorder and unpredictability.
Mr Pierre Lellouche, a leading French foreign policy analyst, has just
published a sweeping survey of this new world * whose subtitle succinctly
conveys the message: 'From the order of Yalta to the disorder of the
nations.' This new disorder is by nature not readily amenable to
restructuring by governments; moreover, the US is manifestly unwilling to
get involved in the restructuring of Yugoslavia, and it is so broke that it
cannot provide any serious financial help for the ex-Soviet Union.
When President Bush proclaimed his concept of a new world order, he was
evidently inspired both by the belief that the inheritors of the Soviet
Union would become the benevolent partners of the west, and by the
extraordinary diplomatic and military experience of the Gulf war. That
conflict seemed to inaugurate a new era of international consensus between
the responsible powers, in which the United Nations would at last fulfil its
promise of harmonious international action.
Today, these hopes look hopelessly nave. The brilliance of the military
campaign in the Gulf war has been dismally tarnished by the political
aftermath: this is not a satisfactory model for the superior management of
the world. And however friendly the inheritors of the Soviet state may be,
they cannot contribute to any predictable principles of international order,
because their own political system is still in a process of headlong
decomposition. What is happening to Yugoslavia is bad enough, but just wait
for the disintegration of the Russian federation.
The professional self-interest in the unilateral thesis from the Pentagon is
all too transparent: if the US is to be the sole policeman in a unipolar
world, it obviously needs a large defence budget. Yet the end of the Cold
War means military force will become less important as an instrument of
foreign policy, not more.
More fundamentally flawed is the underlying idea that there can be a
unipolar world. The US is and will remain large, rich and powerful; but its
post-war dominance over the western world was essentially due to the
east-west conflict. Today, the western allies no longer depend on the US for
survival; so they have less need to defer to US leadership.
The US-led Gulf war was a dazzling show; the post-war follow-up continues to
be a slog of collective effort. The US is taking the lead in nuclear arms
talks with the Russians; but the real ongoing task is to prevent the
unauthorised leakage of Russian nuclear hardware, and this too can only be a
slog of collective effort.
The central issue is not whether the Pentagon, from a position of military
strength, can assert and impose its dominance over the rest of the world,
(it cannot), but whether President Bush and his successors are prepared to
recognise that in the new situation the US must work with its allies on a
basis of unfamiliar equality. If there is any meaning in the phrase 'new
world order', that is it.

FT  16 MAR 92 / After the Cold War, economics is king
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former President Richard Nixon's denunciation of the Bush administration's
policies towards Russia as 'pathetically inadequate' captured headlines last
week. But it forms only part of a much broader debate about the United
States' post-Cold War role. The key question is whether the US will
recognise the need to put economics at the heart of future national security
policies - a strategy that Japan has quietly pursued for four decades.
The power of the old diplomatic paradigm - which equates national security
with military power - was visible last week in a leaked Pentagon policy
paper. This argued that the US should seek to prevent any other nation or
group of nations from challenging its role as the world's single superpower.
The implication is clear: military spending should remain high enough to
enable the US to serve as world policeman for the foreseeable future.
An economically oriented foreign policy would justify far more generous aid
for Russia, principally as a way to secure US access to a huge new market.
But in a world of many rich nations, Mr Nixon's claim that the US has a
unique responsibility to preserve Russia's fledgling democracy is diplomatic
old-speak - as dated as the Pentagon's grandiose view of the future military
role of the US. At a conference organised last week by the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington think-tank, speakers seemed encouragingly aware of
America's need to focus on the economic foundations of national security.
How many great powers will there be in 2000, asked Mr Chalmers Johnson, the
Japan scholar. The usual answer is three: Japan holding sway in Asia,
Germany running Europe and the US pre-eminent in the Americas. The right
answer, he joked, is two: Japan's Ministry of Finance and Japan's Ministry
of Trade and Industry.
Mr Edward Luttwak, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies,
made a similar point more colourfully. Prussia, he claimed, had transformed
19th-century politics by inventing the first professional military general
staff. In order to survive, other nations had to follow suit and
professionalise their war machines. Japan was the modern economic
counterpart of Prussia. By creating what amounted to an economic general
staff, it had wiped the floor with nations that still relied mainly on
laisser faire policies. Yet the US understood only the old geo-political
rules. The secretary of defence still outranked the secretary of commerce,
while General Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser,
was clueless on economics.
The critics are making two separate points. The first is hardly
controversial: the US's geo-political pretensions directly reduce its
economic vitality because they cost so much. At the conference, Mr David
Calleo, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, rammed this point home. The
budget deficit, he said, was the central economic problem. The only credible
way to reduce it was through deep defence cuts; but these would be
sustainable only if the US radically revised its military commitments. It
could not be world policeman and restore domestic prosperity.
The second point will raise hackles. The reason that the US has nothing
resembling Mr Luttwak's economic general staff is that the nation despises
civil servants and has been ideologically committed to free markets for
decades. With a few exceptions, such as semiconductors, it has avoided
industrial policies because 'doing nothing' is seen as the best strategy.
The question is whether Japan's post-war success, like Prussia's military
success in the 19th century, will force a rethink.
Last month, at a seminar run by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think-tank, Mr Karel van Wolferen, the Dutch author of The Enigma of
Japanese Power, argued vigorously that Japan's strengths are badly
misunderstood. Western economists attribute its economic success to market
forces only because they think liberal policies are a pre-condition for
prosperity. In reality, the network of formal and informal links between
banks, industrial groups and bureaucrats had erased conventional divisions
between the public and private sectors, raising the effectiveness of
policies.
Another Japan expert, Mr Leon Hollerman, a professor at the Claremont
Graduate School, argued that a 'collusive oligopoly' of bureaucrats and
businessmen ran the country and kept foreign policy firmly focused on
economic rather than diplomatic goals. Tokyo had moved beyond the
suppression of imports and promotion of exports and was now deliberately
manipulating the multilateral trade system in a bid to make Japan the
world's 'headquarters nation'. The goal was systematically to reduce other
countries, including the US, to the role of satellite economies.
Such fears may prove exaggerated. Much of the US's lack of competitiveness
can be cured by domestic initiatives: principally more saving, better
education and training and a surer application of commercial technology. But
analysts are right to highlight structural differences: Japan may have
evolved a form of managed capitalism that will steadily outperform the
Anglo-Saxon model. The US will have to experiment with flexible forms of
industrial policy - although it is unlikely ever to create an economic civil
service of Japanese calibre. But it can learn one lesson from Japan: when
the key policymakers - in foreign as well as domestic policy - are motivated
mainly by economic considerations, the economy flourishes.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Watching the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET will be looking for a stronger performance from the dollar this
week while watching for the effect of UK opinion polls on sterling, writes
Neil Buckley.
The US currency was felt by many to have underperformed last week, failing
to take advantage of data showing a sharp rise in retail sales, and a rise
in non-farm payrolls.
Many dealers feel a consumer-led recovery is now under way and will be
keeping a close eye on this week's industrial production, inflation and
housing starts figures on Tuesday, jobless claims on Thursday, and trade
figures on Friday.
If these are as strong as expected, they could give the dollar the impetus
it needs to challenge the DM1.68 and Y135 barriers. Some analysts suggest
that if the market overcomes last week's reticence, the dollar could reach
DM1.70 and Y137.
As sterling continues to look weak ahead of the UK general election on April
9, all attention will be fixed on the opinion polls, and on the opposition
Labour party's alternative Budget on Tuesday. Thursday's unemployment
figures, expected to show an increase of around 35,000, will also be
crucial, for political as much as economic reasons.
Mr David Deakin of Nikko Bank warned: 'It is only just now sinking in among
the dealing fraternity that there is a reasonable probability of there being
a Labour majority, and that is causing a lot of concern.'
'There is a big risk on the downside for sterling.'
He said a strong showing by Labour in the opinion polls would see sterling
continue to fall against the D-mark, dragging down with it the peseta,
top-placed currency in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, possibly even as far as
its absolute floor of DM2.7780.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Japanese bankers keen to develop
domestic sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market looks set to face a potent new competitor over
the next few years as Japanese bankers look to develop their domestic bond
market.
Earlier this month Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the largest Japanese
electricity utility, launched a Y100bn three-year bond issue in Japan. The
deal, lead-managed by Nomura Securities, was one which many syndicate
managers expected to see launched in the international market.
In the past, large Japanese utilities have funded themselves much more
cheaply by launching international bonds, mainly because fees charged by
underwriting firms in the Eurobond market were smaller. But the Tepco issue
shows Japanese underwriting fees are falling. The deal carried full fees of
0.45 per cent (45 basis points). Under the old system of semi-fixed
commissions, borrowers had to pay at least 1 per cent of the total amount
raised.
Direct comparison with the old system is difficult, because the Tepco deal
was the first domestic corporate bond issue with a three-year maturity.
Until last year, the Bank of Japan prohibited companies from issuing bonds
of less than five years' maturity. This was seen as a way of keeping markets
for shorter-dated securities clear to meet banks' wholesale funding needs.
However, in January last year Chugoku Electric Power received permission to
launch a four-year deal. Bankers said the Tepco deal demonstrated that the
authorities were prepared to erode further the banks' monopoly on
shorter-maturity bond issues.
Japanese securities firms have also been importing new issue underwriting
and syndication techniques from the international bond market. Last autumn,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched the first domestic yen bond issue to
be re-offered to investors at a fixed price. The issue was lead-managed by
Nomura and Morgan Stanley, the US firm which pioneered the technique in the
international bond market in 1989.
The idea of the fixed-price reoffer is to prevent junior members of the
underwriting group from flooding the market with discounted bonds if a deal
appears to be proceeding badly. The lead bank can hold the bonds at a fixed
price until it is satisfied the bulk of the deal has been placed with end
investors. Only then is the issue allowed to float and find a true market
price.
The technique is now favoured in most sectors of the international bond
market. It is widely credited with helping to restore the profitability of
underwriting firms and the faith of institutional investors in the primary
market - since prices are less likely to fall straight after launch.
The Tepco bond issue was also sold in this way.
Japanese bankers' desire to develop their domestic bond market stems from a
recognition that the supply of equity finance which fuelled the Japanese
economy in the 1980s has dried up. Companies are now much more reliant on
debt to fund investment.
In the late 1980s Japanese companies had access to almost unlimited amounts
of equity finance as the stock market boomed. In the last quarter of 1989,
just before the equity market collapsed, Japanese companies raised a
staggering Y9,000bn of equity or equity-linked finance. In the fourth
quarter of last year, by comparison, the amount raised was only Y1,000bn.
In addition, many of the equity-linked bond issues launched in the
international bond market in the late 1980s are now due for redemption.
Around Dollars 78bn equivalent of warrant bonds need to be repaid next year,
for example. Since the appetite of international investors for equity-linked
finance is now much less, Japanese companies will have to rely on their
domestic investors for a significant portion of this refunding.
However, there are obstacles to the rapid development of a mature domestic
bond market in Japan. Clearing and settlement remains cumbersome. Physical
exchange of bond certificates is still the norm and the system is dominated
by the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Partly as a result, secondary market trading of corporate bonds is limited.
Bankers are keen to streamline the system and invest in new technology, but
agreement on the structure and funding of such a system has yet to be
reached.
In addition, access to the bond market is still limited to only a few big
borrowers
because Japanese investors want collateral to back any form of debt finance.
Desire for collateral and security is not unique to Japan. But the concept
is strong enough to have effectively blocked most sectors of industry from
issuing domestic bonds.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Spaniards now free to tap foreign funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH borrowers are expected to make more frequent use of the
international syndicated loans market, following the recent lifting of
restrictions on overseas borrowing. Bankers in London and Madrid believe
companies such as Iberia, Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa may be tempted to
tap the international markets in the coming months.
The latest Spanish name to launch a syndicated loan is Comite Organizador
Olimpico Barcelona 1992, known as Coob - or the Organising Committee for the
Olympic Games in Barcelona. The Pta28.311bn loan will be used to pay for
construction and other costs associated with the games. Banesto, the Spanish
bank, is lead manager and agent, and expects 50 to 60 mainly European banks
to participate.
Coob took out a short-term Pta19.5bn bridge loan in December 1991 due to
mature in August 1992. It carried a margin of 62.5 basis points over the
London interbank offered rate, and fees of 10 basis points.
The new credit is intended to replace the bridge loan and increase the size
of the borrowing. The one-year loan is guaranteed by the Kingdom of Spain
and, while the borrower is the Olympic committee for the first year, the
loan can be transferred to the Kingdom of Spain thereafter and extended to
five years. The margin is 18.75 basis points over Libor and there is a
front-end fee of 25 basis points.
Until last month, Spanish borrowers needed Bank of Spain permission to
borrow in a foreign currency. As one banker who works with Spanish corporate
borrowers put it: 'The Bank of Spain was quite capable of discouraging
companies or the autonomous communes from borrowing abroad.'
Another banker said: 'Companies had to maintain an interest-free deposit
with the Bank of Spain equivalent to 30 per cent of the total loan, but this
year all the restrictions have been abolished.'
Spanish borrowers such as Fecsa, the Catalan utility, and Iberia, the
airline, have used the international credit markets in the past.
Fecsa did a small deal for Dollars 58m in December 1990, priced at more than
55 basis points over Libor. In May 1991 it launched a Dollars 150m loan -
which was increased to Dollars 200m - with a margin of 55 basis points over
Libor. Last month it launched an Ecu125m deal - split in two tranches of
Ecu90m and Pta4.6bn - and priced at 50 basis points over Libor.
One banker points out that Spanish names are 'keener to do European currency
borrowings (EMS member currencies) rather than US dollar borrowings', in
order to reduce the currency risk.
The high level of pricing - in terms of the margin over Libor and the fees -
may also encourage more discreet bilateral deals than public syndicated
loans initially. But bankers believe the trend will be towards a wider use
of the international markets by Spanish borrowers.

FT  16 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Recovery signs deepen rates gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEAR market in US government bonds passed a significant milestone late
last week when the yield on the 30-year Treasury issue rose through the
psychologically-important 8 per cent barrier.
With the market now almost universally gloomy about the long-term trend of
interest rates, the main question facing dealers is whether the market is
oversold and whether this leaves scope for a short, sustained rally over the
next few months before the bears really get a grip.
It was not meant to be like this. Back at the turn of the year, when the
bond market was still basking in the Fed's dramatic December 20 easing of
monetary policy, the benchmark 30-year issue was yielding around 7.5 and
plenty of analysts expected it to dip to around 7 per cent before reversing
direction around mid-year.
But the market quickly took fright at the prospects for economic recovery,
and those anxieties have been intensified by the positive statistical data
of the past few weeks.
Last week, in particular, brought surprisingly strong figures for February
retail sales, with a 1.3 per cent increase coming on top of a revised 2.1
per cent January gain.
This pace of advance is not sustainable, and may have been buoyed by special
factors, such as a more-rapid-than-usual despatch of tax refunds, but it
does add weight to evidence of a recovery in consumer confidence.
It was the shock of the retail sales figures which pushed the long bond to
close on Thursday above 8 per cent for the first time since last November.
Better-than-expected producer price figures on Friday morning temporarily
pushed it back below 8 per cent, but that was rapidly reversed when the
market saw that figures showing business inventories dipped 0.4 per cent in
January, which provided more evidence of recovery.
Any lingering hopes in the market of an early easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve have now been quashed. Rather, attention is now focusing
on just when the Fed might begin tightening again.
There is clearly no early need. Money supply M2, which increased by Dollars
2bn in the week to March 2, is slightly above the mid-point of the Fed's
target range, while Friday's producer price figures, showing a 0.2 per cent
increase in February, or 0.1 per cent when food and energy are excluded,
compared with consensus forecasts of 0.3 per cent on both measures.
So far this year the annual rate of inflation is running at around 2.4 per
cent, based on the core producer price index.
This week will bring consumer price figures which are expected to underline
this benign picture. Analysts are expecting a rise of around 0.4 per cent,
both including and excluding energy prices.
At the same time, the economic recovery still hardly looks that robust.
Figures for February industrial production, due out tomorrow, are expected
to show a rise of 0.7 to 0.9 per cent, breaking a spell of three consecutive
monthly declines.
Yet many of the main indicators are little higher than in the middle of last
year, the consumer remains edgy, and the recent trend of rising interest
rates could start to choke off recovery.
All these factors could prove positive for the bond market over the next few
months, if the view takes hold that inflation really is under control and
the economy is unlikely to grow at much more than a 3 per cent annual rate
in the second half of the year.
Continued Congressional deadlock over a fiscal policy would also help the
mood of the market, which took fright at last week's statement by President
Bush that he was more concerned about growth than bringing down long-term
interest rates.
This is why a substantial number of Wall Street analysts are predicting a
mini-rally which could carry the yield on the long bond back down to around
7.75 to 7.80 per cent over the next few months.
In the second half, however, most expect the yield on the long bond to be
nudging back up towards 8.5 per cent, against a background of a gently
tightening Fed, sustained economic expansion, an uncertain presidential race
and the danger of fiscal excesses in Washington which could send the budget
deficit soaring again.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Belgian Bonds: Focus on government's debt-cutting plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN bond market is holding its breath until it sees how the new
government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene plans to cut the overhang of
public debt. This is still a record among OECD countries at 130 per cent of
gross national product (GNP).
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister who stays on in the new
government, created a flutter in the financial markets last week when he
suggested Belgian rates might come down a bit.
The National Bank promptly quashed the idea, saying even a slight cut would
have to await similar developments in Germany and the Netherlands. For two
years, Belgium has kept its franc closer to the German and Dutch currencies
than the European monetary system requires.
Mr Maystadt was tempted into his remarks by a desire to make political
capital out of the improvement in most of the fundamentals of the Belgian
economy. In particular, inflation sank in February to a year-on-year rate of
2.3 per cent, or 2 percentage points lower than the price trend in both
Germany and the Netherlands. Wage moderation is accentuated by the
indexation system when inflation is on the way down. Belgium's current
account surplus continues in steady surplus of around 2 per cent of GNP.
The only glaring black spot remains public debt, which is where the bond
market, handling almost exclusively government paper, comes in. Recent
Maystadt reforms have vastly improved this market. The government, which
issued BFr930bn debt last year, is getting a better deal by submitting a new
range of linear bonds to auction rather than paying fat commissions to a
cosy consortium of underwriting banks. The government's first 15-year bond a
few weeks ago was well received.
The spread on 10-year bonds over the German bund equivalent had fallen to 80
basis points by the end of last week, close to its historic low last summer.
The market has recovered after the Maastricht agreement on European monetary
union boosted hopes of further convergence.
The government's indebtedness still puts a credit risk premium on its
borrowings. But Mr Peter Praet, Generale de Banque's chief economist, sees
change on the way. 'There are signs the new government plans quite a drastic
fiscal package which, if credible, could see the spread coming down to 60
basis points.'
The catalyst, as elsewhere in Europe, is the Maastricht agreement that
governments can only qualify for monetary union by bringing their total debt
down towards 60 per cent of GNP and annual budget deficits down to 3 per
cent of GNP. The Dehaene government has committed itself to trying to hit
these targets by 1996.
Belgium still has miles to go before it rests. Even if the budget deficit -
6.3 per cent of GNP last year - were reduced to 3 per cent by 1996, its debt
would then still be 110 per cent of GNP, and 80 per cent by 2006, according
to one authoritative estimate.

FT  16 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Election concern depresses prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOOD of despondency settled over the government gilt-edged securities
market, as the bonds shed around 1 1/2 points on the week on a wave of
concern about the Conservative government's prospects in the April 9 general
election.
The unveiling by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of a Budget which many
judged to be less than helpful to the Tories' chances set the tone. Many in
the City were disappointed the Budget failed to feature the sweeping tax
cuts which might have formed a good platform for the Tory election campaign.
Dramatically, Mr Lamont also indicated the government's finances were in a
far worse state than many had expected. This will lead to a surge in issues
of gilts over the next two to three years to pay for an increase in
borrowing, and the result of this will be to depress prices of the bonds.
But it was the feeling that the Tories might be losing their grip on voters'
sentiments which had the biggest effect on the gilt market. Many investors
view with trepidation the prospects of Labour forming the next government,
largely due to theories that Labour would be likely to push up government
borrowing still more or cause a run on the pound.
That was behind both the severe markdown in gilt prices - which wiped out
the gains of January and February and pushed up yields to around their
levels at the beginning of the year - and also the soggy tone of sterling.
The pound lost nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs on the week to close at 2.855.
With the pound trading at around 9 pfennigs below its central DM2.95 rate in
the European exchange rate mechanism, the gilt market is extremely cautious
about whether the government will be able to push through an early cut in
base rates. Many believe a cut is needed to revive the ailing economy.
However, the sentiment is growing that, because of the need to defend
sterling, the UK authorities might soon after the election have to push up
lending rates, rather than bring them down. That could happen, on the
assessment of many in the markets, irrespective of the political colour of
the next government.
Reflecting this sentiment, last week's rise in yields was especially
pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, which reflects expectations
of changes in base rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent for more
than six months.
The short-dated 10 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 1994 dropped from 100
21/32 at the close of the previous week to 99 7/8 on Friday, with its yield
up 35 basis points (0.35 per cent) to 10 per cent. There was a less
pronounced change for the longer-dated 9 per cent Treasury stock due in
2008, which closed on Friday at 96 15/16 , from 95 1/2 the week before, with
the yield rising to 9.54 per cent from 9.37 per cent.
There is a distinct possibility of a further rise in yields this week,
resulting from a batch of economic data which is expected to paint a bleak
picture about economic prospects. Next Thursday's unemployment statistics
are expected to indicate a rise last month of about 35,000 in the official
jobless total, now at about 2.6m.
Even though the outlook for inflation looks reasonably good - next Friday's
announcement about retail price inflation is expected to put the headline
figure last month at 4 per cent, after 4.1 per cent in January - the
political impact of the less than cheerful news on the economy will probably
be negative for gilts. 'Everything is looking a bit fragile at the moment,'
said Mr Gwynn Hacche, an economist at stockbroker James Capel.
As for the PSBR, Mr Lamont said the figure for the fiscal year beginning on
April 1 would be Pounds 28bn, after Pounds 14bn in 1991-92. Many had
previously reckoned these two figures would be nearer Pounds 25bn and Pounds
12bn respectively. According to the Treasury, there is worse to come in
1993-94, when the PSBR is likely to be Pounds 32bn, or 4.75 per cent of
gross domestic product.
Given the Treasury's poor record on forecasting in recent years, and the
tendency of the government to look on the optimistic side when it comes to
economic prospects, many in the gilt market reckon the true figures will be
far higher, which last week served to deepen the general mood of gloom
affecting gilts.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Allianz banks on a short-term
loser - Chief executive Uwe Haasen talks about a return to east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the second half of 1990, Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company,
has spent hundreds of millions of D-Marks on the former east German state
insurance monopoly, Deutsche Versicherungs (DVAG).
Munich-based Allianz acquired DVAG in two stages from the Treuhand
privatisation agency, and though the second stage still awaits finance
ministry approval, it has de facto management control.
Allianz laid out DM711m (Dollars 433.5m) to buy the business which, it now
forecasts, will lose more than DM1.5bn before starting to make operating
profits at the beginning of 1996.
Not included in the purchase price is a further DM600m already deployed on
capital investment. Together with the projected losses, this makes a total
cost of more than DM2.8bn, which represents nearly three times Allianz's
consolidated earnings for 1990. And the cost will probably grow even bigger
as Allianz moves to build up DVAG's financial reserves.
Perhaps Allianz will never make a return on its investment if the 'time
value' of money is taken into account. If it does, it is unlikely to be
until early next century.
Is this willingness, then, to take on such losses, over so many years, an
example of the legendary German 'long-termism'? Or is the deal simply
misguided, driven by Allianz's desire at any price to be number one in the
east of Germany as well as in the west?
Mr Uwe Haasen, chief executive of the group's main domestic insurance
subsidiary, argues that the losses and the investments have to be seen as
part of the purchase price for a business which will give Allianz a strong
position in the fast-growing market for insurance in the east.
For Mr Haasen, short-term pay-back criteria are secondary to the long-term
strategic benefit of getting back into a market which Allianz, and other
western insurers, were forced to quit after the second world war. He also
maintains that however expensive the acquisition may look now, it will cost
rival insurance companies considerably more to establish themselves in
eastern Germany at a later stage in its economic recovery.
Before reunification, east Germans spent an average of Dollars 127 per head
a year on insurance - about a 10th of the amount spent by their west German
counterparts. Allianz, and the more than 300 other insurance companies which
have sought to establish themselves in the east since the state monopoly
there was broken up in July 1990, believe that east German spending on
insurance will eventually catch up with that in the west.
The Allianz view is that this will take place over the next five to eight
years, by which time the east German market will have come to represent
about a quarter of the German total.
'We were there in the past - up until the (second world) war our
headquarters were in Berlin and the main part of our business used to be in
the east,' recalls Mr Haasen. 'And it is very important for us to reoccupy
this market segment.
'In 1990 (when Allianz bought its first 51 per cent stake in DVAG) we
decided that the best way to do this was to occupy the infrastructure of the
old monopoly - to get the offices, the telephones, all these little but
important things.
'The priority is to get the same market share in the east as in the west -
maybe a little more - and to become established as a settled and well-known
insurer, to make sure that the structure for doing business is in place.
These operational reasons are more important for the time being than
short-term earnings.'
However, Mr Haasen's 'for the time being' means at least four years from
now: four years before the acquisition begins to make even operating
profits.
Meanwhile, market share objectives have already been achieved. For example
in the motor sector, Allianz's share in the east is more than 20 per cent
compared with 15 to 16 per cent in the west.
Mr Haasen rejects the suggestion that Allianz is having to wait too long for
a return. 'Other insurance companies interested in the east will have to go
the same way eventually. Insurance is a local business - you have to be in
the east if you want to do business there. You have to build up a salesforce
and administration, and that means that (our rivals) will have to pay the
same amount of money. In fact, I feel that it is cheaper to invest now,
rather than in three or four years' time when prices will have gone up.'
Although profits are not the priority, Allianz is taking steps to cut costs.
It has long-term plans to bring the number of offices in the east down from
more than 200 to between 10 and 20.
This year it plans to shed 1,400 employees, approximately 10 per cent of
DVAG's workforce, and staff numbers will be whittled down further over the
years to come. Although Mr Haasen refuses to be drawn on precise numbers, he
does say that the DM2bn of business handled by the 14,000 DVAG staff would
need only 5,000 to 7,000 people in the west.
He says DVAG productivity will never rise to western levels. Business in the
east involves small sums of money and is thus more work-intensive.
Therefore, in the long term, staff cuts will exceed the 10 per cent
announced already.
While costs in the east are higher than in the west, the premiums Allianz
charges on its eastern policies are lower - considerably lower in some
cases. Motor rates, the most important non-life sector, stand at about 80
per cent of what they are in the west, despite claims experience which is
worse - and is likely to get worse still as east Germans drive their
newly-acquired western cars around the east's inadequate roads.
Property premiums are only 10 per cent of rates in the west, household
insurance rates only a third. Allianz cannot simply adjust rates to economic
levels; Mr Haasen reckons that if motor rates were doubled, half the
existing clients would cancel their policies.
Summing up, Mr Haasen says there is a misunderstanding among analysts about
the costs of tidying up DVAG - that they tend to assume that DVAG was just a
badly-run company which could be rationalised through the application of
textbook management procedures.
He points out that the required restructuring is much more fundamental than
that. 'You've got to transfer the company from the old monopoly structure to
our type of economy - and pay for the transition period and all the expenses
of getting people used to our systems, to the market, to competition, to the
western legal system.'
It is possible that Allianz is exaggerating its woes in the east - flaunting
the very scale of its commitment to the east - to ensure that the finance
ministry does grant approval for the second part of the transaction.
However analysts consider that, by normal short to medium-term financial
criteria, the deal does not make sense. Mr Peter Constable at Robert Fleming
Securities in London, for example, is recommending that investors take
advantage of the recent rise in the German stock market to sell shares in
Allianz before the full impact of the eastern operations feeds through to
the bottom line.
Most of the shares in Allianz, however, are held by a small number of German
financial institutions - for example Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank and Munich
Re - whose investment horizons are every bit as long-term as those of the
Allianz itself.

BENGUET Corporation, the Philippines' largest gold producer, has reported
consolidated net profits for 1991 of 91.1m pesos (Dollars 3.7m), a decline
of 64 per cent from the previous year's 251.7m pesos, writes Jose Galang in
Manila.
However, Mr Dennis Belmonte, president, said non-recurring gains from the
sale of real property provided the bulk of 1991 profits.
Operating revenues declined by 8.5 per cent to 3.65bn pesos, owing to lower
production volumes and metal prices on the world markets.
The 1991 performance followed a 26.5 per cent drop in net profits in 1990.
Production of gold declined 21.5 per cent to 107,265 oz, while that of
copper fell 14 per cent to 31.17m lbs.

AIR Liquide, the French technical gases group, plans to invest DM267m
(Dollars 162.80m) in a large air dispersion plant to be built in Bohlen in
east Germany.
It bought the 110,000 sq metre site for the factory from the Treuhand agency
last week. The property previously was part of Sachsische Olefinwerke. The
plant will employ 185 people and supply the chemicals industry in Saxony.
Mr Pierre Solente, a director of Air Liquide, said it planned to invest a
total of DM400m in east Germany. The company previously bought the Tega
technical gases plant in east Berlin, as well as several other factories and
transfer points. Nearly 200 east German companies sell the company's
products.
Air Liquide is also considering the construction of gas pipelines in east
Germany, Mr Solente said.
French companies were among the leading foreign investors in east Germany,
buying 44 companies and pledging investments of DM2.3bn by the end of last
year. British companies bought 26 companies and committed themselves to
invest DM1.3bn.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Chrysler leadership race
intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Chrysler, the US automotive manufacturer, held an unusual
special meeting in New York at the weekend amid speculation that it would
consider naming Mr Robert Eaton, president of General Motors in Europe, as
successor to Mr Lee Iacocca, its chairman.
Mr Iacocca, who is 67, is due to retire at the end of this year. The
Chrysler board has been weighing up for months whether to appoint a
successor from within the company or on from outside.
Mr Eaton acknowledged in an interview with the New York Times that he had
held discussions with Mr Iacocca about joining Chrysler, though he did not
specify in what capacity.
Aged 52, he has played a key role in making GM Europe the company's most
profitable automotive business, helping to offset heavy losses in the US
market.
Mr Eaton was rumoured to have flown to New York to meet the Chrysler board
late on Saturday to discuss a succession plan, although a spokesman for the
company declined all comment on the board's deliberations.
The appointment of Mr Eaton would be a severe blow to Mr Robert Lutz,
president of Chrysler, who has made clear that he wants to succeed Mr
Iacocca.
Mr Lutz, who has a strong design and engineering background, has played a
crucial role in revamping Chrysler's tired model line with a range of
exciting new vehicles due to reach the US market over the next two years.
Several large Chrysler shareholders have made clear they back his candidacy.
However, Mr Lutz has less knowledge of the financial side of the business
and has clashed with Mr Iacocca on numerous occasions. If he does not get
the chairmanship, Chrysler might have trouble keeping him.
Another possible contender is 56-year-old Mr Gerald Greenwald, Mr Iacocca's
former heir apparent, who left the company in 1990 to join an ill-fated
airline management buy-out and now works for a New York investment bank.
Mr Iacocca has been chairman of Chrysler ever since the late 1970s, when he
engineered a government rescue which pulled the company back from the brink
of bankruptcy.

THE IRISH Stock Exchange has taken the unusual step of revealing that it had
carried out an insider trading investigation into the recent sale of part of
the Irish government's holding in Greencore, the sugar and foods group.
It said 'the Exchange has found nothing that would lead it to believe there
were instances of insider dealing involved. The Exchange points out that its
normal policy is to neither confirm or deny that it conducts insider dealing
investigations in particular cases. However, it feels that in this case the
level of public concern involved justified making an exception'.
Last month the government sold a third of its 45 per cent stake in Greencore
to an institutional fund manager. This breached an undertaking made at the
time of its flotation in April 1991, that the government would not dispose
of any further shares in the company for at least two years.
The move angered institutional investors, who were not offered the 12m
shares on a pro-rata basis, and shook confidence in the government's
commitment to the company.

Specialist Computer Holdings (SCH), a privately-held computer dealership and
distributor, confirmed that it had increased to 24.2 per cent its stake in
NMW Computers, the leading processor of stock exchange transactions, writes
Alan Cane.
Mr Peter Rigby, SCH chairman, said that he had been interested in NMW for
some time, but had no immediate intention of launching a full bid for the
company.
He believed, however, that the pattern of NMW's shareholding - with many
small investors - had prevented the company maximising its potential.
He thought it likely SCH would be seeking representation on NMW's board.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Reaping the benefits of an
international strategy - How Bovis is escaping the ravages of the UK
construction recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS, the UK construction group, appears to be on a winning streak. On
Friday, it was confirmed that the company had been awarded the contract to
manage the main building works, worth between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 408.7m - Pounds 583.9m), for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta,
Georgia.
The order would be a coup for any international construction company. For
Bovis it comes in the middle of a remarkable three-month run of success,
during which it has picked up management contracts for some of the world's
biggest and most prestigious building projects.
Since the beginning of December, Bovis, a subsidiary of Peninsula and
Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O), the British property and transport group,
has been awarded contracts to manage construction work worth more than
Dollars 3.5bn.
The contracts, won against stiff competition, particularly from the US, have
been spread as far apart as continental Europe, the Far East and the US.
They include:
a Dollars 700m second phase of the Euro Disney theme park in Paris;
the first phase of a big city centre office and redevelopment worth between
Dollars 800m and Dollars 1bn in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;
Dollars 700m of maintenance facilities for United Airlines at various US
airports; and
a Dollars 400m development for Kommerz Bank in Frankfurt.
Other contracts include a Dollars 100m Court of Appeal building in San
Francisco; a Dollars 150m hotel in Los Angeles; a Dollars 100m redevelopment
of Navy Pier in Chicago; and refitting the London headquarters for the
European Bank for Development and Reconstruction, expected to cost Dollars
90m.
The awards reflect the success of the company's policy, established in the
mid-1980s, of building a worldwide construction business to reduce its
dependence on a home market which has suffered as a result of overbuilding
in the late 1980s and the decline in the UK economy.
By the end of last year, Bovis held contracts to manage projects worth
Pounds 3.7bn - 8 per cent more than at the end of 1990 and in spite of one
of the worst recessions for UK construction for half a century.
According to Bovis, the combined value of its UK contracts last year fell by
41 per cent from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 1bn. The value of US work, however,
increased by three-quarters from Pounds 800m to Pounds 1.4bn, while the
value of continental European and Far Eastern projects rose by 44 per cent
to Pounds 1.3bn.
Sir Frank Lampl, Bovis's Czechoslovakian-born chairman, says: 'We decided in
1985 that the rise in UK construction output could not last and that we
needed to find new markets. At that point more than 90 per cent of Bovis's
turnover was generated in the UK.'
The company does not carry out construction itself, but manages projects for
a fee, subcontracting the work to others. Its domestic success had been
based on establishing long-term relationships with UK customers, similar to
the 'partnerships' between Japanese contractors and clients.
Bovis, between 1927 and the mid-1980s, managed the construction of almost
all of Marks and Spencer's stores. It still carries out more than 80 per
cent of developments for the group. Bovis also has close relationships with
Stanhope, the UK property developer, and with Safeway, the British retailer,
for which it has built more than 200 stores.
Sir Frank, who left Czechoslovakia in 1968, just before the Soviet invasion,
says: 'We have tried to offer similar continuity and quality of service to
international customers which regularly build overseas.'
The breakthrough came with the purchase in 1986 of a 50 per cent stake in
Lehrer McGovern, the New York-based construction management group, which was
purchased outright by the British company in 1988.
Bovis, through Lehrer McGovern, was able to offer US-style construction
management, just as North American developers were seeking to invest in
Europe.
It is a mark of Bovis's success that it has won repeat orders for both Euro
Disney (where it managed phase one of the project) and for Canary Wharf,
where it is managing the construction of a multi-billion-pound office scheme
being developed by Olympia &amp; York.
In 1990, Bovis - previously based in the north-east and west coast of the US
 -acquired McDevitt &amp; Street, a large US construction group working
primarily in south-eastern states. This year, it bought Schal Associates, a
Chicago-based construction management company covering the mid-west.
McDevitt &amp; Street and Lehrer McGovern will mastermind the construction of
sports facilities, accommodation, transport and communications for the 1996
Olympic Games.
Bovis, which seven years ago only had overseas subsidiaries in Portugal and
San Francisco, now has subsidiaries in Spain, Germany, France,
Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, Japan,
Taiwan and the US.

FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Petrocon declares final its
offer for James Wilkes - Bidder attacks target's policy of selling core
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROCON, the engineering and surveying group, yesterday declared final its
bid for James Wilkes, the Sheffield-based engineering company, and launched
a scathing attack on the Wilkes defence.
The attack came in Petrocon's offer document which shareholders should
receive shortly.
Petrocon's bid, a straight share exchange of 13 Petrocon shares for every
three Wilkes shares, was launched on February 3 and at last Friday's closing
prices, valued Wilkes at about Pounds 28m. The offer closes on March 30.
Petrocon said it had the support of 35.4 per cent of Wilkes shares,
comprising accept- ances of 13 per cent, a commitment to accept the bid from
holders of a further 17.6 per cent, and a further 4.8 per cent owned by
Petrocon and its associates.
The offer document con- centrates on Petrocon's cash resources and net
assets, which it claims will support Wilkes' 'overgeared and hard pressed
balance sheet,' and Petrocon's strong man- agement team and specifically
attacks Wilkes' policy of selling its core busi- nesses.
It also points out that links remain between Mr Arthur Watt, the new
chairman of Wilkes, and Mr Stephen Hinchcliffe, the former chairman who
resigned after the Petrocon bid.
The document also hits out at Mr Watt's record as a director and latterly as
managing director at Aurora, the engineering group, for five years until
1983.
Petrocon said Mr Watt left Aurora in 1983 prior to a financial
reconstruction of the company; 'Wilkes' shareholders should not let Aurora's
fate befall their company,' said Petrocon.
Petrocon rejected Wilkes' criticism of its management team, pointing to its
successes in revitalising and improving performances at other engineering
businesses, including successful research and development projects at Cape
Industries and Floform.
It also highlighted the management team's performance at Central &amp; Sheerwood
where operating losses of Pounds 1.4m in 1986 were transformed into
operating profits of Pounds 787,000 in 1988.
Wilkes' strategy of selling many of its non-core businesses is described by
Petrocon as 'an admission of failure,' and Petrocon also points out that Mr
Watt shares common directorships with Mr Hinchcliffe, Wilkes' former
chairman.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Lonrho faces shareholder criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, is facing calls from some of
its biggest shareholders for changes in its corporate governance as a
consultancy published a report containing criticisms of the group.
Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), an adviser to the pension
funds with investments in Lonrho, has called for the appointment of four
'high-calibre' non-executives; a change to the company's memorandum and
articles to provide for the election of all directors; and the creation of
an independent pay committee.
Some of Lonrho's institutional shareholders expressed support for PIRC's
proposals.
Ms Ann Simpson, PIRC's joint managing director, said: 'All the major issues
affecting the share price have been removed from the process of
accountability. Some of the group's biggest shareholders have told us of
their dismay at the group's inability to respond.'
On Friday, Lonrho's share price fell to a six-year low of 95p after a spate
of bad news.
Lonrho does not believe PIRC to be representative of its shareholders, which
include a high proportion of small shareholders.
PIRC is recommending that Lonrho's shareholders set a deadline for the
company to comply with guidelines set by the Institutional Shareholders
Committee arguing for the appointment of independent non-executive directors
to its board.
Failing this, PIRC says shareholders should put forward their own candidates
for election.
It also recommends that shareholders question management about the group's
articles of association which exclude Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, aged
74, from the need to seek re-election. Postel Investment Management, an
institutional shareholder, has been arguing that all directors over 70
should be up for re-election every year. In light of Mr Rowland's salary
increase from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.6m against a fall in Lonrho's pre-tax
profits, PIRC calls for the creation of an independent pay committee.

FT  16 MAR 92 / G30 to review use of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROUP of Thirty, the Washington-based think tank, plans to launch a
review of the risks to the world's financial markets from the growing use of
derivative instruments such as futures, options and swaps.
This would mark the first comprehensive study of the risks which have built
up in the financial system following the explosive growth of all types of
derivatives since the early 1980s. Regulators around the world have been
working towards ways of measuring and limiting such risks, though no
comprehensive solutions have yet emerged.
Derivatives are financial products whose value is based on underlying assets
such as bonds, currencies or stocks. They exaggerate price movements in the
underlying assets, and so potentially pose greater risks to financial
institutions.
A G30 review would carry influence with bank supervisors, some of whom have
expressed concern over the increasing use of products such as swaps and
options. The full risks of these instruments are not shown on banks' balance
sheets.
A chairman has yet to be appointed by the G30, but the review is likely to
get under way during the summer. The review will attempt to define and
measure the various types of risks involved in the use of derivative
products - including market risk, credit risk and settlement risk - and will
also examine how that risk can best be managed.
The review will not only examine the role of banks but also of other
participants such as brokerages and insurance companies. It could make or
break bankers' hopes of winning a favourable interpretation of the Basle
guidelines on the capital adequacy of banks which come into force in January
1993.
For example, bankers have been pressing for rules which would allow them to
net off their exposures in the Dollars 3,000bn (Pounds 1,751bn) swaps
market, effectively reducing the amount of capital they need to hold to
protect against loss.
'Because the Basle accord requires banks to calculate their . . . exposure
on a gross basis, it places banks at a competitive disadvantage' and could
threaten the future of off-balance sheet business, according to Mr Mark
Brickell, chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association, who
expressed his backing for the G30 project at the association's annual
meeting in Paris on Friday.

   By PHILIP COGGAN and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEARING BANKS have clashed with the National Association of Pension Funds
because of views the latter put forward on the need to protect pensioners in
the wake of the Maxwell affair.
The recommendations were contained in testimony to the parliamentary select
committee on social security which has been considering reforms of the
pension laws for the past three months.
The NAPF, a trade organisation of pension fund managers, urged that
companies which manage their own pension funds be required to appoint an
independent custodian for safekeeping of assets.
Lloyds Bank said it was unhappy about the representations made by the NAPF
to the committee, and felt that the views of all the members had not been
canvassed properly. The Lloyds group pension fund is the biggest single
customer of Lloyds Investment Management, and the bank acts as custodian of
the pension fund.
Lloyds said it would 'carefully consider' its membership of the NAPF when it
came up for renewal. Other clearing banks have also expressed concern about
the NAPF's views on the issue.
In the case of the Maxwell companies, Mr Maxwell was apparently able to gain
access to pension fund assets because a company he controlled had physical
possession of them. Since the Maxwell case arose, the fund management
industry has been anxious to ward off calls for custodians of assets to be
independent of those who decide where to invest the funds.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Retail prices index comes under fresh
bout of scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN Britain's retail prices index is coming under official scrutiny.
In a press release, which was quickly lost from sight in the aftermath of
the Budget and the excitement surrounding the fixing of the election date,
the Central Statistical Office last week announced the membership of its
retail prices index advisory committee.
Nineteen economists and experts, including the FT's chief economic
commentator Mr Samuel Brittan, will advise Mr William McLennan, the CSO's
recently appointed head, about the implications for the RPI of the abolition
of the poll tax and its replacement by the council tax. Also on the agenda
will be the inclusion of holiday spending in the index and the way the RPI
tracks the prices of new cars.
The decision to reconvene the committee was announced by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, last month. But it is unlikely that it will meet before the
election. It could then find its brief radically altered in the event of a
Labour victory which could lead to the scrapping of the council tax.
However, there are some who would argue that the RPI needs more careful
scrutiny than that envisaged by the committee's terms of reference. Two
market researchers, Mr Pym Cornish and Mr Mike Waterson, have published a
paper which maintains that the index, as presently constituted, overstates
UK inflation in conditions of recession. They add that it probably
understated inflation in the economic boom of the late 1980s.
The RPI is a vitally important indicator. With reason, Mr Nigel Lawson said
in the 1980s that inflation was the 'judge and jury' of British government
policy. The economic pain involved in reducing the annual rate of retail
price inflation from its recent peak of 10.9 per cent in October 1990 will
dominate the election campaign.
The index has an impact on many aspects of everyday life. It acts as a base
level for wage negotiators; influences the pricing decisions of companies;
determines how state retirement pensions and certain social security
benefits are upgraded, and directly affects savers of index-linked National
Saving certificates and indexed gilt-edged government securities.
The assertion of Mr Cornish and Mr Waterson that the current true rate of
retail price inflation could be as little as 1 per cent compared with
January's 4.1 per cent official inflation rate is, therefore, disturbing.
The two argue that the RPI substantially overstates the true average levels
of many prices paid because the prices making up the index are those on a
list of goods, that is revised annually and taken from a fixed panel of
outlets.
Unlike ordinary shoppers, the officials who gather prices for the index
cannot shop around for the best bargains. Because they are not actually
buying goods, they cannot haggle for discounts on big ticket items.
The index does not capture special offers of the type common in
supermarkets, where big savings can be obtained by purchasing more than one
example of a specific item.
Moreover, the RPI cannot take any account of vouchers issued by
manufacturers to encourage the purchase of specific products. It can only
take account of increases in the size of a product for a given price when
these are lasting.
There are some serious implications for the government in this. For example,
recent assessments of high street activity may appear excessively gloomy
because trends in retail sales volumes are calculated by deflating the value
of total sales by selected components of the RPI.
However, it has to be said that the writers' assessment of the
over-recording of current inflation is no more than an estimate. The two
authors have backgrounds in market research rather than economics and
statistics.
Mr Waterson also makes clear that he believes there could be business
opportunities for market researchers in developing an alternative to the RPI
based on transacted prices.
On the other hand, the RPI probably deserves more examination than that
planned for the CSO's advisory committee, if only because some government
officials have also expressed doubts over whether the index is accurately
reflecting the real state of inflation.
German outlook
The retail prices index used to be a key factor determining British interest
rates. But since Britain became a member of the European exchange rate
mechanism in October 1990, German inflation has been more important.
This point was acknowledged by Mr Lamont in his Budget speech when he said
he expected to see reductions in European interest rates 'as the underlying
level of German inflation abates'.
But what is the outlook for German inflation? According to one leading
German bank economist, price developments in Germany will be 'on a roller
coaster' in the coming months, reflecting tax changes.
Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich, told
a meeting in London last week that inflation was likely to rise to about 4.5
per cent in April and May then fall to 3.5 per cent in July before
increasing again at the end of the year as a planned increase in value added
tax translates into a 0.5 percentage point rise in consumer prices.
These trends would not justify any further increase in German interest
rates. But cuts would be unlikely before mid-year and the subsequent
downward trend would 'probably be very slow'.
Looking further ahead, Mr Hufner's analysis contained both good and bad news
for the UK. The current slowdown in the German economy would be temporary
and the 1990s would be a period with strong growth of about 4 per cent a
year as supply side improvements boosted the German economy and it benefited
from German and European unification. That would be good for UK exporters.
On the other hand, high fiscal deficits meant that Germany's discount rate
was unlikely to fall below a range of 4 per cent to 5 per cent compared with
3 per cent or less in earlier cycles.
As Germany's discount rate is currently 8 per cent, that could suggest a
future floor of around 7 per cent for UK base rates in conditions of rough
price stability.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Enter the ghost of crises past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont is quite a young man, but last week he delivered an old
man's Budget. It revived old policies, being just a little bit Keynesian (in
appearance at least), though not enough to frighten the children. It ran
into an old constraint, the PSBR, and got an old-fashioned response in the
stock market. And it was haunted throughout by the ghosts of old-fashioned
crises - balance of payments crises and sterling crises - which were
supposed officially to have been laid; first when we floated sterling and
again, with a stake through the heart, when we joined the ERM.
You had not noticed these oddities? Then you are old fashioned, too, and
perhaps rightly so. If worries about government borrowing are not simply a
long-ago conditioned reflex, then they are revealing; they show that nobody
really believes that we have achieved the brave new European world, in spite
of the unshakeable commitment expressed on all sides; otherwise these
worries are not rational at all.
In one sense they are relatively new-fangled. There was a time when the PSBR
was simply a memorandum item for the gilts market. The economically
significant number is not the public sector borrowing requirement but the
financial deficit - the PSFD. This largely forgotten set of initials shows
how far the government is living within its means. It does not, that is to
say, treat asset sales as a substitute for thrift. On that test, Mr Lamont
is a good deal more improvident - or expansionary, if you believe that kind
of arithmetic - than he has admitted, but still not improvident enough to
revive the economy, let alone fears of inflation.
The PSBR, which simply forecasts government demands on the credit market,
became important (if ever it was) during the tragi-comedy of British
broad-definition monetarism. Any public borrowing which is not funded adds
to the broad money supply; QED. However, the attempt to control the broad
money supply was a fiasco and was formally abandoned some years ago. If we
were worrying about it still, as the Liverpool letter-writers do, we would
be concerned about the fact that it is growing far too slowly.
Here the PSBR is not a constraint but an opportunity; don't fund all the
borrowing, and money growth improves. Indeed, Professor Tim Congdon argues
that government spending which is fully funded has no effect on the economy
at all - and we are still working on a full-funding rule in this country, as
Mr Lamont reiterated. Funded borrowing should not, on the Congdon theory,
affect markets either.
That is debatable, but what is beyond question is that a rise in borrowing
which is simply the result of falling revenues cannot be a stimulus. It
means no more than that the government's spending, unlike that of the
private sector, is not trimmed to match short-term fluctuations in income.
If the markets believed Mr Lamont's claim that the budget is in medium-term
balance, they should shrug off this year's borrowing with barely a thought,
except for their faulty economic models.
What about another old-fashioned idea - crowding out? The theory is that
excessive government borrowing will force up the cost of private credit, and
cramp the economy. This hardly makes sense in 1992. There is too little
private credit demand, not too much. The collapse of commercial building
alone is likely to cut borrowing by about as much as government borrowing is
rising, as American Express has pointed out in an analysis. If we were still
operating in a closed British market, government bonds would be the only
good investment on offer in anything like an adequate quantity.
But of course we are not operating in a closed market, and have not been for
well over a decade. In the context of the world market, the British
requirement is entirely dwarfed by the really big borrowers, led by the US,
and the unexpected change in the PSBR, a matter of Pounds 4bn at most, is
not even noticeable.
So we come back to where we started. If you believe that Britain is a
committed member of the ERM, and committed to the present exchange rate,
then the Lamont Budget is a financial non-event, and all the ink spent on it
nothing more than an attempt to fill the space reserved for what was
expected to be a more interesting package. But what if you don't believe
these things, even though everybody says that they are so?
The man who gave voice to the unspoken worry which makes sense of the whole
thing is Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI, the
engineering group. Just before Mr Lamont made his speech, Mr Lewinton called
for a devaluation of sterling within the ERM. His aim, he said, was to
enable the government to cut interest rates.
The experience of other ERM members who have devalued suggests this would
not work; devaluation makes a currency more suspect, not less. Indeed, so
far as the markets believe that Mr Lewinton is speaking for other, though
more tactful, industrialists, his speech alone could help to keep rates
high. But the effect will be marginal, because the suspicion has always been
there.
It is in this context only that selling Pounds 3bn of new gilts (including
refunding) every month for the next three years could be a problem. It is
not insuperable; the US Treasury continues to borrow huge sums, the dollar
has a dreadful record and none of the predicted crises have actually
occurred. But don't expect British bond rates to come down much for a long
time yet.
And when that time does come, you may well see the problem defined away.
It's not just that we may have a Labour government, which believes in
productive public sector investment, and would like to exclude it from the
present definition of the public deficit. Such a move would have the
sanction of the EMU rules, which allow for 'excess' borrowing to finance
investment.
And then perhaps we could exorcise the ghosts whose rattling chains have
been unsettling the markets, and start to analyse the things which really
matter. The present rules suited past monetarists, and they suited Mrs
Thatcher, who wanted to ensure that only privatised utilities could plan
their investment outside Treasury constraints. But they never did make much
sense.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S white political leaders wound up their referendum campaigns
at the weekend amid forecasts of a closely contested outcome to the poll
that will shape the country's future.
President FW de Klerk, ending a tour of the country in the rightwing
strongholds of Nylstroom and Pietersburg, told audiences the only
alternative to continuing negotiations was violence and civil war. Dr
Andries Treurnicht, rightwing Conservative party leader, said white South
Africans would never accept rule by the African National Congress (ANC).
The government's initial confidence that it would obtain about 60 per cent
of votes in tomorrow's poll has been replaced by alarm at an apparent surge
in support for a 'no' vote.
Although this may be a tactic to encourage 'yes' support, it also reflects
genuine and growing concern that the depth of backing for the rightwing
alliance has been underestimated. Mr de Klerk's call for a 'landslide'
victory now looks optimistic. Senior government officials acknowledge
privately they would be relieved to get 55 per cent of votes.
But if the turnout among the 3.3m white voters is low, the right will insist
that the government has no mandate for the radical changes it has set in
train.
Violence continued to mar the campaign, with 12 people killed in
Johannesburg townships at the weekend. This brings to 250 the total killed
since the referendum was announced three weeks ago.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Nigeria criticised by World Bank: 'Inconsistencies' in
government accounts reinforce concern over corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S economic management 'lacks transparency and accountability',
according to an unpublished World Bank report which is likely to reinforce
concern about official corruption and set back the country's prospects for
rescheduling external debts of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.5bn).
The report, Public Expenditure Management, is based on a review conducted
early in 1991. It is under discussion with the military government of
President Ibrahim Babangida, who seized power in a palace coup in 1986.
It shows that the bank suspected the authorities of under-reporting oil
earnings in 1990, when prices were boosted by the Gulf war. The report says
the receipts were some Dollars 2bn higher than the bank had forecast.
However, says the report, 'attempts to account for the proceeds from oil
production in 1990 produced a shortfall of foreign exchange inflows
reflected in the official central bank cashflow of around Dollars 2.1bn, of
which only Dollars 0.6bn can be explained by the two continuing dedication
accounts' - special accounts for project and other expenditures.
A World Bank official would not say last week whether this and other
'inconsistencies' in government accounts had been resolved. Provisions for
external debt servicing might account for the discrepancy, but the bank
should have been informed of receipts set aside for that purpose. The
official described the report as an 'internal document' and would not
discuss it further.
The government has not responded to a request for comment. In June, it
maintained that all earnings could be accounted for, partly through
debt-service payments. It also deported the Financial Times Lagos
correspondent following his reports on the size and allocation of the
windfall.
Diplomats in Lagos said last week that full and accurate details of
government accounts had yet to emerge.
Pressure to spend the 1990 windfall led to a 'breakdown in fiscal and
monetary discipline', the report says. It calculates that government
spending 'outside the normal accounting and budgetary mechanism' in 1989 and
1990 exceeded the 1990 budget, excluding debt-servicing.
The calculation assumes that the 'inconsistencies' detected represent actual
expenditure. The report expresses concern about 'large scale' spending of
oil revenue 'outside the purview of statutory controls'.
It also criticises several government-backed projects, including a
controversial aluminium plant. In a barely veiled reference to corruption,
the report highlights 'a lack of transparency and accountability of big
spending decisions and the exclusion of many items of capital expenditure
from any rigorous project screening.'
The report goes on: 'Public expenditures are used more to distribute oil
riches and generate lucrative business and employment opportunities for
selected groups than to ensure efficient delivery of goods and services to
the public at large.'
The damage to the government's reputation as a result of the report may be
partly offset by this month's decision to float the naira, accompanied by a
renewed commitment to the 1986 reform programme. The devaluation answers the
report's concern that the now abolished multi-tier exchange system was open
to corruption.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Decision to reduce export credit insurance premium
praised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CAMPBELL E DUNFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The British Exporters Association welcomes the Trade Minister's
decision to reduce export credit insurance premiums for medium- and
long-term business under the Portfolio Management System to a more realistic
level ('Export insurance premiums cut by up to 50 per cent', March 10).
When the Portfolio Management System was introduced in early 1991, the
government hoped that other countries would raise their export credit agency
premiums to UK levels. That has not happened.
David Dodwell's article 'Putting risk reality back into export cover' (World
Trade News, February 4) makes the point that Italy is saying 'no' to the
Portfolio Management System unless the rest of the world follows.
As a result, while the Portfolio Management System relates risk to premium,
its uncompetitively high rates have adversely affected our ability to export
capital goods.
Other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries
appear to be winning contracts (and employment opportunities) in the UK's
traditional Third World markets.
The British Exporters Association hopes that the government's decision
heralds an ongoing review process which will cover not only premium rates
but also Portfolio Management System market capacity - that is, the amount
of cover available for individual countries.
Although some markets are highly price sensitive, the Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD) must be aware that others appear to be cover
sensitive.
A degree of flexibility by ECGD to relate its policy to market needs would
be welcomed by industry. The government's decision on premium rates is a
first step in the right direction.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Fax machines would cut queues at Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JAN R. HARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In an electronic age, it is preposterous for people to have to stand in
lines to have their passports checked on arrival at Heathrow.
All passports ought to be looked at by airline personnel on checking in,
with the information then faxed or otherwise transmitted to a central
processing facility.
That facility would fax back one of three messages: OK, No, or Verify.
All passengers with OK status would leave the aircraft in the UK and would
not need to have their passports checked at all.
Those passengers with a No response would be denied boarding.
Those passengers with a Verify response would be subject to special
examination on arrival.
This way of doing things would not increase check-in time, since it could be
absorbed into the current security procedure. It would greatly increase
speed on arrival.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Little 'Red Book' now needed for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important aspect of a British Budget is very often not the tax
measures announced by the chancellor, but a publication issued on the same
day known as Financial Statement and Budget Report - or more briefly as the
Red Book, because of the colour of its cover.
The publication originated in the obligation to give parliament information
about the government's own accounts and is, indeed, traditionally signed by
the financial secretary. But over the years, it has grown into the nearest
thing to a full-scale economic survey that the British Treasury publishes.
Apart from outline accounts for the whole public sector, it also contains
two other key chapters: one on the Medium Term Financial Strategy, and
another on short-term economic prospects. The Medium Term Financial Strategy
chapter focuses, rightly in my view, on the medium-term growth of the
national income in cash terms ('Nominal gross domestic product') and its
past and prospective division between inflation and real growth. The Red
Book is also a mine of information on matters such as the Treasury's view of
the growth of productive capacity, the development of the public-sector debt
ratio, as well as trends in the growth of money supply and velocity, and
much else.
The chapter on economic prospects is very useful, even to dyed-in-the-wool
sceptics about short-term economic forecasting, like myself. For the effort
to make a forecast forces Treasury economists to sketch a systematic and
coherent picture of the past and present: which is far from simple, as
economic statistics do not speak for themselves. Even in the rush of Budget
day, I mentally earmark many of the charts and tables for subsequent use in
Financial Times articles and longer pieces. The Red Book has the great
advantage over commercial forecasters that it is not under pressure to put
all the emphasis on simple forecasts and is able to treat history as
something other than bunk.
None of this is to pretend that the Red Book contains a boring,
cold-bloodedly impartial view of trends. Its purpose is to state government
macroeconomic policy more coherently than the House of Commons would ever
allow ministers to do. There must, of course, be some contributing
economists whose own economic outlook is very different, and who privately
sneer at people like me for taking the document seriously. Even they may
learn something in the process of compiling the material.
What is the 'but' to follow this encomium? It is that the main instrument
for macroeconomic management is nowadays monetary policy, which even without
full-scale European monetary union, is decided at a European level with the
Bundesbank calling the shots. The true UK Medium Term Strategy is now to try
to remain in the exchange rate mechanism at the present parity; and this
will remain so irrespective of the election result. So the Budget Red Book
has to rationalise policy decisions over which the British government has
little power, and to concentrate on a geographical area, that of the UK,
which is not the relevant unit for macroeconomic decisions.
What is clearly needed is a Red Book at the European level. Already, it is
more sensible to ask whether demand in money terms is rising too quickly or
too slowly in the core countries of the Community than it is in, say,
Britain or France taken alone. It is European and not just British Nominal
GDP that is relevant for European monetary policy.
For the moment, the Bundesbank may say that other countries make their own
choice in pegging their currencies to the D-Mark, and that it will continue
to make its decisions in relation to the German economy. But as other
countries begin to satisfy the Maastricht conditions for monetary union,
this approach will become less convincing; and once the immediate
unification hump is over, the Bundesbank will find itself having to take
into account the trends of the wider European economy and the views of other
central bankers.
Who then should publish the European Red Book? It would be death to entrust
this task to the Brussels Commission. The material would be out of date
before it was even printed. It would be disseminated in a series of phoney
leaks to Brussels correspondents, and not be made available conveniently and
on time to economic commentators. It would have to respect too many national
susceptibilities and political orthodoxy. Yet the Commission would not be
able to resist using the document to push the case for centralisation and
harmonisation.
The obvious body to publish the European Red Book is the European Monetary
Institute, to be established at the beginning of 1994, as a precursor to the
European Central Bank. But the Institute itself already exists in embryo in
the form of the EC Committee of Central Bankers, which avoids becoming
bogged down in the Brussels institutions by working very sensibly from the
Bank for International Settlements in Basle. The Committee already has a
small staff of economists, who are of a basically monetary orientation, but
who are healthily sceptical of the competing orthodoxies in the field. It
would be a very good exercise for them to start publishing a European Red
Book every quarter.
The authors would have to be very cautious to start with, embody the
financial targets of member governments and central banks, and try to put
them into a coherent framework. But, in time, they could develop a
perspective of their own, which will also govern their briefing of European
central bankers; so it would not be just pie in the sky.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: IBM seeks to clarify issue of counterfeit memory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R ROTTKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We refer to your article 'IBM deals blow to computer leasing'
(Employment, March 2), which contains information that may mislead your
readers.
The issue is one of counterfeit memory: IBM has discovered that memory
originally manufactured by IBM has been altered and refabricated by some
third parties and misrepresented as genuine IBM parts.
It is this misrepresentation that IBM wants to stop.
This unlawful practice is detrimental to IBM's product integrity and overall
reputation as a manufacturer.
Such refabricated parts are not covered by IBM's maintenance agreements;
non-genuine IBM parts never were.
So, contrary to what your article implied, IBM has not changed its policy:
IBM will continue to maintain re-configured products that contain genuine
IBM parts.
Furthermore, two additional pieces of information will be of interest to
your readers.
First, IBM did not change the price of its 128MB memory cards, as might be
concluded by some readers of the article.
Second, your article also mentioned legal action by IBM in the US.
Regrettably however, it did not mention that the court has issued an order,
based on an agreement between the parties, under which Comdisco, among other
obligations, is obliged properly to represent and to label any altered
memory and to disclose the fact that such memory is not eligible for IBM
maintenance.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Gas industry conflicts in prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN POWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The five-month gestation period of British Gas's agreement to comply
with the Office of Fair Trading report has illustrated the complexity of the
UK gas industry. It has also demonstrated the conflict between shareholder
and consumer interests which may arise following undertakings announced on
March 11.
For shareholders, there is an explicit threat to their dividend when British
Gas divests itself of 55 per cent of a market in which, last year, it made a
profit of Pounds 281m at a 12.1 per cent rate of return on assets.
The related but implicit threat to consumers is that British Gas will seek
to recover profits by raising the price of contract gas to industry and
commerce while saving costs in the price regulated domestic market by
lowering service standards to householders.
The notion that competition alone will keep industrial gas prices down is
wrong. While British Gas is compelled to publish a schedule of prices,
competitors will be happy to track the price of the dominant supplier and to
watch the average price drift upward to the advantage of North Sea producers
who have ownership and equity interest in much of the emergent competition.
As a first move, British Gas can be expected substantially to reduce the
availability of cheap interruptible gas which accounts for 50 per cent of
its contract market by volume but yields little profit. It will do this by
raising the price in the knowledge that, initially, the interruptible market
has little attraction to competitors. It will seek to replace the
load-balancing facility of the interruptible market by investment in more
storage assets within the 'gas transportation unit'. As the new unit will be
subject to a form of rate-of-return regulation, the increased asset base
will provide justification for higher transport costs to British Gas and to
its competitors. These will in turn feed through to higher prices and even
to the abandonment of postalised prices (standard ones, regardless of where
users are) in favour of regional differences related to the distance that
the gas travels from terminal to factory site.
Who will keep an eye on all this is uncertain and seems to depend on whether
the government will have time, before the election, to increase Ofgas's
powers over British Gas through the Competition and Service (Utilities)
Bill. From the consumers' point of view, better one regulator than several;
the simultaneous involvement of OFT, Ofgas, Department of Energy and DTI has
done little to speed this matter to a tidy conclusion.

FT  16 MAR 92 / The economic questions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THEY were to consider only their bank accounts, many FT readers would
quickly decide how to cast their ballots. Large numbers would, after all,
suffer from Labour's announced fiscal proposals. But there is more to life
than one's wealth. Many readers are, for example, concerned with how the
outcome might affect both the economy and their businesses. Yet identifying
what difference the election might make to either is not quite so simple as
a quick glance at our poll of business leaders today might appear to
suggest.
If, for example, voters examine monetary policies, they will find they can
have any they like, so long as it is the Bundesbank's. Even over the extent
of government borrowing, few differences stand out. In last week's Budget,
the Treasury forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of some 6 per
cent of gross domestic product, before privatisation receipts, over the next
two years. A Labour party wanting to borrow for investment is, therefore,
unlikely to get away with a larger fiscal deficit than Conservatives
committed to balancing the budget over the cycle.
It is on levels of taxation that likely differences emerge. If Labour is to
match the higher public expenditure it desires with 'prudent' borrowing and
no more extra taxation than already announced it must have a rapid economic
recovery. But, barring a large devaluation, Mr Smith would have no more
control over that than hapless Mr Lamont.
Fallible forecasts
The Treasury's latest forecast would console the shadow chancellor, had its
forecasts not proved so fallible. Average growth is put at just over 3 per
cent a year between 1991-92 and 1996-97, which is no faster than the
recovery from the last recession. But conditions then were more favourable.
What would happen if such a recovery were not to materialise? If Labour had
to choose between higher taxes and cuts in public provision, would it choose
the latter? If not, would the UK's advantage of a relatively low burden of
taxation by European standards disappear?
Yet it is over policy towards the supply side of the economy that
differences are most clear. Which of the potential governing parties is most
likely to ensure effective provision of public services? And which will get
right the balance between promotion and regulation of competition?
That the UK needs better education and training and more investment in
infrastructure, there can be little dispute. With public spending likely to
be tightly constrained, however, the question is how additional resources
are to be found. And which party can arrange the most effective delivery?
The Conservatives may have demoralised the providers of public services, but
Labour's pandering to producer groups might well throttle what limited
market pressure the government has managed to introduce.
French camp
For those concerned with the relation between the government and the market,
Brussels is the first port of call. It is via European Community decisions
on trade, competition, industrial and labour market policies that a British
government's influence on the domestic economy is increasingly channelled.
Where the Conservatives stand is known, but what of Labour? Will it fight
for a competitive and outward-looking EC, or will it join the French camp?
Even more broadly, can a party that has condemned almost every major
industrial change - from the downsizing of the steel industry in the early
1980s, to that of the coal industry in the early 1990s - abide by the
market's verdict? Can it, for example, turn its doubts about take-over fever
into anything more than a way of upholding the managerial status quo?
If the known weaknesses of the Conservatives and the obvious doubts about
Labour are too disturbing, the economically-concerned voter can always
choose the thoroughly European and market-oriented Liberal Democrats; that
is if he is prepared to vote for a third force rather than a potential
winner. But mostly, voters to whom these issues are of paramount concern
will want to scrutinise the rhetoric of Mr Kinnock's economics team.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Perestroika without glasnost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHO WAS right: Mikhail Gorbachev or Deng Xiaoping? On the face of it, recent
events in what used to be the two great bastions of doctrinaire
Marxism-Leninism appear to throw that question into stark relief. In the
former Soviet Union, the collapse of communism has been accompanied by
economic misery and social chaos. In parts of still-communist totalitarian
China, however, a form of capitalism is thriving, bringing with it an
economic boom and strongly improving living standards.
What is more, it seems that the ruling Politburo - encouraged by the
87-year-old Deng - is gearing up for another drive for economic reform.
Although the process is fragile and vulnerable to attack from party
hardliners, it is beginning to look as if China is again setting itself
unequivocally on the road to the market - and that it has just as much
chance of succeeding as has Russia in its own anarchic transformation.
In fact, contrary to conventional wisdom, China never really abandoned the
path of reform in the past three years - the repression of June 1989
notwithstanding. At the centre, to be sure, Tiananmen square did seem to
presage a pause in Beijing's opening to the outside world, and bring
hardliners to the fore, with their warnings against instability and cultural
contamination. But all the while, out in the fields and factories, private
economic activity continued to grow; foreign investment to flow in; and
exports to mushroom. In short, market reforms have shown astonishing
resilience - to the point where they may be declared to have developed their
own unstoppable momentum.
Reformers' initiative
Now the reformers have again seized the initiative. After months of
ideological struggle, the official press last week carried banner headlines
endorsing Deng's line in favour of foreign trade, investment and management
practices. The decks are evidently being cleared for the crucial 14th party
congress this autumn, which - if Deng and his acolytes have their way - will
set the seal on reform policies and usher in a new, somewhat younger
generation of party bosses to implement them.
Deciding the line, of course, is only part of the battle, and the challenges
facing the leadership are immense. For alongside China's rapidly growing
private and collectively-run businesses - concentrated mainly in the south -
is a collection of state-run industries in a state of near-collapse, with
losses and debts that are sucking the state coffers dry. The bureaucracy is
stultifyingly inefficient. Pricing signals are hopelessly confused, making
sensible management decisions virtually impossible.
Social dislocation
None of these problems will be resolved without great economic and social
dislocation. For example, the leadership has little chance of improving the
profitability of state industry without imposing job losses on a massive
scale. This may be politically infeasible, which is why the state has in
recent years relied on private sector activity and foreign capital as the
twin motors of prosperity.
People should not delude themselves that a further loosening of the economic
throttle will be followed by a relaxation of the party's ruthless political
grip. On the contrary, the lesson Deng drew from the overheating of the
economy which preceded Tiananmen is that economic reform necessitates the
maintenance of tight political control. The continuing strains that result -
caused by corruption and by growing inequalities between and within regions
 -are likely to reinforce that view in Beijing.
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the economic transformation now
under way will ultimately spark demands for greater political freedom, and
that the authorities will have to listen, just as they have been forced into
another wave of market reform to maintain the growth in living standards.
While remaining strong in their condemnation of human rights abuses, western
governments should seek to encourage such economic change in China. That
means keeping the import and investment channels open, not attaching
political conditions to trade concessions as the US Congress has been trying
to do.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Stark options: The referendum which will steer South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow, white South Africans will choose between danger and disaster, in a
referendum which will determine the fate of one of the world's most troubled
societies.
The choice - between a fragile peace and civil war, between apartheid
fantasies and the reality of a multi-racial future - has polarised the white
nation and drawn blacks into new conflict. It is the biggest political
choice white South Africa has faced, and many potential voters may avoid it
altogether. As for the rest, it is not yet certain that they will make the
choice urged on them by the international community, and by their brave
reformist president, Mr FW de Klerk.
Both sides - the ruling National party, which is asking for a 'yes' vote to
endorse negotiations with blacks, and the ultra-right Conservative party,
which wants 'no' voters to back its plans for modernising apartheid -
predict a close poll. The landslide triumph seen as crucial by Mr de Klerk
may not materialise.
Much could change before polls open in 24 hours' time. The anxiety of the
Nationalists could galvanise reluctant 'yes' voters into action; or,
conversely, the outside chance of victory for the Conservatives could give
the 'no' campaign new life. With the publication of opinion polls banned
during campaigning, neither side knows its true strength.
The Conservative party, with its allies the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB) and the Herstigte
Nasionale party (Reconstituted National party, HNP), has undoubtedly run a
more powerful campaign. That is scarcely surprising: the Conservatives have
found it easy to tap emotion and prejudice, fear and anger. Mr de Klerk has
sought the more difficult goal: to capture the soul of the white voter
through reason. It is not clear he has succeeded.
The Conservatives kept their message simple: vote 'no', and stop the advance
of communism in the form of the African National Congress (ANC), with its
close ally the South African Communist party (SACP). The Nationalists ran a
wordy and unimaginative campaign.
Repeatedly, Mr de Klerk called on voters to resign themselves to the
inevitable: that a huge majority of blacks cannot forever be governed by a
small white elite. He experimented with visionary rhetoric, promising a
grand and beautiful multi-racial future; but his efforts fell flat with
audiences far more worried than inspired by change.
After all, Mr de Klerk's ideal is not the integration of South Africa's
peoples into one colour-blind nation; it is to create a balance of power
between racial groups which will eliminate conflict while preserving
cultural differences. The ANC wants a melting pot; Mr de Klerk prefers a
rainbow.
Most South Africans, barring a small minority of liberal whites, have a
similar vision. They know white domination must end, and will vote for the
party which strikes the best bargain for white interests.
Mr de Klerk has promised to prevent black domination, by insisting on
traditional liberal protections and enforced coalition government. The
Conservatives preach a neo-apartheid vision of racial separation which they
defend as Afrikaner nationalism, and which Mr de Klerk condemns as
neo-fascist. Tomorrow's vote will tell whether whites believe Mr de Klerk's
vow to share power without abandoning it, or Mr Treurnicht's promise of
security in separation.
Unless the result is clearly a landslide, disputes will inevitably arise
over the strength of Mr de Klerk's mandate: if turnout is low, a 55 per cent
majority will do little to support his claim to negotiate for white South
Africa.
But if a large majority (say, 60 per cent) votes 'yes' to a 'continuation of
the reform process . . . aimed at a new constitution through negotiation'
(the essence of the wordy referendum question), blacks will come to power in
an interim government within months. Parties to the multi-racial negotiating
forum, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), will have had
a serious fright at the prospect of right-wing victory; they will rush in a
multi-racial interim government which would be less vulnerable than the
Nationalists on their own.
The outlines of such a deal have been sketched in during bilateral talks
between the ANC and the government - the only two parties whose agreement is
truly essential. An interim executive could be appointed by Codesa as early
as June, with multi-party committees to oversee the security forces, local
government, the budget and foreign affairs, as well as independent
commissions to control the media and multi-party elections.
Within a year from then, elections would be held to a unicameral legislature
which would both replace the current parliament and draw up a new
constitution. This represents a major concession from the Nationalists, who
have always insisted on a second chamber, a sort of 'house of minorities',
to protect whites. Such a legislature would meet the ANC's main demand: that
an elected constituent assembly draw up a post-apartheid constitution, with
decisions taken by two-thirds majority.
This body would sit for about a year - not the 10 years originally demanded
by the government - until elections were held under a new constitution which
would enforce power-sharing for a further five years. The new parliament
would be bicameral, with disproportionately large representation for
minority political parties by region. And crucially, many powers would be
devolved from central government to the regions. For this is the key to the
National Party's plan for preventing black domination; government officials
believe they have ANC agreement to maximum devolution.
Details of this plan could change - especially if a big 'yes' vote inspires
Mr de Klerk to take a tougher line - but an interim government should be put
swiftly in place. At least as importantly, a clear 'yes' majority could
provoke the Conservative party to split, with a large chunk entering talks
on a more moderate platform. The risk is that the radical rump of the party
 -along with the paramilitary AWB - would turn increasingly violent once
legal forms of opposition had failed. The result could be a smaller but more
radicalised right, creating havoc as a spoiling force.
The consequences of a slim 'yes' majority, perhaps with a low turnout, are
more difficult to predict. Mr de Klerk will have been denied the clear moral
and political victory he sought, and negotiations could lose momentum. Here,
the role of the security forces could become crucial: for while the largely
conscript army has no tradition of taking power, the generals might find
their tenuous commitment to political reform weakened, and drag their feet
over Codesa. Negotiations would continue, but with less speed.
The prospect of a 'no' vote provokes apocalyptic visions from most
commentators. Mr de Klerk, the great hope of South African democrats, would
resign; his government would lose a general election fought within electoral
boundaries which give heavy weight to conservative rural areas; inevitable
black protest would provoke security force repression; and the west would
impose further sanctions.
None of this would happen overnight, and the behaviour of the Conservatives
 -who claim to be willing to enter negotiations with blacks to create a
confederation of racially-based states - would also be important. But
Conservative policy is irredeemably racist, and it is hard to see room for
accommodation with the ANC, which would be forced to resume a campaign to
overthrow the government. Civil war would ensue; and though South Africa
probably does not have the potential for conflict of Lebanon or Yugoslavia,
many would die - far more blacks than whites, as always in South Africa.
Whatever the referendum outcome, 1m or more whites will have voted to reject
a multi-racial South Africa; they will not disappear with the polling
booths. It is hard to imagine a lasting solution without them; and they are
unlikely to compromise unless heavily beaten in the referendum.
For it could prove dangerous to force artificial political unity on a
country which has for so long clung to diversity. 'It is not possible to
subject a nation forever,' argues Prof Carel Boshoff, an Afrikaner
theologian who is the respectable face of the right. 'There will always be a
struggle for self-expression, even if it takes 50 years.' And unless this
struggle can be brought to the negotiating table, it will destabilise South
Africa for years to come.

<TEXT>
Travel around west Germany and you will find plenty of people who wish the
wall between the two Germanies had never come down. This not simply because
they, like everyone else, object to paying higher taxes to finance
reunification. The reason is that they have just had their car stolen.
The wall's removal has apparently led to a massive increase in car theft in
the west of Germany. According to Allianz, the Munich-based insurance
company, organised gangs are behind a 50 per cent increase in stolen cars
last year.
Most of the cars go to eastern Europe and the recovery rate is extremely
low. Allianz says that as many as 60,000 stolen vehicles were shipped out
from Germany to Poland alone last year, of which only 1,700 were recovered
by the police.
The cars are stolen to order and can be delivered within 24 hours, the
insurance company recounts. It seems that the clients are discerning: most
of the stolen cars are large luxury BMWs and Mercedes and nobody is
bothering to steal the Trabants which still clutter East Germany's roads.

They are four of the first five names listed in a directory of British
Studies Societies in Japan, compiled by the British Council. The second on
the list, which would have given the game away, is the Agatha Christie Fan
Club of Japan.
The 113 societies' interests also include Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell,
the Brontes, Browning, Chaucer, D H Lawrence and so on down to Yeats - who
might be counted as British for at least the earlier part of his life.
According to Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Centre for
International Exchange, the list shows Japanese intellectuals' awareness of
Britain's literary and artistic heritage. By contrast, he told the UK-Japan
2000 Group's latest meeting, 'there are very few scholars or experts in
Japan well versed in the current political dynamics of the UK or its policy
process'.
The group hopes to put that right by promoting educational exchanges between
the two countries. When its members met Prime Minister Major, however, his
special concern seemed to be to spread knowledge of cricket - and not only
to the East. Thanks to the Japan Festival, he said, there were now thousands
of British schoolchildren who knew more about sumo wrestling than about
their own national summer game.

Meanwhile the final days of South Africa's referendum campaign are
attracting some unexpected pieces of free advice from outside. Take for
example the letter, published in Johannesburg's biggest evening paper The
Star, from Tony O'Reilly, the Irish president of Heinz.
In it, he offered South Africans the wisdom of the poet W B Yeats,
originally voiced in 1924 after the bitter civil war which followed the
British withdrawal from Southern Ireland in 1921: 'The Irish won but then
again they lost, because they never made friends with themselves.'
O'Reilly followed those words with his hope that 'you make friends with
yourselves.' Then he added that Heinz had an 'especial' desire to invest in
the new South Africa, 'one of the most wonderful countries on the face of
this Earth.'

Britons were made to look thoroughly second-rate Euro-citizens by reports
that, whereas the UK's Stationery Office won't even be selling the 350-page
Maastricht treaty on European Union until after the election, the Danish
government is freely distributing 300,000 copies of the full text.
But it turns out that the Danes are nowhere near such Euro-goodies as the
reports implied. The reason for the printing marathon is not popular
interest in the treaty, but that a referendum on it will be held on it on
June 2, and the result will be binding on the legislature.
Current signs are that the supply of the copies, one for every nine
households, is doing more good for opponents of Maastricht than for
supporters including five of the eight parties represented in Denmark's
parliament, the Folketing.
Even a glance at the text, written in lawyerese, is enough to turn off the
Dane-in-the-street. 'All it means is more power to Brussels, and I'm not
going to vote for that' is the typical answer to opinion polls.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Bad news for Britain: A hung parliament would be the worst
outcome of the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a fashionable idea around in Britain that a hung parliament will
somehow be good for us. It is often coupled with the view that
constitutional reform is an elixir for future British achievement. Let
parliament be hung, and reform will follow.
Such thinking is romantic escapism. In the first place, a hung parliament -
by definition - would give a disproportionate role to MPs from Northern
Ireland. There will continue to be 17 of them, whatever happens to voting
patterns elsewhere. They have one characteristic in common: their primary
interest is in Northern Ireland. Thus, their votes on other matters will be
up for grabs, according to what they can get out of it for their own region.
Far more important than that, constitutional reform is perhaps the one
subject on which all MPs - perhaps with some justification - regard
themselves as experts. Indeed, there is by now a well-documented paradox:
the only way to achieve constitutional reform in Britain is through
parliament, yet parliament is incapable of delivering.
In the late 1960s, the House of Commons spent two years debating the reform
of the House of Lords. It failed because of a cross-party alliance of
maverick MPs. In the late 1970s, it spent more than two years debating
devolution for Scotland and Wales.
Again, it failed to deliver satisfactorily because back-bench MPs could
stick down any amendments they liked. The final legislation took not only an
absurd amount of time; it failed to meet the original objective of giving a
measure of devolution to the Scots.
Just over 10 years later, the question is back on the agenda as though the
earlier debates had never been.
Today a central issue is said to be proportional representation. Let us
leave aside the merits of the argument as such, and concentrate on the
practicalities. PR is a very complicated subject: it comes in many forms.
Ask parliament to legislate for it, and almost every MP will have a
different view. If they do not have views at the start, they will find it
necessary to invent them, for constitutional reform is a game for which you
make the rules as you go along. Anyone can play, especially MPs.
There is another game much played in Britain. It consists of inventing new
reasons every few years to explain the country's relatively poor performance
compared to that of other European countries. It used to be the stagnant
society - the lack of harmony between the two sides of industry. Then it was
the failure to enter Europe at the proper time. After that, it was calls for
more science-based industry and picking winners. The search for a social
contract was followed by the crusade to curb the power of the trade unions.
All of those rationalisations had an element of truth: without an attempt to
act on them, we might be even worse off than we are today. Demands for
constitutional reform, however, contain an element of intellectual luxury.
As it happens, we are being constitutionally reformed by the week, simply by
our membership of the European Community. Yet few people stopped to read the
Treaty of Rome and all its subsequent developments. Instead, there is a fond
idea that by tinkering with - or even root-and-branching - our own system,
we may be able better to compete.
There is no overwhelming evidence that I know of that our failings lie in
our constitution, or lack of it. In England we have what amounts to a 2 1/2
party system. The function of the third or half party is occasionally to
deliver the two bigger parties a kick in the pants: for instance, by winning
seats in by-elections, coming up with a more attractive leader and even the
odd idea. Yet I have never come across an idea in the Liberal party, the old
Alliance or the Liberal Democrats that could not have been found somewhere
in one or other, and sometimes both, of the two big parties. Labour and the
Tories are already coalitions: we do not need any more.
Lest I appear reactionary, I should add that there are some constitutional
reforms that I would welcome. One would be fixed-term parliaments; not
because this would reduce the possibility of governments' seeking to bribe
the electorate before the election.
They could still do that, but they would be unable to play silly
guessing-games about election timing. At least one British government that
deserved to stay in office threw power away by going to the country at the
wrong time. That was Mr Heath's in 1974. Mr Major may have done the same by
waiting too long.
Two other reforms are a smaller parliament and less legislation, but you
will not get either out of a parliament that is hung. If it comes, you will
be bored by it well before the game is over.
And if you want a different electoral system, look at the French, who will
be voting next Sunday. Their system of 'first-past-two-posts' was much
favoured by that old Tory leader, Lord Home. He was also not averse to
Scottish devolution. Reform is a slow process.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Anna Karenina - Tricycle Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tolstoy dabbled in writing drama but he is not best remembered for plays.
Even partial adaptations of his novels have been more successful than his
plays. At the Tricycle, it is not 'the vasty fields of France' but the cool
plains of Russia which Helen Edmundson (adaption) and Nancy Meckler
(direction) cram into a black box in their compelling version of Anna
Karenina for the Shared Experience company.
At over three hours, the play still romps through the Russian countryside
and blazes through Tolstoy's plot. Anna leaves a barren marriage to live
with her lover; but society shuns them and her world disintegrates. Her
story then interweaves with that of Levin and Kitty, building an ideal rural
life outside the Moscow-Petersburg axis. Others have done Tolstoy faster -
David O. Selznick's 1935 version was a shameless 95 minutes, mostly devoted
to Greta Garbo - but the essentials are here.
The Tricycle trick is to make Anna (Annabelle Apsion) and Levin (Richard
Hope) into player-narrators of their own interlinked stories. They are
always on stage, commenting or describing: Anna says 'You are Konstantin
Levin, why are you here? This is my story' and Levin replies 'It seems it's
mine too'. The staging places city against country, Anna's despair against
Levin's hope: in one scene, Anna breaks with her husband (Gregory Floy) and
Levin proposes to Kitty (Pooky Quesnel), while the rest of the cast party in
the background - this is like good opera, where several things happen
simultaneously.
The eight actors generate intense energy in a minimal set; and the simple
creative lighting (Ace McCarron) makes one wish more directors and designers
could be this bold. The only design motifs are pairs of railway lines, like
a metaphysical conceit from Marvell: infinite but never meeting and
travelling but never arriving. It seems apt that Tolstoy died in a railway
waiting room.

achieving fusion via miniature versions of the H-bomb.
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) investigates the evidence used to convict three
leading members of the Black Panthers and suggests that they were victims of
a conspiracy between the FBI and the police. Somehow it all sounds eerily

FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Orfeo - Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Orfeo that David Freeman directed for English National Opera in 1981 was
his first substantial achievement in this country. The London branch of his
Opera Factory was yet to get underway, and the ideas and approach to music
theatre which Freeman put into into practice in his staging of Monteverdi's
favola per musica must have seemed far less familiar then than they do now.
Yet it emerges once again as a fascinating, penetrating piece of drama, a
wonderfully imaginative and moving solution to the problems of presenting
the first of all operatic masterpieces.
In a programme note he describes Orfeo as 'not the work of professional
opera writers: rather the response of two friends (Monteverdi and Alessandro
Striggio) to the various attempts at recreating Greek drama which had taken
place in the preceding ten years'. It is this mysterious mixture of theatre,
religious ceremony and musical lyricism that is captured so well here. In
the opening and closing acts the threads of a communal celebration are woven
together with the bundle of myths out of which the story of Orfeo's tragedy
gradually takes shape; in the third and fourth acts, on the banks of the
river Styx and the Underworld itself, the action focuses down from the
community to the individual, and in the nightmare world of Orfeo's
imagination the drama passes over from ritual to fully-fledged opera. It's
almost as if it is necessary for Orfeo's great aria 'Possente spirto' in Act
3 to open up that new world of musical feeling.
With sets confined to some scattered boulders and patterned hangings, the
sense of place is deliberately under-emphasised. The singers themselves
create the atmosphere, provide all the context for the unfolding of the
story. Freeman is served splendidly by his cast, which has Antony
Rolfe-Johnson's Orfeo as its focus, singing with unfailing elegance and
intensity, and managing even the most elaborate decoration of his arias with
an ease that never neglects the expressive weight of every phrase.
Elsewhere there are few weaknesses and many stylish strengths. The
intelligence and lucidity of all the singing (in Anne Ridler's English
translation) are characterised right at the start in the prologue by
Jennifer Smith's rapt delivery of Music's invocation, and later encompasses
especially Margaret Preece's Nymph, Sally Burgess's Messenger (wonderfully
moving in her aria to Orfeo), Therese Feighan's Hope, and Marie Angel's
distinctive, seductive Euridice. Christopher Robson leads the Shepherds with
verve and rounds out every one of his phrases with eloquence.
The performance is directed by Harry Bicket. At times the instrumental
playing seemed less characterful than it could be, though the Coliseum is an
enormous space in which to make 17th-century instruments tell expressively.
And there is never anything which detracts from this profoundly revealing
staging, one which gets closer to the essence of Orfeo than any more gilded,
elaborate presentation seems ever likely to approach.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vocem is a keen music-theatre ensemble, much concerned with electronics,
educational work and 'community' projects. On Saturday they appeared on the
South Bank with electronics for Vic Hoyland's new In Pursuit of a Dream, and
with the Endymion Ensemble and a few props for Judith Weir's version of
Scipio's Dream - billed as a little known 'opera' by 'the 14-year-old
Mozart'. In fact Il sogno di Scipione was a 'serenata drammatica'
commissioned for the inauguration of the new Archbishop of Salzburg in 1772,
when Mozart was already 16, but never mind; it made an engaging start for
the evening.
It would have made a still better ending, as originally announced, for it is
half the length of the Hoyland piece and palpably richer in music. He and
his bright cast proved that this pretty jeu d'esprit can work with no visual
tricks more modern than a dance hall mirror-ball.
Miss Weir's alterations to Scipione are limited and precise. The original
scenario was the lofty sort of 'morality' that was standard for celebrating
accessions to high places, royal or ecclesiastical: noble Scipio is divinely
wooed both by Fortuna and by Constanza, and with guidance from a noble
ancestor chooses the right one (the latter, of course). In Weir's wry, pawky
English text he becomes an impressionable City chap of the 1990s, but
mutatis mutandis the dream-vision remains the same. The Weir orchestra is
updated to match, not only by electric guitar and keyboards to back her
string trio and four winds, but with a huge, dominating part for
mock-celestial harp.
In that role Hugh Webb was indomitable - it must be more taxing than
Mozart's own Concerto for harp and flute - and his sure-fingered rhythm
invaluable. Gwion Thomas sang 'Mr Scipio' in ringing style, and with cool
comic flair: he is a performer of noteworthy potential. The pleading soprano
goddesses were Frances Lynch and Josephine McNally, both of them alert and
characterful, and Andrew Gallacher's bass 'Grandfather' wielded more
gravitas than his casual pitch really earned.
He was more exactly sonorous as Oberon in Hoyland's piece, which is a
thin-blooded extract from A Midsummer Night's Dream (no Athenian court, no
mechanicals) with cosy intermittent warbling by the surviving characters.
Even if the music hadn't expressly cited 'I know a bank . . .' from
Britten's Dream, it would recall Britten's sound-world for most
music-lovers: white-note harmony with a few modal twists, soft whole-tone
clashes between voices.
Unlike Britten, Hoyland offers little more than that - and his score is
further diluted by long spoken stretches: half unintelligible if you don't
know the play well, irritatingly truncated and denuded of context if you do.
Besides most of the singers already mentioned, Philip Creasy, Phillip
Casperd and Teresa Shaw sang and declaimed to excellent purpose. The net
effect of In Pursuit of a Dream was nonetheless dramatically slim, and
musically too bland and inoffensive to stamp a character of its own upon the
shrunken Shakespeare text.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Ernani - New Theatre, Cardiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The point is not lost when one happens to catch Ernani on the day that a
general election is called. Like some other Verdi operas, this one involves
itself with a period when absolute rulers were in power and the populace
waited upon the whim of one individual to see whether that power would be
dispensed for good or ill.
In the case of Ernani the outcome hangs in the balance and it is only
towards the end that Don Carlo, having secured his position in what one
imagines to have been a fairly ruthless fashion, turns to magnanimity and
forgives his enemies. No doubt some parallel with contemporary politics
could be found. The strength of Elijah Moshinsky's production is that it
generally leaves making perceptions of that nature to the audience's
imagination.
It was as long ago as 1979 that this Ernani was originally put on by Welsh
National Opera. At the time the company was riding high on a tide of
adventurous programming, of which this early Verdi opera played a part, and
it seems appropriate that it should be coming back into the repertoire now
alongside the highly-acclaimed new Pelleas et Melisande.
It was a handsome production to look at then, and still is now. The dark
vision of a 16th-century Spain, dominated by grim men of the sword and
strict household formalities, has aged extremely well. The chorus, always a
strong element in WNO performances, is used to forceful effect and Richard
Armstrong conducted with the sturdy feeling for Verdi's dramatic pulse that
always marked his work for the company. One regrets only the decision to
trim the score by omitting second verses of some arias and cabalettas.
If the opera still did not wield a sharp enough cutting edge in this
performance, there are a couple of main reasons. One is that the Italian
text was rarely delivered with any clarity. All the singers were offenders
in that respect and Suzanne Murphy's Elvira in particular, no matter how
easily her beautiful soprano sails out in this music, even in the most
awkward passages of coloratura.
The other is that the characters were never quite projected with the sort of
elemental force that these early Verdi dramatic prototypes require. The most
successful at generating sparks of electricity off each other were Malcolm
Donnelly as Don Carlo and Alastair Miles as Silva. Both had the measure of
their roles in a theatre of this size (not so different from the Teatro la
Fenice in Venice, where Ernani had its premiere), although Donnelly ideally
lacks vocal grace as a singer of early Verdi.
In the role of Ernani himself Paolo Kudriavchenko equally preferred
generalised force of vocal delivery to niceties of phrasing. One suspects
that it is with this character, the outsider and potential revolutionary who
turns to the populace for his support, that Verdi instinctively felt his own
sympathies to lie and so the role is an important one. Unfortunately
Kudriavchenko's lacklustre showing in it would not easily win my vote.

How do you go about introducing concepts such as productivity, marketing and
incentive in chronically inefficient industries within a centrally planned
economy?
China's state-owned industry is hugely overmanned, churns out products
regardless of whether there is a market, and is enmeshed in bureaucracy. It
is one thing for the communist government in Beijing to say that it is bent
on economic reform, but quite another to implement change in the factories.
This should be fertile ground for management consultants - but only those
willing to put up with frustrations to earn their fee. One now learning the
ropes is Knight Wendling, which is Swiss-based but part of the Lester B
Knight &amp; Associates group of Chicago.
Knight Wendling won a two-year contract, supported by a World Bank loan, to
help restructure Shanghai's electronic components and scientific instruments
sectors. Since last November, it has had a team operating there under the
direction of Robert Mackenzie, who is based in London but travels to China
frequently.
The industries provide life-time employment. Sales and marketing were
unknown since their entire output was handed over to the state, which dealt
with any exports.
Plants typically ordered stock requirements for the year ahead. The concept
of competition was also unknown, though poor planning has in recent years
led to products competing with those of other Chinese factories.
There was little co-operation between plants, so that one factory had a
modern sheet metal press operating only four or five hours a day while its
neighbours within the same corporation either sought to make do with
inferior technology, or bought in their needs from outside.
A number of levels of bureaucracy - the factory management itself, the
corporation of which it is a part, the Shanghai bureau which oversees the
industry, and the Shanghai municipal authorities - have been free to
interfere in the operation of plants.
Knight Wendling's task is to help the Chinese to correct all of this and
more in factories producing a wide range of products, some of which  - like
microscopes and camera lenses - are of good quality and have a reasonable
potential market, and some of which do not.
It is working with the Shanghai bureaucracy to establish a simpler
organisational structure and chain of responsibility. But it must always
ensure that structural changes are understood at every level. Within the
plants, Knight Wendling has to accept that employees cannot simply be made
redundant, even though the factories already employ thousands where hundreds
would do, and upgrading of technology would reduce the required workforce
further.
Part of its approach is to designate a model factory and, within it, a model
cell. In them, it attempts to demonstrate best practice and to set proper
manning levels, so that financial results of model units can be produced
without accounting for unnecessary employees, even though the results for
whole plants will still reflect them. A key element is the attempt to
introduce incentives, another unknown concept.
Every small step requires a round of meetings, which tend to be attended by
many officials. 'One-on-one meetings are virtually impossible,' says
Mackenzie. This can make it difficult to get over ideas about management and
responsibility. However, workshops are organised to develop management
skills and Mackenzie says some managers have real potential.

RESULTS DUE
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services conglomerate, is expected
to report a 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to about Pounds
1.05bn on Wednesday.
Eagle Star, its insurance subsidiary, is still suffering from heavy losses
on its domestic mortgage indemnity business. Analysts will be interested to
hear how higher premiums are affecting other underwriting business - for
motors, buildings and house contents. However, the final dividend should
benefit from the strength of the tobacco business, which is enjoying
increasing market share in the US and higher prices in Brazil.
Guinness will produce another creditable set of figures on Thursday.
Forecasts of pre-tax profits for 1991 range from Pounds 947m-Pounds 970m,
the top end representing 15 per cent growth in the year. The rate has
slowed, though, from 23 per cent in 1990 and 33 per cent in 1989.
Shareholders will be rewarded with a dividend increase of about 12 per cent
on last year's total of 9.7p.
WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, is likely to unveil today
a halving of pre-tax profits for 1991 to about Pounds 45m. Revenues are
likely to be down slightly to Pounds 1.26bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Staff levels
have been trimmed by 8 per cent during the year.
WPP is believed to have been seeking additional financing of some Pounds
100m from its bankers, who are interested in seeing some disposals,
particularly of the US agency Scali McCabe Sloves.
Guardian Royal Exchange on Thursday will follow the loss-making trend of the
insurance sector. Forecasts range up to Pounds 250m for 1991 compared with a
year-earlier loss of Pounds 157m. Some analysts believe it will maintain its
11.9p total dividend for the year but that cannot be taken for granted after
Royal Insurance's decision to omit its final.
Wimpey is expected to turn in tomorrow a loss for the year ended December of
around Pounds 20m against pre-tax profits of Pounds 43.3m a year earlier.
The final dividend is likely to be cut to make a total for the year of 8p
(10.5p).
Against the backdrop of the deep construction industry recession, Wimpey
will take a Pounds 12m provision on its Channel Tunnel involvement plus
write-downs on land and property.
Although Delta, the electrical cables and engineering group, has a
reputation for limiting the damage of recession, pre-tax profit in 1991 is
expected today to be nearly 30 per cent down at between Pounds 60m and
Pounds 65m .
It has not been able to buck the UK trend, although its cashflow performance
is thought to have been strong. Growth in the group's spirits businesses
will have run at about 11 per cent last year (15 per cent in 1990). Beer
will have been more impressive, thanks mostly to Guinnesses Spanish
acquisitions.
One intriguing question is likely to be settled this week. Has Warren
Buffett, the legendary US investor, built up a Guinness stake of a few
percentage points?
Each point is worth about Pounds 100m. US and UK market watchers believe he
has and expect confirmation in the annual report of Berkshire Hathaway, his
main corporate vehicle.
Such an investment would be highly uncharacteristic. He has never bought a
foreign stock before, believing he should stick to the US stocks he knows
inside out. But on the other hand, he is attracted to companies with strong
brands and cashflow such as Coca-Cola.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Appointments: First among rivals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hagan, former founder and managing director of Tullet &amp; Tokyo
Equities, is taking a non-executive seat on the board of his old rivals
First Equity, another equity interdealer broker, after 'falling out' with
Tullets a year ago.
'Tullets was immensely successful and this in itself can lead to stresses
and strains,' says Hagan who, since he left, has been working on a lengthy
but abortive attempt to buy money brokers Exco from the British &amp;
Commonwealth administrators.
Now the offer for Exco - an Pounds 85m bid backed by Electra and the fund
management arm of Phoenix Securities which would have put Hagan in as Exco
chief executive - has been declined and he is looking around for other
opportunities. 'At 45 I am not quite old enough to embark on a career as a
non-executive director.'
He calls First Equity, which was set up in February 1987 five days before
the equity inter-dealing broking arm of Tullets, 'a very impressive little
outfit. They faced pretty mighty opposition, including from me, at the
beginning. But there is now no clear market leader.'
He was also attracted by the company's 'interesting institutional
shareholders' - which happen to include Electra.
Paul Henry, joint managing director of First Equity, says of his old rival's
appointment: 'Attitudes have matured a lot. We have a healthy respect for
one another now.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Appointments: BAe plays its Gulf card
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is strengthening its firepower in its battles with the
Ministry of Defence by securing the services of Air Chief Marshal Sir
Patrick Hine, the overall commander of British forces in last year's war
against Iraq.
Faced with cutbacks in military orders and increased competition, the
company is playing its Gulf card - the goodwill gained through the role its
products and support personnel played in the campaign - for all it is worth.
'Paddy' Hine, who ran the UK command bunker at High Wycombe, retired from
his post at RAF Strike Command in August. He actually began work at BAe's
Strand headquarters in January, but his appointment as military adviser has
only now been made public. He succeeds another Air Chief Marshal, Sir David
Evans, who retires at the end of the month.
He is one of the few Gulf commanders not writing a book about the war - that
is, he says, not while he is working for BAe. The book he is thinking of
would be critical of some aspects of the handling of the campaign. Since the
MoD is BAe's chief customer, he believes 'it is better left for the time
being'. He sees his job principally as helping BAe deal with the ministry,
using his experience of how it works and thinks. At 59, he foresees four to
six years at most in the job. 'It depends if my face fits,' he says.
*****
Coutts &amp; Co, NatWest's upmarket private banking business, continues to
reshuffle its senior management team. Jack Willson, aged 56, has become
senior manager of Coutt's city office at 15 Lombard Street. He joined Coutts
in 1952 and has spent the past 14 years managing one of its branches in the
Strand. He replaces Christopher Rashbrook, aged 53, who is retiring after 36
years with the bank.
*****
J HENRY SCHRODER WAGG &amp; CO has increased its tally of directors to 67 by
appointing Rupert Birch, Sriram Chari, Peter Hennessey, Arnaud Limal and The
Hon Nicholas Smith. Clive Boothman and Peter Wolton are to be directors of
Schroder Investment Management. Elizabeth Goldhill is appointed first
vice-president of Schroder Capital Management International Inc and Ltd.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Slaughters tops league table of profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLAUGHTER and May, the City solicitors, has emerged as the UK's most
profitable law firm last year according to a league table of earnings
published by the magazine Legal Business.
Slaughter and May had average net profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 on a
turnover of Pounds 113m and profits per fee earner (lawyer) of Pounds
65,000. The firm has 542 fee earners.
Its nearest rival was Linklaters &amp; Paines with profits per partner of Pounds
349,000 on a turnover of Pounds 144m and profits per fee earner of Pounds
69,000. Linklaters has 692 lawyers.
The UK's largest law firm, Clifford Chance, not surprisingly had the biggest
turnover of Pounds 232m. With more than 200 partners and 1,122 fee earners
its profits per partner were Pounds 278,000.
Most of the top 10 most profitable firms had gross fee revenues of about
Pounds 1m per partner, according to the legal business statistics.
The magazine says it has had the co-operation of partners in the vast
majority of firms in compiling its figures, although there was a 'handful'
of firms for which it made 'informed guesses'.
None of the firms included in the league table would admit yesterday to
having co-operated with the magazine. Categorical denials of co-operation
were given by Slaughter and May, Freshfields, Lovell White Durrant, Allen &amp;
Overy, Linklaters &amp; Paines and Clifford Chance. No firm was prepared to
comment on the accuracy of the figures, however.
The magazine stresses that profits per partner did not represent take-home
pay. There are a few senior partners in London firms who earn more than
Pounds 1m a year but in general earnings for partners in the top firms range
from about Pounds 200,000 a year for junior partners to Pounds 500,000 for
senior partners, it says.
Most large law firms operate a 'lockstep system' which means their earnings
are capped after a certain number of years in the partnership. Also, in many
firms partners are expected to plough back some of their 'draw' to provide
working capital.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Mystery surrounds helicopter death crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELEVEN men are believed to have died when a helicopter crashed in a North
Sea blizzard, on what should have been a two-minute trip from a Shell oil
platform to an accommodation vessel 200 yards away.
There were six survivors of Saturday evening's accident, the cause of which
was still a mystery yesterday.
A specialist diving ship yesterday arrived at the Cormorant Alpha platform,
100 miles north-east of Shetland. It will attempt to locate and salvage the
wreckage of the Super Puma helicopter, made by Aerospatiale of France.
Six bodies had been recovered last night and there was no hope of finding
any of the five missing men alive.
The helicopter's operator, Bristow, said it had no immediate evidence of
technical failure. 'The aircraft has an outstanding safety record so far,'
it said.
The intensive use of helicopters in the North Sea has led to several fatal
accidents over the past 10 years. Most serious was the crash of a Boeing
Chinook in 1986, which killed 45 men.
Although the weather on Saturday night was poor - with the wind gusting at
up to 60mph in snow squalls - Shell said the helicopter flight was within
safety guidelines.
Mr Frank Doran, Labour's oil industry spokesman, said: 'Despite the fact
that pilots are trained to fly in extreme conditions, unless the flight was
absolutely necessary I think we would want to question seriously why they
were flying in these conditions at all.'
Unions representing offshore workers said they would press for an inquiry
into helicopter safety. Mr Roger Lyons, general-secretary elect of the MSF
offshore workers' union, said: 'Shell has refused to discuss helicopter
safety with us, and tomorrow I shall go back to the Civil Aviation Authority
to tell them this is too important to be left to the company.'

FT  16 MAR 92 / Names to discuss further action on Outhwaite losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 600 Lloyd's Names who were members of the loss-making Outhwaite
syndicate 317/661 but did not benefit from the Pounds 116m out-of-court
settlement negotiated last month have been invited to a meeting in the next
two weeks to discuss possible further action.
Mr David Tiplady, of the London law firm DJ Freeman, said yesterday he was
convening an open forum of Names - individuals whose assets support
underwriting on the insurance market - to review their options.
His call follows a meeting earlier this month in London of about 80 working
Names - those with jobs with brokers or underwriters at Lloyds  - who
belonged to the Outhwaite syndicate but did not take part in the action to
recover some of the Pounds 200m losses it made.
The working Names affected by the Outhwaite settlement are in several cases
highly placed at Lloyd's and had been hoping to persuade Mr David Coleridge,
chairman of Lloyd's, to back an extension of the out-of-court settlement.
They are now dismayed to find this possibility receding.
Mr Tiplady, who has instructions from a group of Names involved in the
Outhwaite case, said yesterday that he was acting on behalf of a different
type of Name from this group.
'The people I represent are overseas Names - Americans, Australians, South
Africans - who were unable to take part in the action because in some cases
they did not even know that it was happening,' Mr Tiplady said.
Members' agents at Lloyd's were advised to pass on details of the action to
their overseas Names when it was launched, but it appears some agents did
not do so.
A group of the Names not included in the original court action has been
advised by counsel that they are not 'time-barred' and can pursue the case
even though it is more than six years since the Outhwaite syndicate reported
its losses.
In the original action 987 Names alleged that negligence on the risks of
asbestos by RHM Outhwaite Underwriting and 80 other agencies led to
syndicate losses of more than Pounds 200m.

FT  16 MAR 92 / ERM effect on pay deals seen as slight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK MEMBERSHIP of the European exchange rate mechanism has had little effect
so far on pay determination, according to Britain's two biggest pay research
bodies.
A survey of 185 organisations by Industrial Relations Services (IRS) found
that 83 per cent 'had not assessed the implications of ERM membership either
for their level of pay settlement or for their pay determination process as
a whole'. Even companies which had assessed the implications found it
difficult to say what they were.
Incomes Data Services (IDS), the rival pay analysis body, also concludes in
its latest report: 'The idea that the discipline of the ERM produces lower
pay settlements remains an unproven hypothesis for the present.'
IRS, however, holds out the possibility that a 'transformation of
pay-setting behaviour could have been taking place' thanks to the
combination of recession and ERM membership. Distinguishing between the two
effects is still impossible, it adds.
The IRS survey found that most employers are planning to settle near the
projected inflation rate of about 4 per cent in the six months to August
this year.
It also found that only 8 per cent of employers are suffering from skill
shortages. But in spite of the recession most organisations are continuing
to pay the 'market rate' for most jobs.
Both IRS and IDS see a reduction in the number of pay freezes compared with
last year. IDS's estimate of average pay settlements is somewhat higher than
that of IRS, in spite of being about half the level of a year ago.
IDS says most settlements are bunched between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent,
while the average rise for private-sector managers is 5.3 per cent. It adds:
'The fact that most deals match the increase in the cost of living suggests
that bargaining is still centrally about motivating staff and protecting
living standards.'
IDS found pay freezes are only a small proportion of all settlements and
there are significant sectors where there have been no earnings standstills.
These include cars, food, drink and tobacco, chemicals, public services,
energy supply, building societies, insurance and oil.
Companies which froze the pay of employees early last year have not done so
again this year. Pay cuts have been extremely rare.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Support for Major seen at 93 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE only surprise in the assessment of the relative qualities of the two
party leaders is just how overwhelming is the backing for Mr John Major. The
present prime minister is preferred by 93 per cent against the 1 per cent
backing Mr Neil Kinnock.
But there is an unwelcome message in the survey for Mr Norman Lamont. Only
39 per cent believe he is the best choice for No 11 Downing Street against
the 46 per cent prepared to forgive Mr John Smith his party affiliation and
say that he would make the better chancellor.
Mr Smith is particularly popular among executive of companies with a
turnover of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 2bn, where his rating jumps to 56
per cent, while the very biggest companies are kinder towards Mr Lamont.
Elsewhere, Mr Michael Howard scores for his implacable opposition to the
minimum wage and to any increase in the powers of unions by winning the
preference of 69 per cent for the job of employment secretary. Mr Tony
Blair, the young star of the Labour front bench gets the vote of only 14 per
cent.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary and a strong
contender for the future party leadership, does better, with 33 per cent
backing him for the cabinet post. But the present incumbent at the
Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Peter Lilley, is still comfortably
ahead with the support of 45 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Kinnock's team 'bad for Britain'
</HEADLINE>

THE clear message of the survey is that business leaders believe a Labour
government would be bad for the country (88 per cent said it would be 'very
bad' or 'fairly bad'), but not quite as damaging for their individual
businesses (58 per cent).
The respondents were equally unenthusiastic about any coalition which might
be formed in the event of a hung parliament. Four fifths say it would be bad
for the country and three fifths think it would damage their business.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Life companies are wary of constitutional
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH life assurance companies stepped up their warnings over the weekend
about the dangers they see to their business from constitutional change in
Scotland.
The Scottish life companies, which derive about 90 per cent of their
business from England and Wales, fear that their business would be seriously
damaged if Scotland became independent, while the creation of a devolved
Scottish parliament would at a minimum cause damaging uncertainty.
Mr Scott Bell, chief executive of Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based mutual
which is by far the largest Scottish life company with assets of Pounds
18bn, has written to staff warning that constitutional change could damage
trust in the company among its non-Scottish customers.
Mr David Berridge, chief executive of Scottish Equitable, with assets of
Pounds 5bn, said on BBC television yesterday that if Scotland became
independent the company might have to set up a base in England to serve its
customers in that country.
Scottish Widows echoed the theme, telling staff that independence 'could
well affect our ability to keep all our main functions in Edinburgh.' Last
month the Associated Scottish Life Offices, the trade organisation
representing the nine Scottish life companies, called for retention of
constitutional status quo.
The life offices' main fear is that in an independent Scotland with a
separate currency and regulatory regime, they would be at a disadvantage
compared with English companies in selling life assurance in England. Even
with a level playing field they fear English financial advisers could play
on investors' fears about putting their long-term savings into a foreign
company.
The Scottish National party reacted to the life companies' warnings to their
staff by saying that the companies were seeking to influence the way their
employees vote, and 'playing politics with jobs.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S alternative Budget today will be followed this evening by a
televised confrontation on BBC's Panorama programme between Mr John Smith,
the shadow chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Alan Beith,
the Liberal Democrats' economic spokesman.
The three main party leaders will appear separately on subsequent Panorama
programmes up to the election, starting with Mr Paddy Ashdown for the
Liberal Democrats, Mr Neil Kinnock for Labour and finally the prime
minister. The party leaders will also be interviewed separately by Sir Robin
Day on Sky News, but with Mr Kinnock, rather than Mr John Major, the last to
appear.
It is the first general election for Sky News, the 24-hour satellite
television news service. Its output will add to what Britain's broadcasters
are promising to be the most comprehensive coverage yet of a British
election.
BBC
BBC1's flagship Nine O'Clock News has been extended by 15 minutes and will
feature foreign affairs editor John Simpson assigned to cover Mr Major,
foreign affairs correspondent Brian Hanrahan with Mr Kinnock and Carole
Walker with Mr Ashdown.
Sir Robin Day is back three mornings a week on BBC1's Breakfast News to
debate the campaign issues with a panel of 'three wise men' - Lord Jenkins
of Hillhead, Mr Denis Healey and Mr Norman Tebbit.
At 9.05am there is a daily Election Call hosted by Jonathan Dimbleby and
carried simultaneously on radio and television. The number to ring is
071-799 5000.
Campaign Report will go out three times a day on Radio 4's long-wave network
with the latest campaign updates at 10.30am, 3pm and 8pm. David Dimbleby
will conduct 40-minute interviews with the party leaders on the three last
Mondays of the campaign.
On BBC1 on Sunday evenings, Olivia O'Leary will present The Vote Race, a new
series designed to investigate what the party managers and manipulators are
up to. A studio audience linked to vote-meters will say whether they like or
believe the campaign messages.
ITN
The main ITN programmes will feature everything from live satellite links
from the constituencies to trend polling, focus groups and special reports
on 'constituency clusters' - groups of seats in certain regions with
particular characteristics. There will also be family profiles of the main
party leaders.
The main ITN programmes are:
World and Election News on Channel 4 Daily, 6.30 - 9.25am; ITN Lunchtime
News on ITV, 12.30-1.10pm; ITN Early Evening News on ITV, 5.40-5.55pm;
Channel 4 News 7pm, 7.50pm; News at Ten on ITV 10.00-10.30pm; Channel 4
News: Midnight Special, 12.00pm-2.00am.
Midnight Special will feature a wide range of guests, not just party
spokesmen.
CHANNEL 4
Apart from ITN's news programmes and Midnight Special, Channel 4 will offer
four critiques of the electoral process in its Dispatches documentary
series. In particular, Hugo Young will look at how the politicians try to
manipulate broadcasters and how, in his view, broadcasters generally let
them get away with it.
The network will also offer a special edition of the Channel 4 Debate on the
Sunday before polling day, an extended review of how the campaign is going
on Midway Sunday by the team from A Week In Politics and an election edition
of Hard News on press coverage of the campaign.
On every weekday evening Comment will be devoted to ordinary voters from
around the country discussing the campaign.
SKY NEWS
Sky will cover the daily morning party press conferences live in Sky News
Sunrise.
Sky News Phone-In will be extended daily to question politicians on the
issues dominating that day's campaigning, and throughout the day Sky news
crews will shadow leading politicians.
In addition, the Target discussion programme on Tuesdays and Fridays at
8.30pm will feature Norman Tebbit who is standing down as Conservative MP
for Chingford, Dame Barbara Castle, the former Labour MP and Lord Rogers,
one of the 'Gang of Four' who founded the Social Democratic Party.

THE death toll in the Turkish earthquake disaster reached 320 yesterday,
with another 150 feared dead. Fears that the toll might reach 1,000 were
discounted, Reuter reports from Erzincan.
More international rescue teams joined increasingly desperate efforts to
find survivors amid the rubble of Erzincan. Hundreds spent the night in
tents or under blankets, prompting protests to the governor's office
yesterday demanding extra help with food and shelter. Villagers from
outlying areas expressed anger about lack of help.
Erzincan's deputy governor, Mr Mehmet Unal, said US, Swiss and Turkish teams
helped by more than 2,700 troops were digging for people buried under
collapsed multi-storey buildings.
Teams from Russia and France were expected to join rescue efforts yesterday.
Last night the Council of Europe, which is co-ordinating aid efforts, said
there were enough doctors at the scene but more medicines were needed.

THE head of a 22,000-strong United Nations task force said yesterday he was

reconciliation body, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
Mr Yasushi Akashi of Japan also expressed concern over violations of the
Paris peace agreement signed by the country's four main factions last year.
He said further acts would not be tolerated.
'If there are any persistent or clear-cut violations, I'm sure the Security
Council will be in a position to take a clear-cut decision of enforcement,'
Mr Akashi said on his arrival in Phnom Penh.
Mr Akashi said he was concerned about the 'ineffectiveness' of Cambodia's
Supreme National Council which is 'supposed to be a very, very important
instrument for national reconciliation to prepare for the steps of democracy
in this country'.
He added that he would work with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian head
of state and SNC president, towards making a council which comes up to its
'promises and expectations.'
The SNC holds Cambodian sovereignty ahead of UN-organised elections next
year.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Re-birth of UK monetarism in a European disguise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has suffered, survived and vowed never to repeat its early-1980s
attempts at pursuing precise domestic monetary targets. No mainstream
political party describes itself as monetarist; all parties are committed to
continued membership of the European exchange rate mechanism; and all appear
resigned to the current combination of high interest rates and rising
unemployment.
Yet the current framework of UK economic policy-making remains similar to
the one that prolonged the 1980-81 recession. UK interest rates are again
very high even though the economy has been in recession for over a year and
inflation has fallen to European levels. What distinguishes the new-style
monetarism is its international flavour. UK monetary policy is once more
determined by an elusive broad money target; but the target is now set in
Frankfurt.
German broad money growth determines UK interest rates, and not vice versa,
because of the Bundesbank's anti-inflation credibility. The D-Mark has never
been devalued within the ERM, and no member country has ever managed to
reduce its interest rates below those of Germany. The pan-European interest
rate floor, set by the Bundesbank, has risen over the past two years as
inflationary pressures have built up in Germany following unification. The
fiscal deficit, tax increases and the generous terms of monetary unification
have all fuelled bank lending and wage and price inflation. In December, the
Bundesbank raised German interest rates and revised its target range for
annual broad money growth to 3.5-5.5 per cent. Yet M3 rose by an annualised
9 per cent in January, up from 5.8 per cent in December.
Interest rates across Europe stay uncomfortably high as a result. Moreover,
Europe's monetary policy will remain tight for some time, despite sluggish
economic growth outside Germany. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, last week reaffirmed its commitment to the current monetary
target zone and demanded an immediate clampdown on German credit expansion.
But M3 is not expected to dip back into its new target zone this year, as
the right-hand side of the chart shows. Inflation in Germany and slow growth
elsewhere make German money supply an inappropriate target for European
monetary policy. Does the broad money target make sense for Germany?
Monetary targets are only a good guide for policy if the relationship
between money and inflation is stable and predictable. The relationship has
been more stable in Germany than in other industrialised countries over the
past decade. But the recent UK experience counsels caution.
Domestic monetarism in Britain collapsed because the government tried to
target broad money growth just when an apparently stable relationship
between money and inflation was breaking down. The abolition of exchange
controls and supplementary special deposits in 1979-80 raised the proportion
of national income that the public wanted to hold in broad money assets. The
growth rate of Pounds M3 duly shot out of its new target range, as the chart
shows, even though inflation had already begun to fall.
Could German broad money growth also be over-shooting because the
relationship between the money stock and nominal income is shifting? One
reason why this might be so is that the D-Mark is being used as a parallel
currency elsewhere in eastern Europe. That would increase the demand for
broad money without fuelling German inflation. But non-bank deposits have
risen at least as fast as currency in circulation.
Another reason why the demand for broad money might have risen is the
proposed change to the taxation of interest income later this year. This may
have prompted investors to sell non-money assets and hold their savings in
cash and other broad money deposits. Meanwhile, east Germans are still in
the process of switching their broad money holdings into other non-money
assets.
All of which makes German money demand unpredictable, and the Bundesbank's
current task particularly difficult. A slavish devotion to fixed monetary
targets would be risky, as the UK experience has demonstrated. The rest of
Europe has little choice other than to trust the Bundesbank's judgement.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Israel and US in clash over 'weapons sales'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALREADY-STRAINED ties between Israel and the US have come under greater
pressure from new reports that Israel sold US military technology to China,
South Africa and other third countries.
Israel has hotly denied any unauthorised sales, but US officials have
confirmed they are examining possible transfers of military technology. 'We
have some concerns. We are discussing it with the Israelis. I don't want to
go beyond that,' said Mr Robert Clarke, assistant secretary of state in
charge of politico-military affairs, whose office supervises US arms
exports.
The row reflects deep splits in the Bush administration over how to handle
US-Israeli ties. Besides the immediate point of contention, the Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.6bn)-worth of loan guarantees Israel has asked to help it settle
up to 1m immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Israel's entire role in US
foreign policy is now in flux.
The loan guarantees question may be edging nearer solution, as leading
senators have reportedly worked out a compromise which addresses US concerns
that the guarantees should not directly or indirectly finance Israeli
settlement activity in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.
But it is not clear if Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is ready to
accept this Senate compromise.
Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, Israeli spokesman, said yesterday his country would
co-operate with any US investigation of alleged unauthorised sales of US
military technology, said to include air-to-air missile supplies to China,
anti-tank missiles to South Africa, and cluster bombs to Ethiopia.
Israeli officials have reacted angrily to the reports, denying the
allegations and accusing the Bush administration of trying to smear Israel.
But beneath the anger, concern is clear over the effect the issue may have
on the country's strategic relationship with Washington.
'Israel has nothing to hide and is prepared to make everything available to
the US government,' said Mr Netanyahu. 'I can guarantee you we have
scrupulously abided by our commitments to the US. We have a lot at stake
here and we do not want to jeopardise it.'
While denying illicit trade in US technology, officials have been forced by
the reports to make public statements about Israel's arms exports from its
own defence industries which have a record of copying and enhancing foreign
technologies.
Mr Moshe Arens, defence minister, who is expected to discuss the issue with
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, in Washington today, said publicly for
the first time at the weekend that Israel had sold some of its own arms to
China.
'Our industrial base is microscopic, so I think nobody should be surprised
that Israel sells some of the products of its defence industries to other
countries, including China,' Mr Arens said on Saturday.
Israel is worried that the raising of the issue by Washington is a signal by
the Bush administration, already at odds with the government of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir over policy in the occupied territories, that it
attaches less importance to the strategic relationship with Israel than in
the past.
Any restriction of US military co-operation would be a serious blow to the
Israeli Defence Forces and Israel's ailing defence industries which have big
sales in the US.

Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, is to put forward a compromise
eventually preventing lenders granting loans worth more than 25 per cent of
their shareholders' funds to a single borrower or group of borrowers.
A single loan worth more than 10 per cent of shareholders' funds would have
to be cleared with national banking supervisors.
Ministers will today try to agree a transition period for banks in some
countries such as France and Italy, which are currently allowed to grant
loans to a single client up to a 40 per cent limit.
The European Commission would like this cut to 25 per cent within five
years, but member states are likely to settle for the longer eight-year
transition proposed by the Portuguese.
Britain limits banks' large risks to 25 per cent of shareholders' funds.

THE Italian government yesterday invoked special powers to cancel a proposed
strike by air traffic controllers called for today, Robert Graham reports
from Rome. Similar powers are likely to be invoked for another stoppage
planned by different unions among the air traffic controllers for tomorrow.
Mr Carlo Bernini, the transport minister, ordered air traffic controllers to
report to work as normal and controllers who defy the order could face up to
five years in jail.
Strikes last Friday and Saturday by the air traffic controllers forced the
cancellation of over 80 per cent of all flights in and out of Italy.
The government has intervened after strong pressure from Alitalia and
protests from other international airlines. The stoppages were called as
part of a dispute over work conditions.

LEBANON and its Arab partners in peace talks with Israel will meet in Beirut
on a date to be fixed to co-ordinate strategy, the Lebanese ambassador to
Egypt said, Reuter reports from Cairo.
Mr Abdel-Rahman al-Solh said Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians had agreed
in principle to attend such a meeting following a Lebanese invitation.
Jordan said yesterday it would attend an Arab meeting in Beirut later this
month to discuss progress in the peace talks.
Arab diplomats said the proposed meeting would focus on the outcome of the
four rounds of Middle East peace talks held so far and whether to hold a
fifth round ahead of Israel's June general elections.
The last round of talks ended in Washington this month with Israel and the
Arabs blaming each other for lack of progress.
Jordan's state news agency said the Beirut meeting would chart strategy for
the peace talks. It did not say which countries would attend. Diplomats in
Amman said the Arab peace talk partners would attend, plus Egypt.
Some Arab participants say holding another round would achieve little.
Others say the process might lose momentum if the talks are put off for four
months.

MR Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's finance minister, flew to Washington
yesterday to seek support from the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the US government for his tough budget policies.
Mr Olechowski will seek IMF assurances that the budget, which foresees a Zl
65,500bn deficit amounting to 5 per cent of GDP, would form a basis on which
to renegotiate the terms of Poland's Dollars 1.6bn three-year extended
facility.
That was suspended last autumn when Poland's previous government failed to
meet the Fund's performance criteria on its budget deficit and expansion of
domestic credit.
Mr Olechowski will also be looking to the World Bank to ease the conditions
under which Dollars 1bn of credit committed to Poland and due this year can
be drawn.
Mr Olechowski needs international support when he returns on Wednesday to
present the draft budget to a centre-right cabinet aghast at the prospect of
major cuts in spending plans.
A more demanding test awaits the finance minister next month when he will
present the budget to parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers are today expected to agree on the need for Russia and
other ex-Soviet republics to join the International Monetary Fund next
month, and to settle repayments terms on past debt, before getting
macro-economic aid from the west.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economic affairs commissioner, will present to
the finance ministers' meeting a paper which details the economic plight of
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It
raises the question of whether the west should start organising for them a
currency stabilisation fund, or a balance of payments loan.
The tentative nature of the Commission's proposal stems from the fact that
the EC executive is split on the need for urgency in helping the CIS. Mr
Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner, returned two weeks ago from
a tour of CIS republics convinced that IMF credits will be too little and
too late to meet their immediate needs.
The Bush administration's difficulty in getting overall IMF funding
increased in a US election year has reinforced, in Mr Andriessen's view, the
need to start planning extra funding for Russia now.
But Mr Christophersen and the Commission's president, Mr Jacques Delors,
appear to concur with the majority of EC governments in arguing that nothing
must be done to undermine the IMF's leverage in negotiating reform
programmes with Russia and the other CIS states.
Yet there is no disagreement within the Commission that additional help will
be needed later this year. The Christophersen paper forecasts that Russia's
financing gap may rise to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) in 1993.

<TEXT>
EAST Germany's shipbuilding crisis has claimed its first political victim,
Mr Alfred Gomolka, prime minister of the economically troubled state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - adding to the woes of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats (CDU).
Mr Gomolka is to resign today after losing a vote of confidence at the
weekend within the CDU. He fell from favour after dismissing his justice
minister, Mr Ulrich Born, who had criticised his support for the sale to
western shipbuilders of three large shipyards.
The dispute centred on Mr Gomolka's unpopular move to privatise the
shipyards, the region's main industry, by splitting them instead of merging
them into one company as demanded by unions.
He is the third east German CDU prime minister to lose his post following
the state leaders of Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt. All were officials in the
CDU when it was closely allied with the ruling Communist party.
The upset underlined the CDU's shaky organisation in the east, a region that
is crucial to Chancellor Kohl's chances of retaining power in the next
general election in 1994.
The CDU has lost a series of state elections in the west but still controls
four of east Germany's five states.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Killing turns spotlight on Mafia political links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE links between Italy's ruling Christian Democrats and the Mafia have
become an important issue in the Italian election campaign following last
week's assassination of Mr Salvatore Lima, the party's most influential
politician in Sicily.
Magistrates believe the killers of Mr Lima, a European parliament deputy,
were Mafia gunmen. But the motives are the subject of intense speculation.
The government maintains the killing was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the
campaign for the April 5 election. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister,
has also suggested the murder was an indirect attack on himself since Mr
Lima was his pro-consul in Sicily.
Indeed, for the past three days Mr Andreotti has been on the defensive,
justifying his friendship with Mr Lima and protecting the latter's good name
against suggestions of links with the Mafia which are highly damaging to Mr
Andreotti. The affair risks bringing under public scrutiny the long-standing
Christian Democrat practice of relying on Mafia votes.
Another theory for the killing is that the leading Mafia families wanted to
show their displeasure over the authorities' tougher attitude towards
organised crime. Since the Second World War, the Mafia has been used behind
the scenes in Sicilian politics by the Christian Democrats to help fight
communism and to maintain the party's share of votes.
The collapse of communism has thus reduced the Mafia's political role, while
the spread of organised crime throughout Italy has obliged the government to
devote more energy and resources to fighting the Mafia.
But the most commonly held view is that Mr Lima was murdered in a Mafia
settlement of accounts. He is alleged to have long acted as an intermediary
in the murky world where politics and organised crime meet.
As a former mayor of Palermo, Mr Lima was responsible for the city's new
urban plan in the Sixties which encouraged a speculative property boom
dominated by the Mafia. At least four times in the Seventies, parliament
unsuccessfully tried to investigate his links with the construction business
and the Mafia. But he was the Christian Democrats' most effective operator
in Sicily and had powerful friends like Mr Andreotti. Indeed, Mr Lima acted
as if he was 'untouchable' and was one of the few politicians who felt a
body-guard unnecessary.
Two magistrates are expected to leave shortly for the US to clarify Mr
Lima's connections with the Mafia, questioning Mr Tommaso Buscetta and Mr
Francesco Marino Mannoia. The latter are prominent former members of the
Mafia, who have been co-operating both with the US and Italian authorities
in return for immunity.

FT  16 MAR 92 / Cresson's popularity sinks lower as regional polls loom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE popularity of Mrs Edith Cresson, France's embattled prime minister, has
sunk to a new low, just a week before regional elections.
Only 19 per cent of French voters approve of Mrs Cresson, compared with 21
per cent last month, according to a poll by Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche.
In the 10 months since she was installed by President Francois Mitterrand to
give the government a new elan, Mrs Cresson's unpopularity rating has risen
by 42 points to 59 per cent, according to yesterday's poll. Moreover, only
39 per cent of Socialist sympathisers still support her, down eight points
on February, said the poll.
While not directly comparable, it is striking that Mrs Cresson's score now
stands just a few percentage points ahead of the extreme right wing National
Front (FN), whose anti-immigration policies have attracted support from 13.5
per cent of the electorate.
The Socialist government can draw little consolation from the fact that the
same poll shows President Mitterrand has gained two points in the popularity
ratings over the past month, to a mere 26 per cent.
The uproar surrounding the FN's election rallies - some of which have been
banned by local authorities - intensified on Saturday night, when fighting
broke out in the cathedral town of Chartres. FN supporters attacked
left-wingers, who were protesting against a rally led by Mr Bruno Megret,
the FN's deputy president. Police arrested 10 FN supporters and were still
holding two yesterday.
In another symptom of the protest vote, the Hunting, Fishing, Nature and
Tradition party, which supports the right of all French citizens of any
political colour to kill wild animals and birds, has been winning 5 per cent
popularity scores in recent polls.
FRANCE'S economic downturn caused the government to overshoot its budget
deficit by 63.2 per cent last year, the first time since 1987 that it has
allowed the shortfall to increase, writes William Dawkins. Final
calculations of 1991 accounts show a FFr131.7bn (Pounds 13.5bn) deficit,
against the FFr80.7bn envisaged in that year's budget, said the Finance
Ministry. This brings the deficit to 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product,
up from 1.4 per cent of GDP the previous year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA, one of the strongest supporters of sanctions against apartheid in
South Africa, is embroiled in a debate over the extent of institutionalised
racism against its Aboriginal minority, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Race relations have rarely been smooth since the first white settlers
arrived in Sydney 204 years ago. But two incidents in recent weeks suggest
that official prejudice against blacks remains widespread.
The most striking was an amateur video broadcast on ABC television which
showed policemen at a charity function cavorting for the camera with blacked
faces and nooses around their necks.
The officers identified themselves as David Gundy and Lloyd Boney, both
Aborigines who died in police custody. Mr Gundy was shot dead in Sydney in
1989; Mr Boney hanged himself in a police cell in 1987.
The screening of the video followed a documentary in which police in the
Sydney suburb of Redfern were filmed harassing Aborigines, some of whom were
arrested for using 'offensive' language which also formed a prominent part
of the police vocabulary.
Both incidents have been condemned by political leaders of all parties. Mr
Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the video was 'a national disgrace'.
He urged Australians to 'expunge racism from every corner of this country'.
The officers, who belong to the New South Wales (NSW) state police, have
been placed on restricted duties, and are being investigated by the force's
internal affairs department. A separate inquiry is taking place into the
events in Redfern.
Aborigines reacted to the video with outrage. Mr Paul Coe, chairman of the
Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern said the video was indicative of racism
'in all institutions throughout the states and the Commonwealth (federal
government) of Australia.' Ms Irene Moss, the federal Race Discriminations
Commissioner, said the 'outrageous' behaviour exposed in the broadcasts
reflected 'widespread involvement of police in acts of racist violence,
intimidation and harassment of Aboriginal people'.
Police officers appeared to be less concerned. Mr Tony Day, president of the
NSW Police Association, said it was a disgrace the video had been
sensationalised.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS perfectly clear who could win the Democratic party's presidential
primary in Illinois tomorrow. His name is Pat O'Connor, he comes from
Chicago's 40th ward and he would win, if he were running, because he had
easily the largest float in Saturday's St Patrick's Day parade through the
middle of the windy, frozen city and over a bright green river.
National politicians are not really welcome at this public, but essentially
private, celebration of Irishness by Chicago's policemen, plumbers,
pipefitters and social club members.
The three Democratic candidates stayed away, and not only because none can
afford pneumonia at this stage. Pat Buchanan, whose name fits, was going to
appear but spent the morning with Ukrainians instead.
Most, however, put in time at informal neighbourhood parades yesterday.
Their supporters were out working the crowds, though hopelessly outnumbered
by those running for local office. By virtue of the number of placards seen
and leaflets collected, Bill Clinton will beat Paul Tsongas here easily,
with Jerry Brown nowhere, but this is hardly a scientific measurement.
More reliable, but not infallible, was a weekend Chicago Sun-Times poll
which gave the governor of Arkansas 48 per cent, the former senator from
Massachusetts 21 per cent and the former governor of California a meagre 7
per cent. It also had President George Bush overwhelming Mr Buchanan by
79-15 per cent on the Republican side.
The Mason-Dixon poll in neighbouring Michigan, which also votes tomorrow,
told a similar tale, with Mr Clinton at 48 per cent, Mr Tsongas 22 per cent
and Mr Brown 11 per cent. Mr Clinton's pollster added that he thought Mr
Brown was rising so fast that he could relegate Mr Tsongas into third place
in the state. Mrs Nikki Tsongas, encountered at a Greek restaurant in
Chicago on Saturday night, would have none of this gloomy prognosis.
The big industrial cities of Illinois and Michigan have long been known for
their political machines, many union-based. Certainly Mr Clinton has been
picking up far more formal endorsements than his opponents, but there is
doubt these days as to how valuable these really are.
The Chicago Tribune reckoned yesterday that of the city's 50 wards, only
about eight have machines consistently capable of delivering the

FT  14 MAR 92 / Sex and the single company: Dominic Lawson thinks that a
womens' magazine and a condom company make strange bedfellows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the few perks in the otherwise austere life of a magazine editor is
that he or she is constantly being sent free copies of every other magazine.
The perk lies in not reading them. But sometimes curiosity overcomes
judgement. Elle magazine caters for curious editors by publishing a special
'SEX' section. Just in case we don't get the point, the word SEX is written
in red letters six inches high. It's size that counts. But one should not be
flippant. Elle has recently forged links with The Guardian newspaper and
must, therefore, be taken seriously, if not actually believed. 'Imagine,'
the SEX section begins, 'a woman standing straight and proud, facing the
world head-on. In one hand she carries a briefcase, symbolising her control
over her working life; in the other she brandishes a vibrator and a packet
of condoms   . in the 1990s this woman is becoming a reality.' This, of
course, is absolutely right. Women walking around with symbolic briefcases
in one hand, and condoms and vibrators in the other are a common sight these
days, and I'm surprised no one has noted this fact before now. Presumably
the condoms these women brandish are manufactured by Durex. You see, Durex
has sponsored the Elle SEX survey, and it would be ungrateful to brandish
imaginary condoms made by a rival company. Durex, naturally, would like
every woman of child bearing age to run around brandishing its wares, and it
pays to advertise; the subliminal message, as they say in the Ad Biz, is
that if you don't do Durex you do get AIDS.
But not all the readers of Elle, sadly, have yet absorbed this vital
message. 'Has AIDS changed the way we love?' it shrieks: 'A staggering 54
per cent of our sample did not consider themselves at risk from AIDS.
Understandable perhaps, given that many of them are in relationships, but
worrying, given the statistics on fidelity. Even more concerning is the fact
that over a third claim not to have changed their sexual behaviour because
of HIV/AIDS.'
I do indeed find it staggering that 46 per cent of Elle readers consider
themselves at risk from AIDS, and that two thirds of its readership have
changed their sexual behaviour because of HIV/AIDS. The most recent
statistics from anonymous tests carried out in British ante-natal clinics
show the incidence of the HIV virus among women in central London as 0.04
per cent or one in 4,000. Outside central London the incidence of HIV is
0.016 per cent, or one in 16,000. These, remember, are figures from
ante-natal clinics, essentially women between the ages of 18 and 38. Such
tests among the total female population would most likely show an even more
minuscule incidence of the HIV virus.
These figures do, admittedly exclude one category of intravenous drug users,
the only element among the female population genuinely at risk from
HIV/AIDS. This, on the other hand, has nothing to do with SEX. And Durex
cannot help to reduce the risks for these unfortunate auto-injectors.
For some reason, however, Elle, in association with Durex, have not seen fit
to inform their readers of the true risks of AIDS to women. Instead they are
jointly promoting a new condom for women. According to the Elle editorial,
'Durex have come up with Assure, a condom that still retains the high
quality and reliability of Durex, but which is packaged discreetly and
stylishly . . . no need to wince if they drop out of your handbag.' Handbag?
Whatever happened to the symbolic briefcase?
Doubtless Durex will succeed in its aim to increase the acceptabilty and
sales of its product. But I still think that magazines should not get into
bed with condom manufacturers. The readers have no protection.

had known heaven and hell in 30 seconds. Mackay made no comment, but as we
trudged back through the driving mist to the House three miles away he told
me a story. I wish I could reproduce the rolling 'rs' and Highland lilt.
'There was this fine gentleman, lad, who loved his fishing. Spent all his
spare cash and some more; trout, salmon, pike, bass, sharks. A famous angler
he was. Not that his wife or his bairns saw much of him. But his picture was
in all the sporting papers. And then he died. Died with a rod in his hand
and a trout on the line.
'Well, lad, he arrived on the Other Side and was greeted by a Shining One
who welcomed him warmly. Shook his hand too. 'Ah, Mr Johnson, we've been
expecting you. What'd you like to be doing then?' 'What? Can I choose?'
'Well, of course you can. That is what this place is for.'
'So naturally our Mr Johnson asked if he could fish. Indeed he could. Finest
salmon river you've ever seen. Finest tackle. Finest weather. Water just
right. More flies than you'll see in your Natural History Museum. So he set
up his rod, our Mr Johnson, and started to fish. And first cast - wham into
a 10lb salmon. In 20 minutes it was in the net and on the bank. What a
river. And would you believe it, next cast just the same. And the next. Come
noon he'd ten great salmon salmon, as like as peas in a pod, all lined up on
the bank.
'So our Mr Johnson, he's mighty pleased with himself now isn't he? It's been
a good morning. Time for a dram and his sandwiches maybe. So he starts back
up the bank to the fishing lodge. On the way he meets the Shining One.
'Now,' says the Heavenly Being, 'Where d'you think you're off?'
''Well,' says our Mr Johnson, pleased as pleased can be, 'had a wonderful
morning. Ten 30lb salmon. What d'you think of that? Thought I'd knock off
for a bite of lunch and a drink. Don't want to spoil it, eh, by overdoing
it.'
''Sorry about that,' says the Angel 'but I'm afraid you can't stop. You just
get back over that river and carry on catching salmon. For ever and ever.
Where do you think you are - in Heaven?''
The trouble is, it does not add up. Heaven and Hell have inbuilt
illogicalities. Here and now we get glimpses of both. 'Hell is other
people,' says Sartre. 'Heaven is other people,' say I.
I spent some time the other day studying a splendid Doom painting sprawled
across the chancel of a local church.
I do not know if it really did persuade the Wiltshire yokels of the 14th
century to mend their ways. Frankly I rather doubt it. I certainly do not
want to join the queue of po-faced bishops and skinny noble ladies being
welcomed into Heaven by a supercilious St Peter.
The gory activities on the Hell-side of the arch are much more interesting.
The Devils are the only people hugely enjoying themselves, stoking eternal
fires with terrified humanity. Hell is clearly Heaven to them. But an
eternity of sado-masochism is hardly my recipe for a believable heaven or
hell. We do such things better on earth.
'Pate de foie gras to the sound of trumpets,' decided Sidney Smith. But pity
the poor geese. It must have been hell for them. And who pays the
trumpeters?
Hell, like fictional villains, is easier to to imagine; after all we see it
nightly on our television screens. But Heaven? I knew an elderly Irish
aristocrat who was convinced that Heaven was an endless vista of parkland
sculpted by an angelic Brown) with woods and hills embowering white
Palladian halls. Didn't Jesus say, 'In my Father's house are many mansions?'
 -'Angel] Fancy seeing you here. Isn't He just a heavenly Host' But who
cooks the meals and dead-heads the roses? I forgot: They never wither do
they?
The Heaven we paint is a kaleidoscope of 'high' experiences which cannot
possibly co-exist in this time space sequence. But are they fragments of
light from-other realm of being where time runs every which-way and space
curls in upon itself like some cosmic mizmaze? Or just sparks from the
bonfire of our own humanity? Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I think they
are just our own sparklers we have lit to keep the night at bay. Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays I think they are the eternal stars. And Sundays?
Where does He come into it - if at all?
Well if He exists He must be All-Holy, All-loving and All-Wise. And that
means that at some time - Beyond Time - he just has to do some totally
mind-boggling work of New Creation that so ravishes the human heart that
every human being who has ever lived, whatever horrors and torment they
endured will be able to say: 'It was worth it for this]' Now that I cannot
imagine. But then, I tell myself, and half believe it: if I had been around
10bn years ago and some passing angel had pointed to the incandescent fires
of Alpha Orion and said: 'One day that is going to be cheetahs and parakeets
and Milton and Bach and Gary Linneker - not to mention Marilyn Monroe' - I
would have taken a whopping bet against it - and lost. If, out of that, He
can make this, what can He not make out of this Heaven? I will bet on it.
And Hell? That is the place for people who prefer things as they are.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Recruitment without the cutting edge - Malcolm
Rutherford reviews Farquhar's play at the National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THIS production of The Recruiting Officer, the National theatre has
completed a 180 degrees turn. George Farquhar's play was the first
restoration comedy to be staged by the National Theatre Company when it was
in its infancy at the Old Vic in 1963. The production then was directed by
William Gaskill and had more than a handful of stars in the cast: Laurence
Olivier, Robert Stephens, Colin Blakely, Max Adrian and Maggie Smith among
them.
The Gaskill approach drew heavily on an adaptation of the play by Bertholt
Brecht, Pauken und Trompeten, which emphasised the horrors of war,
imperialism, the exploitation of the working class and everything else that
you might expect to go with a title like The Recruiting Officer.
The new production, directed by Nicholas Hytner, puts Brecht firmly behind
it. The setting, the style, the tone are all positively bucolic. There is
hardly a hint of war in the background, any class exploitation is most
gently done and scarcely a blow is struck in anger. Almost the only moment
of shock comes when an officer reaches for his sword on being alarmed by the
mooing of a cow.
I suppose that I am too much of an innate Brechtian wholly to welcome such a
total reversal and admit to some surprise that it should come from the
National Theatre. Nevertheless, there is some justification for this kinder,
gentler approach in the original text.
Writing at the beginning of the 18th century, Farquhar was plainly
influenced up to the hilt by Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. The Recruiting
Officer has parts of Henry 1V and Much Ado About Nothing written all over
it. Jonson's influence is most apparent in the fortune-telling scene, which
could have come from The Alchemist.
The striking fact, however, is that Farquhar drew only on the romantic side
of his forebears. There is a lot about recruitment and war in Henry 1V and,
a military man himself, Farquhar clearly borrowed from it. For the
Gloucestershire of Henry 1V, Part 2, he substitutes Shropshire, which is not
so very different. But the characters that he picks up are the Shallows and
the Silences, not the Pistols. There is more than a touch of Falstaff in his
Captain Brazen, but it is Falstaff the lovable, not Falstaff the coward and
cynic.
As for Ben Jonson, Farquhar has embroidered on his theme of the gullibility
of human nature, yet none of his dupes are villains. In the world of this
Recruiting Officer, everyone is ultimately well-intentioned at heart. It is
a pastoral society where sheep may safely graze, as indeed in Ashley
Martin-Davis's setting they do, alternating with the cows and the pigs.
Such an interpretation, which may be literally correct, has its limitations
as drama. The first half of the production seems at times painfully slow and
even after the interval, when the threads are put together, you sense a
contradiction between recruiting for war and the idyllic setting in which it
takes place.
Still, the play has some individual virtues. There is a wonderful twist at
the end when Captain Brazen, who has seemed a bit of a name-dropper, turns
out genuinely to know some of the people being mentioned. Unlike Falstaff,
he ends on a note of triumph. Farquhar's writing, almost entirely in prose,
is consistently direct and witty: he was Irish by birth. And this being the
National Theatre, the acting is uniformly excellent.
Desmond Barrit plays Brazen as a huge, cumbersome, yet endearing figure.
Alex Jennings is an aesthetic as well as athletic Captain Plume, and Sally
Dexter's Syliva is even better when she is dressed as a man.
For the record, the piece has a number of firsts behind it. It may have been
the first play staged in North America - in New York in 1732. It was
certainly the first in Australia where it was performed by a group of
convicts in 1789. One suspects that they gave it slightly more edge than
Hytner. This production is sponsored by the private contributors to the
Royal National Theatre.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Horne displays her vocal skill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARILYN HORNE, in the sunset years of her career, maintains a formidable
armoury of vocal skills. Just how formidable was underlined after the final
item of Wednesday's Covent Garden song recital, an admirably full (and now
even rather unfashionable) two-hours' worth which had been sung, the singer
revealed, with a chest-cold so bad she had been on the point of cancelling
her London visit. Up to that moment one's evaluation was that Miss Horne had
spent two hours giving a perfectly astonishing demonstration of how to make
the most of little. The formerly extensive and voluptuously ample instrument
seemed itself only in the lowest ranges, and ventures above had been
carefully restricted (a single top G being the climax of the first half),
yet by means of technical skill and communicative address in exactly judged
combination she drew an exhilarating effect from every song she sang. Even
before the start Miss Horne and her excellent pianist Martin Katz had earned
one's approval by choosing a genuinely interesting and varied programme:
Rossini, Vivaldi, Pauline Viardot and William Bolcom were its composers.
Rossini opened and closed the proceedings; this is his anniversary year, and
Miss Horne is of course one of the most celebrated of living Rossinians, but
in both groups it was the quietly reflective songs that best showed her
considerable powers of characterisation, colour and shading: a short setting
from Dante of the Francesca da Rimini tale, an extraordinary elegy on one
note entitled 'Adieux a la vie'. This singer has often seemed to me, indeed,
a performer with two distinct and sometimes unreconciled personalities. The
first is that of a serious and even rather restrained artist, skilful in the
many languages she sings (in the fascinating group of Schumann-like Lieder
by Pauline Viardot, her utterance of German was beautifully weighted); the
second, thrower-out of florid fast scales, turns and shakes in abundance and
thunderer of trombone chest notes, is a sock-it-to-'em vulgarian.
On this occasion, health constraints were posing constant obstacles in the
way of the latter Marilyn Horne - the single exercise in vocal bravura,
'Sorge l'irato nembo' from Vivaldi's Orlando furioso, proved impressive but
by no means the tour de force of former years. And perhaps for this reason
there seemed a far less stark dichotomy in the singer's artistic styles and
ambitions. She remains a wonderfully frank, forceful humorist: in a
selection from Bolcom's easily lyrical and well-turned I Will Breathe a
Mountain cycle (1990), her varieties of native-American inflection, from the
openly raucous to the quietly rueful with a hundred stages in between, were
a joy to hear.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: 'Death' and 'Desire' - East Berlin is gripped by US
drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BERLIN last week, the lyrics 'I want to live in America' surged out on to
the dimly lit Friedrichstrasse in the east as the Metropol, a 1960s-style
music hall, celebrated the hundredth performance of a West Side Story which
opened within weeks of the Berlin Wall's collapse. Up the road, the sold-out
premiere of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman at another former eastern
playhouse, the Maxim Gorki Theater, demonstrated the serious side of a
passion that is now gripping German-speaking theatres: a love-affair with
modern American drama, and especially with the kind of mid-century American
play in whose post-war concerns so many contemporary German dilemmas are
finding a voice and a symbol.
Salesman, cannonaded as communist propaganda when it appeared on Broadway in
1949, is of course the perfect play for the old east Germany. The sense of a
threatening new order; the salesman left behind, forced to admit that his
life has been run by dreams and lies; his awakening sense that the
capitalist spirit he had so fervently embraced is now pinching him where it
hurts; the fear that failure means no longer belonging to society: Willy
Loman's crisis rings true not for Honecker's Germany but for the former
eastern states today.
The Maxim Gorki production has almost the vigour of a new play, the sense of
rediscovery enhanced by a fresh and sensitive translation from Volker
Schlorndorff, who filmed the play in 1985, and by one of the most intently
involved audiences I have seen. The piece comes with programme notes from
ex-DDR dramatist Heiner Muller - that capitalism's only enemy is now itself,
that Germans cannot distinguish between advertisement and reality, and this
is the core of Klaus Manchen's interpretation of Willy. From his first
moment on stage, back to the audience, large suitcase drooping from each
hand, Manchen expresses the world-weariness not just of 30 years on the
road, but of a man caught in a lifelong web of deceit and
self-justification.
Manchen is big, fat and impeccably dressed: the desperation for approval,
the clinging to his pinstripes and hat as talismans of the right way to be,
is the more poignant and vulnerable in so imposing a man. We never learn the
contents of his suitcase, but Manchen begins at once selling himself - to
his wife, his children. He can neither give up nor live up to his image of
successful salesman, and the conflict isolates him. He looks wildly round
the stage, the audience, to be met by blank incomprehension at the intensity
of his fantasy. His voice, veering from soft fatigue to raw shriek, suggests
a potential heart attack victim; the face gets greyer and wan, he visibly
ages during the performance.
Director Siegfried Buhr packs in psychologically acute support - Gotz
Schubert as Biff and Thomas Ruhmann as Happy fight convincingly in their
thirties the battles that should have happened in adolescence, as Biff
finally grasps - but never lets the father-son relationship deflect the
tragic impulse that propels the piece. Other roles are played with Brechtian
dramatic economy - explorer-brother Ben (Gottfried Richter), for instance,
is crystal clear as a glamorous symbol to Willy but shows no emotions
himself.
Staging echoes the theme of masks and dreams. Huge cubes and rectangles form
the tower blocks hemming in the Loman apartment; slits between the granite
let in views of an infinite cityscape. Contemporary action takes place
mostly in shadowy corners or doorways; scenes reenacting Willy's memories
are by contrast bathed in spotlight, his boasting playfulness with his boys
a theatrical performance, the glow fading as he crumbles back to his true
insecurity. Stars pop up like jewels on the big black shapes, hinting at
romance, at the grandiose idea of commercial heroism - suicide for the
insurance premium, the ultimate self-sell - which we know will kill Willy.
Following the Berlin version, another Salesman opens in Hamburg's main
theatre this week, Miller's View from the Bridge opens in Dusseldorf, Edward
Albee has just premiered in Cologne, while in Vienna I caught A Streetcar
Named Desire, the new production in one of the most ambitious American
ventures, the Volkstheater's Tennessee Williams cycle. The play, written two
years before Miller's, works through sentimental romance the same theme of
social alienation.
Viennese theatre has a special quality of encapsulating the mood and setting
of a piece at a mesmeric, almost suffocating pitch; this marks both classic
and modern works at the Burgtheater as well as the lighter Volkstheater, and
is perhaps a reflection of the museum-like claustrophobia of the city
itself. With Williams such an approach cannot be bettered; few dramatists
delineate their own world more precisely, and the Volkstheater's evocation
of his vulgar-lush southern town is worth seeing for the set alone.
The 'raffish charm' Williams demanded is all here. The New Orleans corner
house, weathered grey, with white frame, rickety stairs, ornamented gable;
the palm tree leaning against a telegraph pole; trains shuttling through;
Jim Beam and Shell in neon, spin on a revolving platform. Inside is the
shabby Kowalski house; outside a half-moon dance floor with a blues pianist.
Beyond, the sky turns turquoise, pink, bloodshot; jazz rhythms come and go;
sirens wail; a rainbow arches overhead: director Horst Ruprecht's backcloth
of beauty, cruelty, ugliness is never still.
Ruprecht extends raffish charm to character too. Everyone is a shade too
nice: we need more meance from Josef Bilous as the brutish Pole Kowalski,
and a more hardened neurosis from Kirsta Stadler as his genteel
sister-in-law Blanche. This checks Williams' highly strung extremes - in the
key fight between the sensitive (Blanche) and the materialist (Stanley),
there is some sympathy for the latter, though there is no risk of running
out of it for the former, who can be a tiresomely self-indulgent prima
donna.
Ms Stadler instead gives Blanche initial control and some humour, and
excellently conveys the desperation of the fallen woman straining after
innocence which later turns to insanity. A refrain, introduced by a tinkling
glockenspiel and ending with a gunshot, recurs each time her memories are
danced out on the crescent platform, and enhances the sense of obsession.
The tenderness of the portrayal suffuses the theatre - just too sweetly. It
is hard not to compare the smouldering beast Marlon Brando in deadly
conflict with wistful fluttering Vivien Leigh, in the film version; here the
tension is many volts lower.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUDGET and the rest were all on Radio 4, but this is not the place to
discuss these things - especially after some parliamentary wit observed that
this was not a Budget for Britain but for Sam Brittan.
After its four debates, Radio 4 adorned Sunday evening this week with The
Great Monkey Trial, almost as much a debate as a play. It is an expert
adaptation by Peter Goodchild of the transcripts of the trial of
schoolmaster John Scopes in Tennessee in 1925. The charge was that, contrary
to Tennessee law, he taught that man was not created as described in
Genesis, but descended from creatures of a lower order. The prosecution was
led by the biblical orator, Williams Jennings Bryan; the defence, by the
eminent lawyer Clarence Darrow, an agnostic, who appeared on principle,
without payment. At the climax of the trial, Darrow had Bryan in the box as
a witness. Did he believe the story of Jonah and the whale? that Joshua
stopped the sun for three days? that all living things were destroyed in the
flood? that there were morning and evening in the first three days of the
creation, when the sun was not made until the fourth day? 'God could have
taken care of it,' was a typical Bryan reply. So could the State of
Tennessee; such matters were ruled irrelevant, and after a nine-minute
deliberation the jury found Scopes guilty. He was fined Dollars 100 - and
Bryan died a few days later.
The production was recorded in the Warner Brothers studios in Hollywood,
under Susan Loewenberg and the BBC's Martin Jenkins. The playing was
first-rate, with Edward Asner as the assured Bryan, Charles Dorning the
attacking Darrow, the lively presentation by Tyne Daly, whom we know from
Cagney and Lacey. There wasn't a dull moment in the whole two hours.
The Food Programme last week, fronted by the imperishable Derek Cooper
(Radio 4, Friday), was disguised as a sports feature. First, the competition
for the 1992 Croque d'or, reported as if a Rugby match (Thanet the winner).
Next, sports medicine, starting with, of all things, racing drivers, for
whom an extra pound may cost a second, and then Olympic archers, who care
less. Other sports, other diets: a girl cox needing hurriedly to reduce from
51 kilogrammes to 45 was on 1800 calories a day, whereas a cyclist in the
Tour de France might need 10,000. Frank Dick, of the British Athletic Team,
spoke dubiously of infusions of items like vitamin B12, 'prescribed' by
locker-room chat. The ethos of sport, he thought, was being damaged by such
matters as retarded growth, and the rules might well be rewritten.
All Radio 4 this week, for I couldn't find what I was after, FEM FM, the
first all-girl station, when I looked for it. Thursday's The New Recruit is
a series dealing with newcomers to various professions. Last week, air
hostesses; this week, in a similar style, prostitutes. Mostly we heard talk
between a 60-year-old veteran and a newcomer, Vanessa. Vanessa needed advice
about condoms from her older colleague; after all, as she said, 'I've got to
be clean for my baby.' They thought little of the punters, and Vanessa had
to laugh at bondage (they said 'bandage"). It was 'like a hobby', only done
when broke. I heard no judgment, one way or the other.
Also on Thursday, Butterflies Don't Count, a play by Wally K Daly about a
priest who hears a confession of murder, which of course he may not tell
anyone else. The murder is contrasted with a child's killing a butterfly,
which he is told need not be confessed as a sin. There is much talk between
priests; there is some over-writing that Daly must have retained from his
science-fiction days; and I found it hard to keep up with events. Perhaps it
will all be made clear in the sequel next Thursday, Broken Butterfly.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Too beautiful to be fashionable? - William Packer
breathes a sigh of relief not to be confronted with conceptual art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER WHAT seems like weeks on end of turning a sceptical eye on what passes
for the most significant of British art of our time in the opinion of our
more au courant dealers, collectors and institutional curators, it comes as
some considerable relief to turn again to some proper painting. No matter
that none of it is self-consciously avant-garde, or that none of the artists
concerned is likely to see the right side of 45 again: the young, like the
poor, are always with us.
Jennifer Durrant is the one abstract painter among them, whose latest
canvases now fill the Concourse Gallery at the Barbican (level 5: until
March 25). She works habitually on the largest practical scale for a studio
painter, 9 feet by 10 or so. The imagery in the work is unspecific but
nevertheless richly associative. If anything, it proposes a cosmic space,
her bright, ambiguous elements wheeling and turning like planets in their
pictorial firmament. Yet it swings back from the most expansive space that
the imagination can comprehend to the smallest, to those no less limitless
inner and secret spaces of biology under the microscope.
The imagery, formal elements of active colour disposed in mutual relation
across a colour field or ground, is rich in organic association, redolent of
seeds and pods and urgent, microscopic, seminal activity. The canvases are
beautifully sustained, the paint thin and translucent. The surface is
constantly flickering and alive, often physically interrupted by the
overlaying of canvas upon canvas, edges and interstices catching the light
with the irregular run of pigment.
Miss Durrant in mid career is as distinguished a painter as any in her
generation. Yet her work is too seldom seen, for it, like so much else, no
longer fits the orthodoxies of curatorial interest. It is too instinctive,
perhaps, too conspicuous in its lack of any conceptual programme or
rationale, harder to talk or write about than simply to see. It has no
politics, no fish in a tank to relieve imagination of particular
responsibility. It is, perhaps, too beautiful.
Mutatis mutandis, as much may be said of Dick Lee, whose latest work is now
on show at Cadogan Contemporary (108 Draycott Avenue SW3, until March 28).
He is a painter of the landscape, the domestic agricultural landscape of
Suffolk and Normandy, and also of the studio and domestic interior with its
natural informal clutter of still life. Whatever: at nearly 70, he is as
good a painter as any we now have.
His handling is deceptively casual, the paint indulged in the easy touch and
sweep of the hand, loose and free. But the ease is deceptive, the rigour of
the construction and the consistent articulation of the pictorial space ever
apparent. All is looked at long and hard, the form described, the space
understood and registered with an admirable simplicity. This is
old-fashioned painting of the Modern British School, in the knowledge of
Sickert and Camden Town seen through a filter of French experience and
sensibility, and as thoroughly contemporary as could be.
The other exhibitions I can do little more than recommend. Susan Pye's first
solo show, long overdue, is at the Pike Gallery, a new gallery in Wandsworth
(145 St John's Hill SW11, until March 29). She is something of an
expressionist, her table-top still-lifes, landscapes of a sort, teasing
their way towards abstraction, but never quite. The smaller work tends
towards the decorative and exuberant, the larger remaining the more austere
in feeling, more thoroughly worked and impressive.
I have yet to see the shows of Maggi Hambling, at Bernard Jacobson (14a
Clifford Street W1, until April 4), and Harry Holland, at Jill George (38
Lexington Street W1, until April 3), but I shall most certainly do so.
Beyond curiosity as to detail, I have no fear in recommending them, for I
know the work well in both cases. I have already seen in the studio much of
the Jemma series of monotypes, of the female nude, that Maggi Hambling is
showing; as with Zen calligraphy, with the monotype there is no going back,
and these images are as remarkable for their commitment as for their
spirited accomplishment. And by the form book, Harry Holland's odd and
ambiguous metaphysical still-lifes should be as beautiful as anything
currently on show in London.
Will the guardians of our national collections feel it worth their while to
get along to see them, or the works of any other of today's artists?

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: The Golden Age of Dutch drawing - Homan Potterton
admires the Abrams collection, currently in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOMAN POTTERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WHILE MOST people know Rembrandt's drawings
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a huge number survive - similar works on paper by his fellow Dutch artists
of the 17th century are altogether less familiar. This is in contrast to
Italian and French painters - from Raphael, Michelangelo or Guercino to
Claude, Poussin or Watteau - whose graphic work has always been prized and
appreciated. But who can recall seeing studies in pen or chalks by Hals,
Steen, Cuyp, Ruisdael, Vermeer or any of the other great names which
constitute the pantheon of Dutch art of the Golden Age ?
Yet, as a beautiful exhibition - Seventeenth-Century Dutch Drawings from the
Abrams Collection - now at the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (and
already seen at the Rijksmuseum and the Albertina in Vienna) makes clear,
drawing was just as prevalent in Dutch art as it was French and Italian and
the results were frequently as ravishing. From the end of the 16th century,
Dutch artists adopted the Italian renaissance practice of making preliminary
drawings from life - for both figures and landscapes - as a means of
achieving more naturalistic effects in compositions that were in fact
products of the imagination.
In the case of both portraiture and flower-painting, where reality was of
the essence, it goes without saying that drawing also played a vital role.
Contrary to one's initial impression, therefore, a substantial legacy of
Dutch graphics from the 17th century exists and, generally speaking, the
range of subject-matter is more varied than what one finds within the
classical confines of French or Italian art of the same period.
For over 30 years a Boston lawyer and his wife, George and Maida Abrams,
have been buying Dutch drawings of the 17th century and in doing so they
have assembled a collection of the very highest quality and distinction. It
is a very personal collection with a strong emphasis on landscape. An early
influence on the couple was the great Harvard teacher and connoisseur of old
master drawings, Paul Sachs, who told them, on seeing their early
acquisitions, that they were 'people' as opposed to 'landscape' collectors.
As a result, they consciously sought out landscapes to correct their natural
inclination towards figure studies so that, for example, of the three sheets
by Rembrandt in the exhibition two are of landscapes; both date from about
1652 and both were bought at the Chatsworth sale in 1967.
Sachs's admonition may be the raison d'etre for several of the other
interesting sheets in the collection. A wonderful wash sketch of a castle on
a cliff with the blasted trunk of a tree in the foreground is surprisingly
said to be by Rembrandt's pupil, Nicolaes Maes; alternatively, the catalogue
suggests it could be by another pupil, Samuel van Hoogstraten. The problem
is that neither artist is really known as a landscape painter so that the
attribution of the work remains tentative. Another Rembrandt pupil who is
more familiar as a figure painter is Jan Lievens; yet he is represented in
the Abrams collection by two pen and ink studies of landscape. The artist
Abraham Furnerius is not exactly a household name; but he was a pupil of the
great master himself and was described by a contemporary as 'very clever in
his landscapes'. Typically, the Abramses have sought out an example of his
work.
Hendryik Avercamp, the deaf-mute painter of winter scenes, was a prolific
draughtsman and notable among his oeuvre are a number of fully-finished
watercolours which the artist, unusually for his time, produced (and sold)
as autonomous works of art. Two of these - a view with a river and a more
typical scene on the ice - are among the highlights of the Abrams
collection. Not surprisingly, the pioneer masters of the naturalistic
landscape - Claes Visscher, Cornelis Vroom, and Esaias and Jan van de Velde
are also represented; and from later decades there are examples by
well-known names - van Goyen, Jacob van Ruisdael and Nicolaes Berchem.
Among the figure studies are a number of very beautiful drawings ranging
from quite Mannerist (and Italianate) studies by such artists as Bloemaert,
Wttewael and Goltzius to raucous low-life scenes by Adriaen and Isack van
Ostade, Cornelis Bega and Dusart. The most surprising of the figure drawings
are, however, a group of large black and white chalk drawings on blue paper.
Two of these are by Jacob Backer, two by Govaert Flinck, and another by
Lambert Doomer - all artists who worked in the immediate circle of
Rembrandt. Academic in style, the drawings represent a particular tradition
that seems alien to Dutch art and indeed, as the catalogue points out, they
owe their inspiration to the great Flemish artists, Rubens and Van Dyck.
Other large-scale figure drawings - by, for example, Berchem and Adriaen van
de Velde - also display a use of chalk that is more Italianate than Dutch.
The fact that there are gaps in the Abrams collection is witness more to the
very personal nature of the selection than to any oversight. There is for
example no drawing by Cuyp, none by Jan Both, hardly any Italianate
landscape drawings (a major genre), and not a single study of shipping by
Willem van de Velde or indeed any other master of seascape. Nor are there
any drawings by the Dutch Caravaggisti such as Honthorst or Stomer. Lacking
too are any drawings of architecture by a master such as Saenredam, who was
a prolific draughtsman, while Emanuel de Witte, who is known for his
paintings of church interiors, is represented by a very curious chalk
drawing of a nude Medusa. This is part of a very rare album of drawings by a
number of different artists that was bought from an English private
collection as recently as 1967.
No exhibition of Dutch art would be complete without some representation of
flower painting and in this respect the Abrams collection is no exception:
the watercolours on vellum of tulips by Jacob Marrel are simply sumptuous.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Synchronised sin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEN CAMPBELL'S directorial debut was organising the shallow end for the
Summer Water Show at Bournemouth. Campbell has swum a long way since then,
and with Pigspurt at the Riverside Studios presents not so much synchronised
swimming as synchronised sinning. For those prepared to take the plunge,
this is vastly enjoyable.
Campbell's tense anarchy has enlivened The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
the 22 hour Warp at the ICA, and created a lugubrious Gonzalo in Derek
Jarman's Tempest. If Pigspurt is not the most accessible Campbell, at least
his crazed invention, disregard of convention, and superb control are fully
available in this chaotic one man show.
Campbell spurns plot, opts for coincidences which take one from an
archeological dig in Oman via Hebrew football commentary in Munich to Pidgin
translations of Ken Dodd in the Solomon Islands. He has the extraordinary
gift of insinuating insanity everywhere. What starts as a paean to the stock
'Third Act Inspector' in detective dramas broadens into a portrait of the
Bishop of Colchester overcome by guffaws of laughter in the stalls,
squeezing Cub Scouts like bellows in his merriment.
After the break, Campbell finds that his nose resembles a woman in Man Ray
position (without the cello holes); the show's second half is a quest for
the perfect match, turning a bare possibility into a naked fact by
photographing nude women. Meanwhile - incomprehensibly - the right half of
Campbell's face becomes Elsie the housewife, the left half a randy squire
straight from Smollett; this turn of events ushers in transvestism and a
strange party at La Maitresse.
Further explanation beggars belief. Campbell is perplexing, infuriating and
refreshing; sometimes hilarious, often scatological, and always mad. Perhaps
it is no accident that he went to school in Barking.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Arts: Convulsions in the countryside - Patricia Morison
visits the Museum of Rural Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE consolation for being a reluctant urban-dweller is the BBC's superb
early morning farming programmes. Nothing brings home more sharply the
convulsions now taking place in the British countryside - or the reasons
why, apart from doctors, farmers have the highest rate of suicide. And yet,
it seems there is extraordinarily little awareness among the folk who this
Easter will be unloading the organic Brie and Frascati outside a thousand
rented cottages, that what happens to British farming will vitally affect
the countryside we urbanites currently enjoy.
Anyone seriously interested in the countryside will doubtless know, if only
by reputation, the Museum of English Rural Life at Reading, on the edge of
the University campus in a dreadful 1960s prefab. Started in 1951, the
museum houses a large collection (only a small part is on show) illustrating
the changing face of farming and rural industries between, roughly, 1850 and
1950. However, this permanent exhibition of 'rescue objects' is only the tip
of the haystack: it is but one part of the unique resources offered by
Reading University's Institute of Agricultural History.
First, however, the museum (0734-318660). These days, the countryside is
well stocked with rural museums dedicated to the bygone skills and
folk-customs of Thomas Hardy's England, etc. etc. aThe Reading Museum is
fairly old-fashioned and strictly educational, not Bank Holiday fare for
children. In the words of its Director, Dr Ted Collins, 'There are no chaps
leaping about in smocks here' - and besides, it is shut on public holidays.
This is a museum chronicling change in the countryside, not nostalgia, and
above all, the interface between industry and farming. In that respect, it
forms a remarkably good counterpart to Hardy's novels. In Tess of the
Durbervilles, written in the great agricultural depression of the 1880s,
Hardy's observes the reaper-and-binder, harvesting 'with the gentle ticking
of grasshoppers making love'; this refers to a revolutionary innovation
which, as I now know, was the invention of Cyrus H. McCormick of Virginia in
1831, and popularised here by the Great Exhibition 20 years later. School
history books tend to overlook one salient fact: the 'dark satanic Mills'
had as much impact on rural life in the 19th century as they did on urban
society. Men like Robert Ransome of Ipswich, whose business developed out of
patenting cold cast iron ploughshares, or Robert Boby of Bury St Edmunds who
invented the Boby corn screen, were as significant in their impact, not just
here but overseas, as ever Robert Arkwright with his spinning jenny.
Of course, in these days of the computerised milking parlour, photographs of
any pre-war farming activity are bound to strike a nostalgic chord. I was
fascinated to find that benighted farmers in Kent still used ox-teams in
1910, much like their ancestors in the Domesday Book. The Ransome's Hall
part of the museum houses a selection of fine wagons including the
quaintly-named Hermaphrodite of 'Maphrodite', a cross between a wagon and a
cart. There is also a collection of beautifully crafted model ploughs and a
mass of curious objects for making besoms, chair-bodging, dairying, and such
beastly operations as bloodletting horses (a fleam-stick) and cutting off
lambs' tails.
A small section portrays the changing image of the farmer in society. It
does not, alas, take the story as far as today's barley barons in their
Range Rovers, doomed as they may be to become the museum exhibits of
tomorrow. But it is piquant to read the laments of observers like Richard
Jeffries in the 1880s on the gentrification of Farmer Giles and, especially,
of his womenfolk. 'The daughter is pale and interesting and interprets
Beethoven, and paints the old mill, while a skilled person hired at a high
price rules in the dairy.' Newly pallid misses of that type were what Angel
Clare rejected in favour of poor, rosy-cheeked Tess.
So much for the museum, then, a good morning's outing. The Institute of
Agricultural History is a far more notable beast. Essentially, it is an
extraordinarily rich archive - over 30,000 books and periodicals, company
records, government bumph on farming, old films, union archives, and over
one million photographs - charting every aspect of the history and
development of the countryside from the late 19th century to the present
day. Most of the material is British, but not all, and many of the company
archives chart the rise and fall of British agricultural engineering exports
overseas.
The photographic archive is wonderful. Carefully indexed, it allows you to
check what steam lawnmowers looked like, and inspect the designs for
electricity pylons and village streetlighting considered in the 1930s (the
Council for the Preservation of Rural England has deposited its archives
here). Collectors of vintage farm machinery often consult the the Institute
because crammed onto its shelves are longhand ledgers of engineering firms
dating back to early last century.
People looking to set up 'traditional' rural industries, researchers working
on historical ecology, landscapists, historians of food, hunting, costume,
and agrarian political discontent, have access to invaluable material
through the Institute's computerised data base. In theory, you could use
deposits of old MAFF farm management surveys to check the profit sheet of
any farm in the land: unfortunately, these records are classified secret.
Dr Collins also points to the hitherto unexploited potential of the
Institute as a source of information for the development of alternative
technology. He would like to see more Third World governments funding
research into pre-tractorisation techniques. However, the premises of the
Institute are absurdly small for its collection and the archives, let alone
the activities of its staff and the public. An appeal has now been launched
by the University of Reading to make of the Museum and the Institute a new
entity, the Rural History Centre and is looking to raise Pounds 3.5m for a
new building. The Centre will link up with Reading University's strength in
in all aspects of agriculture, food production, and the environment at large
and could play a really significant part in helping the general public reach
a more informed, less sentimental understanding of the countryside and its
inhabitants.

FT  14 MAR 92 / White South Africa faces its last trek: On Tuesday, whites
vote in a referendum on political reform that could lead, after 350 years,
to rule for the black majority. Patti Waldmeir assesses the mood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'THE HISTORY of the Afrikaner reveals a will and a determination which makes
one feel that Afrikanerdom is not the work of men but the creation of God.'
 - Daniel Malan, South Africa's first National Party prime minister
With this grand vision of the Afrikaners as a chosen people in a promised
land, Malan ushered-in the era of apartheid which has so twisted the psyche
of all who live at this tortured tip of Africa. Now, apartheid is shuddering
to an end and Afrikaners must face something that many find too ghastly to
contemplate: the triumph of black Africa.
For 350 years, they have fought to keep Africa at bay. They have believed
the Afrikaner tribe would perish unless it had total domination. Apartheid
was to have been the Afrikaner's saviour - but it has failed him.
On Tuesday, whites will be asked to make the final leap into a multi-racial
future when they vote in a referendum on political reform. Beset by all the
old, atavistic fears of the black man, and more modern worries over economic
decline, the Afrikaner is setting out on his last great trek. Where will it
lead? 'Not to isolation this time, but to find a real home in the new South
Africa, a true fatherland at last,' says Afrikaner historian Professor FA
van Jaarsveld. 'A trek to accepting changed values. A trek to accepting the
inevitable."
Tuesday's vote will tell if a majority of the 3.5m Afrikaners are resigned
to such a trek. Clearly, many are not, for throughout the South African
platteland - the deeply-conservative home of the rural Afrikaner - the
prejudice of centuries dies hard. Spurred-on by a blend of arrogance and
fear which seems peculiarly Afrikaans, the dour farmers of the platteland
still shock the foreign visitor with their bigotry. I cannot count the times
I have been told - by God-fearing Afrikaner men and women throughout South
Africa - that blacks smell; that they cannot be trusted; that they are
unreliable drunkards with no inclination to work or save; and that they are
not really human.
Afrikaners challenge the self-righteous foreigner with the claim that
economic apartheid exists in every country; they believe South Africa's only
fault was to make it law. But such aggression reveals, as well, a dark fear
of being swamped by Africa; of being forced to go against the divine will as
interpreted by generations of Afrikaans pastors - that God created the races
to remain separate and mixing them is against both nature and religion. 'If
you're taught something all your life and then you're told it's a sin, it
makes life very scary,' says Dina Cronje, 57. Seated at a rough table in her
farmhouse kitchen near Warmbaths, in the heat and dust of the northern
Transvaal, she is outraged that the Dutch Reformed Church - the main
Afrikaner church - has branded apartheid a sin and that some church leaders
have apologised for it. 'I've never done anything to blacks so why should I
apologise?' she asks.
In her platteland community - where the cars are recent models but the
dresses and hair-styles would have been stylish in the 1960s - almost
everyone still believes that the Bible ordained apartheid. Cronje's
neighbour, Herculas Venter, 78, offers to prove this from the copy kept near
at hand in his sitting room. The argument focuses on Old Testament texts
which demand apartheid between the children of Israel and other heathen
nations.
For years, the Dutch Reformed Church (known, disparagingly, as the 'National
Party at prayer') distorted the Bible shamelessly to give apartheid a
theological basis. Since 1986 - when, miraculously, the church re-discovered
Christ's instruction: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,'
and branded apartheid a sin - its leaders have fought to persuade their
parishoners of the need for change. They have made little headway in
Warmbaths.
Cronje and her neighbours do not believe apartheid was wrong: it just did
not work. Its aim, they argue, was not to oppress the black man. In the
words of Afrikaner theologian Dr Carel Boshoff: '(Apartheid) was a serious
and honest effort to liberate the black nations.' Put more crudely, whites
believed blacks had to be segregated in separate tribal homelands to stop
them tearing out each other's throats. Many whites still do; they predict
civil war in the new South Africa, not between white and black but between
tribes of Africans.
Tannie (Aunt) Lettie Swart is convinced of it. When I knocked at her
screened back door, Tannie Lettie - like any 19th century Voortrekker wife -
was baking rusks in an old wood-burning stove. Scarcely had I stepped
through the door before she let me know that two of her aunts and her
grandmother had been interned in British concentration camps during the
Anglo-Boer war, and that the farm where we stood had been destroyed in the
fighting.
Stooped and bent at 75, Tannie Lettie's voice is faint with age. But her
opinions are forthright. 'The white people worked so hard, since van
Riebeeck's time (Jan van Riebeeck, the first European settler). Nothing was
done by the blacks. In the past four centuries, the whites are responsible
for all the growth: now, the blacks want to take it from us.'
Her neighbour Bucks Viljoen, 52, could not agree more. When I drew up
outside his tiny bungalow on a smallholding near Warmbaths, he was sweating
in the midday sun - along with his wife, Katerina, and mother, Anna Maria -
to build an ice-house to store the farm's slaughtered meat.
He wants to be self-sufficient and never uses black labour. But this means
that Anna Maria, 73, and Katerina, 46, have to help with the farm work. They
are a portrait of the poor white family. Anna Maria's face is like cured
leather from the sun; she wears a crushed hat and old trousers. Katerina is
plump and shapeless and looks after the four-year-old son of an unmarried
daughter.
The Viljoens demonstrate one of the abiding mysteries of Afrikaner
psychology: how, in the words of novelist Alan Paton, 'a nationalist can
observe the highest standards of behaviour towards his own kind, but can
observe an entirely different standard towards others.' Allister Sparks, an
historian and journalist, spells-out this paradox further in his book The
Mind of South Africa: 'Piety co-exists with cruelty, prayerfulness with an
aggressive militarism, a yearning to be understood and to be loved with a
national bellicosity and an impulse to tell the rest of the world to go to
hell.'
Bucks Viljoen embodies all these contradictions: polite to me at all times,
he is shockingly crude in his attitude to blacks ('the 'munt' is still
half-wild,' he told me, promising to 'shoot me a coupla kaffirs'). He is a
Christian but bars 'munts' from his church.
Viljoen is an extreme case of the platteland racist. But even among the more
enlightened platteland Afrikaners - and there are many who support political
reform, either by conviction or because they are resigned to it as
inevitable - the fear remains that Afrikaans culture will be swamped by the
very different values and practices of Africa and that Afrikaners will
become, once again, a subjugated nation in their land.
Afrikaner leaders always have taught that a pure white race could not
survive without a privileged position. As van Jaarsveld explains: 'Apartheid
was designed for the protection of the Afrikaner. Throughout the 20th
century, he felt threatened by the British - there was always the memory of
the Anglo-Boer war. 'Then, after the (second world) war, Afrikaners were
worried about the urbanisation of blacks. Apartheid was meant to protect
Afrikaners against the English, and against the rise of the black man.'
Throughout the platteland, Afrikaners recount the struggle against the
cultural and linguistic dominance of English. 'The Afrikaner, over the
years, had to fight like hell to maintain his language against English
influence,' says De Wet Nel, a retired lawyer in the Karoo town of
Carnarvon. 'You could read decent books only in English when I was young -
there was very limited reading matter available for Afrikaans-speaking
people. So it (the Afrikaans language) has had a hard struggle to get where
it is today.'
But Andries Botha, a liberal farmer in arch-conservative territory in the
Orange Free State, points out that the battle has left deep scars as
Afrikaners have forced other groups to speak their language. 'The
Nationalists made Afrikaans extremely unpopular and unpalatable to the rest
of the population,' he says.
Now, Nationalist leaders are fighting a rearguard action to get Afrikaans -
a creole of Dutch, French, English, Malay and African words - accepted as an
official language in the new South Africa. They argue that 13.3m South
Africans understand and speak it - 1m more than speak English - and that
5.5m to 6m regard it as their mother tongue, making it the third largest
home language after Zulu and Xhosa.
Leading Nationalist institutions such as the the Dutch Reformed Church and
the Broederbond (the Afrikaner secret society which directs much National
Party policy) finally have abandoned their strategy of purity in isolation.
To ensure the survival of the Afrikaans language and their culture, they
have redefined the very concept of an Afrikaner: now, you can qualify simply
by speaking Afrikaans and 'wanting to make one's future in Africa.' The
clear aim of this policy is to include the country's 3m coloureds
(mixed-race people) in the Afrikaner nation so as to give it critical mass.
Many Afrikaners - especially among the urban middle classes, the
professionals and the verligtes (enlightened ones) - see the threat of
Africa as more economic than cultural. They fear expropriation by a black
government, and the economic mismanagement which has turned much of the rest
of Africa into a wasteland. De Wet Nel points out that 40 years of apartheid
have left blacks ill-educated and unused to responsibility.
The view on the platteland - or in the working class suburbs of any major
city - is more emotional, though. Kobus Botha, a lawyer in the Orange Free
State town of Viljoenskroon, gives the apocalyptic view of the future. 'If
things end up the way they're heading now, the Afrikaner will be wiped out.
The white nation in South Africa will be . . . split up and chased all over
the world and this country will become just one more battlefield in Africa.'
Afrikaners are, more than at any time in history, divided over their future.
Boshoff says: 'Some want to enter the new South Africa purely on merit,
without guarantees for their values and culture; then another group wants to
take part, but with safeguards on language and education.' The third group,
for which Boshoff speaks, does not want to join the new South Africa at all;
it has founded a separate white state, called Orania, in the northern Cape.
Tuesday's vote will tell whether the majority of Afrikaners have resigned
themselves to life as an ethnic minority ruled, if not dominated, by blacks.
On the platteland, though, change will be slow to come - either way. As
Tannie Lettie steps into her dusty yard, taking the freshly-baked rusks to
an outdoor clay oven for drying, she is far from optimistic. 'I believe in
the will of God, but it's hard. We can try to live together, but I don't
think it will ever be good or pleasant. They are so DIFFERENT from us.' She
shakes her head, sadly. 'Sometimes, I think there's going to be a war.'

FT  14 MAR 92 / Inkatha leader in pact with S African right wing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR leader of South Africa's Zulu Inkatha party yesterday signed an
agreement with leaders of rightwing parties, in an attempt to persuade
whites to vote No in next week's referendum on whether the government should
continue negotiations to end apartheid.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, immediately repudiated the
agreement, announced by the head of Inkatha in the province of Transvaal, Mr
Musa Myeni.
Mr Myeni, who is one of Chief Buthelezi's most powerful lieutenants, held a
joint press conference with the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB), Mr Eugene
Terreblanche, and Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the ultra-right
Conservative party.
They said they had signed a non-aggression pact aimed at persuading whites,
in the words of Mr Terreblanche, that 'they will not be murdered by black
people if the No vote wins this referendum'.
This was a reference to a statement earlier in the day by Mr Nelson Mandela,
leader of the African National Congress (ANC), that race war would be
inevitable if political reform is rejected in the referendum.
The ruling National party has used the prospect of a race war to try to
persuade whites to vote Yes in the referendum, which will determine whether
negotiations on a new constitution continue.
The announcement could undermine the campaign of President F. W. de Klerk,
who was mobbed yesterday by rightwing students at Pretoria University. They
tried to beat him over the head with a placard.
Many National party supporters have long hoped for an alliance with Inkatha
to prevent domination by the ANC in a future government. Yesterday's deal
will shake their confidence in the prospect for such an alliance.
The pact will also give credence to charges that rightwing whites have been
involved in black-on-black violence which has left 11,000 people dead since
1984.
Violence has flared again since the whites-only referendum was announced
three weeks ago, with nearly 230 people dead in that period. Some 25 were
killed yesterday alone.
Chief Buthelezi reacted furiously to news of the deal between Mr Myeni and
the leadership of the Conservative party and its paramilitary ally, the AWB.
He distanced himself from the CP's policy of separate homelands for whites
and blacks, saying the creation of racially-divided states was
'unthinkable'.
Black community leaders said they feared news of an alliance between part of
Inkatha and the white supremacists of the AWB - who dress in khaki
paramilitary uniforms and carry guns - could inflame township violence.
It was not clear whether Mr Myeni intended to lead a breakaway faction from
Inkatha into a formal alliance with the AWB, nor was it clear whether Mr
Hartzenberg spoke for the the CP leadership.

THE US has moved the aircraft carrier America into the Gulf, as the United
Nations prepares for an intensified effort to force Iraq to co-operate in
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
The move was disclosed as a UN inspection team prepared to return to Baghdad
next week to continue its mission to track down Iraqi ballistic missile
arsenals.
US defence department officials said the aircraft carrier, which has about
80 warplanes, entered the Gulf on Thursday with an escort of a cruiser, a
frigate and two supply ships.
Officials cautioned that the US had maintained a considerable naval presence
in the Gulf region for some time. The America was not the first US aircraft
carrier to enter the Gulf since the end of the allied military operation
that drove Iraq out of Kuwait last year.
They said the US had 22 naval vessels in the Gulf, along with seven in the
Mediterranean and five in the Red Sea and a strong naval presence would
remain in the region as long as was necessary to enforce the UN economic
embargo on Iraq.
The latest move is regarded as a public display of US determination to put
pressure on the regime of President Saddam Hussein, rather than a militarily
significant deployment. The US in fact already has more than enough
warplanes in place to strike at Iraqi targets if necessary.
Although options are considered limited, President George Bush has said he
would 'contemplate all alternatives' to press Iraq to obey UN orders. Mr
John Major has indicated Britain does not rule out a military strike if Iraq
defies the UN.
The UN Security Council clashed with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, at a meeting in New York this week over what the council said was
Iraq's continued refusal to comply with terms of the Gulf war ceasefire.
Visiting Iraqi experts led by General Mohamed Rashid Amir, a deputy minister
of heavy industry, continued talks last night with UN officials in charge of
the programme to dismantle Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the programme, intends to despatch UN inspectors to
Baghdad next week for another attempt to locate and eliminate the remainder
of the ballistic missile arsenals. More than 60 missiles with a range of
150km or more have been destroyed, but the UN believes there are other
secret stocks.
It was announced last night that talks would resume in Vienna next week on
how to arrange limited sales of Iraqi oil so that the country can buy food
and medicines abroad.
Talks were broken off last month, but the Iraqis agreed this week to make a
new effort to reach an accord. The Iraqis have complained that the deal
would operate in such a way as to violate their sovereignty.
A UN resolution authorising sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 900m) of Iraqi oil
expires next week. But Mr Diego Arria of Venezuela, Security Council
president, promised a decision would be made next week on whether to extend
the authorisation.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Volvo winds up import deal with Lex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car maker, is ending its exclusive import agreement with
Lex Service four years early to take direct control over the distribution of
its vehicles in the UK.
The premature termination of a relationship that goes back 33 years will
cost Volvo more than Pounds 100m. In the heyday of Volvo imports in 1988-89,
more than 80,000 cars a year were sold in the UK - Volvo's second most
important market.
Last year, in a UK car market that was 30 per cent down on its 1989 record
of 2.3m units, Volvo's figure was 47,000 - a share of just under 3 per cent.
Volvo said the ending of the agreement reflected no disappointment in Lex.
It followed the creation of a European marketing section in Brussels.
The Swedish group is following Nissan and Toyota, the Japanese
manufacturers, which have set out to acquire control of their
importer/distributor operations from independent franchises. Volkswagen also
seems determined to take control of VW/Audi in the UK from Lonrho.
Last year Volvo Concessionaires contributed a Pounds 13m operating profit to
Lex's total of Pounds 16.2m. Profit peaked for the import business at about
Pounds 50m in the late 1980s.
Lex's results, announced yesterday, showed a slide in pre-tax profit, after
Pounds 16.5m of interest payments, to Pounds 500,000 on turnover of Pounds
1.32bn. Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman, blamed 'appalling conditions in the UK
motor industry'.
He said that after receiving the Volvo cash and selling its European
electronics components business, the group could have Pounds 70m cash by the
end of this year, on top of an investment worth about Pounds 60m in Arrow
Electronics, an international distribution business.
Lex's share price dropped 30p yesterday to close at 205p, giving the group a
market value of about Pounds 191m.

volume

Wall Street
SHARE prices firmed yesterday, but the strength of the gains was somewhat
undermined by the lack of volume in the lightest week of trading this year,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 27.28 higher, at 3,235.91. Big board
volume was meagre, 176.6m shares changing hands on the day as advances led
declines by 985 to 671.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.95 higher at 405.84, while the Nasdaq
composite was up 2.70, at 618.62. On Thursday, the Dow had closed unchanged,
at 3,208.63.
Equities received some support from the release of the February producer
price index. This rose 0.2 per cent, or 0.1 per cent excluding the volatile
food and energy components, adding to the picture of a recovering economy.
Bonds also posted gains initially on the PPI release, but technical selling
pushed yields higher.
Pfizer was one of the most active NYSE issues of the day, tumbling Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 71 3/8 , as the market registered concern that risks related
to the company's Shiley heart valve were higher than previously estimated.
Late on Thursday, the Food &amp; Drug Administration asked Pfizer to warn
patients that the rate of fracture for some of the valves was as much as
five times higher than previously thought. The FDA said that some patients
should consider having their implanted valves replaced.
Among other heavily-traded big board shares, Dayton Hudson regained some of
its Thursday losses by climbing Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 . The stock
had fallen Dollars 5 3/4 after the retailer turned in its 1991 results,
which included lower operating profits in all three of its divisions.
A number of blue chip issues ranked among the most active on the NYSE. These
included IBM, Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 89 5/8 , American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 38 1/4 , and Ford Motor, off
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
General Motors slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 after credit-rating
agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the car maker's senior debt. GM posted a
17.4 per cent increase in early March car sales and a 10.9 per cent rise in
truck sales.
Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 3/4 , as company directors
prepared for a special weekend meeting to find a successor to Mr Lee Iacocca
as chairman. Mr Iacocca is due to step down at the end of the year.
In the secondary market, high tech and biotech stocks dominated trading.
Lotus Development added Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 , after an analyst
at Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock's rating to 'buy' from 'hold'.
DDI Pharmaceuticals plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 3 1/4 , after the
company said that a phase III study of its bovine superoxide dismutase, to
treat osteoarthritis, had showed negligible effectiveness.
Canada
TORONTO's 300-composite index lost 4.05 points, closing at 3475.79. The
index was off about 55 points on the week. Declining issues topped advances
by 305 to 223. Volume was 35.1m shares and trading value was CDollars
315.8m.
International Corona shot up 80 cents to CDollars 4.95, with about 7.1m
shares changing hands. Homestake Mining and Corona said that they had agreed
to a business combination through a share exchange, whereby Homestake will
offer 0.35 of its shares for each Corona common share.

FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lex Service collapses to Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEX SERVICE, the motor group, yesterday announced the virtual disappearance
of pre-tax profits in 1991 and the early ending of its exclusive import
agreement with Volvo.
Volvo Concessionaires has been the mainstay of Lex's profits for years,
making about Pounds 50m in 1988 and Pounds 13m last year. The share price
shed 30p to close at 205p, about 40 per cent of its pre-1987 crash high.
Pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 500,000, after interest costs
of Pounds 16.5m, on turnover of Pounds 1.32bn (Pounds 1.79bn). Losses per
share were 3.2p (earnings 4.9p) and the final dividend is cut to 6p for a
total of 10p (15.3p).
The ending of the Volvo agreement will bring in more than Pounds 100m for
Lex. This comprises Pounds 20m cash on completion, Pounds 20m cash for
properties, and three non-interest-bearing loan notes totalling Pounds 80m.
It is anticipated that Lex will realise about Pounds 67m from their sale.
Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the group would have
cash of about Pounds 70m by the end of this year, compared with Pounds 57m
net debt in December for gearing of 34 per cent.
Combined with a 34 per cent stake worth more than Pounds 60m in Arrow
Electronics, a US-based international distributor, this gave scope for
expanding the motor dealership network, the vehicle leasing business and
possibly taking on another import concession.
Last year, motor distribution contributed Pounds 14.9m trading profit on
sales of Pounds 1.12bn. Volvo Concessionaires' shares were Pounds 13m and
Pounds 564m.
Associates, mainly joint ventures in vehicle leasing, which in 1990
accounted for Pounds 540m of off balance sheet liabilities, contributed
Pounds 800,000.
The group has now virtually got out of electronic components distribution
(other than the Arrow stake). Arrow bought the North American operation last
year and the European one last month.
This was Lex's diversification of the 1980s after earlier forays into such
things as hotels and employment agencies. However, even in the record year
of 1988, vehicles accounted for all but Pounds 3.6m of Pounds 70.4m pre-tax
profit.
Yesterday Sir Trevor said of the latest expansion plans: 'We do not intend
to enter any new business areas outside the automotive industry.'
This year he expected demand for new cars to start to grow again, helped by
the cut in special car tax in the Budget. The group would also enjoy the
benefits of cost cuts.
Contract hire had turned round. Pre-tax profit from the joint ventures with
Lombard North Central was expected to be Pounds 4m for the six months to
March 31, compared with a Pounds 5.2m loss in 1990/91.
Taken with the elimination of gearing, the improvement in the business this
year was expected to 'amply justify a maintained level of dividend'.

FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rothschild expected to advise on sale of
MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NM ROTHSCHILD, the merchant bank, is expected to be appointed next week as
adviser on the sale of Mirror Group Newspapers in the first indications of
preparations for the disposal of the group.
It is believed that the majority shareholding in MGN could be ready for sale
by the summer, although no final timetable has been drawn up.
Partners at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, who are acting as
administrators to the private business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
are expected to make a final decision on the appointment of advisers within
the next few days. They are believed to be favouring Rothschild over a rival
bid from Morgan Grenfell.
The purchaser of MGN might not be able to take control until towards the end
of the year as any sale may need ratification by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The administrators are believed to have received expressions of interest
from at least ten potential purchasers.
The sale of the principal UK businesses of AGB, the market research company
from the administrators of the private empire of Robert Maxwell, to Addison
Consultancy was completed yesterday.
A rights issue offer document issued last month to raise money to buy the
AGB businesses, showed that it was paying Pounds 14.75m.
Sales of other AGB companies overseas are expected within the next few
weeks.

FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: GPA float goes ahead with SEC filing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS PEAT Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, is to
go public in June after yesterday it prepared to make a preliminary filing
with the Securities Exchange Commission in Washington, the US regulator.
The flotation, which could value the group at more than Dollars 3bn, (Pounds
1.7bn) will be one of the most ambitious attempts to market shares in the
big share markets of the world.
GPA will obtain listings simultaneously in New York and London. The Japanese
share sale will be a public offering without listing, a technique pioneered
in the sale of the UK water industry.
The sale, aimed primarily at investment institutions, will raise hundreds of
millions of dollars in new money for the company, needed to finance its
ambitious programme of aircraft purchases.
The total value of shares on offer, likely to be no more than Dollars 1.5bn,
will depend on how many of its existing shareholders wish to sell.
GPA's executives will become multi-millionaires out of the offering. The
shareholding of Mr Tony Ryan, the group's chairman and founder, is likely to
be worth more than Dollars 200m at the flotation price, which has yet to be
agreed.
The company and its advisers disagreed over the share price, the advisers
arguing for a price closer to Dollars 20 compared with GPA's preferred price
of about Dollars 30. The advisers are now understood to be arguing for a
price between Dollars 20 to Dollars 25.
The lead managers are Nomura in Japan, which is also global co-ordinator,
Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, which raised Dollars 500m for the group by
way of a public bond issue, in the US and Schroders in the UK. Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and Davy Stockbrokers are brokers to the sale.
The aircraft leasing group based in the Irish Republic made after-tax
profits of Dollars 73m (Pounds 40.1m) for the three months to December 31,
compared with Dollars 55.5m.
Net profits for the nine months were Dollars 196.5m, only just ahead of the
corresponding 1990 figure of Dollars 195.8m, but the group is confident of
record profits in excess of Dollars 261m for the 12 months when it publishes
its year-end results in June.

FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Allied Radio cuts deficit to Pounds 1.57m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, the former Third Mile Investment which, last September,
acquired County Sound and Radio Mercury, covering Surrey, north Sussex and
north Hampshire, reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.74m to Pounds
1.57m in the year to December 31.
However the merger was completed only a few days before September 30, the
traditional year-end for UK commercial radio companies, and the date to
which Allied will change its year-end. These results therefore, reflect only
the activities of TMI, rather than the trading results of both radio
stations, which are now the core business. The accounts do show, though,
corporate costs and interest due on the loan stock since the merger.
Allied also owns 24.9 per cent of Fox FM in Oxfordshire and 20 per cent of
Pirate FM in Cornwall.
Trading profits came to Pounds 66,000 (losses Pounds 484,000) and there was
an exceptional loss of Pounds 764,000 (Pounds 1.54m) relating to a provision
for the permanent diminution in value of the group's non-radio investment
portfolio.
Losses per share were cut to 23.8p (83.4p).

Reduced losses of Pounds 872,000 were announced by Forward Technology
Industries, maker of ultrasonic cleaning and welding equipment and
specialist in duplicating tapes and discs, for the year to December 31. The
loss for 1990 was Pounds 2.34m.
Mr Brian Chilver, the chairman, said that exceptional costs of Pounds
253,000 (Pounds 1.37m) reflected the reorganisation of the trading
divisions. He added that the electronics activity had achieved a turnround
in profitability of Pounds 1.3m because of rationalisation measures taken in
1990.
Turnover for the year fell to Pounds 39.8m (Pounds 44.6m) but there were
operating profits of Pounds 111,000 against losses of Pounds 155,000. The
loss per share fell to 2.4p (8.4p).

<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Headway, the consumer and industrial goods specialist once
known as Beaverco, were more than doubled to Pounds 795,000 in the six
months to December 31.
The comparative figures are previously unpublished because the group changed
its year-end in September. Turnover, affected by the difficult trading
conditions, slipped to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 12.2m). Operating losses were
Pounds 761,000 (profits Pounds 57,000), and were mostly, said Mr Denis
Cassidy, chairman, attributable to Aronstead, the garden furniture company.
The other companies in the group showed profits.
Interest payable was reduced to Pounds 319,000 (Pounds 504,000) and there
was an exceptional gain of Pounds 285,000 relating to profit from a property
sale.
After estimated tax credits of Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 134,000), losses for
the period were halved to Pounds 533,000 (Pounds 1.08m) - there was no
extraordinary charge this time. Losses per share grew to 4.2p (2.8p).

THE US subsidiaries of Bank of Ireland incurred an increased pre-tax loss of
Dollars 123.4m (Pounds 70m) last year, against Dollars 99.8m. The bank
blamed the continuing recession in New Hampshire, where its subsidiaries
operated, and the severe decline in real estate values during 1991.
There is also a Dollars 4m extraordinary item arising from additional
wind-down costs for Vendor Funding.
Total assets of Bank of Ireland First Holdings, which controls the US
subsidiaries, rose by 52 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn, reflecting the purchases
last autumn of Amoskeag Bank and BankEast Corporation. Total deposits were

The company said that the trading position was substantially worse than was

Large losses on the manufacturing side were blamed, coupled with a
disappointing year for the merchanting activities which had been hit by
lower sales and reduced margins.
Mr Christopher Bostock has resigned as chairman to be replaced by Mr Martin

FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lonrho gloom in spite of Pounds 45m sale to
Trinity - Recession leaves Liverpool Post group 27% lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, yesterday announced the sale
of its Scottish and Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity
International Holdings.
But the sale was overshadowed by a series of negative factors which pushed
Lonrho's shares down 19p to close at 95p, its lowest price since 1985.
Although the newspaper sale will be used to chip away at Lonrho's Pounds 1bn
debt the market was disappointed that the disposal did not include the
larger George Outram, publishers of the Glasgow Herald and Evening Times.
The sale of all Lonrho's newspaper titles had been expected to fetch up to
Pounds 200m.
News that the long-term debt of Lonrho had been accorded a rating three
notches below investment grade by Moody's, the US rating agency, also
affected the shares.
Warburg Securities added to the bad news by publishing a bearish note
warning that the underlying businesses were consuming cash, requiring
further disposals. At the same time exchange movements were continuing to
eat into Lonrho's asset base.
There were also fears in the market that Lonrho's Western Platinum mine,
located in South Africa where almost a third of the pre-tax profits are
generated, would be adversely affected by a 'no' vote in the referendum
taking place on political change.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said the fall in the group's
shares made him feel sorry for shareholders but pointed out that several big
US institutions were buying. He described the newspaper sale to Trinity as a
'very good deal for Lonrho' which should be seen as part of the group's
overall disposal programme.
The Scottish papers have a combined circulation of 600,000 and in the year
to the September 28 made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m on turnover of
Pounds 21.6m.
Trinity is raising Pounds 23.6m by way of a 1-for-5 rights issue at 215p
compared with yesterday's unchanged share price of 270p.
At the same time the group announced a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 13.3m, for 1991. A final dividend of 5.8p makes
8.4p (8p).
Mr David Snedden, Trinity's chief executive, blamed the profit fall on the
recession on both sides of the Atlantic. As well as being publishers of the
Liverpool Post and Echo, it has weekly newspaper interests in Merseyside,
North Wales and North America.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Law lords to assess legal convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW LORDS are to review the long-standing legal convention that
statements made by a minister in promoting an act of parliament cannot
normally be looked at when a court is interpreting the act.
The review has been prompted by a case concerning a schoolmaster who was
granted tuition fees for his son at the school where he taught at 20 per
cent of the normal rate.
The Inland Revenue argued that this concession was a taxable benefit.
During the passage of the 1976 Finance Bill Mr Robert Sheldon, then chief
secretary to the Treasury, argued that the taxable liability on school fees
would be very small. There is no reflection of this statement in the act.
When the case reached the House of Lords seven law lords decided that a
Lords appellate committee should consider 'whether and in what circumstances
parliamentary debates on a bill may be used as an aid to construction of the
ensuing act.'
Mr Michael Bishopp, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse, said a
decision in favour of the Inland Revenue could affect many employees - for
example, transport and entertainment workers who receive cheap tickets.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Lewis's pension trustees may take legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAW Debenture Corporation, trustees of the pension fund of the Lewis's
stores group which went into receivership last year, is considering legal
action against the former trustees claiming they may not have acted in the
best interests of beneficiaries.
While there are no allegations of fraud or that the trustees benefited
personally, Law Debenture is questioning two transactions which appear to
have benefited the company at the expense of beneficiaries.
The former trustees were all executives or directors of Lewis's, which was
formed in 1988 as part of a management buyout from Sears. When the buyout
occurred Sears transferred pension assets to Lewis's intended to cover its
former employees' pension liabilities and to provide a surplus.
Lewis's crashed early last year with debts of Pounds 50m after its bankers
refused to extend overdraft facilities.
Law Debenture said that although the investments deprived pension fund
members of about Pounds 3m out of a Pounds 14m fund, it had enough funds to
meet all obligations to pensioners and was likely to be able to meet the
cost of likely new laws requiring equal pensions for men and women.
It is examining the pension fund's decision to purchase from Lewis's a
derelict building in February 1990 for Pounds 2.4m. This represented about a
quarter of the fund's assets at the time. The building had been purchased by
Lewis's for the same amount the year before, just as UK property prices were
beginning to soften. Law Debenture said there was no evidence that a full
independent valuation of the property was made at the time of the sale to
the pension fund.
Solicitors for the former trustees, Ellison Westhorp, said the trustees
viewed the property as an excellent development site which was likely to
appreciate sharply over the next few years. They believed its eventual sale
would cover any future contributions Lewis's would have to make to the fund.
Negotiations for the sale of the property are set to be completed shortly
with the pension fund expected to lose about Pounds 1.6m on the transaction.
Law Debenture is also questioning the extension of an unsecured Pounds 1.25m
loan in August 1990, six months before the company went into receivership
and when it was already experiencing financial difficulties. Although
interest was to be paid at a rate close to current bank base rates, Law
Debenture believes the terms were more generous than a commercial lender
would have extended on an unsecured loan to Lewis's given its financial
difficulties.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Burlington footwear group goes into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURLINGTON International Group, the footwear manufacturer, yesterday called
in administrative receivers after amassing unsustainable levels of debt,
which are estimated at Pounds 10m.
A total of 1,200 jobs in the Midlands, Ayrshire and London were put at risk
by the company's collapse. Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers, immediately made
200 employees redundant, mainly in Northampton.
In a further blow to the Midlands economy, Albert Martin Holdings, a
clothing supplier, announced it would make 195 compulsory redundancies by
stopping production at its Nottingham factory in June. The group has a
workforce of 4,300.
Burlington International Group was formed when a management group, backed by
Schroder Ventures, the venture capital company, paid Pounds 10m for 15
British Shoe Corporation factories owned by Sears.
At that time the BSC factories had annual sales of Pounds 50m but Burlington
expanded rapidly by acquiring a string of financially troubled rivals.
The company's pension fund later made significant investments in the
business. The receivers said they had been informed by the trustees that all
pension commitments were fully covered.
Northampton-based Burlington was the UK's third-largest footwear
manufacturer until it closed six of its nine Northampton factories in
January, shedding more than 500 jobs.
The company also has production plants at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire; Wembley,
north London; Atherstone, near Birmingham; and Kettering, Northamptonshire.
It ran six loss-making retail outlets.
Industry observers believed that the receivers might find buyers for
Burlington's Kettering and Kilmarnock plants but would find it more
difficult to sell the Northampton units. The receivers said several
potential buyers had expressed interest in parts of the group.
Mr Nicholas Calvert, director-general of the British Footwear Manufacturers'
Association, said: 'The recession has put enormous pressure on the industry.
Manufacturers have been caught between falling sales and rising occupancy
costs. Rents have spiralled upwards and the uniform business rate has been
an additional heavy burden.'
Retailers have been buying an ever-increasing proportion of footwear from
overseas to try to keep prices low. Sears, owner of the BSC, by far the
biggest retailer of footwear in the UK with almost one-fifth of the market,
now places orders in many overseas countries. It said Burlington's collapse
would have a 'negligible impact' on supplies.
Mr Calvert said: 'Retailers have been cutting back on ordering in the UK and
have bought at the lowest cost they can get.'

FT  14 MAR 92 / 'Supergun' report splits MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs investigating the Iraqi 'supergun' affair split yesterday over a report
which criticises officials but stops short of attacking the intelligence
services and ministers.
The cross-party trade and industry select committee approved by six votes to
four a report to be published on Monday - hours before the Commons rises for
the election.
Four Conservative MPs on the committee tried to block the report, partly
because they believe criticisms implied in it have not been properly
substantiated or investigated.
The Department of Trade and Industry has said it was not fully briefed about
the Iraqi project until March 1990, when eight sections of steel tubing
manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters were seized by customs officials.
The report blames the DTI and the Ministry of Defence for not pooling
information which, if put together, should have provoked suspicions much
earlier. It suggests, however, the mistakes were innocent, rather than part
of a conspiracy.

FT  14 MAR 92 / BBC review may cut 10,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC should review the potential for contracting out all its activities,
which could cost up to 10,000 jobs over the next five years, according to an
internal working party.
The radical recommendations are contained in a confidential report by one of
the 15 task forces set up to look at every aspect of the BBC's role in
advance of the renegotiation of its Royal Charter, which runs out in 1996.
Recommendations from all the task forces are being collated and will be
considered by the BBC board of management and governors in May.
The task force on BBC services argues that all BBC activities should be
reviewed this year to see whether they are suitable for contracting out.
Some BBC departments could even be 'privatised' by sale or management
buy-out.
The committee, chaired by Mr Bob Pugh, general manager of administrative
services at London Television Centre, says implementation should start by
early next year.
The document, leaked to the Bectu broadcasting union, says: 'Rapid
implementation would help show politicians, civil servants and the public
that the corporation has a genuine commitment to becoming leaner and more
efficient.'
At the beginning of last year there were about 23,500 staff in the home
services of the BBC - 25,000 including BCC Enterprises and Open University
production staff.
The savings mentioned in the report would come from buying in services and
from Producer Choice, the BBC initiative allowing producers to buy services
on the open market.
Mr Michael Checkland, BBC director general, has repeatedly emphasised that
the corporation would remain a significant programme producer.
Mr Roger Bolton, the Bectu official responsible for BBC members, said: 'What
you are looking at is the disintegration of the BBC as a programme maker.'
Earlier this month Mr Robin Corbett, Labour's broadcasting spokesman, wrote
to Mr Checkland warning that the nature of the corporation was being changed
irreversibly in advance of a public debate getting under way.

TEN BUILDINGS in London's Holborn, including the Mirror Group headquarters
and Maxwell House, have been put up for sale by Grant Thornton, the
receivers to Robert Maxwell Estates, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The buildings, which cover nearly three acres bounded by Fetter Lane and New
Fetter Lane, were valued last year at Pounds 120m, although the value has
fallen sharply since then.
Robert Maxwell Estates had obtained planning permission to redevelop the
site with 500,000 sq ft of offices and 250,000 sq ft of retail property.
Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, property consultants, said there was interest in
the site as a whole, although the collapse in the property market made the
redevelopment unviable.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Inmos plans closure of Welsh superchip plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INMOS, the semiconductor company which invented the transputer
microprocessor - the 'computer on a chip' - plans to close its fabrication
plant in Newport, south Wales, unless it receives government aid.
The move by Inmos, now owned by SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian
semiconductor manufacturer, follows prolonged speculation about the plant's
future.
Closure may end a controversial and often politically charged chapter in the
history of the UK semiconductor industry. It would also mean the end of UK
manufacture of the transputer, which is one of the few successful
semiconductor inventions to come out of Britain - and one that had been
hailed as a key to regaining British leadership in the computer industry.
The plant's planned closure in a year to 18 months is likely to rekindle
debate about UK industrial policy and its failure to keep strategic
technologies in home ownership.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the closure of
the plant would mean 'yet more high technology redundancies and yet another
British invention lost to British manufacturing for good'.
Inmos said that because of the response to its decision it would now apply
for aid to the Welsh Office. It said it had not applied before because
several months of discussion had led it to believe that aid was unlikely.
The result of its application could alter the decision to close the plant,
Inmos said.
Inmos was set up in 1978 by the Labour government in an effort to win a
leadership position for Britain in microelectronics. The government invested
huge sums in the company to enable it to develop the transputer, a
semi-conductor which can process a large amount of data concurrently at very
high speeds.
While Labour looked to the transputer as a revolutionary device which could
help Britain gain leadership in semiconductors, the succeeding Conservative
government delayed funding and then sold Inmos to Thorn EMI in 1984. Thorn
sold Inmos to SGS-Thomson in 1989.
The transputer recently won a significant endorsement when IBM, the world's
largest computer manufacturer, decided to use the device as a control
mechanism.
Inmos said, however, that it did not make economic sense for SGS-Thomson to
invest the Pounds 50m or so needed to upgrade the Newport plant in order to
satisfy volume production.
The financially pressed group has recently made huge investments in other
semiconductor fabrication plants.
Production at Newport will be gradually wound down and transferred to
SGS-Thomson plants at Rousset, in southern France, Agrate in Italy and
Carrollton, Texas.
There will be a limited number of redundancies among the 450-strong
workforce in the next month, but there are no detailed plans for overall
redundancies when the plant finally closes.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Switch from poodles to politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ROSETTE makers Tony and Jenny Curgenven the Tory choice of an April
general election could not be better - timed as it is before the start of
the dog show season, Chris Tighe writes.
Turning their attentions from chihuahuas and Great Danes to politicians, the
couple and their six staff will produce tens of thousands of rosettes over
the next few weeks, to be worn from Wales to Durham.
Dalsetter Designs, based in a former school in East Ardsley, near Wakefield,
West Yorkshire, is one of more than a dozen rosette makers likely to be
burning the midnight oil to fulfil election orders. 'It will help us out
tremendously, it'll pay off a few bills,' said Mr Curgenven yesterday.
He has already had a taste of election fever. His company's decision earlier
this year not to quote for a Conservative party order of 1m rosettes has
been wrongly interpreted by the media, says Mr Curgenven, as an indication
of his political affiliations. Such an order was just too big for a small
business like his to handle. No way was Mr Curgenven, who prefers to keep
his political views private, going to risk letting down his pigeon-fancying,
dog-owning regulars.
The company is producing rosettes for both Labour and the Tories.
After April 9 Mr Curgenven will be back to rosettes for dog shows and
gymkhanas. But he would not object to a hung parliament.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Car tax oversight rectified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday rectified a Budget oversight which could have
proved very costly to car and motorcycle dealers.
Under the proposed Special Car Tax rules dealers had been faced with the
prospect of having to charge customers the new 5 per cent rate to cars and
motorcycles in stock, even though they had already paid the old 10 per cent
rate.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation, the dealers' trade organisation, said
that up to 20,000 cars at various stages in the supply pipeline could have
been caught in the trap at a cost of several million pounds had ministers
not intervened.
Winding up the second reading debate on the Finance Bill to enact the Budget
measures, Mr Francis Maude, the financial secretary to the Treasury, told
the Commons that dealers would be allowed to claim refunds on all such
vehicles.
Customs and Excise has introduced an extra-statutory class concession to
enable refunds of the tax differential to be made in respect of tax-paid
stock which was held by dealers but unsold on March 10.
The announcement came as Vauxhall, Ford's arch rival, responded to deep
price cuts in some of Ford's cheaper car models in the immediate aftermath
of the Budget.
Vauxhall has declined to cut prices but said that it was adding value worth
up to Pounds 850 to some of its models. Mr Bill Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman,
insisted that Vauxhall's cheapest Nova small hatchback was still Pounds 600
cheaper than the equivalent Ford Fiesta in spite of the price cuts.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Doubts in City will ease, says MacGregor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INITIAL DOUBTS in the City about the effectiveness of the Budget will be
dispelled as the general election campaign gathers momentum, Mr John
MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said yesterday.
Replying to taunts from the Labour benches that the City had given the
Budget the 'thumbs down,' he said: 'Like all good things people come to
appreciate them better the more they study them.'
MPs approved the Finance Bill embodying the key Budget proposals after
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs failed in a last-ditch attempt to block the
introduction of a 20p lower-rate income tax band for the first Pounds 2,000
of taxable income.
The relevant clause was approved by a government majority of 182 (325 - 143)
and, with the parliamentary guillotine used to curtail debate, the bill was
rushed through all stages in just over two hours.
The Lords will formally approve the bill on Monday before parliament is
dissolved.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, argued that the action
taken to restrict debate on the bill reflected the government's desperation
'to get its bribe on the statute book'.
He claimed that the City's verdict on the Budget showed that the launch of
the Conservative election campaign had stalled.
To Labour cheers Mr Cunningham said: 'The rocket motor has simply fizzled
out like a damp squib'.
He said Labour MPs were opposed to the 20p lower rate band because they
believed any money available 'in these desperately difficult financial
circumstances' should go into investment.
Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, recalled that Mr John
Smith, the shadow chancellor, had advocated a lower rate income tax band as
recently as last month. By opposing the 20p band, he said, Labour MPs were
sacrificing their aims on the 'altar of a false and superficial commitment
to fiscal probity'.
Mr Mellor confirmed that if the government secured a renewed mandate a
second finance bill running to 75 pages of legislation would be introduced
to implement the reduction in inheritance tax and the other outstanding
Budget proposals.
His assertion that a 'lot less' than 800 additional staff would be needed to
administer the 20p rate band was strongly disputed from the opposition
benches.
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Treasury affairs, said the
additional staff needed would make it 'the greatest job-creation element in
the Budget'.
He said the chancellor's proposals amounted to a 'political gamble' which
offered no hope of getting Britain out of recession.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Tories accuse Labour of lacking experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVE party's first rally of the campaign opened with a sustained
attack on the alleged lack of experience among leading figures in the Labour
party.
Launching a national poster campaign - in which a learner-driver's 'L' plate
is used as the first letter of the word Labour - Mr Chris Patten, the Tory
party chairman, and senior colleagues highlighted the choice between Mr John
Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, as the next prime minister.
In a speech surveying the international scene Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, pressed home the contrast with a tribute to Mr Major's diplomacy
in the 15 months of his premiership, and the risks ahead in the post-Cold
War world order.
A further sign that the party plans a forward-looking campaign based less on
its record than on its vision of the future, came in an appeal to first-time
voters from Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary.
Mr Heseltine's speech, which won the most enthusiastic response of the
afternoon from the 800 representatives, said Labour's message of higher
taxes for both rich and poor would discourage the young from enterprise and
taking responsibility.
Mr Heseltine portrayed Labour as rushing like the charge of the light
brigade 'into the valley of taxes'.
The day was dominated by hammering home Labour's decision to vote against
the Budget proposal for a 20 per cent tax rate for the first Pounds 2,000 of
taxable income.
The Tories are confident that the opposition to the reduced rate band leaves
Labour more vulnerable on tax even than its previous policy of raising the
top tax rate and removing the ceiling on national insurance contributions.
Mr Patten, reinforcing the Tories' central message that Labour cannot be
trusted with the economy, said the only thing the party could be trusted to
do was to raise taxes.
'Neil Kinnock's message is simple: 'Read my lips, lots more taxes',' he
said.
Both Mr Patten and Mr Heseltine drew murmurs of support from the audience of
senior party workers when they attacked Labour's 'scare campaign' on the
health service.
Party officials said that the negative campaigning tone of the day's
speeches would change today with the address from the prime minister which,
in setting out his vision of the future for Britain would set the tone for
the campaign.

Budget in place / A look at details of financial measures passed yesterday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCE Bill enacting part of the Budget statement was published and
passed in the Commons yesterday before dissolution of Parliament on Monday.
Some of the announcements made in the Budget on Tuesday are not included,
such as the move to limit the rise in the uniform business rate to the rate
of inflation and the 100 per cent exemption on inheritance tax for small
businesses. These will be enacted in legislation if the Conservative Party
wins the general election.
Many of the provisions in the 11-clause bill come into operation
automatically. These include the new levels of personal and age-related
income tax allowances, the capital gains tax annual exemption and the
pensions earnings cap for 1992-93, all of which were indexed in line with
inflation.
Other changes which do not require legislation include the changes in
personal equity plans (PEPs) to remove the Pounds 3,000 limit on on
investment in unit or investment trusts and the changes to the income tax
car-benefit scale.
Provisions requiring legislation include the introduction of the 20 per cent
income tax rate on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income for 1992-93 and
the freezing of the level of the married couple's allowance and the basic
rate limit. The second two measures override statutory indexation and so
require legislation.
The bill confirmed the changes in the rates of excise duties, car tax and
value added tax penalties. It also gave the Treasury powers to order the
biggest VAT payers to make monthly payments on account.
Among other VAT changes were the rise in the registration threshold, small
extensions to relief for charities and recovery of the tax on cars bought
for certain businesses.
Two Budget measures will be enacted only in part. The inheritance tax
threshold will rise to Pounds 147,000 from April 6, in line with inflation -
but legislation will be required to raise it to Pounds 150,000 from March
10. Scale charges on car fuel will rise only in line with inflation.
Legislation will be required to introduce a separate scale with lower
charges for diesel fuel.
The bill is made up as follows:
Clause 1 increases by 4.5 per cent the rates of excise duty on spirits,
beer, wine, made-wine and cider. The changes have effect from 6pm on March
10, the day of the Budget.
Clause 2 increases the rates of duty on tobacco products by 10.4 per cent
for cigarettes, 4.5 per cent for pipe and chewing tobacco and 10 per cent
for cigars and hand-rolling tobacco. The changes have effect from 6pm on
March 10.
Clause 3 increases the rates of excise duty on hydrocarbon oils by 7.5 per
cent on leaded petrol and other light oils and 4.5 per cent on unleaded
petrol, DERV, fuel oil, gas oil, other heavy oils and light oil used as
furnace fuel. The changes have effect from 6pm on March 10.
Clause 4 raises to Pounds 110 the rate of vehicle excise duty for private
cars, light goods vehicles, taxis and all other vehicles currently licensed
at Pounds 100 a year. It also introduces a rate of Pounds 15 for tricycles
under 150cc. These changes apply to licences taken out after March 10 next
year.
Clause 5 provides for a reduction in the rate of general betting duty from 8
per cent to 7.75 per cent, for bets placed on or after April 1.
Clause 6 enables the Treasury to make an order in the interests of the
national economy to require payments of VAT on account in advance of the
normal quarterly payment.
Clause 7 reduces the rate of serious misdeclaration penalty from 20 per cent
to 15 per cent for a penalty assessed on or after March 11. The reduction
does not apply to a supplementary assessment (a recalculation) when the
original penalty assessment was made before March 11. The clause also
reduces the maximum rate of default surcharge from 30 per cent to 20 per
cent with effect from April 1. Other rates of surcharge are unchanged.
Clause 8 reduces the rate of car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent with
effect from March 11.
Clause 9 provides for the introduction of a lower rate of income tax, at 20
per cent on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income.
Clause 10 imposes income tax for 1992-93 and sets the rates at 20 per cent
for the lower rate, 25 per cent for the basic rate and 40 per cent for the
higher rate. It overrides statutory indexation to keep unchanged the levels
of the married couple's allowance for those under 65 and the basic rate
limit. It also maintains at Pounds 30,000 the limit on mortgage interest
relief.
Clause 11 specifies the short title of the bill and deals with
interpretation.
Treasury orders which have been made to implement Budget changes are:
The Income Tax (Indexation) Order 1992, the Capital Gains Tax (Annual Exempt
Amount) Order 1992, the Retirement Benefits Schemes (Indexation of Earnings
Cap) Order 1992, the Income Tax (Cash Equivalents of Car Benefits) Order
1992, the Personal Equity Plan (Amendment) Regulations 1992, the Value Added
Tax (Increase of Registration Limits) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax
(Charities and Aids for Handicapped Persons) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax
(Cars) Order 1992, the Value Added Tax (Treatment of Transactions) Order
1992, Value Added Tax (Increase of Consideration for Fuel) Order 1992, the
Inheritance Tax (Indexation) Order 1992, the Income Tax (Cash Equivalents of
Car Fuel Benefits) Order 1992.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Ashdown sets hectic pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY Ashdown launched the Liberal Democrat general election campaign
almost single-handedly yesterday, with hectic trips to Wales and Scotland
and a plea for Labour and the Tories to address his 'positive, hopeful'
agenda for Britain.
Opening the Liberal Democrats' first London election press conference, Mr
Ashdown shrugged off opinion polls showing a dip in his party's support in
recent days. His task was to 'liberate' the 'reservoir of potential out
there for this party'.
Accompanied only by Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, he
released a letter he has written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, calling on them to shun negative
campaigning. Later he flew to Edinburgh and Cardiff for similar press
launches.
The Liberal Democrats have constructed a high-tech press conference facility
in the Gladstone Library of the National Liberal Club in Westminster. It
includes nine television monitors for graphics displays, juxtaposed with
dusty volumes on the library's shelves.
Mr Ashdown signalled his determination to capture the moral high ground with
a slick campaign that eschews personalised attacks on Labour and the Tories.
He said he was not afraid to push potentially unpopular policies - such as
the Liberal Democrats' pledge to increase the basic income tax rate by 1p to
bring an extra Pounds 2bn for education spending.
'We will say the things that need to be said, even when this makes
uncomfortable listening,' he said.
Most of the party's 21 other MPs will stay in their constituencies for the
campaign, with occasional forays to London.
Mr Ashdown's letter calls on Mr Major and Mr Kinnock to set out how they
would end the recession, protect the environment, invest in education, and
reform Britain's democracy. 'Liberal Democrats have clear and positive
answers to these vital questions,' he said.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Mrs T still arouses voters' passions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S a funny old world.
Nearly five years ago, on May 15, 1987, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - mistress of
all she surveyed - proclaimed the triumph of popular capitalism to euphoric
Scottish Tories in Perth in her first salvo of the general election
campaign.
Yesterday the former prime minister started her contribution to the current
contest by pressing the flesh in a dowdy pedestrian precinct at the opposite
end of Britain. It was a poignant illustration of the fickleness of power.
In her 1987 speech the tone was characteristically martial and moralistic.
Socialism was in retreat. Labour had 'lost its grip on reality'. There was a
strong moral case for reducing taxation.
Yesterday, far from the perils of Labour's 1987 'iceberg-manifesto' - with
one-tenth of its socialism visible and nine-tenths below the surface - the
outgoing MP for Finchley spent a tranquil afternoon crossing the Solent.
Among the few convictions she voiced was her belief in the policies of her
'excellent' successor. 'They were my policies first,' she said, alighting at
Cowes.
The purpose of yesterday's south-coast visit was to lend support to Mr
Christopher Chope and Mr Barry Field, MPs for Southampton Itchen and the
Isle of Wight respectively, and faithful bearers of the Thatcherite
standard.
Neither constituency is exactly marginal - both MPs have the luxury of
6,000-plus majorities - but neither is traditional Tory territory. Mr Chope
defeated Mr Richard Mitchell, the Labour defector to the SDP, in 1983.
Mr Field upset the Liberals four years later, winning the seat in the
slow-paced holiday and retirement island.
It was curious, then, that Mrs Thatcher came dressed predominantly in black.
One could only conclude it was in deference to Mr Field's profession - the
family firm is big in crematoria - rather than a prediction of the result on
April 9. As she emerged from the offices of the Southern Evening Echo,
flanked by a beaming Mr Chope, a hearty cheer went up from the 150-strong
crowd of shoppers milling around.
There was hissing, too - and the contrasting reactions continued as she
proceeded, at the centre of a frantic media scrum, in the general direction
of Ratner's.
'"What about the poll tax?' shouted some. Others yelled: 'Maggie, we love
you.' Clearly Mrs T had lost none of her ability to arouse both adoration
and deep antipathy.
She-who-must-be-obeyed still has the power to inflict mortal damage on Mr
John Major's campaign by lifting a finger out of line, as his advisers well
know. That was the sub-text to the gift of flowers to her from the prime
minister this week.
Conservative Central Office will be mightily relieved when her campaign  -
started Friday the 13th - ends with a transatlantic flight on April Fool's
Day.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Kinnock signals readiness to boost public
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR looks set to target new spending in next Tuesday's 'shadow budget' at
a boost in capital expenditure on hospitals and schools, along with steps to
encourage private finance for the railways.
The hint on how Labour might reallocate the Pounds 1.8bn spent by the Tories
in Budget tax cuts came in Mr Neil Kinnock's speech to the Scottish Labour
party in Edinburgh yesterday.
So far, Labour has kept silent as to what it might do with the Pounds 1.8bn
'windfall' due from its promise to reverse the government's decision to
raise the public-sector borrowing requirement for a new 20p tax band. But it
has made clear that the money will be spent on new projects leading to
fierce speculation as to where the funds might go.
The party's published Pounds 4.4bn economic programme is already funded by
increases in taxes on the higher paid and the removal of the National
Insurance contribution ceiling on upper band taxpayers. This money will go
on increased pensions and child benefit and on Labour's Pounds 1.1bn
industrial recovery programme.
But in his speech Mr Kinnock suggested that the 'windfall' finance arising
from the tax cuts has been set aside exclusively for education and health -
Labour's 'winning' election issues.
Mr Kinnock said: 'We will take a lead by investing in capital works for the
health service, the education service and for house building to stimulate
the construction and building supply industries.'
He went on to add that Labour would also get private finance into public
railway projects to provide orders for engineering industries.
However, the Labour leader made clear that the number of projects that could
benefit from new cash would be limited. 'It is not an exhaustive list,' he
said.
His comments conform with Labour's commitments to concentrate government
spending on capital schemes rather than social security where it can be
accused of squandering money on consumer spending.
Its central criticism of the Tories' tax cutting budget has centred on the
waste of 'borrowing for consumption' rather than investment. Generalised tax
cuts will merely increasing imports at a time when efforts should be
targetted at employment-intensive sectors such as construction, Labour says.
In another key passage in his speech Mr Kinnock steered a careful path in
tackling the controversial debate over Scotland's future.
Attacking the Nationalists and Tories as 'separatists and centralists', he
said that Labour's plans for an elected parliament would fulfil Labour's
'constitutional contract' with Scotland and maintain the union.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Clark, the minister for defence procurement, brought his ministerial
career in the Commons to a remarkable close last night by fiercely attacking
a Conservative colleague, Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East.
A routine debate about the failure of GEC-Marconi, whose Stanmore
headquarters is in Mr Dykes' constituency, to secure the contract for the
new advanced short-range air-to-air missile system developed into a bitter
exchange of insults.
Mr Clark, a wealthy right-winger who is not seeking re-election as the MP
for Plymouth Sutton, admitted his 'idiosyncratic' behaviour had got him in
trouble in the past.
A gleeful Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover and sole occupant of the Labour
benches, encouraged the combatants while ministers, including Mr Richard
Ryder, Tory chief whip, looked on in silence.
When Mr Dykes opened the debate by underlining the importance of GEC-Marconi
to his constituency he complained that Mr Clark, who momentarily left his
seat to consult civil servants, was not listening.
Mr Clark said Mr Dykes had made his position absolutely clear by calling on
the prime minister to sack him in a 'full frontal' television programme.

<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE business managers at Westminster have withdrawn the party whip
from Mr John Browne, Tory MP for Winchester, after his decision to stand
against the officially selected candidate in the seat on April 9.
The penalty, the ultimate sanction of whips at the Commons, means Mr Browne
is no longer a member of the Parliamentary party. However it will have
little impact in practice, with MPs rising for the election on Monday.
Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, said in a terse letter to Mr Browne that if he
were ever re-elected to parliament he would not be offered the party whip.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the education secretary, yesterday blamed a 'farcical
performance' by Labour and Liberal Democrat peers for the deletion of
central provisions in the Education (Schools) Bill, Ivor Owen writes.
He claimed that a 'collection of 1960s peers' had been responsible for
defeating the government and inserting an amendment designed to limit the
choice school governors can exercise in deciding how their establishments
should be inspected.
The amendment, which at the time of the defeat was said by Baroness Blatch,
a junior minister, to have 'torn the heart out of the bill', ensures that a
centralised inspection system is retained.
Mr Clarke's caustic comments about the peers reflected his frustration in
having to accept the defeat inflicted by the Lords or lose the entire bill
because of the the current parliamentary session being curtailed by the
general election.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Party may be over for Pravda: Paper faces closure just short
of 80th birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRAVDA, the most famous communist newspaper in the world, is 48 days short
of its 80th birthday. The chances are, however, that it will not achieve
octogenarian status, with the after-life it has managed to preserve since
the death of the party in August being snuffed out at last.
It has run out of money, and is several million roubles in debt. Its
publisher, Pravda Publishing House - which it used to control - has given it
a final warning: if it cannot pay, today's edition will be the last.
After nearly 80 years of propaganda, lies, distortion, calumny and
invention, Pravda has at last fallen foul of what it was founded to destroy:
the iron law of profit.
Mr Vselevod Ovchinnikov, a foreign affairs commentator for the paper, said
last night that hugely increased costs for paper, distribution and services
mean it costs Rbs600 to provide a copy of Pravda to each of its 1.5m
subscribers and casual buyers - while the price of a subscription was set
last year at Rbs29.
The network of foreign correspondents - the finest flowers of Pravda and
often skilled, if inevitably ideologically limited, observers of the
international scene - once totalled nearly 50. It now has foreign bureaux
only in Washington, London, Paris, Berlin and Beijing.
Pravda's cost structure, should any western press baron be interested, is
now horrendous. It gets Rbs30m a year from subscriptions, Rbs10m from kiosk
sales and Rbs40m from advertising, making an income of Rbs80m. Its annual
outgoings, however, are Rbs300m, of which only Rbs26m are editorial
expenses.
'We want to try to survive until May 5, our 80th anniversary,' Mr
Ovchinnikov said. 'We are planning a big festival.'
However, the publisher, taken over after the August coup by the Russian
Information Ministry, has called in its debts.
A bank loan is being negotiated but Pravda executives do not believe that
the publisher, now in the hands of ideological opponents, will wait. A
gloomy board meeting yesterday came up with no new ideas, nor any new money.
'I think that this is connected with the events of March 17,' Mr Ovchinnikov
said. 'The Russian authorities would be happy not to see us appear then.'
A session of the defunct Peoples Congress of the Soviet Union is planned for
that day in the Kremlin, together with a demonstration of former Communists
and other anti-government forces in Moscow: Pravda has supported both
initiatives.
Mr Alexander Ilyin, a deputy editor, said: 'This is a sad loss for the
country. Whatever you think of the paper and its past political allegiance,
it is a national institution.'
Once selling some 10m and required reading for all party members, as well as
for all observers of the Soviet Union, because of its scanty and heavily
coded glimpses into official policy, Pravda's circulation dropped to 1.3m at
the end of last year.
However, its staff say the circulation has risen to 1.5m as the paper gained
readers because of its strong line of opposition to the Yeltsin government
and to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union.
Ironically, the former Soviet Union's second-most famous paper, the evening
Izvestia, celebrates its 75th anniversary today with a glitzy reception.
Izvestia, once the government newspaper, now claims a circulation of 3.8m
and follows a line of critical support to the Yeltsin government. However,
it too will have a struggle to survive.

<TEXT>
THE UNITED NATIONS is sending Mr Cyrus Vance to try to help end the bloody
conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in the former Soviet
Union.
Mr Vance's mission was announced yesterday as an ex-Soviet general warned
that Armenians and Azerbaijanis were attacking towns in each other's
republics in an apparent escalation of the dispute.
Mr Vance, 74, a former US secretary of state, recently helped arrange a
ceasefire between Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia, opening the way for
deployment of 10,000 UN peacekeepers.
But he said his mission next week to the two ex-Soviet republics, including
the embattled enclave, was simply to gather information, not to arrange for
despatch of peacekeepers. The UN is already committed to a large-scale peace
force for Cambodia, as well as Yugoslavia.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, disclosed Mr Vance's
fact-finding mission in a telegram to Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak
foreign minister. Mr Dienstbier, who is president of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), is also planning a peace mission
to Nagorno-Karabakh, as international efforts mount to quell the dispute.
Nagorno-Karabakh is a largely Armenian populated enclave within Moslem
Azerbaijan. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, ethnic hatred has
bred a violent struggle to control the mountainous region, leaving about
1,500 dead in the last four years.
In the Russian parliament, Lt-Gen Boris Pyankov said fighting had gone
beyond the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, with incursions into the two
republics.
He said Armenian militants were storming into the region of Agdam, several
kilometres inside Azerbaijan. At the same time Azeri forces were also
pushing over the border of Armenia.
Gen Pyankov is deputy head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), which both Armenia and Azerbaijan joined on the
collapse of the Soviet Union. He claimed CIS army families were 'in effect'
held hostage in the two republics, as 27 out of 67 CIS posts were still not
evacuated because of attacks by militants.
Earlier, Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel in Ankara quoted
Azerbaijani leaders as saying the two sides had achieved a ceasefire.
According to a military commander in Agdam, an Azerbaijani official had left
Agdam for talks with Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh.
But according to Reuters news agency, both Armenia and Azerbaijan reported
fresh clashes, shattering a ceasefire less than 24 hours after it took
effect.
There was only sporadic artillery and automatic gunfire in Stepanakert,
capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. But further east in the Agderi region of the
enclave, Azerbaijan said Armenian gunmen killed 50 people in a big
offensive.
Azerbaijan's Turan news agency reported hundreds were wounded in the
onslaught and seven villages had been seized. Armenian forces were massing
again near Agdam, it added.
Itar-Tass news agency reported from Armenia that Armenian guerrillas
neutralised Azeri attacks on three villages in Agderi.
Russia and Ukraine buried their differences on repaying the Soviet Union's
foreign debt in a political breakthrough for the Commonwealth of Independent
States yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Commonwealth premiers reached
a series of economic accords including one to take joint responsibility for
the Dollars 60bn-Dollars 70bn Soviet debt - clearing the way for new western
credits. Russian first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar told reporters: 'I
think it is the start of a movement towards towards common sense.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday took his re-election campaign to the
car-making state of Michigan by announcing that his administration was
dropping controversial plans to impose new anti-pollution controls on cars,
George Graham reports from Washington.
The administration has decided to abandon a proposed rule which would have
required carmakers to fit special canisters designed to catch petrol vapours
that escape during refueling - a requirement that would have substantially
increased costs.
Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency plans to require the
installation of vapour traps directly on petrol pumps.
President Bush was due to announce the move yesterday during a campaign trip
to Detroit. He was also expected to promise to resist congressional pressure
for the imposition of tighter fuel efficiency standards on new cars.
Michigan is due to vote in a presidential primary on Tuesday, along with the
neighbouring state of Illinois. The state numbers many car workers among its
voters, and it has been shaken by the massive job cuts recently announced by
General Motors.
The Bush campaign was also considering running a television advertisement
attacking Mr Patrick Buchanan, the president's right wing challenger, for
owning a German-built Mercedes car - in contradiction of the protectionist
rhetoric Mr Buchanan has used to criticise Mr Bush.

FEARS ON Wall Street that US inflation might rise if the economy recovers
were reduced yesterday by another encouraging report on price trends.
The Labour Department said the producer price index for finished goods rose
0.2 per cent last month and only 0.4 per cent in the year to February.
Financial markets had expected a monthly increase of 0.3 per cent. The
better-than-expected report calmed nerves in bond markets, which saw sharp
price falls on Thursday following news of a surge in retail sales in recent
months.
Separate figures from the Commerce Department showed a 0.4 per cent drop in
business inventories between December and January. Given the strong rise in
retail sales, much of this fall was probably involuntary. Many analysts
expect companies to begin rebuilding inventories, giving output a modest
boost this spring.
The most encouraging figure was a 0.1 per cent increase in the 'core'
producer price index - which excludes the volatile food and energy
components. This was the smallest gain since last July and reduced the
annual rate of core producer price inflation to 2.4 per cent.
Inflation for goods at an earlier stage of production remains subdued. In
the year to February the indices for crude goods and intermediate goods fell
by 6.7 per cent and 0.7 per cent, suggesting further moderation of finished
goods prices in coming months.

BETWEEN 300 and 1,000 people were believed killed yesterday in an earthquake
in eastern Turkey, Reuter reports from Ankara.
The earthquake, which struck the provincial capital of Erzincan, 350 miles
east of Ankara, early yesterday evening, was felt in 14 provinces.
'According to first reports, we estimate a death toll of between 300 to
1,000', State Minister Omer Barutcu told the semi-official Anatolian news
agency.
He said the city's hospital was one of many buildings that had collapsed,
with more than 60 students reported trapped in the rubble of the medical
school.
Interior Minister Ismet Sezgin said relief supplies were being sent into the
city of about 145,000 people, which was without electricity.
The earthquake measured 6.8 on the Richter scale and was the worst in the
area since 1939, when 30,000 people were killed, said seismologists from the
US Geological Survey.

EUROPEAN Community ambitions to design a social policy giving workers a
stake in the single market and monetary union were put on hold yesterday
until after the British general election.
But it became clear that one of the main labour market measures the UK hoped
to impede through exclusion from the Maastricht European union treaty would
go ahead however the election transpired.
All sides appeared to recognise that a form of collective bargaining at
Community level was certain to be established whether or not the social
protocol, which Britain's 11 partners agreed at Maastricht, is activated.
Employment and social affairs ministers were holding their first discussion
of the implications of Maastricht at an informal meeting in Portugal.
The protocol envisages voluntary agreements between EC federations of unions
and employers as a self-regulatory substitute for Brussels putting forward
laws for approval by member states. The bolder social provisions of the
protocol will not start operating until next year, after the treaty is
ratified. But already, European capital and labour have started enacting
proposals blocked by the UK under existing EC social provisions.
The Commission had hoped to get a vote on April 6 on another proposal which
the UK is holding up - to introduce a 48-hour working week. That meeting of
the Council of Ministers is now certain to be postponed until after the UK
election. 'It is right that the Community should not interfere with the
British elections,' Ms Vasso Papandreou, EC social affairs commissioner,
said.

BOVIS, the construction arm of Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O),
the British shipping and property group, has won the contract to manage the
main construction works for 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.
The contract, thought to be worth between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn is to
provide sports facilities and accommodation, transport, communications and
other infrastructure.
A spokesman for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games said that
McDevitt and Street, an Atlanta-based subsidiary of Bovis, had been selected
as lead contractor for the construction programme, but the detail of the
contract was still under negotiation.
It is the latest in a string of large contracts for Bovis which managed the
construction contract for the first phase of the Euro Disney theme park near
Paris and has recently won a Dollars 700m contract to manage the second
phase. It also managed construction of the Canary Wharf tower, Europe's
second tallest building, for Olympia &amp; York in London's former docklands.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Israel charges US with false arms leak

<TEXT>
SENIOR Israeli officials, stung by allegations that Israel may have sold
Patriot missile technology to China, yesterday bitterly accused the
administration of President George Bush of deliberately leaking to the press
what they said was a false report.
The issue, made public just as Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister arrived
in the US for a visit, has focused attention on Israel's well-established
clandestine international arms links, including to China and South Africa.
It was a further blow to a US-Israeli relationship already badly dented by
Israel's struggle to persuade a reluctant Washington to grant at least some
of its request for Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees to aid Jewish
immigration from the former Soviet Union.
Mr Eliyahu Ben Elissar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence
committee and a senior Likud party MP, said the Bush administration was
trying to 'sully' Israel. 'It is not the first time the administration uses
the press as a convenient opportunity, usually when we have an important
visit like the defence minister or when the administration is trying to
pressure us with slander,' he told Israel television.
Mr Arens, who is to see Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary on Monday,
took care to exclude President Bush, Mr James Baker, the secretary of state,
and Mr Cheney, from his remarks. But he said 'somebody out there is trying
to muddy the waters'. He said the administration should have approached
Israel privately before going public.
The Washington Times newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior US official,
reported on Thursday that the administration was investigating US
intelligence reports that suggested Israel may have sold a Patriot missile
or part of its technology to China.
The European Commission yesterday pressed China to curb the Community's
growing deficit with Beijing, writes David Buchan in Brussels. In the first
visit of a top Chinese leader to Brussels since the 1989 massacre of
students in Tiananmen Square, Mr Qian Qichen, the foreign minister, was also
reminded by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, of the need for
political reform in China.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Lloyd's in fresh drive to raise cash from members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, PETER MARTIN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London, the insurance market, is taking special measures to raise
cash from members who have been refusing to pay money, or to meet cash
calls, needed to cover losses.
It has served formal notice on members who have received cash calls that it
will draw down on funds held on deposit or on bank guarantees and letters of
credit to make up any missing money.
A letter dated March 9 sent to Names, the individuals who supply the capital
to the market, by Lloyd's membership department based at Chatham, Kent,
says: 'You will be aware that a number of recent cash calls have met with a
poor response. Accordingly it is necessary to take special measures in order
to accelerate the normal process for the release of Names' deposits to
syndicate funds.'
It continues: 'By formal resolution, the Council of Lloyd's decided on March
4 to pursue this action on a blanket basis'.
An accompanying letter warns Names that, if necessary, 'the Council may,
without giving further notice to you, take steps to draw down on your
deposit for the necessary amount'.
Some 700 Names represented by Mr Michael Freeman, a London solicitor, are
seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on the deposits all
Names must lodge with their agents when they join. The main letter
specifically mentions this legal action as a cause of 'additional delays' in
raising cash from Names.
A Lloyd's official said, however, that the blanket demand for payment did
not apply to those names represented by Mr Freeman, since a court
undertaking has frozen their deposits until the case is heard later this
month. The official accepted there was a risk that this special demand for
payment could drive other Names to join Mr Freeman's action.
He described the letters as 'precautionary tactics'. He did not know how
many Names were affected though it is believed the number could run into
thousands.
Lloyd's is asking members' agents to forward the formal notice only to those
Names in arrears on cash calls, or without enough cash in their special or
personal reserves to meet the calls outstanding. The notice is being sent to
Names who have applied to Lloyd's Hardship Committee for help, 'pending the
outcome of their application'.
The managers of the syndicates formerly run by Gooda Walker, which have
suffered particularly bad losses, have been unable to collect Pounds 20m of
a Pounds 136m cash call made last year, and have made little progress in
collecting Pounds 101m called this month.
A third letter to Names says: 'You are only required to pay the amount of
the outstanding call(s), and accordingly the Council will only draw down on
your deposit to the extent that it receives formal written notification from
your underwriting agent(s) that you have failed to pay a cash call in full
or part.'
The cash calls are needed for the most part to meet reinsurance claims by
other syndicates, not to pay the original insurance claims. Names on
syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Feltrim, Rose Thomson Young and
Devonshire face a bill of more than Pounds 700m, over half the market's
total loss for 1989.
Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's the US credit rating agency, infuriated
officials at the Lloyd's Corporation by saying it was concerned that Lloyd's
might face a liquidity crisis, or cash shortage.
Lloyd's dismissed the fears as unfounded. It says that its assets of Pounds
18bn exceed liabilities by Pounds 6bn and that many liabilities arise from
claims which may in some cases not fall due until well into the next
century.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Markets decline further on fears of Tory defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH wave of pre-election jitters affected the London financial markets
yesterday, as investors began to face up to the possibility of Labour
forming the next government.
Shares, sterling and government gilt-edged securities all continued their
losses of earlier in the week, amid rumours that a batch of opinion polls at
the weekend would show ebbing support for the Conservatives.
The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,476.0, down 17.3, to show a fall of nearly
100 points over the past three days, while the pound dipped half a pfennig
to DM2.855 and gilts lost  1/2 point for a decline of 1 1/2 points on the
week.
The bleak mood in the City was partly in response to Tuesday's Budget
statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, which many
judged had done little to help the Conservatives' chances in the general
election on April 9.
The subdued mood of investors was deepened by the prospect of economic data
due next week. There is particular anxiety about unemployment statistics due
on Thursday, which are expected to show a further 35,000 job losses last
month.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the London
investment house, said: 'A flat economy, an unexciting Budget and a lag in
opinion polls - it hardly adds up to a good start for the Tories in the
campaign.'
The week's slide in share prices started on Tuesday night, after the market
was disturbed by the detail in Mr Lamont's statement which indicated that
the economy was in a worse state than had been expected, leading to the need
for a large rise in government borrowing.
The disquiet pushed the FT-SE index, which had risen on Monday and initially
on Tuesday, to a net fall on the week of 57 points.
Currency investors switched funds out of sterling, which over the week shed
nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Against the dollar, the pound
dropped just over half a cent over the week, closing last night in London at
Dollars 1.7125.
Its trade weighted index ended unchanged on the day at 89.7, which compares
with 89.9 at the opening on Monday.
In New York, sterling fell further, closing at DM2.8497 and Dollars 1.7075.
On the London money market, the three-month interbank rate, which shadows
base rates, was quoted yesterday at about 10 13/16 per cent, a rise of  3/16
of a percentage point on the day and  3/8 of a point on the week.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Kinnock pledges to increase investment: Tories ready to
retaliate with promise to cut taxes and inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK set out his central election message yesterday when he
contrasted an exhausted Tory government, bereft of vision, with a Labour
administration pledged to 'invest, invest, invest'.
As Mr John Major prepared to unveil his campaign themes today, Mr Kinnock,
the Labour leader, said his government would 'take the lead' with a
programme of economic measures to bring Britain out of recession and free
the country of the fear of unemployment.
In a passionate speech to Scottish party members, Mr Kinnock quoted his
hero, Aneurin Bevan, saying debts, unemployment and a 'fear of the future'
had halted consumer spending, investment and undermined Britain's
confidence.
Labour's programme would centre on time-limited tax incentives for industry,
training projects and capital works for the National Health Service, schools
and housing.
With two opinion polls today both showing Labour just one percentage point
ahead of the Tories, Mr Major will counter-attack in an address to
supporters in Torquay by stressing his commitment to lower taxes and
inflation. Strategists of both parties are braced for the six opinion polls
to be published tomorrow, already dubbed 'Super Sunday' at Westminster.
Mr Major will tackle head-on the opposition's insistence on the need for a
change after 13 years of the Conservatives. He will say: 'The Labour party
want to change Britain. There would be change all right - short change, for
pensioners as savings shrank, for home owners as interest rates soar.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, began his intense election
programme yesterday with flying visits to London, Wales and Scotland. He
urged his opponents to abandon negative campaigning and debate problems
which Britain must address by the end of the century.
At Westminster, MPs rushed through all the stages of a heavily truncated
Finance Bill in preparation for the dissolution of Parliament on Monday.
In his Edinburgh speech, Mr Kinnock combined a personal attack on Mr Major
with an attempt to increase the pressure for a televised debate between the
two leaders. He ridiculed the prime minister for hesitating over the
election date and added: 'It seems he is certain about only one thing: he is
definitely not willing to face me in a television debate.'
Labour strategists claimed the Tories were in 'a shambles' over TV debates
during the campaign. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Hesel-tine, environment secretary, have
agreed to head-to-head debates with their Labour shadows.
But Tories argue a debate between the two party leaders would be in a
different league.
Mr Kinnock launched a two-pronged attack on the Tories and Scottish National
party in words carefully phrased to head off support for independence and to
promote Labour's plan for a Scottish parliament.
Mr Major will also address the constitutional future of Scotland today. He
will set out his view of what devolution might entail - not institutional
change or added tiers of government, but of passing power directly to people
by enabling them to take more decisions about their lives.
The Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph shows Labour down half a percentage
point from last week at 38 per cent, the Tories on 37 (down 1 1/2 points)
and the Liberal Democrats on 20. The Harris poll for the Daily Express,
carried out after the Budget, puts Labour on 40, the Tories on 39 and the
Liberal Democrats on 16.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: An island haven for noisy wildlife - Michael Woods
visits a part of Australia where the sea-lions have priority over people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LARGE buff-maned bull sea-lion reared up and surveyed the beach around
him. A second bull, silvery grey and sleekly wet, fresh from the sea, was
suddenly faced with his noisy aggression.
Backing off quickly, he skirted the first animal,which was nearly 8 ft long
and built like a tank, and found a more peaceful spot to sleep. Fortunately
my presence only four yards away was disdainfully ignored for, on Seal
Beach, the sea-lions have become accustomed to having priority over the
70,000 visitors who come each year to see them.
Probably 10 per cent of the total Australian sea-lion population lives and
breeds on this beach on Kangaroo Island, and to watch them swimming, resting
and suckling their young is a privilege: there are few places in the world
where such animals are so tolerant.
Almost 30 per cent of Kangaroo Island, Australia's third largest, has been
set aside for conservation, and it is a wonderful place to see many of the
country's indigenous species. When, earlier this century, South Australia
realised that modification of much of the state's natural habitat was wiping
out its wildlife, it introduced a number of animals, such as koala and
platypus to Kangaroo Island in order to conserve them.
For my part, a visit to this temperate wildlife haven was pure indulgence.
On Seal Beach, for instance, we did not just watch sea-lions but saw the
complete skeleton of a whale washed up about five years ago, and glimpsed a
pair of white-breasted sea eagles.
The biggest national park on the island, Flinders Chase, occupies the
western end and covers an area of 185,000 acres. Koalas sit wedged in the
crotches of gum branches, sleeping soundly in the leafy shade. The more
wakeful scratch lazily or extend a paw for the occasional leaf.
Unlike the mainland population, these animals are disease-free. Without
predators, their numbers are booming. At the information centre, Kangaroo
Island's own kangaroos gather to be fed by visitors. They take pellets with
salivary muzzles and demonstrate how, when moving slowly, they support their
bodies on their tails and front limbs in order to move their hind legs
forward.
Here, near the rangers' offices at Rocky River, our guide, Craig Wickham,
grilled steaks on a barbecue in one of several special covered areas
provided by the park authorities. These are spacious, clean, open-sided
buildings with tables and benches, running water and a sizeable gas grill.
It is a testament to the general atmosphere of trust and honesty on the
island that the original gas lighter, provided when the barbecue was
installed some years ago, is still there.
We drove south through dense forest to the tall stone lighthouse at Cape du
Couedic, first to see Admiral's Arch, which drips with long black knobbly
stalactites. The Southern ocean beats against the cliffs here and against
the small off-shore islands where sea-lions and New Zealand fur seals bask
on the rocks.
Nearby, in a sudden geological switch from limestone to granite, is a dome
topped with a collection of naturally sculpted and scalloped boulders. Their
forms and the play of light and shade present great opportunities for
photographers but how, in this hard rock, some of the boulders achieved
their massive, spectacularly delicate shapes, puzzles me still.
In comparison with the huge bulk of Australia, Kangaroo Island looks tiny, a
day-trip's worth of island a stone's throw from the South Australia coast.
In fact, at 90 miles long and 35 wide it is almost 12 times the size of the
Isle of Wight and a single day is adequate only for skimming its surface.
Even with Craig, who was born on the island and knows it intimately, I did
not see all I wanted in two days and could easily have spent twice that time
there.
Kangaroo Island's mainly dirt roads, although often badly corrugated, are
pleasant to travel on: a broad strip of trees and shrubs flanks each
roadside between fields and carriageway and gives a wilder, wooded feel. At
the same time the climate is cool and comfortable even in high summer.
While large waves frequently batter the south coast, the sun-facing north is
much more sheltered with the Australian mainland only a short distance away
across Investigator strait. Here we visited Stokes Bay, a delightful hidden
treasure reached through a natural tunnel in the rocks where fairy penguins
nest. The brilliant white sands of the beach are protected by a reef of
rocks which provides safe swimming.
Not all the interesting parts of Kangaroo Island are found around its coast.
For example, a number of inland lagoons support a wealth of water birds.
Some are little known, and Craig drove me across fields to reach them -
irregular shady pools with gums standing in their midst up to their knees in
water. One lagoon was good for spoonbills, another was used by chestnut teal
and wood duck as well as more familiar birds like little grebes and
moorhens.
It is always a pleasure to be guided by someone who has a good knowledge of
an area and its wildlife and so, when I asked to be shown kookaburras, Craig
offered koalas, too, and took me to a small wood on the way to the airport.
We spotted the birds at once but the koalas were more elusive. Craig was
determined, though, and - just as it began to look as if I would have to
dash to catch my aircraft - we caught sight of one almost concealed in a
thicket of gum leaves.
Michael Woods toured Kangaroo island with Craig Wickham's Adventure Charters
(tel: 0848-33282) which is based at the Wanderer's Rest in American River
(tel: 0848-33140), a pleasant motel with striking views over Eastern cove,
where he stayed. He flew to Kangaroo Island from Adelaide with Air Kangaroo
Island (tel: 08-2344177).
Visitors to Kangaroo Island will probably want to stay overnight in Adelaide
at the start and end of their visit. Adelaide's Bed and Breakfast at 239
Franklin Street (tel: 08-2313124) is cool, comfortable and friendly and the
proprietors, Tony and Deirdre DiFalco, serve good food with style.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: What Pounds 60,000 buys in the wilderness - Nicholas
Woodsworth on the rural good life in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT CAN YOU do with Pounds 60,000 these days? It is a good chunk of money,
but it hardly seems enough to set yourself up in life. You could buy an
Italian sports car. Or finance a child's education. Or pay the electricity
bills. Or, like Rod McNabb and Vlasta Ulovec, you could purchase 11 acres
and 700 apple trees on a small island in the north Pacific, and embark on a
life as an organic apple farmer.
Three years ago McNabb and Ulovec, Vancouverites with hectic, big-city
lives, decided they had had enough. Both in their early 40s, they had
pursued careers that kept them on a never-ending treadmill, he with the Post
Office, she as an architectural draft designer. For them Vancouver, scenic
as it is, had become too big, noisy and expensive. Like many other
city-dwellers, they dreamed of slowing down and taking time to enjoy life.
Two decades earlier, Vlasta Ulovec had fled Prague following the Soviet
invasion of Czechoslovakia, and went to Canada for a better life. Now, both
decided it was time to sell their house, drain the swimming pool, give away
the potted plants and flee once again - voluntarily this time. They became
urban refugees.
The way to Denman Island is not an easy one - this is a coast of inlets,
bays, sounds, inland passages and hundreds of small islands. From Vancouver,
you follow the coast northwards to Horseshoe bay, take a ferry across the
broad straight of Georgia to Vancouver island, drive 50 miles further north
and then board the small Denman ferry. You have to travel for the better
part of a day to get there, but it is a trip that takes you a world away
from Vancouver.
The McNabb-Ulovec establishment now sits on a gentle slope, surrounded by
woods and coniferous forest, not far from the Denman island sea-shore. It is
closer still to a small lake that makes for good swimming in hot weather.
From the upper orchard you can look up and across the Georgia strait to snow
on top of the Coast Range. Look down and you will see neat rows of apple
trees stretching across the grass to a cedar-shingled house in the distance.
Generally Rod McNabb is somewhere in the scenery. He may be up in the
orchard cutting grass, pruning trees or scheming ways to counter the latest
black ant invasion. If not, he is down at the house with Vlasta, talking
with friends, feeding the ducks or attending to the last batch of home-made
beer.
What can Pounds 60,000 buy you? On Denman island it can buy an orchard, a
hand-tailored wooden house, an old John Deere tractor with far too many
attachments, 60 assorted ducks and chickens, various outbuildings and barns,
a riotous front garden of flowers - and two milk cows named Sophie and
Squirt. Throw in a pick-up truck, two dogs and four cats and you have got
yourself a life. A busy one, at that.
Before they bought Apple Lane Orchard, Rod and Vlasta knew about as much as
we all know about apples. Depending on them for their survival, they now
know far more. Tending an apple orchard sounds idyllic; you watch the things
grow and make sure small boys do not steal them. Don't you? Apparently you
do not. Life may be more enjoyable than it was before for this couple, but
it is just as demanding.
As others before them have discovered, making anything grow is work. Making
apples grow, especially in a climate like this, is a constant chore. There
are late frosts, early freezes, grass and weeds to tend to, plant rusts,
fungi and scab diseases galore.
Growing the apples organically makes it even more difficult. There are no
chemical insecticides, herbicidal sprays or artificial fertilisers on the
McNabb acres. Instead there are kelp and composted manure piles around the
trees, ground-up seashell solutions for insect infestations, and ducks that
eat weeds. It all makes life more difficult and risky, but it seems to be
worth it.
At the Granville island produce market in Vancouver there are retired
British expatriates who haven't tasted apples like those McNabb grows since
childhood. There are Cox's orange pippins, Bramley seedlings and Westover
seek-no-furthers.
No matter how frantic they become growing apples, the McNabb-Ulovecs
appreciate their new lives on Denman island. They are not alone. Denman is
populated by 800 islanders. They are a hardy lot, much like the
turn-of-the-century settlers who originally moved there. They value
independence and practical skills. Above all, they enjoy a rural way of life
that is becoming harder to find.
Many have moved from cities for the simpler life, but brought along skills
that make them a living. Next to Apple Lane Orchard, in a Japanese-style
cabin hidden in a stand of firs, Tokyo-born Yoshi Yoshihara makes up large
wooden vats of traditional Japanese miso (fermented soyabean) and sends it
to specialist shops across the country.
Up the road, brothers Tom and Mike Dennis, former Berkley academics, pot and
sculpt. Across the way, Brian Grogan takes photos for the island paper and
bakes bread he will exchange for local eggs, milk and vegetables. Behind the
orchard, Rolf Ludwigson, another academic who specialises in trylobytes, has
founded DIRT, surely the most arcane organisation on the continent - Denman
Island Research on Trylobytes. Nobody makes a great deal of money, but then
nobody expects to.
The winters are long and wet. In summer there are difficulties with water
supply on the island. Rod and Vlasta would like to find time to travel but
the roof of their house needs replacing and apple scab is an ever-present
menace. On the whole, though, such a life seems a bargain at Pounds 60,000.

FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: Florence: film set or city?

ON MY last visit to Florence, writes David Pilling, the magnificence of the
Piazza della Signora was partly obscured by scaffolding which smothered the
stone buildings on two sides of the square and prevented closer inspection
of the statues.
That was 12 years ago, and the scaffolding has now gone. Or rather, it has
moved - to the other side of the square. Like the Forth bridge, work on the
piazza may never be completed.
In this and all other respects, Florence had hardly changed since I was last
there. Its art galleries are still crammed with paintings, its gelaterias
with teenagers and its grandmothers with pasta.
At night, looking across the river Arno at the illuminated brown and yellow
buildings with their red-tiled towers and domes, Florence still looks more
like a film set than a city. Every building - and almost everybody - is
decked out to perfection.
Florentine women have maintained their fur-wearing obsession, recession and
animal rights seeming to have by-passed this part of Italy. I had not seen
so many fur coats on display since Doctor Zhivago.
I travelled to Tuscany for the weekend with Bladon Lines - a tour operator
more usually associated with ski holidays - to sample two hotels offered in
its Italian summer brochure.
We spent our first night at Relais La Suvera, a 16th-century former papal
residence about 20 miles from Siena. One would normally expect to pay an
entrance fee simply to look around such a building; to stay there was almost
too much, a bit like bedding down in the Brighton Pavilion.
My suite, near the top of a rectangular stone tower, had 30-ft-high
wooden-beamed ceilings, a chandelier in the bathroom and a four-poster bed
of astounding proportions. I half expected the antique furniture to be roped
off, and was reluctant to sit on the sofa or straight-backed wooden chair in
case an attendant leapt out to admonish me.
From my shuttered window there were views of the undulating Tuscan scenery
and the vineyards from which La Suvera produces very drinkable organic wine.
The hotel was the most lovely I have ever stayed in.
Bladon Lines offers seven nights' B &amp; B at La Suvera (flight and car hire
included) from Pounds 638. Supplements of up to Pounds 65 a day are payable
for the top-end suites.
In Florence, the four-star hotel Lungarno is rather unremarkable by
comparison, except for its location within serenading distance of the
Pontevecchio. The view of the famous bridge from my room would have had EM
Forster drooling. Seven nights' fly-drive staying at the Lungarno starts at
Pounds 585.
Details of Bladon Lines' Italian and other brochures are available from
56/58 Putney High Street, London SW15 1SF. (Tel: 081-785-3131).
