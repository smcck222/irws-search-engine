FT  30 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) World Trade News: Restructuring hope for
Szczecin yard

Correction (Published 1st July 1992) appended to this article.
A PLANNED restructuring of Poland's Szczecin shipyard's Zl 12,000bn (Pounds
473m) debt, coupled with a full order book and cuts in delivery times, holds
out new hope for the yard's once-bleak future.
Last week at the yard, Mr Harald Block, of Hansa Treuhand, a Hamburg-based
shipping line, said: 'I'm paying 20-30 per cent less and getting delivery
six months earlier than I could have got in Germany last year,' as his
12,380 dwt container ship, costing about Dollars 18m (Pounds 9.7m), slid
easily off the slipway into the water.
The yard is one of Poland's three major shipbuilders, the others being at
Gdansk and Gdynia, further east along the Baltic coast.
The general improvement in output at Szczecin is moving apace with
restructuring envisaging that the yard's suppliers swap debt for equity.
Bank creditors, meanwhile, are to stretch repayment times after having debts
redenominated in US dollars at appropriate interest rates. The operation
presages a general debt restructuring which the finance ministry is now
preparing for the whole economy, easing financial burdens on those Polish
companies deemed to have a future.
At Szczecin, a new management team headed by Mr Krzysztof Piotrowski, who
was forced to leave the yard in 1985 after having served on its workers'
self-management council, returned last year determined to restore the
company's fortunes. Over two-thirds of the debt he inherited came from
non-payment by Soviet clients for ships ordered and built, and the sudden
cut by the Solidarity government of the 20 per cent subsidy on ships for
western lines ordered in the late 1980s.
The Soviet clients who once took half the yard's output have now
disappeared, leaving Szczecin with orders from Germany and the PZM Polish
shipping line. The workforce has been moved on to two shifts and away from
traditional piece rates. A tightening of delivery schedules by outside
suppliers squeezed for custom by Poland's recession has made it possible to
plan an efficient assembly timetable.
The pressure to improve delivery times has also come from the 50 per cent or
more annual cost of credit, all of which means the yard is on the way to
halving its previous ship assembly times. Financial controls are also being
tightened. Mr Block's container ship has, for example, been built as a
partnership between the yard and the Warsaw-based Polish Development Bank.
It has provided guarantees for the German client's downpayment, then held
them, only releasing funds to the yard as and when successive portions of
the vessel were completed. Other vessels will be treated as separate
financial units, thus avoiding dissipation of funds. The general tightening
in efficiency is bringing results without much need for significant capital
outlays.
At present, the yard is planning to buy several heavy-duty cranes for
Dollars 6m; further capital equipment needs are put by management at Dollars
10m. This should be set against the Dollars 1.3bn worth of orders and
options for 53 vessels the yard now has on its books with delivery dates
until the end of 1995, and the Zl 800bn worth of vessels being built at the
moment.
Correction (Published 1st July 1992)
The debt of Poland's Szczecin shipyard should be 2,000bn zlotys (Pounds
77.7m), not 12,000bn zlotys, as reported in the Financial Times of June 30,
1992.

FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on Steel results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and
PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market's concern over the climate for corporate dividend payments
faced its first test yesterday when British Steel disclosed its results. The
shares retreated 6 to 61p, recording the day's sharpest fall among FT-SE 100
stocks, mostly in reaction to analysts' disappointment at the meeting with
the directors following the release of the figures.
The Pounds 55m loss reported was better than market forecasts and, as
predicted, the company cut the dividend payout, making a total of 4.5p
against 8.75p last year. At the analysts meeting, however, the company
warned that future dividend payments would depend on steel prices. With
prices currently weak and forecast to remain so, analysts took the board's
comments as potential for further dividend cuts.
Smith New Court was reported to have been a big seller yesterday afternoon
and turnover in British Steel shares reached 18m by the close. The broker
now expects a current year loss of Pounds 125m, against a previous estimate
of Pounds 135m. Charterhouse Tilney forecasts a deficit of Pounds 140m.
No respite for BP
There was no respite for British Petroleum shares from the selling prompted
by last week's dramatic boardroom developments. The stock market is steeling
itself for news on the dividend from the company's presentation to oil
sector analysts in London at lunchtime today.
Suggestions that at least one big Japanese institution had decided to
sharply reduce its holding in BP triggered another big sell-off. The shares
came under heavy pressure within minutes of the opening and closed at 200p,
a fall of 10. Last week the stock lost almost 17 per cent of its value.
The Japanese institution was said to have sold 10m shares during the morning
and then returned as a big seller during the afternoon. Mr Alan Marshall,
oil sector analyst at Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker, said he
expected BP to halve the dividend and said the shares 'are a sell down to
160p'.
There was, however, evidence of good buying interest as the shares moved
towards the 200p mark. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was believed
to be a keen supporter of the shares. And County NatWest shifted its stance
from 'long term underperform' to 'neutral', saying the stock is starting to
look reasonable value against other oil shares.
Fisons wanted
Renewed rumours that Fisons might attract the attentions of a predator
ensured that the pharmaceuticals company held up in a generally weak sector.
Press comment at the weekend suggesting that the company might prove
vulnerable to a takeover following the recent drop in its share price -
after an interim profits warning - prompted the stock to rise 13 at one
stage. The shares slipped back with the market but managed to remain one of
the strongest performers among the FT-SE 100 constituents with a net gain of
5 at 200p. Mooted bidder ICI eased 2 to 1221p.
Arjo weakens
Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton dropped 17 to 226p after the company
broker and one agency broker cut profits forecasts.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Arjo's broker, adjusted this year's figure by Pounds 8m
to Pounds 205m and the 1993 estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 235m. At the
same time, James Capel moved down to Pounds 210m for this year and Pounds
245m for 1993. Capel's Mr Jonathan Helliwell said he had adjusted his
figures because: 'The pulp price is starting to move up and paper prices are
not yet following, so margins are being squeezed.' It is believed that UBS
had the same rationale.
However, Credit Lyonnais Laing believes the shares are a buy at these levels
and was, last night, preparing a note recommending the stock.
Worries that British Gas could face a strike by 45,000 white collar workers
who rejected a 4.3 per cent pay offer unsettled the shares, which dipped 1
1/2 to 242 1/2 p.
Lasmo closed 4 higher at 181p, after 183p, with most sector specialists
disregarding stories that a bid for the group is in the offing.
A successful presentation to big investment institutions in Japan last week
helped Thames Water to maintain its recent momentum, the stock closing 5
higher at 435p on good turnover of 2.5m. North West Water, which has also
visited Japanese institutions, climbed 12 to 437p.
Insurance issues remained weak as analysts pondered the possibility of
dividend cuts and the effect of the latest hurricane damage in California.
General Accident fell 14 to 477p, Royal 12 to 226p and Sun Alliance 14 to
293p.
Amber Day jumped 13 to 51p on strong turnover of 2.2m shares after retail
and office property management group In Shops confirmed recent speculation
that 'a bid approach is being considered'. In Shops slipped 10 to 74p after
the company said it would approach Midland Montagu, its financial adviser,
this week to discuss an offer.
Reports of a disappointing presentation at the base of Holiday Inns in
Atlanta, Georgia, hurt the shares of parent company Bass on the London
market, but analysts suggested the retreat of 16 to 581p may have been
overdone.
Internationally traded Glaxo and Wellcome fell 18 to 675p and 15 to 872p
respectively, reflecting a weak dollar and poor defensive stocks in the US.
Glaxo was further affected by a downgrading from US investment house
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Wellcome also suffered from doubts raised in
the weekend press about its forthcoming share flotation.
Hotel group Forte dipped 3 to 206p as the lack of a conclusion to the sale
of its Gardner Merchant catering subsidiary to Compass Group and US
competitor ARA continued to hang over the stock.
After the recent good run in Thorn-EMI, County NatWest moved from a buy to a
hold on the stock, which weakened 12 to 818p.
A warning that first-half profits at Heywood Williams, the building products
group, could fall prompted an immediate slide of 43 to 288p.
BM Group plummeted 83 to 150p, the worst fall of the day, on talk of
accounting worries. There were also reports that Kleinwort Benson had cut
profits expectations following a meeting with the company.

FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the derivatives reported a volatile session in which stock index
futures relinquished earlier gains due to a lack of features on which to
focus, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the September contract on the FT-SE was recorded at
2,588, a premium of 14, which dealers took to be a sign of a strong session
ahead and helped send the underlying cash market higher.
The positive mood, however, did not last as independent traders turned
sellers, causing a reversal in the September future - although there were
few takers after the first of the sell orders. The contract continued its
downward direction throughout the afternoon, once again becoming a factor in
the reversed direction of the cash market. Not even the early rally on Wall
Street could lift September from its retreat and it reached a low of 2,542
just before the close.
A slight bounce helped September end at 2,553, down 25 from the previous
session and around 2 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash
of about 35. Turnover, at around 7,000 lots, was poor.
Traded options also experienced a poor day, with a meagre 25,834 contracts
dealt. There were 8,435 lots transacted in the FT-SE option. Among stock
options, BP saw 2,892 contracts traded and British Steel 1,979.

FT  30 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic trading in a nervous market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG opening in the stock index futures market failed to shield UK share
prices yesterday from adverse trends in currencies and the wave of dividend
worries prompted by last week's developments at British Petroleum.
Trading could only be described as moderate, reflecting the winding down of
investment portfolios ahead of the close today of the second quarter of the
year. Equities reversed early gains to fall sharply towards the close,
contrasting with a rise of 17 Dow points as Wall Street opened its new
session.
The stock market made a gloomy start as its worries about corporate earnings
and dividends were joined by new fears about sterling. Weakness in the pound
was ascribed to growing political pressures in the UK over the Maastricht
treaty, including the opposition expressed by Mrs Thatcher, former British
prime minister.
The initial strength of the September futures contract on the FT-SE Index
caught the stock market by surprise, and the Footsie moved up by 14 points
in the wake of the contract, but trading volume was unimpressive.
The market was encouraged by its first reading of the results from British
Steel, which disclosed a loss and dividend cut well within forecasts.
Nevertheless analysts returned discouraged from the meeting with the British
Steel board, and turned their attentions to the dangers facing the next
prospective payout from the steel company.
By midsession, equities were wilting in the face of renewed and heavy
selling of British Petroleum, and when stock index futures also lost their
early shine, share prices moved down rapidly.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,515.8, down 18.3. Seaq volume,
at 382.7m shares, compared with 638.9m on Friday, was low; but daily Seaq
totals have proved a poor guide to underlying equity market business in the
past week.
Traders said the equity market remained extremely nervous. Some houses
believe that British Petrolem shares could come under further pressure, now
that 'US investors are having second thoughts', as the head dealer of one
leading marketmaking firm put it.
Analysts have drawn up lists of companies where the dividend payout could be
at risk, with the banks, the composite insurance companies and the building
and construction groups all figuring prominently.
Wellcome continued to give ground ahead of the planned Pounds 3bn sale of
shares, although the group's merchant bankers firmly rejected suggestions
that the offer was under pressure.
There was no lack of special features in the market in spite of the
generally cautious mood. A number of bid favourites were revived, with the
possibility of a bid from France for Lasmo, the oil exploration company,
finding a ready response. Also favoured by some speculators was the hope
that ICI might show interest in Fisons. But traders stressed that many
institutions had already closed their trading books on the second quarter.

FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Rate cut hopes rise on weakUS
home sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices rallied sharply yesterday after some unexpectedly bad home
sales data raised investors' hopes for an interest rate cut, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 37.45 ahead at 3,319.86, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 5.49 to 408.94. The American SE composite
improved 3.06 to 377.10 and the Nasdaq composite advanced 10.96 to 558.80.
New York SE turnover, however, was modest at 177m shares.
After a string of poor economic data last week, hopes for a rate reduction
were already high, but the morning's announcement of a 5.6 per cent fall in
May new single-family home sales heightened the expectations.
The decline in monthly home sales was the fourth in a row, and indicated
that the rebound in the housing market, which many had hoped would be the
driving force behind the economic recovery, has stumbled.
Investors hope that monetary policy will be eased some time this week. The
Federal Reserve's key policy-making Open Market Committee meets today and
tomorrow to appraise the state of the economy, but it may wait until the
employment report for June is released on Thursday before taking any action.
Banks were mostly higher in anticipation of lower rates, which could boost
bank revenues. Chase Manhattan firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 28 1/8 ,
BancOne Dollars 1 to Dollars 45 1/4 and Citicorp Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 21
1/2 . The exception was BankAmerica, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39 and
still disturbed by the unexpected resignation last week of Mr Robert Smith,
the group's recently named president.
A range of Dow constituents enjoyed solid gains. IBM put on Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 98 5/8 , Merck Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 7/8 , Caterpillar Dollars
1 1/2 to Dollars 52 7/8 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 and
Texaco Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 3/8 .
USAir jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 in active trading on reports
that the airline is negotiating to purchase a large part of TWA with the
help of British Airways, which would, according to the reports, buy a stake
in the new combined carrier.
Waste Management fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 in volume of 3.3m
shares after the company said that it would record a charge of Dollars 96m
in the second quarter related to the adoption of new accounting procedures.
McDonnell Douglas advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Boeing shed
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 after the former beat the latter to a Dollars
1.2bn contract to produce 40 narrow-body jetliners in China.
Aetna lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 after announcing it would take a
Dollars 145m second-quarter charge to cover a job-cutting programme.
Canada
TORONTO followed the strong upturn in New York, the TSE 300 index improving
24.5 to 3,375.8. However, advances and declines were even at 272 each.
Volume was 20.3m shares.
Moore Corp said its second-quarter earnings will be substantially below
expectations and well below those of a year ago due to weak sales in April
and May. The stock was off CDollars  7/8 at CDollars 22 3/4 .

BRAZILIAN equities fell sharply yesterday following fresh press evidence of

Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
The Bovespa index ended 14.6 per cent down at 18,925 in low turnover of
Cr163.4bn. Late last week the index had risen 11.65 per cent over two days,
since the congressional investigation had not yet uncovered evidence
directly linking the president to allegations of corruption against his

FT  30 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sharp futures drop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures contracts traded at their lowest since early May yesterday
as the weakness of the pound caused a ripple of uncertainty on the UK money
markets.
In an otherwise quiet day - interbank rates barely moved - the September
sterling contract fell 11 ticks from Friday's close of 90.18. This was the
lowest level since May 5, when interest rates were cut from 10 1/2 per cent
to 10 per cent. The December contract declined 10 basis points, touching a
low of 90.32, and the March contract lost 7 ticks.
Most traders said the bearishness of sterling futures trading was probably
short-lived. 'Unless people actually think interest rates are going to go
up, I cannot really see the contracts falling much further,' said one
trader.
Overnight cash rates ended cheaply at around 8 1/2 per cent after the Bank
of England took out the liquidity shortage in the early afternoon.
An initial forecast shortage of Pounds 850m was revised to Pounds 900m in
the late morning, and again to Pounds 1.1bn in the afternoon.
In the early round the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 48m, including
Pounds 10m of band-3 bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 38m of band-4
bills at 9 19/32 per cent. Later it bought bills worth Pounds 157m. This
comprised Pounds 23m of band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 112m of
band-3 bills at the same rate as before, Pounds 7m local authority bills at
9 19/32 per cent and Pounds 15m of band-4 bills at the earlier rate. In
afternoon operations the Bank met the shortage, buying Pounds 919m of band-1
bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
Period interbank rates did not react as badly as sterling futures to the UK
currency's weakness. One-month money ended at 10 1/8 per cent, unchanged
from Friday. The three-month interbank rate - an important indicator of how
the market thinks base rates will move - also closed at 10 1/8 per cent,
1/8 firmer.
German call money hovered near the Bundesbank's Lombard emergency funding
rate in spite of an injection of funds under Section 17 of the Bundesbank
act. This allows the central bank to transfer public authority funds to the
market for a limited period.
Dealers said only a small amount was injected into the market yesterday,
which had little effect on rates. Call money was quoted unchanged from
Friday.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound suffers in busy trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK was the main beneficiary of sterling and dollar weakness
yesterday, ending sharply higher as the pound fell on Maastricht
nervousness, and worse than expected new homes data pushed the US currency
lower.
The pound tumbled following weekend reports that Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister, would resign if Tory backbenchers voted against the Maastricht
treaty on European monetary union.
Although Downing Street dismissed the story yesterday morning, the damage
had been done and the UK currency ended the day 2 pfennigs down from
Friday's close at its lowest level since just after the general election on
April 9.
An analyst commented: 'After Denmark's rejection of the treaty, people are
taking these rumours more seriously than they would otherwise have done.'
Foreign investors in particular were worried by the reports and rushed to
safety in the D-Mark.
Sterling's weakness was exacerbated by a number of gloomy economic surveys
released over the weekend and by heavy dollar and yen selling for D-Marks.
The pound closed at DM2.8925, compared with DM2.9125 previously. However, it
held up against the dollar - which had an even rougher day - finishing at
Dollars 1.9070, after Friday's close of Dollars 1.8920. Sterling eased back
in New York to end at Dollars 1.9033.
The dollar continued its sharp descent, losing 2 1/4 pfennigs in a busy
session. Traders reported heavy selling from a wide range of corporate and
fund investors.
Discussions about another possible cut in US interest rates dominated
activity on the foreign exchanges. This looked even more likely after May US
new home sales were reported to have dropped a sharp 5.6 per cent to
501,000, compared with economists' forecasts of a rise to 550,000.
A US bank trader said: 'The dollar had been on a nice corrective rally this
afternoon, but the figures put paid to that.'
The Federal Open Markets Committee meets today and tomorrow to discuss rate
policy. Many expect it to sanction a further easing.
The US currency closed at DM1.5165, down from Friday's finish of DM1.5390.
It fared slightly better against the yen, thanks mainly to heavy yen selling
for D-Marks. The dollar ended steadier in New York at DM1.5213 last night.
All this left the D-Mark sharply higher. 'Everybody loves the D-Mark,' said
one trader. 'If Maastricht breaks down, that is where everyone will go. If
there is any economy with growth potential, it is Germany's'
The Portuguese escudo, still the top currency in the European Monetary
System grid, pushed through its maximum limit against the pound during the
day, but traders said the Bank of Portugal intervened to sell escudos for
D-Marks.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Slow start for Globex with
less active contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOBEX, the 24-hours-a-day futures and options trading system launched last
week, has got off to a slow start, but its longer-term prospects are still
hard to gauge as key contracts have not yet been listed.
On its first full day's trading on Friday. the system traded just 2,000
contracts. The bulk of this was in DM/dollar and yen/dollar contracts, which
notched up 1,000 and 800 contracts respectively. Yesterday, volume slipped
to 1,700 contracts.
Mr Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex, which is backed by the Chicago
Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, said: 'I am
very pleased with the way the system has performed.'
Mr Ginter said he was encouraged by the quality of the market, with narrow
bid/offer spreads and a broad geographic range of business. So far Globex
screens are on-line in Paris and London as well as the US.
The CBOT has not yet been authorised by the UK Treasury, however, so its
10-year Treasury contract cannot be traded in London, where it would provide
a useful hedging instrument for swap dealers. The contract is traded until
10.30pm local time in Chicago, so the prospects for any increase are slim
ahead of UK authorisation, which is expected soon.
The low level of trading is not unexpected. Less active contracts were
chosen initially to test the system.
Exchange-listed currency derivative products are not widely used in Europe,
where there is a large over-the-counter market in such instruments. Some
market participants predict a shift towards exchange-traded foreign exchange
business, however, as concerns about counterparty credit risk mount. This
could favour Globex.
Interest in the system will not be fully tested until the most
actively-traded products become available in the next few months. Mr Martin
Booth, a director on Barclays de Zoete Wedd's futures desk, said: 'The real
launch will be when the Eurodollar contract is listed.'
Even the Eurodollar contract faces a tough battle, however. The contract is
already traded on Simex, the Singapore exchange, and Liffe in London -
although volume there is not high - as well as in Chicago and some traders
argue that after-hours trading is not needed.
The Eurodollar contract, with 30-year Treasury and Libor contracts, will be
listed in the next 75 days, following the listing of other currency
contracts and two and five-year note contracts in the next two weeks.
The system could face problems if a critical mass is not created. The head
of a futures brokerage in London said: 'It's difficult to motivate staff
when there's no business going through.'
At Dollars 800 a month for each terminal, the costs deter some market
participants.
In an effort to encourage business, Reuters has waived transaction fees of
50 cents per trade for the first four months, and for a further two months
in the case of marketmakers.
The exchanges have cut the Globex charges per contract for six months, and
for 12 months for market-makers.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Finland leads flurry of issues with
Dollars 1bn FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of new Eurodollar bond issues were launched in the international
bond market yesterday, most receiving a warm reception against the
background of a rally in US treasury bonds.
Finland continued its heavy international borrowing programme by launching
the first Eurodollar floating-rate note by a sovereign borrower since the
mid-1980s.
The Dollars 1bn five-year transaction, lead managed by Nomura International,
pays the six-month London inter-bank offered rate. Buyers included central
banks keen to hold liquid, sovereign floating rate paper. Commercial banks
were also active buyers, since they do not have to set aside capital against
holdings of OECD sovereign debt. Part of the proceeds of the Finland issue
were swapped with SBAB, the Swedish national housing finance corporation,
which launched a Dollars 500m fixed-rate deal, also lead managed by Nomura.
The back-to-back swap reflects the paucity of currency and interest rate
swap opportunities in the mainstream market.
The five-year SBAB deal was priced to yield 60 basis points more than US
Treasuries, considered aggressive by participants in the deal. Depressed
conditions in Sweden's housing market and financial system were seen as
deterring some potential buyers, although SBAB retains a credit rating just
one notch below the top triple-A level from the big rating agencies.
Redland, the UK building materials group, launched a Dollars 250m five-year
issue, lead managed by Goldman Sachs. The group raises most of its dollar
funding from banks and the US commercial paper market. Yesterday's issue was
its first in the Eurodollar market since the 1970s.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce the amount outstanding
under Redland's commercial paper programme, which rose from around Dollars
150m to Dollars 400m following the acquisition of rival building materials
group Steetley earlier this year.
The 7 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 90 basis points more than US
Treasury paper, considered good value by participants in the deal.
Eurodollar bonds issued by British Aerospace were trading yesterday at a
yield spread of 87 basis points.
City of Kobe launched a long-awaited Dollars 210m 10-year deal, lead managed
by Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. The bonds were priced to yield 30 basis
points more than treasuries, considered tight following a widening of
Eurodollar yield spreads last week. For example, the Asian Development
Bank's Dollars 500m 10-year deal was launched two weeks ago at a yield
spread of 26 basis points but was trading at around 30 basis points by the
close yesterday.
Elsewhere, European investors remained keen buyers of bonds denominated in
French francs, despite a sharp sell-off following Denmark's rejection of the
Maastricht treaty this month.
Yesterday, France Telecom saw an enthusiastic response to a FFr2bn nine-year
deal lead managed by Credit Lyonnais. The 9 per cent paper was re-offered to
investors at a fixed price of 99.34 for a yield 32 basis points more than
French government bonds. By the close the bonds stood at 99.55 bid, for a
yield spread of 28 basis points.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise after release of home
sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday following an unexpected
decline in monthly home sales.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 102
5/8 , yielding 7.765 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16
at 100 11/32 , yielding 4.801 per cent.
Prices opened firmer amid hopes that the Federal Reserve's policy-making
Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets today and tomorrow, will sanction
a cut in the discount rate, currently 3.5 per cent.
Recent evidence of economic weakness has buoyed hopes of a cut, and
yesterday's news of a 5.6 per cent drop in May new single-family home sales
only heightened the market's expectations.
The Fed, however, may not move until after the June employment report on
Thursday, although some insiders say the FOMC is likely to have advance
notice of the jobs data and could, therefore, lower rates before the
official release.
UK government bond prices fell back steadily during the day, losing nearly
half a point, due to the combination of sterling weakness and disappointment
over the outcome of the EC summit in Lisbon last weekend.
Sterling fell against the D-Mark, dipping below the 2.90 level to reach
2.8908/35 in the afternoon. Short-dated issues dropped by up to one-quarter
of a point, with the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 slipping from 104 3/4 to
104 17/32 . At the long end, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 tumbled
from 116 15/32 to 116 1/32 , while the recent auction stock - the 9 per cent
gilt due 2012 - fell from 35 3/8 to 35 1/16 , taking the partly-paid price.
Dealers said the weekend EC summit in Lisbon had proved a disappointment for
the gilt market due to the lack of a resolution on the future of the
Maastricht Treaty. 'The feeling is that the summit did not go any way
towards resolving the problems caused by Denmark's rejection of Maastricht',
said one economist.
THE German government bond market edged higher in dull trading yesterday,
with many of the market participants waiting for the release of the May
employment figures from the US on Thursday.
Dealers expressed some surprise that the European bond markets did not show
a more pronounced reaction to last weekend's EC summit in Lisbon. 'Given
that the markets wanted to hear about the bones of an agreement or plan to
get Maastricht back on the road again (at the Lisbon summit), I'm surprised
that the complete lack of clarity and lack of guidance in Lisbon did not
lead to a stronger reaction yesterday', said one dealer.
The state of Bavaria yesterday reported a cost-of-living increase of 0.3 per
cent in the month to mid-June, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.7 per cent.
The inflation figures were in line with expectations. Provisional consumer
price data for all of west Germany are due later this week.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.59 and edged up to 87.74 by
late afternoon, although volumes were low with only about 15,000 contracts
traded.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly weaker in Tokyo on profit-taking,
but picked up during London trading as the yen strengthened against the US
dollar.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.27 per cent, moved in a
range of 5.265 to 5.29 per cent, and closed in Tokyo at 5.285 per cent.
However, as the yen strengthened from 125.5 to 124.70 to the dollar during
London trading, dealers reported a rise in Japanese government bond prices.
The markets expect the Group of Seven industrialised nations to support a
strong yen at their meeting next week.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazil to ease way for
foreign portfolio hedging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investors are likely to be given permission this week to use
Brazil's stock futures and options markets to hedge their portfolios, the
head of the country's securities commission said yesterday.
Speaking in London, Mr Roberto Faldini, president of the Comissao de Valores
Mobiliarios, said an application would be made today to the monetary
council, a grouping of government and private sector officials which has the
right to rule on such matters.
He said that the inability to hedge portfolios was one factor discouraging
foreign investors.
However, they still may not hedge exchange rate fluctuations, a procedure
which would take more time to be approved.
Mr Arminio Fraga, senior Economy Ministry official, said there had been a
net inflow of funds into the Brazilian stock market since it opened up to
foreign investment about a year ago. Since early 1991, Brazilian entities
had raised Dollars 7bn through the issue of marketable securities.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Missile bid believed near for
Northrop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHROP, the US defence contractor, is believed to be close to joining
French state-owned arms maker Thomson-CSF in its Dollars 300m bid for the
missile business of LTV Corporation, the US steel company.
Thomson has been hurriedly talking with three US companies - Northrop,
Raytheon and Loral - in an attempt to find a US partner before a government
committee advising President George Bush on the security implications of the
French bid hands over its recommendations next month.
Sources close to the negotiations said yesterday that if Thomson clinched a
deal with a US partner it was most likely to be with Northrop, which has
already agreed to buy 49 per cent of LTV's aircraft business from Thomson's
partner, the Washington-based Carlyle Group of investors. If a deal is
struck, it will be announced in the next few days.
Thomson has been forced to seek US participation in its acquisition of the
LTV missile division because of US government concern that foreign ownership
of a US defence contractor might compromise national security.
US defence chiefs are particularly unhappy about allowing LTV's missile
operations to fall into the hands of a company controlled by a foreign
government. Thomson is 58 per cent owned by the French state.
Thomson hopes that if it can persuade a US partner to take over the
management of the missile operations, leaving the French group as a passive
investor, US fears about national security will be assuaged. If Thomson
failed to find a partner, however, the Dollars 300m deal could be scrapped.
Northrop and Thomson CSF would not confirm that they were nearing a deal
yesterday. Both companies said that they were 'exploring opportunities' with
each other, and declined to comment on the progress of the discussions or on
when they were likely to be concluded.
Thomson stressed its regret at 'the disproportion between what for us was a
simple business opportunity and the row that has blown up in US political
circles'.
Congressmen in Washington have recently expressed their opposition to
Thomson's proposed acquisition of LTV's missile division. Last month the
House armed services committee cited reports that the sale of arms to Iraq
by the French group may have breached US or French export laws as
justification for blocking the bid. Thomson denies breaking US or French
export laws.

A US bankruptcy court last night approved a one-month extension - until the
end of July - of the deadline by which The New York Daily News has to file
its reorganisation plan under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, writes Alan
Friedman.
The postponement will give more time for talks with prospective buyers of
the New York tabloid, which was bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell in
1991.
The two main contenders for The News are Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian
publisher who also owns the Daily Telegraph in London, and Mr Mortimer
Zuckerman, the property developer who owns US News and World Report and
Atlantic Monthly magazine.
The key issues for both bidders are the reaching of an agreement with the
trade unions representing the newspaper's 2,100 full and part-time workers
and the settling of claims by the paper's creditors.
Mr Black has already offered to set aside Dollars 75m for severance
payments, working capital and his offer to pay between 25 and 50 cents on
the dollar to creditors who are owed Dollars 43m. Mr Zuckerman is believed
to be his making proposals to union leaders this week.

CBS/FOX FILM, the home-video venture of CBS and Twentieth Century-Fox with
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said they have settled a lawsuit in which CBS accused
MGM of cheating CBS/Fox out of video cassette rights to successful films,
AP-DJ reports from New York. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
CBS/Fox filed its lawsuit against MGM in November 1989 in Manhattan, seeking
damages of Dollars 250m and an injunction granting it the home-video rights
to the film 'Rain Man' as well as other hit films.
The lawsuit also accused MGM of producing low-budget, inferior films solely
to satisfy the company's obligation to provide films to CBS/Fox under a
home-video contract.
*****
A CLASS action lawsuit has been filed by a New Jersey consumer against
Sears, Roebuck, the US retail chain, on behalf of people who paid Sears for
unnecessary and/or over-priced car repair services, AP-DJ reports.
The allegations include installation of parts that were not necessary, or
charges for repair services that were not performed. The suit also alleges
that Sears unjustly marked-up the prices for parts sold in connection with
the repairs.
*****
A SERIES of lawsuits against non-US steelmakers alleging unfair trading
practices may be launched today by the six largest American steel companies,
writes Alan Friedman.
Although the legal actions could bring retaliation from foreign steel
producers in up to 20 countries, US companies such as USX, Bethlehem Steel,
LTV and Armco are expected to file anyway.
*****
WASTE Management, the leading waste services company, expects second-quarter
earnings to increase by about 23 cents a share to a total of about 67 cents,
writes Barbara Durr in Chicago. This results from gains from an initial
public offering (IPO) of shares by Waste Management International and some
special charges.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Aetna plans 4,800 cut in payroll
by 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurance companies,
yesterday announced plans to shed 4,800 jobs by the end of next year as part
of a new cost-
cutting programme.
The company said it would take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 145m in the
second quarter to cover the severance, benefits and other costs related to
the plan. It hopes the job reductions will lead to pre-tax savings of about
Dollars 200m a year.
Aetna, which employs 46,000 people, plans to lose about 3,000 staff this
year and another 1,800 in 1993. About 40 per cent of the job cuts will be in
Connecticut, where Aetna has its headquarters.
The news is a blow to the north-eastern state, which has been affected by
the recent national recession.
Aetna revealed that about 80 per cent of the staff reductions would come
from four areas of business: group health insurance (about 1,300 jobs lost);
property-casualty field operations (1,000); property-casualty claims (800);
and systems and information technology (700).
The company said that payrolls in the various departments would be reduced
by 'redesigning work processes and dramatically streamlining the delivery of
customer service, consolidating certain functions, continued downsizing in
unprofitable markets and more aggressive cost-management.'
The job reduction programme is part of a large-scale restructuring at Aetna
which, like many other US insurers, has been trying to bolster reserves and
improve profits in the wake of problems with poor-performing property
investments.
Earlier this month it announced plans to sell its reinsurance subsidiary to
a buy-out vehicle for about Dollars 1.4bn.
The cost-reduction plan failed to impress Wall Street yesterday. The stock
closed Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 41 3/8 in New York, having touched
Dollars 40 7/8 .

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor group, has filed a patent
infringement lawsuit against Sanyo Electric which, it claims, is using its
semiconductor patents without a licence.
The move follows indications from Sanyo that the Japanese electronics group
was, in turn, preparing to file patent litigation against Texas Instruments
both in the US and Japan.
Sanyo said last week that it would file a lawsuit against the US group
unless it reduced the amount of royalties it was seeking for its patents.
Sanyo's legal counsel has claimed that Texas Instruments' conduct in its
negotiations constitutes patent misuse and anti-trust activity.
The two groups have had a cross-licensing agreement but this expired at the
end of 1990.
At the centre of the trans-Pacific patent disputes are a portfolio of
semiconductor patents held by Texas.
The US group, one of the most aggressive companies in seeking royalty
payments for its intellectual property, is also involved in a dispute with
Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and electronics group, over the Kilby patent,
which is a basic patent for the invention of the integrated circuit (IC)
covering all ICs made, used or sold in Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, said yesterday that it made an
operating profit in the first six months of the year, compared with a small
operating loss in the first half of last year. Turnover climbed 8 per cent
to DM4.95bn (Dollars 3.13bn).
Helped by good sales for tyres and technical products - and a cut in losses
at General Tire, its US subsidiary - the group forecast that it was on
course to make a profit for the whole year after a net loss of DM128.2m for
last year.
Continental said shareholders would benefit from the improvement, but that
it was to early to make a pronouncement about dividend policy. No dividend
was paid last year.
The statement came a few days ahead of Friday's annual meeting in Hanover,
at which the company will face a challenge from Pirelli, the Italian tyre
company which owns 5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further
34 per cent stake.
For the second year running, Pirelli is seeking to overturn the rule which
limits shareholder's voting rights in the German company to 5 per cent, no
matter how big their stake. The companies abandoned merger talks in
December.
The outcome of the meeting is likely to hinge on the technicality of whether
Pirelli is allowed to vote the full 39 per cent stake.
It seems likely that Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the Continental
supervisory board and a main board director at Deutsche Bank, will order
that Pirelli can speak for no more than 5 per cent of the votes. This would
mean that Pirelli would not be able to command the necessary majority.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Players line up for Adidas
action / Examining a crucial week for Bernard Tapie's group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French entrepreneur and politician,
announced two years ago that he was buying Adidas, one of the world's
leading sporting goods groups, it looked like the biggest coup of his
business career.
Today, the Adidas acquisition looks more like nemesis for Mr Tapie, who was
last month forced to resign from the French cabinet because of an alleged
fraud case. His business reputation has suffered as Bernard Tapie Finances
(BTF), his holding company, desperately struggles to make disposals to meet
the deadlines on its Adidas debt. Adidas itself is clouded by rumours of
bids, counter-bids, redundancies and resignations while Mr Tapie decides
whether he can afford to hold on to it.
This week will be critical. Yesterday, there was a stormy meeting of BTF's
shareholders who asked why the company had fallen from net profits of
FFr47.97m in 1990 to a net loss of FFr294.9m (Dollars 56.9m) in 1991, how
disposals plans were progressing, and whether it would be able to meet its
debt schedule.
Today, there will be another shareholders' meeting, this time at Adidas. Its
investors will want to know why the company's profits fell - from DM90m to
DM44m - last year and about the mysterious DM1bn management buy-out bid
unveiled by Mr Rene Jaggi, Adidas' chief executive, on Friday. Most of all,
they will want to know whether Mr Tapie plans to hold on to his controlling
55 per cent stake or if he will be forced to sell it to pay off the debt
incurred to buy Adidas in the first place.
Before the Adidas deal, Mr Tapie was seen as one of France's most successful
entrepreneurs. By 1989 He had created a company with net profits of
FFr27.7m, sales of FFr1bn, and estimated debt of FFr300m. Adidas was much
bigger, with sales of DM4.6bn in 1989. It was also in the red with estimated
losses of DM120m. Mr Tapie had to borrow at least FFr2.2bn to buy it.
He trumpeted his acquisition with the proud promises that he would keep
Adidas, and his investment, intact. Less than a year later he was
negotiating not only to sell some of its subsidiaries but also 40 per cent
of Adidas to a consortium of investors, notably Pentland, the UK consumer
products group, which emerged with a 20 per cent holding and pre-emptive
rights over the remaining Tapie stake.
Meanwhile, the original BTF was disappearing as Mr Tapie sold off its
businesses to pay off his short-term debt on Adidas. By the end of 1991 BTF,
which had lost FFr295m during the year, had net debt of FFr3.64bn and
shareholders' funds of FFr1.72bn. But Mr Tapie had managed to make his
short-term repayments. Earlier this month, when BTF's results were
published, Mr Tapie sought to lighten the gloom of its losses by announcing
that he would make the final FFr615m repayment a month ahead of the
scheduled date of August 6.
BTF has already raised FFr365m through a series of disposals and plans to
raise the remaining FFr250m by selling its Testut-Teraillon weighing machine
business and Scaime, a small industrial concern.
BTF claims that it can still make the FFr615m payment ahead of schedule.
Even so, it will still be left with substantial net debt and with Adidas as
its only remaining business. This raises doubts about Mr Tapie's ability to
hold on to Adidas.
Last month Mr Tapie confirmed that he might consider selling Adidas.
Pentland immediately presented itself as a prospective purchaser 'at the
right price'. Devanlay, the French textile group, has since expressed
interest in Adidas' clothing interests.
But on Friday Mr Tapie announced he had received a management buy-out offer.
Mr Jaggi confirmed that he had tabled a DM1bn bid with a deadline of today.
Adidas, the company for which Mr Tapie risked - and may have lost -
everything, is waiting to hear its fate. Mr Tapie himself is keeping an
uncharacteristically low profile. He did not attend yesterday's BTF meeting,
and at the weekend was quoted in a French newspaper as saying that he was
tempted to go to his yacht and sail away.
BTF, Mr Bernard Tapie's holding company, yesterday confirmed it was
considering selling its controlling stake in Adidas.
Mr Elie Fellous, who took over as chairman of BTF in April told shareholders
that the board was considering three offers for Adidas.
Mr Fellous did not comment on the identity of the prospective purchasers,
except to confirm that BTF had received a DM1bn bid for its stake in Adidas
from the management team led by Mr Jaggi.  Mr Fellous said that the news of
the Jaggi bid had 'elicited two other offers' for the company.
Pentland Holdings said it had not tabled 'a viable offer'.  Mr Frank
Farrant, finance director, said that Pentland 'had not seen any of the three
offers'.
BTF's shares were suspended at FFr130 on Friday.  The company said they
would remain suspended until it had reached a decision about the future of
Adidas.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tabacalera lifts pay-out as
profits rise 16%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TABACALERA, Spain's government-controlled tobacco manufacturer and
distributor, has raised its dividend by 20 per cent to Pta180 a share
following a 16 per cent rise in net profits to Pta14.2bn (Dollars 147m) in
1991.
Tabacalera, which is 52 per cent state-owned and whose non-Spanish
shareholders represent 27 per cent of the total equity, has already paid a
Pta80 interim dividend.
Mr German Calvillo, chairman, expects the company to raise net profits this
year to Pta15.4bn and to repeat a 20 per cent increase in its 1993 pay-out
to shareholders.
In the latest of its diversification ventures, Tabacalera is to become a
leading shareholder in Elosua, Spain's second-biggest edible oils company.
Mr Calvillo plans for Tabacalera to assume management responsibilities in
Elosua in partnership with Ebro, a big Spanish food company controlled by
the Kuwait Investment Office.

<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the fast-growing niche pharmaceuticals company, has signed a
conditional agreement worth Dollars 28.6m (Pounds 15.4m) to acquire
International Medication Systems, a Californian-based pharmaceuticals
manufacturer.
The consideration consists of Dollars 24m for the company and deferred
payments of Dollars 4.6m for royalties on a new patented heart-attack
product called Carbicarb. Medeva said yesterday that IMS's net assets were
Pounds 10m at the end of last year.
Medeva is financing the deal through additional dollar borrowings. It said,
however, that its policy was not to build up significant long-term loans.
The group has raised Pounds 196m over the last two years.
IMS, which manufactures specialised injectable delivery systems, had
turnover of Dollars 39m last year but only broke even before interest costs.
Medeva said it expected the net effect of IMS not to be significant in 1992
but that it would make a net contribution from 1993.

raised bid

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate, is finally
poised to acquire Finanzauto following a new bid that has raised the value
of Spain's sole Caterpillar distributor by 13 per cent to Pta15.9bn (Pounds
86.2m).
Mr Jose Antonio Gonzalez, Finanzauto's chief executive, said that the
company would drop its two month long hostility to Bibby's bid at an
extraordinary meeting scheduled for yesterday evening.
Finanzauto's decision to adopt a neutral position brings to an end one of
the roughest foreign takeovers of a Spanish company.
Madrid analysts said yesterday that the change of stance by Finanzauto paved
the way for Bibby to acquire the greater part of the equity at the increased
offer price of Pta1,500 (800p) per share.
To Finanzauto's extreme irritation, Bibby, which is owned by Barlow Rand of
South Africa, had originally valued Finanzauto at Pounds 75m in late April
and had offered Pta1,300 per share to the Spanish company's fragmented
equity holders.
Claiming that the value of the company's stock was closer to Pta1,700,
Finanzauto mounted a stiff defence.
Analysts believe that Bibby may have paid too much from the point of view of
a stock market investor, but that the final price could be justified as a
long term industrial investment.
Finanzauto is suffering the consequences of a deep recession in the Spanish
construction sector, but it has close to 25 per cent of the domestic earth
moving market.
Bibby has requested Madrid's stock market commission to investigate
Finanzauto's share price movements over the past two months.

toll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASPREY, the Bond Street jeweller which last year bought its rival Mappin &amp;
Webb, blamed a deepening of the world recession for a 21 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
Profit fell from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 19.4m pre-tax on increased sales of
Pounds 107m (Pounds 100m).
Mr John Asprey, chairman, said all outlets has been affected by the economic
downturn.
The depressed market was responsible for the closure of its Fenchurch Street
branch in London in line with its rationalisation of City outlets. Most of
the staff have been redeployed at its Bond Street showrooms.
Earnings per share fell to 15.14p (18.54p). A same-again final dividend of
3.75p makes an unchanged total of 4.85p.

from turnover of Dollars 3.56m for the year to end-March.
This compares with a loss of Dollars 136,000 from sales of Dollars 3.44m

Mr Frank Denton, chairman, said the improving financial position was

Earnings per share came out at 1 cent (1 cent losses).

However, the company also announced a trading venture with Shaklee Japan, a

Regina would become a main brand in this market.
Losses included an exceptional charge of Pounds 147,000 for start-up costs
of the new US operation and reorganisation of the Irish interests. Also
included was a provision for the carrying cost of the former headquarters in
Elstree.
Losses per share were 0.34p (earnings 0.09p).

Avesco, the radio and electronic goods and television and film services
company, turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.26m for the year ended March
31, against a Pounds 1.15m profit last time.
Turnover was down from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 17.9m. The company blamed the
figures on the Gulf war, ITV franchise renewals and the recession.
It has, however, kept up spending on research and development, with Pounds
3.2m last year being invested mainly in Videologic, its multimedia computer
arm which announced a joint venture with IBM this weekend.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 121,000) arising
from the disposals of the System Video business and assets of Spaceward.
Losses per share were 3.4p against earnings of 2p. No final dividend is
recommended (1p), making a total of 0.5p (1.5p).

In spite of continuing difficult trading conditions Turnbull Scott Holdings,
the motor and property group, achieved a profit before tax of Pounds 570,000
in the year to March 31.
This was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 135,000 and compared
with a loss of Pounds 3.39m last time.
The bulk of last year's loss related to Pounds 3.89m of exceptional charges
covering property write-downs and the closure of the TS Frobisher property
arm.
The profit came on turnover halved from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 13.1m.
Earnings per share came out at 6.1p (37.5p losses).
The Turnbull family intends to take the group private and is offering 130p a
share in cash and loan stock for the outstanding equity.

SHARES IN Maddox Group were suspended at 8 3/4 p yesterday in advance of a
placing and open offer to raise almost Pounds 18m to buy a private company
for Pounds 13.1m.
Maddox is headed by Mr Hugo Biermann who built up Thomson T-Line, the
industrial distribution group which was bought for Pounds 186m in February
1989 by Ladbroke, the leisure group. It has two main businesses - Cables &amp;
Flexibles, a distributor bought back from Ladbroke last year, and Seacoast
Electrical Corporation in the US, which Thomson had previously planned to
acquire.
Mr Biermann said that the company to be acquired was in the 'same cabling
and network services field', but would move Maddox 'up the chain away from
distribution and into installation and service and maintenance' for personal
computers for the corporate market.
There were 'some' synergies with C&amp;F and more with Cablelink and ECS, other
subsidiaries. He could not reveal the name of the company for legal reasons.
The consideration is Pounds 10m. Of this Pounds 1.3m is to be issued to the
vendors in new ordinary shares; the balance will be in cash.

FT  30 JUN 92 / TWA in talks with other airlines: Discussions with USAir
could involve British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKRUPT US airline Trans World Airlines (TWA) has held talks recently with
another ailing US carrier, USAir, 'and others', according to Mr Carl Icahn,
the owner of TWA.
However, Mr Icahn described the potential sale of TWA assets to USAir as
'premature', saying that there was no firm offer on the table.
He made no specific reference to British Airways, which is rumoured to be a
possible investor in the enlarged USAir. Both British Airways and USAir
declined to comment.
Other sources in the US suggested that talks between the carriers had been
underway for several months. 'We are aware that talks have been going on
among all three at the same time,' said one party close to the TWA
bankruptcy. 'We heard that BA was interested. Something seems to be hotting
up.'
The TWA branch of the Airline Pilots Association also confirmed that it had
some limited, but 'constructive' discussions with representatives from BA
and USAir, as well as extensive discussions with TWA's management over the
matter.
The rumoured deal would involve USAir, which has made heavy losses in recent
years, acquiring many of TWA's assets. BA would then recapitalise the
expanded USAir business, taking a large minority stake in return.
USAir has previously acknowledged merger or acquisition talks with a variety
of other carriers, including TWA. In turn, TWA is known to have talked to
other possible buyers or partners, such as Continental Airlines.
Mr Icahn added that 'alternatives' to the talks with 'USAir and others' were
being evaluated. However, there was scepticism yesterday over how quickly or
easily such a three-way transaction might be arranged.
BA has been scouting the US for some time for a partnership to increase its
US market penetration. But the company has indicated it was in no hurry and
was also looking for partners in Asia and Europe.
Earlier this year, BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines unsuccessfully attempted
to merge in a deal which might also have involved Northwest Airlines of the
US. KLM holds a stake in Northwest. KLM is still regarded as BA's most
plausible partner and contacts between the two are expected to be renewed
later this year.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Ronson raises possibility of new equity for Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD Ronson, chairman and chief executive of Heron International, the
private property, housebuilding and automotive group which is undergoing a
Pounds 1.3bn refinancing, said yesterday that 'some form of equity' might
form part of the solution to the group's debt problems.
Mr Ronson, his family trusts and charitable foundations are the current
shareholders in Heron. They have told banks and bondholders that they are
not in a position to inject new equity.
However, in a letter to holders of the group's Pounds 500m worth of bonds
yesterday, Mr Ronson raised the possibility of equity being issued. This
could be part of an exchange offer to be made to bondholders.
The letter was part of a document outlining a report on the group produced
by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, for the group's 80 banks. The report
was presented to the banks earlier this month.
Heron has extended the standstill agreement with its lenders from today
until the end of July.
The KPMG report concluded that the best chance for lenders to the group to
recoup their loans would be an orderly sale of properties over four to seven
years, rather than an immediate liquidation.
Liquidation would result in an estimated loss of Pounds 550m to lenders.
Bondholders and banks which had lent to the head office company would
recover between 28 per cent and 59 per cent of their money, with most
getting towards the lower end of that range.
There are four sub-groups within the Heron empire, the report said. Two -
Heron Corporation, which includes the housebuilding and automotive
activities as well as property companies in the UK, France and Switzerland,
and the European property division, covering Spain, Portugal, Germany and
Belgium - have positive net assets of Pounds 318m and Pounds 363m
respectively.
Lenders to these two sub-groups 'should be capable of being repaid as
properties are realised over a period of time', the KPMG report said.
The other two - the head office company, which is the guarantor of all the
company's bonds, and the US division - have negative net assets of Pounds
607m and Pounds 283m respectively. Both have suspended interest payments on
Pounds 700m of debt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HENRI MARTRE, chairman of Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace
group, is to be replaced unexpectedly by Mr Louis Gallois, head of Snecma,
the French state aero-engine company. Mr Gallois' appointment is expected to
be confirmed by the French cabinet tomorrow.
It had been widely thought the government would extend the Aerospatiale
chairman's contract until he retires next February.
The change at the helm of Aerospatiale, a 37.9 per cent partner in the
Airbus airliner consortium, is one of the few surprises in the current round
of top appointments at state-owned French companies.
Last week, Mr Francis Lorentz was replaced as chairman of the loss-making
Bull computer group by Mr Bernard Pache, head of the French coal board and a
former chairman of the Pechiney aluminium group.
Yesterday Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe Nationale des Assurances
(GAN), two of France's largest state-controlled insurance companies, voted
to renominate their chairmen, Mr Michel Albert and Mr Francois Heilbronner.
These nominations are expected to be endorsed tomorrow by the government.
The board of Union des Assurances de Paris, another state-owned insurance
company, meets today, and is expected to renominate its chairman, Mr Jean
Peyrelevade.
Mr Martre has been steering the Aerospatiale through the slump in civil
aviation and the fall in military business caused by the end of the Cold
War.
He has been a leading figure in the fortunes of Airbus and a strong
supporter of European aerospace collaboration.
Mr Gallois had long been regarded as a pretender for Mr Martre's job. A key
adviser to former Socialist prime minister Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Gallois has
headed Snecma for the past three years where he has sought to carve out a
more individual identity for the French aero-engine group closely tied to
General Electric of the US.
Under Mr Gallois, contacts have improved between the French company and
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine company and one of the main rivals of GE.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Imro chief quits after criticism of watchdog body over
Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, RAYMOND SNODDY and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE NISSEN, chairman of Imro, the fund management industry watchdog,
resigned yesterday after widespread criticism of his organisation's role in
the Maxwell affair.
He said Imro was 'open to a share of reproach' but insisted much criticism
of it had been 'misplaced'.
Mr Charles Nunneley, a director of Imro and deputy chairman of Robert
Fleming Holdings, the investment banking group, will act as chairman until a
successor is appointed.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is due to
release a report later this week on Imro's supervision of Mr Robert
Maxwell's fund management companies. The report is expected to criticise
Imro for letting Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), one of Mr
Maxwell's fund management companies, operate under a looser than normal
regulatory regime.
Imro's report to the SIB on its own supervision of the Maxwell companies
concluded that it could not have barred them from operation but should have
supervised them more closely. It also criticised professional advisers to
the Maxwell pension funds for failing to alert regulators to problems they
uncovered.
Earlier this month, Mr David Corsan, an Imro board member and former partner
at accountants Coopers and Lybrand, announced he would not seek
reappointment. Mr Corsan had been a director of the Maxwell Charitable
Trust, of which BIM was a subsidiary. It also emerged yesterday that two
senior Imro officials closely involved with authorising and supervising Mr
Maxwell's companies have resigned in the past two weeks.
The Financial Services Act requires Imro to decide which fund management
companies are 'fit and proper' to do business and to supervise their
activities. Imro authorised two Maxwell-controlled fund managers, BIM and
London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management.
Mr Frank Field, Labour co-chairman of the cross-party group of MPs
campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, applauded Mr Nissen for
resigning and accepting responsibility.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman, also welcomed Mr Nissen's
resignation and called on Mr John Morgan, Imro's chief executive, to do
likewise. Mr Morgan has already said he will retire in September 1993, when
his current contract expires.

funeral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TERRIBLE were the things that happened here; lucky are those who did not
see it.'
With cadences almost biblical in their ring, and with language stark in its
simplicity, Mr Simon Moloi gave a harrowing account of Boipatong's nightmare
and his personal tragedy. In one of the coffins surrounded by the sombre
funeral crowd before him lay the body of his wife, eight months pregnant
when slaughtered.
Late on the night of June 17 men carrying axes and speaking Zulu began a
township rampage that has gone down in the annals of South Africa's bloody
post-apartheid history, Mr Moloi told yesterday's vast Boipatong gathering.
Two white men carrying guns accompanied the gang, he told the vast crowd,
hushed but for the sobbing of relatives gathered around the coffins of 34 of
the 42 victims.
Mr Moloi was separated from his wife amid the carnage. A low moan of shared
pain came from the crowd as Mr Moloi described the ghastly moment when he
lifted the blanket covering a corpse and identified his wife.
Later the mood changed. While Mr Moloi had had the air of detachment that
sometimes accompanies intense grief, other speakers were gripped by an anger
and passion which may bring a new dimension to South African politics.
The anger might have been expected from the radical Mr Chris Hani, leader of
the South African Communist party and head of the ANC's military wing, or
the firebrand trade unionist, Mr Jay Naidoo. But their sentiments were
echoed by most other speakers and they struck a responsive note that echoed
beyond the crowd and into South Africa's tense townships.
Archbishop Trevor Huddlestone, the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner entered
into the spirit of the day, preaching the virtue of hate when applied to a
virtuous cause such as the destruction of apartheid.
He had always said that apartheid would be defeated in his lifetime, he
reminded the crowd, and added a touch of grim humour: 'I'm in my 80th year.
So get on with it, time is short.'
By early afternoon, the speeches over, a long cortege made its way to nearby
Sharpeville cemetery, where Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu began an
emotional funeral service.
Outside the cemetery, the mood had been changing as the procession inched
its way through the township streets. Those streets - often no more than
rutted dirt tracks - had been cleared for the occasion of the makeshift
barricades blocking the way of armoured patrols.
The townships' angry youths were out in strength, brandishing placards
denouncing President FW de Klerk as a murderer. 'One settler, one bullet,'
chanted supporters of the radical Pan Africanist Congress. Others moved in
gangs, performing the toyi-toyi, a rhythmic knee-high dance of defiance and
revolution.
By late afternoon, the coffins were being lowered into graves. But tension
was growing and one onlooker warned of trouble to come.
Thankfully, those forebodings were not realised despite skirmishes between
police and mourners. By late evening it seemed that the day had ended
without serious incident.
But as the programme of mass action gets under way, bloodshed seems
inevitable. The threat of violence, as demonstrators confront security
forces, is just below the surface.

THE African National Congress yesterday demanded the resignation of South
African president FW de Klerk, saying he had lost control of the police and
failed to prevent massacres of blacks, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
A series of attacks on Mr de Klerk came at the mass funeral for the victims
of the recent Boipatong massacre. Amid growing anger, a succession of
politicians, including members of the ANC's radical rivals, the Pan
Africanist Congress and Azapo, found common cause.
Joined at the funeral by Mr Jay Naidoo, leader of the country's largest
union, they made clear their determination to force Mr de Klerk to concede
majority rule by strikes, demonstrations and civil disobedience.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Relief supplies land at Sarajevo as UN takes control of
airport

A FRENCH aircraft carrying relief supplies landed at Sarajevo airport
yesterday, hours after United Nations forces took control of the runway.
Serb irregular forces relinquished their hold on the airport after fierce
international pressure, and were escorted to their barracks south-west of
the besieged Bosnian capital by a 34-man UN force.
After the withdrawal, the UN Security Council, meeting in New York,
unanimously agreed to send 1,000 Canadian troops, on standby in the nearby
former Yugoslav republic of Croatia, to secure the airport.
The Security Council's decision, based on a recommendation from Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, could lead in the next few days to
an airlift of humanitarian aid to the city's 300,000 starving inhabitants.
Despite yesterday's developments, General Lewis MacKenzie, UN chief
negotiator in Sarajevo, said full military control of the airport still had
to be established.
However, the French, who had stationed two air force Transall cargo carriers
at the nearby Adriatic port of Split, decided to risk sending in the first
relief flight.
Western diplomats welcomed the news, but said the fighting around the city
was unlikely to stop. Serb forces continued to keep a tight grip on
Sarajevo, renewing their attacks on the city from surrounding hills.
In Washington, the US State Department for the first time refused to rule
out participation of US military personnel in any operation to bring relief
supplies to Sarajevo.
'If the UN votes on a resolution to take all necessary measures to
facilitate provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, it would be an action that we would support,' said
department spokeswoman Ms Margaret Tutwiler.
The Canadian battalion, expected in Sarajevo over the next 36 hours, is
equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers.
The troops will work with French airport technicians to demilitarise the
airport and surrounding areas.
Sixty UN observers and 30 UN police will monitor the withdrawal of Serb
heavy artillery from the airport area and inspect incoming relief supplies
for smuggled weapons.
Robert Mauthner, diplomatic correspondent, in London writes: Foreign Office
officials said any further troops needed to secure Sarajevo airport would
also be supplied by the UN.
There was no shortage of countries ready to contribute troops to a UN force,
but under no circumstances would Britain contribute ground forces to a UN
contingent likely to be involved in fighting.

FT  30 JUN 92 / For want of a symbol an aircraft was lost: Germany's
threatened withdrawal from the EFA project presents difficult options for
its partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project is hanging on a
German parliamentary party vote today to allocate an additional Pounds 34m
to the Pounds 20bn programme.
A decision to reject the extra funding could rapidly lead to German
withdrawal from the four-nation project. The political, strategic and
industrial implications would be huge.
At stake are thousands of jobs in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. In the
UK alone, British Aerospace estimates that EFA could create up to 100,000
jobs, directly and through indirect employment. Military aircraft industries
in each of the four countries would be threatened with repercussions on
commercial aerospace. Industrial collaboration on a European scale would be
undermined as would Nato's longer-term air defence requirements.
In theory, a no vote would not automatically end German participation in the
programme, in which the German parliament has already committed DM5.85bn
(Pounds 2bn) to overall development costs.
In practice, a decision not to authorise an extra DM100m in the 1993 defence
budget for tooling investments to prepare for EFA production next year would
be interpreted as a sign of Germany's intention to abandon the project.
'The DM100m is a derisory amount of money but it would show Germany's
continued faith in the programme and remove the short-term uncertainties
surrounding EFA,' a British official said yesterday. However, he
acknowledged that the chances of a yes vote were slim.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has vigorously campaigned
against EFA, proposing last week that the programme should be scrapped and
replaced with the development of a cheaper, lighter combat aircraft.
EFA's supporters in Germany have been fighting a fierce rearguard action to
keep the country in the project. But they remain outnumbered by its
opponents.
The issue, however, is by no means cut and dried. Even a no vote today will
leave several different options open for Germany and its three EFA partners.
The most unlikely but clearly best solution for Britain, Italy and Spain, as
well as for the German aerospace industry, would be a firm German commitment
to stay in the project. The alternatives include:
German withdrawal from the production phase of the fighter starting next
year, regarded as the worst option for the UK and the other EFA countries.
Although a pull-out would jeopardise the project, the UK believes the
programme could still be rescued. British Aerospace claims costs could be
held down to Pounds 21m-Pounds 23m per aircraft - the same level currently
envisaged - and at least 450 aircraft would be bought by the three remaining
countries. The programme's production break-even point is about 400 aircraft
and the partners expect additional export demand.
However, many in the industry, as well as senior Ministry of Defence
officials, fear that a German pull-out would have damaging psychological
repercussions in the other partner countries, raise serious questions about
European collaboration and increase the risk of a Spanish withdrawal.
Without Spanish participation, the viability of EFA as a two-nation
Anglo-Italian project would be in even graver doubt. It would also take at
least 18 months to reorganise the programme and partnership in the event of
a German withdrawal. Germany postpones a decision to participate in the EFA
production phase. This is regarded as the most likely outcome of today's
vote. The other partners favour the idea of maintaining some German
industrial participation in EFA to enable it to re-enter the programme at a
later date. This may give the government and Deutsche Aerospace more time to
swing the political mood in favour of the fighter.
The partners have also proposed changes in the EFA work-sharing arrangements
to cut costs, including the reduction of assembly lines and test sites to
make the programme more politically acceptable in Germany. However, some of
the industrial partners, especially subcontractors, fear that half-hearted
German participation would be the worst of all worlds. It would maintain
uncertainty over the project at a time when expensive commitments were
required on new production facilities.
The replacement of EFA with a cheaper, lighter aircraft. Mr Ruhe's proposal
to this effect has been dismissed by the three other countries as well as
Deutsche Aerospace as a non-starter. A smaller, lighter aircraft would have
lower operational capability, and carry less fuel and fewer weapons. It
would entail new airframe and engine designs. The UK estimates the
development of a new fighter would lead to a delay of at least eight years
in the programme and would ultimately cost about 20 per cent more than EFA.
Mr Ruhe's proposal to extend the collaboration to France or Sweden, or both,
also appears unrealistic. The smaller French Rafale fighter is being
designed essentially for French naval and ground-attack applications with an
air defence capability as a secondary role. The Swedish Gripen JAS-39 is a
single-engine fighter which would rule it out in Germany where the air force
is insisting on a twin-engine combat aircraft. Its speed is also a
shortcoming.
The off-the-shelf acquisition by Germany and conceivably by other EFA
partners of US or Russian alternatives. Potential purchases include the
McDonnell Douglas F-15, its planned successor, the Lockheed-Boeing-General
Dynamics F-22, or the Russian Mig-29, of which the German air force
inherited 24 after reunification. All serious alternatives to EFA have been
tested by the partners. Their studies, however, have shown that existing
aircraft on the market or derivatives of these aircraft cannot provide the
performance required for a modern fighter long after 2000 as cheaply as EFA.
Few would argue that the debate in Germany has been sensible and informed.
There has been little careful analysis in the German media, or in
parliament, of the price and capabilities of alternative combat aircraft.
There has been no serious questioning of the likely budget savings to be
made. The desire to abandon EFA is more a desire to destroy a symbol.
The belated realisation in the German defence lobby that the debate over EFA
was as good as lost has galvanised frantic activity in recent weeks. This
may yet succeed in buying a delay. But it cannot change the political
reality that Mr Ruhe so clearly perceives: EFA in the German popular mind is
part of an era of extravagant Cold war defence spending that has now past.
If he succeeds today in pushing a decision to axe German participation in
EFA through the parliamentary parties in the German government, he will be
responsible for what will arguably be the most popular decision taken by the
coalition since its re-election in 1990. But for the EFA programme, it may
not have been the fairest of trials.

Sprawl - the Society for Promoting Road Accidents by Writing Ludicrously -
is at its nefarious work again. The latest example, photographed and sent in
by the Company Writers consultancy, is a highway notice reading: 'Physical

As the consultancy says, a good many passing motorists would be in danger of
hitting something before they'd worked out that what the notice means is
'Road narrows'.
Even so, Observer finds it easier to translate Sprawl's verbiage than to

Which is the more important job - being finance director of Britain's
biggest company or chief executive of a medium-sized fund management firm?
The question is raised by Glaxo's reorganisation of its finance team.
John Hignett, a former head of the City Takeover Panel and ex-Lazard
corporate finance chieftain, is handing over his title as Glaxo's managing
director, finance, to John Coombe, a 46-year-old chartered accountant. After
Hignett has finished adding up this year's profits, he will turn his
full-time attention to managing Glaxo's Pounds 1.2bn cash mountain.
While it's good to see that the company is taking seriously the job of
husbanding its fortune, it is still hard to believe that it is a task which
will stretch Hignett's talents. And anyway his skills lie not in fund
management but in corporate finance.
Could it be that, now 58, he just wants a quieter life?

evidently doesn't now. 'Who was the first socialist?' he asked recently,
before answering his own question: 'Christopher Columbus, because he didn't
know where he was going and when he got there he didn't know where he was,
but he didn't care because he didn't have to pay for it.'
A listening Thai economist commented later that he'd heard the crack before.
But then the question had been: 'Who was the first economist?'

It is always rather sad when a respected chairman resigns because something

the position of John Morgan, the watchdog's full-time chief executive.
At least Robert Fleming's Charles Nunneley, who will be Imro's acting
chairman, is a professional fund-manager. But otherwise his views about how
Imro should conduct its affairs don't sound terribly radical.
In a letter to the Securities &amp; Investment Review magazine, Nunneley says
that 'pressures to change the system whenever a fraud is discovered will
lead only to greater expense and uncertainty, and are particularly
ill-advised when the system is only just beginning to settle down'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Derek Bibby, chairman of Britain's oldest independent deep sea shipping
company, has not made the same mistake as his ancestors. Whereas the first
five chairmen died in harness, and his father was 80 before he could be
persuaded to let go, Sir Derek has handed over the helm at a youthful 70.
Admittedly, fellow baronet Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham - the new chairman -
may only be keeping the seat warm until Sir Derek's son, young Mr Michael,
can take over. However, the introduction of a non-family member as chairman
marks a significant break for one of Britain's more buccaneering
ship-owners.
Having nearly gone bust in the mid-1970s, Bibby Line has reduced its
exposure to deep sea shipping by investing in such off-beat areas as
floating prisons and refugee ships in Manhattan and Hamburg. But at least it
is still afloat which is more than can be said for most of Liverpool's once
famous shipping companies . . .
Meanwhile, Sir Derek will remain honorary president, and a fountain of
useful advice. Among his many tips (published in a recent booklet for the
Birkenhead Boys' Club), the one Observer liked best was: 'If you move into a
parish where you are expected to take on the role of the local squire, it is
more important to have the church's roof surveyed than that of your own
house as the former may cost you much more.'

FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Algerian cycle of violence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REACTION of the Algerian regime to the assassination yesterday of its
nominal leader, Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, is easy to predict. No one will doubt
that the assassins are members of an Islamic group, and the blame will be
put on the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), whose leaders Mr Abbasi
Madani and Mr Ali Ben Hadj went on trial on Saturday, facing charges that
carry the death penalty. The regime will argue that Mr Boudiaf's tragic
death proves - if further proof is needed - that the FIS and its supporters
are men of violence, and that the decision to cancel the elections last
January in which the FIS was about to come to power was amply justified. The
crackdown on Islamic militants of all sorts will be reinforced.
That reaction cannot alter the fact that Mr Boudiaf's death is a severe blow
to the regime's credibility. For by far its strongest claim to support,
whether from foreign creditors or from the Algerian public, was its promise
to restore public order and maintain stability. It was continuing, though
not as fast or decisively as its western well-wishers would like, on the
path of economic reform begun under President Chadli Bendjedid. But
political stability was an essential pre-requisite for economic success.
Thus what had been particularly welcome to the International Monetary Fund,
and even more so to European governments which have a big stake in stability
on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, was that the decision 10 days
ago to halve subsidies on bread, semolina and milk, and to remove completely
those on all other basic foodstuffs, was not followed by any immediate
public disturbances. Any comfort to be drawn from that has now been more
than cancelled out.
One should of course be cautious about taking an assassination as in itself
evidence of widespread discontent. But the murder of the head of state
during a public meeting does call in question, about as radically as
anything can, the regime's ability to maintain order. All the more so when
the fatal shot is fired by a man wearing the uniform of an elite unit of the
security forces: this suggests that sympathy for the Islamic opposition has
penetrated close to the heart of the state.
Mr Boudiaf himself was an honourable man. A hero of the struggle against
France, he fell out with President Ahmed Ben Bella soon after independence
and went into exile, where he remained for 28 years, thereby avoiding any
association with the dictatorial methods, economic mismanagement and
corruption of the former ruling party, the Front de Liberation National. It
was precisely for that reason that the army asked him to take over as head
of state when it intervened to depose President Chadli and cancel the
elections last January.
Mr Boudiaf's intentions were good. He made real efforts to root out
corruption, and was no doubt sincere in his desire to make a new attempt at
introducing democracy once the situation was under control and the FIS
neutralised. But the fact remained that his only mandate to govern came from
the guns of the men who had put him there, and this weakens the regime's
moral case against those who committed yesterday's crime.
It was entirely understandable that westernised middle-class Algerians were
reluctant to entrust their country's fate to the FIS, some of whose leaders
had openly declared that multiparty democracy is incompatible with Islam.
Army officers may well have felt that President Chadli had shown gross
incompetence in choosing a single-member-constituency electoral system which
allowed the FIS to win an overwhelming majority of seats on a minority of
votes, and that he would not be strong enough, whatever his constitutional
powers, to prevent a FIS government from establishing permanent control of
the state.
But having cancelled the elections, they were unable, even with Mr Boudiaf's
help, to formulate any clear new direction for the country. Without him,
their power will be more blatantly than ever based on force alone, unless
they can establish a dialogue with the opposition whose leaders are now on
trial, leading to national reconciliation with an agreed procedure and
timetable for new elections.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Danger and decadence go to rot - Fine arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the artists who achieved an international super-stardom in the 1980s,
the German painter, Anselm Kiefer has, until now, seemed one of the more
interesting and substantial. Through all those febrile neo-neo years of
figurative expressionism revived, his work, darkly histrionic and
angst-ridden as it was, had at least the merits of a singular and consistent
vision, founded in the actual, integrated working of image, material and
surface. Those brooding, portentous edifices, monumental interiors,
devastated landscapes, black and umber, dense with matter worked into the
paint itself, caught and held the imagination as true images and reflections
of the times we live in, fraught with the imminent possibilities of danger,
decadence and decay.
And now, with this latest show, filling Anthony d'Offay's three galleries,
he reveals himself as being as shallow and vacuous as the rest of them -
Baselitz, Chia, Clemente, Schnabel, such names to conjure with - standing on
the conviction that to strike an attitude is enough. No question now of the
practical need to resolve and realise an image, to engage and develop an
idea, with all the difficulties and contradictions inherent in the labour
itself: the only imperative is to propose the image.
Clearly he has come to believe his own critical myth, that his every mark,
his every gesture, indeed whatever he cares to lay hands on and cast
arbitrarily upon the floor like runes, are thus of the deepest significance.
How else to explain these slack and empty canvases, these perfunctory
terraces and colonnades of a sub-Piperian theatricality, indifferently
over-laid with dried stalks and drooping leaves and sunflower heads: how
else to make any sense of these little heaps of assorted rubbish, all so
beautifully presented in their glass cases?
The kindest thing is to be like the sunflower oneself, and turn the head
away.
Saddest, or perhaps most cynical of all is the installation that is given
one whole gallery to itself. Women of the Revolution consists of 27 more or
less identical institutional metal-frame single beds, the mattresses and
sheets of lead, and each with a slight hollow and puddle of water in the
middle. They are set out around the room, casually out-of place as in a
long-abandoned dormitory. A rough label on the wall gives each bed to a
particular woman associated in some way with the French Revolution -
Marie-Antoinette, Charlotte Corday, Madame Roland: victims, heroes,
villains? Who would say? A large photograph shows a man walking away down a
muddy track between the fields. And there are more sunflowers, hanging
upside-down, and a few gardening tools here and there.
This, we are told in an explanatory text, 'is probably Kiefer's most complex
work to date . . . Every one of these elements has a complex role to play .
. . But knowledge of all the . . . references is not essential . . . this is
a work illuminated by the spectator. Like the moon (it) is a mirror. The
lookers may not like what they see there, but that is the force of the work
. . . It is about individuals and . . . about society. It is about history
and memory, but most of all it is . . . about human psychology.'
It is, in short, about everything and about nothing at all, a pretentious,
sub-theatrical, pseudo-historical presentation that, as Humpty Dumpty would
say, 'means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.' If we
dislike it, or take issue with it, we have missed the point. Heads he wins,
tails we lose. The question remains to haunt us still. Was he always like
this, and we mistaken, or this but a passing phase and aberration?
The point is made the more forcibly by the direct comparison now possible
with the work of the Spanish painter, Antoni Tapies. He is now nearly 70,
but the work at the Serpentine dates from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s,
the years of his early maturity and burgeoning reputation. Even so the work
has been too seldom seen here, and the reputation more taken on academic
trust than openly acknowledged. A generation has grown up to whom this rich,
romantic expressionist abstraction must come as a considerable and, I hope,
salutary shock.
So: you would have thick, encrusted paint swept across the canvas, would
you, and dark hints of old and decaying surfaces, and of the earth itself,
nostalgie de la boue? Well here it all is, and done with such simple, rapid
command and magisterial authority as to take the breath away. How rough and
radical it all once seemed, and how seductive and convincing now. The format
is simplicity itself, the canvas large but not enormous, still able to
accommodate the natural scope of hand and arm, the image barely more than a
simple block, vertical set upon horizontal.
The colour is dark, the tone deep - umber, ochre and sienna, grey upon grey,
differentiated as much by texture as by hue. The pigment is laid on in thick
impasto, the thickness exploited or violated by vigorous jags and scorings.
The imagery hints at ancient doorways, lintels, paving, monumental city
walls, and yet seldom flirts with any direct reference or representation.
The painting is what it is, to be taken or left for what it is. It is all
beautifully done, and, at the Serpentine, beautifully shown.
The moral too, should we choose to point it, is simple enough: that the
work, having been proposed, is then engaged, resolved and sustained. The
artist engages in no polemic, sets out no programme of half-baked social or
historical concern. He relies on no list or label to confer significance. He
accepts his responsibility to the work itself, working the surface directly
until, intuitively, it comes right by the measure of his own experience and

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Ludmila Semenyaka - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching Ludmila Semenyaka we see Russian classical dancing at its grandest,
purest. We are in the presence of a ballerina and one without peer in this
country. On Saturday afternoon at the Coliseum, Semenyaka appeared in what I
felt was the lost cause of English National Ballet's derisory Cinderella. By
the beauty of her style - true in means, felicitous in utterance - she
turned the dross of her role into gold. It was a prodigious exposition of
those qualities for which the seasoned ballet-goer hopes against hope - and
so often despairs of finding: exquisite training matched with expressive
sensibility.
It is one of the especial merits of the Petersburg/Moscow training system
that it can shape artists to respond to the most searching demands of the
academic dance. Schooling inculcates a physical response to every action
that is both harmonious and noble in scale. Talent within the company is
nurtured through constant guidance and coaching from former ballerinas,
whose wisdom is itself a repository of generations of experience and
perceptions about roles and steps.
Semenyaka has been the pupil of certain of the greatest dancers of this
century: Marina Semyonova, Galina Ulanova, Natalya Dudinskaya. Her art has
an impeccable lineage, part of a vital performance tradition that can be
traced in direct line to the illustrious ballerinas of the Petersburg Ballet
in the 19th century. And it honours this ancestry at every moment - in the
way steps are presented, in the aristocratic ideals that inform every
gesture, every least motion.
There results, as Saturday afternoon's audience happily discovered, a
radiant authority that can transcend miserable choreography. Ben Stevenson's
dances were opened out by Semenyaka's ideal physique and no less ideal
classic sensibility. Simple, quiet, sure in outline and most divinely light,
her dancing showed the steps as jewels rather than as the paste they so
unutterbly are. It is was an interpretation that told us about Cinderella -
down-trodden, trusting, then ecstatic at the ball - in terms of movement
serenely spacious, pristine. Semenyaka found interest in moments that had
passed for nothing at Thursday night's premiere. Cinderella, trying to save
her mother's portrait, was suddenly a tragic figure; her slow reverence to
the Prince at the ball spoke of all the wonder we hope to see in this
touching scene.
Not even the turgid final duet, when Cinderella is burdened with one of the
most unflattering dresses ever laid on a balletic heroine, could defeat her,
though the lumpen choreography had a good try. It was a radiant
interpretation, and some reward for the past six months in which Semenyaka
seems to have had her light hidden under ENB's bushel. Tim Almaas was an
honourable and attentive partner for her, and gave credibility to a
cardboard Prince. The surrounding performances were not to be recommended.
Ludmila Semenyaka is scheduled to appear in ENB's Cinderella at the Festival
Hall on July 29 and August 1 (evening)

FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Expenditure watchdog ready to bite
more heels - The Commons public accounts committee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PARLIAMENTARY scrutiny of the executive is rapidly disappearing, complained
Mr Harry Barnes, Labour MP for Derbyshire North East, in the Commons last
week.
The left-winger was principally bemoaning the delay in re-establishing
departmental select committees. Protracted horse-trading through 'the usual
channels' - Westminster jargon for the whips' offices - has held up the
reappearance of parliament's most effective tools for monitoring the
executive since MPs reassembled in May.
Government departments have, meanwhile, set about their business untroubled
by this particular form of scrutiny - to the irritation of backbenchers like
Mr Barnes.
But though parliament's departmental monitoring tools are still gathering
dust in Westminster's potting shed, its powerful government spending
watchdog is once again up and barking.
The all-party public accounts committee quietly resumed public hearings this
month, summoning senior civil servants to answer questions on crime in
London and the purchase of X-ray equipment in Northern Ireland.
Committee chairman Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne
and a former Treasury minister, is now extremely experienced in the role,
having held it since 1983. No fewer than seven of his 15-member team are
new, however. An eighth, Mr Denzil Davies - a colleague of Mr Sheldon's in
the Labour Treasury team of the late 1970s - joined earlier this year.
Of the 'new boys', it is safe to say Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary
to the Treasury, will have comfortably the worst attendance record. By
tradition, the government's lone representative on the committee attends
only the first meeting following his appointment, although he receives
minutes and papers.
In the weeks leading up to parliament's summer recess, the PAC has
scrutinised the sale of the regional electricity boards, community
pharmacists and Britain's coastal defences, often in front of
standing-room-only audiences.
Already a handful of permanent secretaries - the highest rank in the civil
service - have been summoned to appear before it.
These include Sir Peter Gregson who holds the position at the department of
trade and industry and must harbour vivid memories of a previous appearance
over the secret Pounds 38m 'sweetener' deal struck with British Aerospace
when it purchased Rover Group.
One newly-appointed committee member last week expressed astonishment at the
forthrightness with which his colleagues hauled one distinguished witness
over the coals.
Tomorrow it will be the turn of Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC's
director-general, to face the PAC's music when the BBC World Service is the
subject on the agenda.
A hint of the areas on which questioning is likely to concentrate is
provided by the NAO report which called on the World Service to improve its
efficiency.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories open fresh battles on Europe
 -Government facing further party wrangling during EC presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER John Major's dogged defence yesterday of his government's
stance at the Lisbon summit signalled a new round of trench warfare in the
Conservative party's internal wrangling over Europe.
Both in the Commons chamber and outside there was clear evidence that the
whips had been at work, although less with the thumbscrews than with the
firm hand on the shoulder.
Last night opponents of the Maastricht treaty sought to dramatise comments
reportedly made to a backbench Tory committee by Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, that Denmark might not take up the EC presidency,
after the UK, in January.
With some Conservative MPs interpreting that as a sign of Britain wanting to
punish the Danes, the Foreign Office issued a statement saying it had 'heard
nothing' from Denmark to suggest it would not become president.
But, aware on both sides of the European battlefield that the latest phase
in the civil war is destined to be a long campaign, even well known
Euro-sceptic MPs were keeping some of their powder dry.
While one described as 'ludicrous' Mr John Major's reported hint of
resignation if the Maastricht terms were not agreed, he went on to concede
that Mrs Margaret Thatcher's weekend outburst had also been 'over the top'.
Another long-time supporter of the former prime minister argued that a clash
of personalities between Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major was not one that
opponents of Maastricht could hope to win.
'She would be better advised to take up gardening,' he said. The
Euro-sceptics of the new intake also appeared to have tempered their
opinions markedly as the mood has changed.
Mr Bernard Jenkin, the 32-year-old MP for Colchester North, merely expressed
surprise at the uproar that her television interview had provoked.
'Her views are well known and consistent,' he commented. 'If they are so
wrong they will be ignored.'
In the Commons chamber, it was almost exclusively the old guard that was
prepared to express carefully modulated dissent. Sir Teddy Taylor, the
veteran Southend MP, used eastern Europe's experience of undemocratic
centralised government to argue the case for a free vote or referendum.
Mr Major gave him short shrift. 'I do find it inconsistent that such a firm
advocate of the parliamentary system should also be an advocate of
referenda,' he said.
Earlier, Mr Nicholas Budgen MP, Mr Richard Shepherd MP and Mr John Biffen,
all long-time opponents of the treaty, attempted to press the sceptics' case
without any palpable successes.
Former Tory Cabinet minister Mr Biffen also attacked the recent EC agreement
on the Common Agriculture Policy, saying it was clear the mechanics of
administration of the policy were 'wholly in disarray'.
The prime minister, however, defended the 'remarkable achievement' of
agriculture minister Mr John Gummer saying there had been substantial reform
of the CAP.
When Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, accused the prime minister of
having 'bullied' Mrs Thatcher into the exchange rate mechanism, he was
brusquely crushed.
'I can only assume you have not met my noble friend,' Mr Major told the
recently elected MP, to the mirth of both sides.
Privately, government loyalists and rebels alike believe the real struggle
will not come until the autumn.
While Thursday's back-to-back debates in the Commons and Lords promise some
fireworks, - particularly from a newly ennobled Baroness Thatcher  - an
uncontentious Commons motion will put the
As for the autumn offensives, government ministers believe an expected 'yes'
vote in the French referendum and Mr John Smith's accession to the Labour
leadership will further strengthen the prime minister's hand.
Nonetheless, Tory ultras are hopeful that with luck and unforeseen
developments on their side, Labour's quandary over tactics might give them
the blocking power they need to halt the treaty ratification process in its
tracks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S women MPs want to use their new muscle in Westminster for a
collective assault in the forthcoming shadow cabinet elections.
With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, some
members of the parliamentary women's committee believe strategic voting
could double female representation in the leadership.
Currently there are just four women occupants of the 18 elected shadow
cabinet seats, but several now say that the group could secure six or more
places if it voted strategically in next month's ballot.
A plan now being discussed informally is to create a recommended list of
women candidates. This would aim to ensure that those who might not normally
be expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their
female colleagues.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs FROM both sides of the Commons yesterday jumped to the defence of their
office cost allowances, attacking press reports suggesting the payments were
just an extension of their Pounds 31,000 salaries, David Owen writes.
Mr Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South, called on the government to
state that the standard of service provided by MPs was at issue. Many MPs
subsidised office costs 'from our own pocket' in the interests of giving
constituents quality service, he said.
He was supported by Mr John Cunningham, shadow leader of the Commons, who
said the 'more misleading' newspaper reports about the allowances paid to
MPs should be 'set aside'.
Ms Edwina Currie, MP for Derbyshire South, said it was 'disgraceful' for
some newspapers to suggest that MPs who employed family members as
secretaries should do so on an unpaid basis.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Transport minister triesto
safeguard rail deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Roger Freeman, transport minister, offered last night to meet
private-sector financiers personally in an effort to ensure that an
innovative deal to finance new railway rolling stock did not fall through.
NWS Corporate Finance - part of Bank of Scotland - has offered to provide
West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority with a 21-year operating lease
covering 14 Class 323 trains for the Leeds-to-Bradford railway line.
The proposed Pounds 30m transaction was described by Mr Freeman last night
as the first 'true' operating lease to have been written in the rail
industry for 70 years.
But the deal has been at risk since the government declined to meet
assurances sought by NWS, formerly IBOS Finance, in order to safeguard its
flow of lease payments. Concerned that government plans to denationalise
British Rail might lead to the privatisation of local transport authorities,
NWS asked the government either to guarantee that there would be no such
change of ownership or to give it an option to demand repayment of the lease
in full in advance of such a change.
The government - which has come under pressure from Yorkshire MPs on both
sides of the Commons - said that no change in transport authorities' status
was planned, but that a guarantee would amount to an unacceptable liability.
Mr Freeman stuck to his position last night, saying the government had no
intention of privatising transport authorities or of changing the method of
their funding. He admitted that the deal had taken 'much longer than we
would have liked' to finalise.
The British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill received its
third reading last night with a government majority of 62 (278-216).

FT  30 JUN 92 / Pension age for women may rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Social Security is expected to decide this summer on an
increase in the state pension age for women - possibly as high as 65 - after
six months of consultation ends today.
The department's views on equalising male and female state retirement ages
will be made amid Treasury pressure to bring the female age, currently 60,
level with the male retirement age of 65. However, 63 remains a strong
possibility.
A white paper would follow, probably before the end of the year, with
legislation in the session of parliament starting late next year.
The political consequences of the decision are likely to be large - even
though the change is likely to be phased in over a period of at least as
long as a decade.
The Treasury is particularly conscious of the cost savings of at least
Pounds 3bn a year that a common retirement age of 65 would bring - even if
the benefits would not be realised until the next century.
A reduction in the male retirement age to 60 has been more or less ruled out
because of the extra cost involved. That has made an increase in the women's
retirement age almost certain.
Past indications have been that a common retirement age of 63 was most
likely.
Nevertheless, the social security department is believed to be contemplating
seriously a rise to 65.
Colleagues of Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, point out that
many other European countries are moving towards equalisation at 65. In the
US there is a move towards retiring at 67 and in Japan towards 65.
A 'flexible decade' of retirement appears to have been ruled out, however.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Labour presses for companies 'blacklist'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FRANK DOBSON, shadow energy secretary, called on the government in the
Commons last night to blacklist companies in the financial services sector
that had any connection with the operations that enabled Robert Maxwell to
plunder pension funds.
He said they should not be given advisory roles in the privatisation of
British Coal or British Rail.
When reminded of Mr Maxwell's associations with the Labour party Mr Dobson
said: 'I do not give a damn which political party Robert Maxwell came from -
he was a villain who stole money from pensioners.'
He added: 'The point I am making is that he did it with the connivance of
innumerable individuals and institutions in the City, because he could not
have done it by himself.'
The government rejected a Labour demand for a provision in the British Coal
and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill to prevent advisory contracts
being awarded to companies under investigation by Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors, or which had been criticised by them.
Mr Tim Eggar, minister for energy, accused Mr Dobson of seeking to stir up
fears and worries about pensions in the coalfield communities and described
his speech as 'an absolute disgrace'.
He dismissed as a 'slur' suggestions that the arrangements enabling British
Coal to stop making payments to pension funds through a 'contributions
holiday' were designed to facilitate a management or employee buyout.
Mr Eggar promised that the pension funds of employees of British Coal and
British Rail would be safeguarded, but when pressed to provide statutory
protection explained that the precise mechanism to be used had still to be
decided.
A clause moved by Mr Dobson was defeated by a government majority of 46
(273-227).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Actuaries, the trade association whose members advise the
pensions industry, has called for the government to expand its review of
occupational pensions to cover state benefits as well.
Mr John Martin, institute president, said yesterday that the patchwork
legislation underpinning state benefits was becoming unworkable and hampered
effective private-sector pension provision.
He said: 'Unless the tax and regulatory regime for pensions in the UK is
given a thorough overhaul, employers will become increasingly discouraged
from making proper provision for employee pensions.'
He criticised the recent trend of employers to provide so-called 'money
purchase' pensions, which guarantee a lump sum upon retirement that is often
too small because of inflation.
Mr Martin urged actuaries to encourage employers to guarantee annual pension
increases pegged to inflation.
The government has deferred introduction of a law passed two years ago that
would have required employers to guarantee annual pension rises equal to 5
per cent or the retail prices index, whichever is lower.

<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF occupational pension schemes are to be given a new entitlement to
an annual statement saying how much their savings are worth, the government
said yesterday.
It committed itself to the move in a formal response to the report on the
Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security committee of the last
parliament.
The change in the law is, however, unlikely to be immediate. It will
probably be carried out along with the conclusions of the pension law review
committee set up earlier this month to look at pension law and regulation.
The committee, to be chaired by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford University, is
to publish a consultation paper within a few weeks as its first step.
While the government has accepted the main recommendations of the social
security committee, it continues to argue that it does not have any special
responsibility for members of the BIHL pension scheme - the company that was
sold to Robert Maxwell by British Airways in 1986, when BA was still
publicly owned.
Ministers say that BA's articles of association meant that the transport
secretary had to be notified of the decision, but did not have any right of
consent.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has also moved to tighten
information provision for pension scheme members. Information that must now
be provided, under regulations laid yesterday, includes details about the
pensions ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service and the
ombudsman.

FT  30 JUN 92 / NUM seeks repayment of Pounds 435m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Union of Mineworkers is to take British Coal to the European
Court over its pension fund contribution 'holiday', Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM
president, announced at the union's conference in Scarborough yesterday.
The move will form part of an NUM campaign against privatisation of the
coalmining industry and is designed to discourage potential buyers. The
union hopes to force the corporation or future employers to repay Pounds
435m into the miners' pension fund.
Mr Scargill also called for the NUM to join forces with the RMT rail union
to take industrial action against privatisation in coal and rail.
He rejected the idea that privatisation was inevitable and urged a 'massive
campaign' for action.
An investigation by the Commons social security committee into British
Coal's pension fund contributions holiday over the past three years was
called for by Mr Scargill. He was particularly critical of the role played
by trustees belonging to the rival Union of Democratic Mineworkers.
There was little difference between someone such as Robert Maxwell stealing
Pounds 450m from Mirror Group Newspapers' pension fund and the corporation
taking a contribution holiday of Pounds 435m, Mr Scargill said. 'The end
result is the same. Money meant and designated for a pension fund has ended
up in the employer's balance sheet,' he said.
The European Court's Barber judgment had established that pension-fund money
was deferred wages, Mr Scargill added. Now the NUM would argue in the court
that the Pounds 435m should be repaid.
Later British Coal said the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme's rules amendment
committee had voted by six to four to put part of its surplus towards a
contributions holiday.
The NUM's general secretary retires this week after eight years as Arthur
Scargill's righthand man. Mr Peter Heathfield said he still felt 'bitter'
after a long fight to clear his name over newspaper accusations of financial
irregularities during the 1984-85 pit strike.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Big names join ICI power attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE British companies including GKN and Blue Circle joined ICI yesterday
in its attack on the government over the price of electricity.
The Major Energy Users Council renewed its campaign for lower electricity
prices for industry by meeting Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. The
meeting follows a rare public statement by ICI, which yesterday said its
important chlor-alkali business at Runcorn, Merseyside, could not survive
without electricity price cuts.
Both ICI and the Major Energy Users say electricity prices make British
industry uncompetitive in Europe. Mr John Topliss, electricity group
chairman of the users council, said Mr Eggar was sympathetic. He added: 'We
are hopeful that he will settle the matter by the end of July or August.'
ICI said the government must move very quickly to settle the electricity
price row. Mr Bryan Bulloch, ICI's power services manager for the
chlor-alkali business, said: 'We are losing business, it's an immediate
problem.'
The business, which uses as much electricity as the city of Liverpool, has
seen its electricity bill - which is about 70 per cent of its variable costs
 -rise 35 per cent since electricity privatisation two years ago. Before
privatisation, ICI and other big electricity consumers paid a much lower
bulk tariff.
The Runcorn site buys power from ICI's own power purchasing subsidiary,
Impkemix, a member of the electricity pool or wholesale market. ICI's move
to set up Impkemix followed a suggestion from Mr John Wakeham, the former
energy secretary, that large electricity users unhappy about prices should
go and compete in the market. Impkemix must still buy from the pool, where
prices are much higher than its pre-privatisation tariff.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the generator that
supplies the bulk of electricity sold in the pool or wholesale market, said
his company sympathised with ICI and had 'stood on its head' to try to help.
'Sadly, it can't be done without cross-subsidy and that's absolutely ruled
out,' he said. It was no cheaper for a generator to supply a very large user
than a small user.

Court.
Mr Ramsden - former chairman of Glen International, an investment firm that
collapsed in 1987 with losses of Pounds 142m - faces 22 charges. The charges
include fraudulent trading, obtaining property by deception, false
accounting and making false statements to Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors.
He has been granted legal aid with a contribution of Pounds 25,000 which,
magistrates directed, will not become payable until the end of the criminal

FT  30 JUN 92 / Homeless youths to get help in 'foyers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUTH homelessness should be tackled in centres that offer young people
accommodation and training, according to the Foyer Federation, which was
launched yesterday, John Willman writes.
The body - backed by Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, and
Shelter, the charity for the homeless - aims to create a network of
'foyers'. They would provide young people with a place to live, train and
get help with finding a job.
Young people moving to a new area would be able to reserve low-cost
accommodation in advance if they agreed to undergo training or participate
in job-search schemes.
The federation will co-ordinate the development of foyers. GrandMet is
providing office space in its former brewery in Brick Lane, east London, and
putting up Pounds 300,000 over three years.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Employers criticised over performance-related pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY EMPLOYERS fail to think through the introduction of performance-related
pay in a coherent manner, according to a study published today by the
Institute of Manpower Studies.
The survey also finds little evidence to demonstrate a causal link between
individual performance-releated pay and increases in productivity. Some
schemes change employee attitudes, it says, 'but not always in the direction
desired'.
Performance-related pay has been one of the most significant changes in
employers' approaches to pay and personnel in the last decade. It is
estimated that about half of Britain's employers have performance-related
pay for at least some white-collar and managerial employees.
In the report, based in part on studies at 20 organisations, Mr Marc
Thompson, an IMS research fellow, finds that many performance-related-pay
(PRP) schemes tend to contradict a range of other policies in the
organisation, or sit uncomfortably with them.
He says: 'The perception of some personnel practitioners was that in order
for PRP to be successful, however that may be defined, it probably had a
better chance if it was part of a wider and more coherent strategy to raise
employee performance.'
The study finds that few employers build in a monitoring and evaluation
process as part of the scheme's introduction. It also says few realise their
schemes could potentially discriminate against women.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Sir Leon Brittan commends investment rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, EC financial services commissioner, yesterday promised
that the agreement reached on the Investment Services Directive (ISD) would
be 'good news for the City of London' as the capital requirements and
trading rules were not designed to damage any market.
He was speaking after EC finance ministers reached an agreement on the ISD
last night.
His statement will be greeted with relief by the financial services houses
in London, many of which were concerned that the ISD might force them to
publish information on security prices and volumes, and so put them at a
disadvantage.
The main issue that concerned the City was transparency, which would require
securities houses to publish price and volume information on a screen-based
system.
Some of the EC member countries were pushing for immediate publication of
such information. Many of the UK-based securities houses were anxious,
however, that the immediate release of such information in the market might
work against their interests.
Market makers in securities argued that if they were forced to buy a large
block of shares from an institution and the information became available to
the market immediately, their competitors would be able to mark the price
down, possibly forcing them to sell the shares at a loss.
The solution agreed yesterday was broadly what had been expected by several
large financial service houses in the UK.
The question of freedom of access - banks will automatically be allowed to
join as members of European stock exchanges - is seen as significant for the
German commercial banks. . Until now they have not been able to enjoy full
membership.
A senior adviser at a US securities house said: 'Progress on the ISD is
important as it means that further liberalisation of the European financial
markets will be possible.'

FT  30 JUN 92 / Double blow to whaling moratorium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to extend the moratorium on commercial whaling suffered a double
blow yesterday when Norway announced that it would resume whaling next year
and Iceland left the International Whaling Commission.
Norway's decision to resume killing the minke whale - the smallest of the
great whale species - was announced by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
Norwegian prime minister, in Oslo, as the IWC was holding its annual meeting
in Glasgow.
The move was immediately criticised by Mr John Gummer, the British
agriculture secretary, as well as by environmentalists and conference
delegates.
According to some delegates, Russia has also signalled that it might want to
resume whale hunting. They said Russia, which ceased commercial whaling in
the 1980s, had asked the IWC for a 'scientific allocation' of whales which
it would be allowed to hunt for research.
Commercial whaling was outlawed in 1986 by the IWC, but a legal loophole
enables Japan and others to hunt for 'scientific research'.
Over the past few years the IWC, to which 37 countries belong, has developed
a system for managing and monitoring a resumed commercial whaling programme,
known as the revised management procedure (RPM). The whaling nations hope
that this week's conference will adopt the RPM, and thus sanction the
hunting of minke whales whose stocks are considered to have recovered in the
Antarctic and north-east Altantic.
But Norway, which adhered to the moratorium in 1987 after threats by the US
to ban imports of Norwegian fish, said that if the IWC did not adopt the RPM
it would devise its own quota for minke whales for 1993.
That would be consistent with proposals of the IWC scientific committee
which assesses the minke whale population in the north-east Atlantic at
86,700 animals.
In his address, Mr Gummer said the world would not 'allow us to risk a
return to the barbarity of the past. Whales are an international - not a
national - resource. A million or more have been killed this century in
Antarctica alone. In a bloody and systematic way, nearly all of the great
whale stocks have been hunted down to depleted, or even seriously endangered
levels.'
He added: 'No country that is party to international agreements can act
unilaterally.'
Conservation groups and countries opposed to whaling fear Norway's decision
will be followed by Japan and Iceland.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Consumers fail to lead recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is still no sign of a consumer-led recovery, according to a survey of
more than 1,000 adults published today by Mintel, the market research
organisation.
Mintel concluded that a 'consumer-driven' recovery, instigated by the
government and financial institutions, would be needed.
It added that the UK population had suffered 'its greatest shock since the
Second World War' and was 'understandably cautious'.
According to the survey, 59 per cent of consumers felt that borrowing money
for anything other than buying a house should be avoided.
A strong majority - 65 per cent - also said they were not prepared to use
credit cards to buy from sales. On the strength of those figures, Mintel
predicted that the next quarter will show a net repayment of consumer
credit.
Meanwhile, two thirds said they intended to put money aside for a rainy day,
and more than half of the sample said they would want to put money into
long-term tax-efficient investments.
Mr Paul Hersey, senior researcher, pointed out that youngsters -
particularly those in the 15-19 age group - had grown significantly more
conservative in their financial outlook over the past few years. He said:
'Three years ago, 15-to-19-year-olds were far more likely to look at
borrowing than they are now. Now it's a question of save now and borrow
later for them.'
However, there were some causes for hope, as a slim majority (48 per cent)
agreed with the statement that 'I feel quite confident in the outlook for
the UK economy', while 46 per cent disagreed. Only 37 per cent are worried
about their long-term financial security.
He said: 'People are not going to rush out and spend money. They still
remember the rapid hike in interest rates in 1989, and many are still
recovering from the extra costs they incurred then, so they are building a
cushion for themselves.'
The report concluded by saying that long-term optimism might mean that
recovery, when it happens, could be 'very fast'.

QUALITY assurance systems are popular with small businesses and do meet
their needs, according to a survey by Pera International, an industry
research association.
Ninety per cent of companies that took government advice on quality
management systems employed fewer than 100 people and 30 per cent fewer than
10 people.
Pera supervises the government's quality consultancy scheme and it says that
28 per cent of companies that took consultancy advice went on to acquire a
certificate for BS 5750/ISO 9000, the most common UK and international
quality assurance standards.
Based on the present level of demand for quality advice, about 45,000 UK
companies will be certified after a government-funded consultancy by mid
1995.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Small businesses attack Tec policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL businesses are poorly represented on the boards of Training and
Enterprise Councils, according to a survey by the Federation of Small
Businesses.
Only nine of the Tecs that responded to the survey had a good spread of
board members from the small-business sector while 37 had inadequate
representation, the survey showed. Sixty-three of the 82 English and Welsh
Tecs took part in the survey.
With 97 per cent of all businesses employing fewer than 20 people, a strong
case could be made for most of Tec board seats intended for employers to go
to small businesses, the federation said.
Ms Ro Pengelly, head of the federation's employment affairs, said: 'Adequate
representation seems to be the exception rather than the rule. The survey
revealed an unsympathetic attitude by many Tecs towards the small business
sector.'
Even when Tecs had small-business representatives, they often came from
local enterprise agencies or the economic development units of local
councils. They were business advisers rather than owner-managers of small
businesses.
The federation said Tecs often appeared confused about what a small business
was. Most defined a small business as one employing fewer than 100 people,
although the federation regarded that as a medium-sized business.
Small businesses should be represented at the highest level on the Tecs and
not just in advisory groups or policy forums, the federation said.
The government guidelines say that local-business leaders on Tec boards
should be selected for their individual qualities and not just as
representatives of existing organisations. They also require boards to
reflect an area's range of industry and commerce.

<TEXT>
PERSONAL computers, fax machines and photocopiers are being stolen on an
organised basis in northern England to feed shortages in eastern Europe,
police believe.
Secondhand markets have collapsed in Britain because of price cutting by
manufacturers.
Greater Manchester police say eastern Europe appears to be the only place
where the returns justify the risks of large-scale crime.
Organised theft of office equipment was identified last year when Bradford
police used a computer to search for patterns of crime. They found that
Pounds 1.57m of office equipment had been stolen in the city in the previous
12 months. Typical insurance claims after a raid are more than Pounds
10,000.
Thieves go to elaborate lengths, often posing as service or removal
specialists to raid offices.
Greater Manchester police have approached Customs and Excise to see if
manifests and bills of lading can be checked for stolen computers and other
electronic office equipment being shipped to eastern Europe.
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Martin said he was applying for Pounds 1,000
from the Home Office's Safer Cities crime prevention campaign to buy a
branding iron with an interchangeable head. Police will then be able to
visit offices and brand a company's postcode into the plastic fascia of
expensive equipment.
'This will make it easier to check goods being offered at car boot sales,
auctions or exported,' he said.

FT  30 JUN 92 / 'Green' audit figures up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of companies mentioning environmental issues in their annual
reports has doubled to almost a fifth in the past year, but few provide much
useful information, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monthly monitoring service.
About 18 per cent of companies that produced accounts in the last 12 months
address 'green' concerns, but half of those provide vague and general
statements that do not describe any action being taken, it says.
For example, Kingfisher, the retailing group, which has projected an image
of corporate responsibility, simply states its commitment to improving
environmental performance and agreeing a policy with its board, without
giving any details.
Among the more interesting disclosures, National Westminster Bank says it
takes environmental considerations into account when assessing loans. Austin
Reed, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, encourages suppliers to meet
environmental standards it sets.
Separately, Company Reporting says that less than 3 per cent of companies
provide any forecast information in their annual reports, in spite of a call
for details of future developments in the European Community's 7th directive
on company accounts.
From a sample of 590 companies, 1.7 per cent highlight forecast information,
a further 1.2 per cent provide some forward-looking details, and 0.3 per
cent state that it is too difficult to make any forecasts.

The Crown Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, is being
sued by the operators of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe over
moves to close the route, Tim Burt writes.
White Horse Ferries is seeking damages after the Crown Estate ordered the
company to halt services between Tilbury and Gravesend, the Thameside towns
linked by a river crossing since 1086. The Crown Estate says White Horse is
breaching the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run a ferry' on the river.
The company bought the service last year from Sealink Stena, but the Crown
Estate says the route franchise was non-transferable. Franchises from
Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the monarch and the Crown Estate
says White Horse has the right to operate in only one direction - from
Gravesend to Tilbury.
The Crown Estate is seeking talks in an attempt to avoid legal action and
negotiate a franchise.

FT  30 JUN 92 / BBC and Sky talk on news service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC is talking to Sky Television about collaboration over 24-hours-a-day
satellite television news in the UK.
The discussions are the latest sign of growing co-operation between the BBC
and the satellite broadcaster after last month's successful joint bid for
television rights to football's Premier League.
Talks are at an early stage, but both sides believe it would be foolish to
have two competing satellite news channels in the UK.
In February Sir Michael Checkland, BBC director-general, made clear that he
wanted to see the corporation operating a round-the-clock satellite
television news service by next year.
Latest thinking at the BBC is that the UK service should be distinct from
the World Television Service news already available in Asia and Africa.
Sky News is now accepted as an integral part of the six-channel Sky
television package - a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a significant stake. Although the losses of Sky News have been
reduced, the channel is expected to lose about Pounds 13m this year.
The possibilities being discussed include turning Sky News into a joint
venture - the BBC-Sky News - or even producing the channel from the BBC but
using the existing Sky presenters.
Meanwhile, the latest accounts filed by British Sky Broadcasting show losses
of Pounds 759m for the first 37 weeks after the merger of Sky and BSB in
November 1990. The company is now profitable, although that has been
achieved by writing off close to Pounds 1bn of excess costs in the two
former rivals. The accounts show that the BSkyB investors are not expecting
significant net cash inflows or net operating profits before 1994.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commercial bank lending still weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDING by the nine biggest commercial banks has remained subdued, according
to figures that were released yesterday.
The statistics support theories that the economy is still some way from a
strong uplift.
The British Bankers Association, which released the statistics, said
sterling lending by the nine totalled Pounds 706m in the three months to
May, compared with Pounds 2.2bn in the previous three months.
On a seasonally adjusted basis - which takes into account the normally weak
demand for borrowing by companies and individuals in the spring - the figure
for between March and May comes to Pounds 3.1bn.
That is in contrast to the Pounds 1.8bn seasonally adjusted figure for the
previous three months.
The association warned that the seasonally adjusted figures may give a
flawed view of borrowing trends.
In recent years, companies have required smaller loans in the spring, when
cashflow is traditionally high.
But such seasonal fluctuations - for which the adjusted figures attempt to
compensate - may not apply when the country is in recession.
According to the unadjusted figures, people borrowed Pounds 1.6bn from the
nine banks between March and May, while companies repaid about Pounds 900m.
Manufacturers repaid Pounds 511m and construction groups Pounds 370m.
The increase in personal borrowing was largely accounted for by lending for
house purchases, which rose by Pounds 1.5bn, up from Pounds 1.1bn in the
previous three months.
However, the association said the rise was probably due to banks taking a
greater share of the mortgage market, from building societies, rather than
to an upturn in demand for housing.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday gave state governments broad powers to
restrict abortions but, by a 5-4 vote, stopped short of overturning its
historic 1973 decision which gave women the right to terminate pregnancies.
The decision to uphold most of the abortion limits in a Pennsylvania law was
immediately denounced by both pro- and anti-abortion groups, who had been
massing around the Supreme Court building during the past week.
Pro-life forces condemned the court's failure to overturn Roe vs Wade, the
decision which legalised abortion nationwide, and concentrated their fire on
Justice David Souter, who had been appointed by President George Bush, an
abortion opponent.
In a departure from usual practice, Justice Souter spoke from the bench. 'To
overrule (Roe) would subvert the court's legitimacy beyond any reasonable
question,' he said. 'If the court were undermined, the country would also
be.'
This left in doubt the widespread assumption that the court, now composed
overwhelmingly of conservative appointees, will eventually overturn Roe.
As had been expected, four of the nine-member court - Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -
wanted an outright overturn of Roe.
Justices Souter, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy staked out a middle
ground, adopting a new test for abortion regulation. This would allow states
to legislate restrictions which do not provide an 'absolute obstacle or
severe limitation on the abortion decision'.
The court then approved the following provisions in the Pennsylvania law:
that women seeking abortions must be told about foetal development and
abortion alternatives and must then wait 24 hours before the abortion;
doctors must keep detailed abortion records; and unmarried girls, under 18,
supported by their parents, must get the consent of one of their parents or
a state judge.
A provision requiring women to tell husbands about abortion plans was struck
down.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Passionate issue high on political agenda: The row over
abortion threatens to become a key election factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO TOPIC in contemporary America provokes such passion as abortion. For
every poll showing 70 per cent of the country, including a majority of
Catholics, in favour of reproductive rights, another will reveal a similar
number believing that to terminate a pregnancy is to commit a form of
murder.
Not since the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements of more than a
generation ago have the streets been so full of protest. Hardly a week goes
by without an attempt being made to close down, often violently, abortion
clinics. In early April as many as 1m people marched peacefully through
Washington in favour of freedom of choice.
The language of the abortion debate is extreme. Last week Mr Randell Terry,
of the anti-abortion Operation Rescue, had no compunction in declaring that
'anyone who says they are a Christian and yet supports child killing is a
liar and a sheep in wolf's clothing'.
Mr David Andrews, of the Planned Parenthood Federation, can put it just as
starkly. 'We have moved,' he said, again last week, 'from Roe vs Wade (the
1973 Supreme Court ruling establishing the constitutional right to an
abortion) to this administration vs American women, and American women will
not stand for a loss of their reproductive rights'.
Reconciliation seems impossible, so entrenched are the respective positions,
leaving any resolution to the courts, government and politicians. And this
is an election year.
Six justices on the nine-member Supreme Court were elevated by Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Their nominations were designed to advance
the conservative agenda in general and to exclude those known to believe in
freedom of choice in particular. As is often the case, the judges are
beginning to behave in ways not entirely intended by the presidents who
promoted them.
Three justices in particular - Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, both
Reagan appointees, and David Souter, named by Mr Bush - have begun to
inhabit a broad middle ground, pragmatic, often narrow in judgment and
disinclined to set constitutional precedent.
They stand between Justices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, both of
moderate Republican lineage, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the more doctrinaire right.
Justice Byron White, named by President John Kennedy and the only Democratic
appointment, has become more conservative over the years.
Twice in the last week the new centre turned down Bush administration
arguments - on religion in schools and on habeas corpus. Their general
tendency seems to be to uphold the rights of states to set their own law,
but last Friday they felt compelled to tell Mississippi that it had not done
enough to rectify the legacy of segregation in higher education.
This is, by no stretch of the imagination, a liberal court, as those who
have sought to avoid the death penalty have found out. Moreover, its two
most liberal voices, Justices Blackmun and Stevens, are ageing. There are
rumours that the former will soon retire; moves are afoot in the Senate to
ask Mr Bush not to nominate a replacement before the election, should he
step down.
The political demarcation lines on abortion are clearer. Mr Bush was once in
favour of the right to choice, but changed his mind when he became Mr
Reagan's vice-president. Vice-President Dan Quayle hardly lets a moment go
by without inveighing against the moral perils of single motherhood.
Governor Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, stands solidly
behind freedom of choice, as does his party. The position of many prominent
Catholic Democrats has best been expressed by Governor Mario Cuomo of New
York who argues that, although he accepts church doctrine, he must also as a
public official uphold the law, which now permits abortion.
Mr Ross Perot's opinions are less distinct, as they are on so many issues.
But the prospective independent candidate, while frequently talking of the
need to restore traditional family values, has never called for a ban on
abortion.
In the past, for all the passion it has generated, abortion has tended to
fade as an election determinant. This year, however, the calculation may be
changing.
No single overriding subject is consuming the electorate and, perhaps
because of this and perhaps because its time has come, there has been a
conspicuous surge in interest in women's issues. Almost all, regardless of
party, are pro-choice.
There is even a vocal pro-choice Republican women's lobby which is
threatening to upset the planned unity of the Houston convention in August.
This should concern Mr Bush, whose strength in the party has always derived
in good part from the support he gets from Republican women.
The Supreme Court's action yesterday has ensured abortion stays high on the
political agenda this year.

CONRAIL and Amtrak, two of the biggest US rail operators, said they had
reached tentative labour accords with their track workers, a significant
step toward resolving the various disputes affecting the US industry, writes
Alan Friedman in New York.
Conrail, one of the largest freight operators, said it reached an agreement
with representatives of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees
(BMWE), which has 3,100 Conrail workers. Amtrak, the passenger service, said
it struck a deal with BMWE officials representing 2,100 of its workers. Both
settlements were reached last weekend and announced last night.
The accords came after Congress acted last Thursday night to end a 48-hour
strike against one big operator by approving legislation that ordered rail
employees back to work. Congress also set guidelines for binding arbitration
should parties find it impossible to settle their disputes.
Amtrak said the accord meant it had resolved outstanding labour problems
with 17 of its 19 unions.

THE Brazilian financial markets fell sharply yesterday in reaction to a
further wave of corruption allegations involving President Fernando Collor
and increasing fears that he will be unable to ride out the crisis.
Mr Collor is expected to address the nation today to answer accusations that
his household expenses are being paid by Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, his campaign
treasurer, who is the subject of a congressional inquiry for alleged
extortion. A barely controlled Mr Collor told reporters: 'I will respond to
the charges item by item.'
The Inland Revenue yesterday began investigating the bank accounts of Ms Ana
Maria Acioli Gomes, Mr Collor's private secretary, in response to the
allegations which appeared in Istoe, a respected magazine.
According to an interview given by the former driver of Ms Acioli, Mr Farias
was paying money into her account under the name Maria Gomes from which it
was transferred to pay Mr Collor's household staff and bills and to give
money to the president's current wife Rosane and former wife Lilibeth. The
magazine backed up its claims with copies of cheques which the driver had
been asked to deposit. The driver will be called to testify tomorrow.
Mr Collor has asked his government for 48 hours to respond to the latest
allegations. The Liberal Front (PFL), the main party in the government, has
threatened to withdraw its support unless he disproves the charges.
Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques, the economy minister, tried to avoid a market
collapse by appealing for 'maturity' and insisting that economic policy
would not change. But the main Sao Paulo index dropped 14.6 per cent by the
close - its largest fall this year - and Telebras, the leading bluechip
stock, fell 22 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Air France in plan to pool aircraft orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE is planning to pool aircraft orders with Sabena, the Belgian
airline, and CSA, the Czechoslovakian state carrier, two airlines in which
it has taken large stakes this year.
The scheme would allow recession-hit Air France and Sabena to transfer
surplus orders to CSA, which is trying to revamp its largely Soviet-built
fleet. It would take collaboration between the three far beyond previously
announced deals on computer systems and aircraft maintenance.
Mr Jiri Fiker, acting director-general of CSA, said the order pooling would
allow the airline to take delivery of four Boeing 737 aircraft a year
earlier than otherwise. He expects to take delivery of nine Boeing 737
medium-haul narrow-bodied aircraft over the next 18 months. Five of these
orders are already secure, the result of a deal between Sabena and CSA in
which the Belgian airline waived delivery of five new Boeing 737-500
aircraft worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 108m). CSA took them instead, with
the first being delivered to Prague last weekend.
The remaining four consist of two 737-300s, which should be delivered next
year as a result of the order pooling, said Mr Fiker, and two 737-400s, the
largest in the range, which would be delivered in 1994. Mr Fiker added that
the airline planned to order Airbuses, probably increasing its complement of
Airbus A310 wide-body aircraft.
Mr Ron Woodard, general manager of Boeing's 737 and 757 manufacturing
division, said that CSA could eventually take up to fifteen 737s.
In April, Air France and its Belgian financial partners injected BFr6bn
(Pounds 100m) into Sabena in return for a 37.5 per cent stake. Earlier this
year, Air France led a consortium of investors to take a 40 per cent stake
in CSA in a Dollars 60m deal.
Boeing is preparing to show its customers plans for a complete revamp of its
best-selling 737 model. Changes will include new wings and new engines,
where three consortia, Rolls-Royce, GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, are in the
running as supplier. Airlines will be consulted on the changes by the end of
the year.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Business invests its hopes in Ramos presidency: Businessmen
in the Philippines look forward to growth and stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE business is hoping that the presidency of Mr Fidel Ramos, who
takes his oath of office today, will usher in a period of economic stability
and growth.
Mr Enrique Esteban, president of the independent think-tank Centre for
Research and Communication, said that with the election of Mr Ramos, 'there
is so much hope now getting into the system'.
However, Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, warned that power shortages, dramatised by daily cuts lasting
three to four hours and estimated to have cost more than Dollars 740m
(Pounds 400m) since March, could dampen the kind of investor enthusiasm
predicted by Mr Esteban.
Mr Pardo said business planned to 'work together' with the new
administration to 'uplift economic well-being in the country and lower the
incidence of poverty' by recommending 'do-able' policies and programmes for
the planning process.
Even before Mr Ramos was formally proclaimed as the winning presidential
candidate, the PCCI had organised a meeting with him during which 10
'priority' concerns were identified and about 50 'action programmes'
recommended. In many of these recommendations, 'direct presidential
involvement' was sought to facilitate action. The business leaders
particularly asked Mr Ramos to oversee moves to tackle the power shortage
and corruption in government.
Mr Ramos's cabinet appointments appear generally acceptable to business. His
economic team will be led by Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and Mr
Rizalino Navarro, trade and industry secretary.
Mr del Rosario is head of Asian Bank, a medium-sized commercial bank, and Mr
Navarro is head of the accounting and management-consultancy group SyCip,
Gorres and Telayo, which has operations in other Asian countries.
Mr Ramos has retained Mr Jose Cuisia as governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines. Mr Peter Garrucho, former trade secretary and Mr Ramos's
campaign manager in the election, was named acting executive secretary and
presidential adviser on energy affairs.
These key members of Mr Ramos's economic team are known advocates of
free-market concepts, even during the authoritarian rule of the late Mr
Ferdinand Marcos. It is expected they will oversee the transition towards
greater liberalisation of the economy. Mr Ramos's predecessor, Mrs Corazon
Aquino, while largely failing to push through her expensive land
redistribution programme, had begun the task of liberalising trade and
investment, ending currency restrictions and breaking up the Marcos-era
monopolies.
The government currently projects gross national product growth this year of
2.5-3 per cent after zero growth last year. Growth in the last quarter of
1991 'turned slightly positive', compared with a 3.1 per cent third-quarter
fall.
Inflation, hovering at 8 per cent, is likely to stabilise at its target of 7
per cent for the year. The exchange rate remains steady, as international
reserves remain high, despite a surge in demand for dollars after the
lifting of the import levy on April 30.
Mr Emmanuel Pelaez, ambassador to the US and former Philippines
vice-president, will be chief debt negotiator. More than 20 per cent of the
country's export earnings go to pay its Dollars 29bn foreign debt. To make
matters worse, Washington recently reduced aid to Manila from Dollars 568m
last year to Dollars 220m for next year.
The government must also prepare the business community for the crucial
adjustments necessary for the planned creation of an Asean Free Trade Area
that will expose local industries to international competition but give them
access to wider markets.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Algerian martyr in the making: The military will use
yesterday's assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf to rally support for law and
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE seven days' mourning declared for Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, after he was
assassinated yesterday in the eastern industrial town of Annaba, is an
honour reserved for the head of state.
However, such were the circumstances in which he came to head the Algerian
government six months ago that his constitutional position was never
properly clarified.
This ambiguity in Mr Boudiaf's status should permit the military, who
installed him, to close the gap left by his death while allowing them to
exploit the traumatic incident as martyrdom for the nation's unity. Provided
the military keep its cool, Mr Boudiaf's death could even be turned to
advantage.
The killing has already been laid at the feet of the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) which was denied certain election victory in January and has since
been outlawed. By identifying the FIS with the killing, the authorities
clearly hope to rally support for law and order and expose the true colours
of the fundamentalists.
At a broader level, Mr Boudiaf's killing can only delay stalled plans for
making Algeria the Arab world's first multi-party democracy. These suffered
a serious setback in January when the military stepped in to prevent the
second round of voting.
In the first round on December 26, the FIS had walked away with 47 per cent
of the vote and looked set to form the next government upsetting 30 years'
uninterrupted rule by the National Liberation Front (FLN).
On the basis that the military had acted with the best of intentions and
would not over-abuse human rights, the over-turning of the elections
received tacit backing from Algeria's main partners among the industrial
nations.
The main concern of the west was security of oil and gas supplies coupled
with stability payments on Dollars 25bn (Pounds 13.50bn) of foreign debt.
Once again this is likely to be the principal worry of the European
Community and the US. However, the military have indicated that security of
oil and gas supplies is an absolute priority, while Algeria has acquired a
breathing space in its debt service by the recent approval of a Dollars
1.5bn refinancing package.
The 73-year-old Mr Boudiaf was one of the last surviving historic leaders of
the FLN which fought for independence against France. In the aftermath in
1962 he fell out with the leadership and took up exile in Morocco where he
spent most of the following 28 years until he returned to Alergia on January
16.
It is still unclear the extent to which he had already agreed to return as a
political figurehead before the military forced President Chadli Bendjedid
to step down on January 11 because they feared he was too weak to deal with
the FIS. Mr Boudiaf had always been hostile to the military. He agreed to
head a five-man High State Council only on condition that he had some
control over policy and soon after he arrived he started lecturing the
government about austerity (he even suggested senior officials try public
transport to see how ordinary Algerians felt).
The Council was an attempt to camouflage the coup in constitutional clothing
by persuading a respected group of five with moderate links to the mosque or
impeccable nationalist credentials to act as 'wise men'. In this way the
authorities sought to offer a competing 'nationalist' platform to counter
the appeal of the FIS.
Mr Boudiaf was said to be anxious to use his powers as de facto head of
government to grant amnesty to a number of FIS members. (Some 5,000 to 6,000
FIS supporters have allegedly been detained since the crackdown on the
movement in January). Such an amnesty is unlikely now and the trial of the
two main FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, postponed over
the weekend until July 12, again raises the issue of the death penalty.
Today, Gen Khaled Nezzar, the defence minister, holds the strings of power
and his record is of a person who favours tough repressive measures against
the FIS. The military might feel it has a freer hand, no longer restrained
by an ageing man who had little sympathy for its profession.
However, the authorities need to proceed with caution to avoid a cycle of
repression that breeds support for the FIS. The FIS possesses several faces.
The majority of those who supported the movement in the elections were not
endorsing a fundamentalist view of Algeria with the strict imposition of
sharia law. Rather they were the urban unemployed - especially the young -
and those in the professional classes who had missed out on the benefits of
FLN corruption.
The most worrying question is whether Mr Boudiaf's death is an isolated act
or the start of a concerted campaign by the armed undergound to overthrow
the government.
Since January the military leaders have recognised that they have limited
time in which to restore stability and get the economy going to lessen
social grievances. The Boudiaf killing may have given more time but it has
underlined what is at stake if they fail - the survival of Algeria as a
state marrying a moderate version of Islam with the needs of a modern state
closely tied to Europe.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Boudiaf: war hero who refused to compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE westernised Algerian middle classes who fear a fundamentalist
takeover of their country, Mohamed Boudiaf was a saviour.
But the Moslem extremists suspected of assassinating the 73-year-old head of
state yesterday portrayed him as a traitor to Islam and a puppet of Generals
Khaled Nezzar and Larbi Belkheir, respectively ministers of defence and
interior, who led the crackdown against the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)
this year.
When he returned to Algiers on January 16 after 28 years in exile, only a
few of Mr Boudiaf's compatriots made the short journey to the airport to
greet the ageing hero of the 1954-62 war of independence.
That same night the tall, bald, hollow-cheeked Mr Boudiaf made the first of
many public appeals for calm and reconciliation. Together, the Algerian
people could overcome this crisis, he said. But they would have to satisfy
their differences; and they would have to work.
Although he governed at the request of the military, his presence conveyed
paternalistic authority, not the compliance of a puppet. As he insisted
repeatedly on the importance of security and his determination to rid
Algeria of those who would harm it, his manner was solemn and his delivery
was firm and careful.
Mr Boudiaf was chosen for three reasons. His record as a war hero imprisoned
for six years by the French was unimpeachable. In the 1960s he had refused
an offer from the late Col Houari Boumedienne to lead a figurehead civilian
government under military control. And unlike fellow revolutionaries tainted
by the corruption and misrule of the last 30 years, Mr Boudiaf had earned an
honest living in his Moroccan exile.
Mr Boudiaf was an uncompromising figure: he never forgave Ahmed Ben Bella
for imprisoning him. Mr Ben Bella had also returned to Algiers after a long
exile but their relations this year were frosty. Most of all, Mr Boudiaf
refused any compromise with the Islamic fundamentalists.
He professed to believe that fundamentalism in Algeria was the result of
economic crisis, the disillusionment of youth and subversion by foreign
powers. He said it would diminish as the economy improved and young people
found jobs. With his violent death yesterday that recovery became more
elusive than ever.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Instability may put debt plans at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS said yesterday that increased political instability could jeopardise
Algerian aims to refinance Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds 12.6bn) of external debt,
but its immediate financing plans are unlikely to be disrupted.
Tomorrow it is due to draw down the second part of a Dollars 1.3bn trade
finance package signed earlier this year. Bankers could see nothing in the
terms of the loan to prevent the funds from being transfered as planned.
The loan will fund the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
facilities. Sonatrach, the state-owned LNG company, has also secured trade
financing agreements with the Export-Import Bank of Japan.
Around Dollars 5bn of Algeria's external debt is owed to commercial banks.
In February, the government signed a Dollars 1.5bn refinancing agreement
with a group of 130 banks and is committed to servicing and refinancing all
external debt rather than calling for a restructuring.
In the secondary loans market yesterday, Algerian debt obligations were
trading at 87 per cent of face value in the morning but fell to 80 per cent
by the close in London.
The death of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf sent ripples through the market in loans to
North African countries seen as vulnerable to a resurgence in Islamic
fundamentalism.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Heavy hand exacerbates fundamentalist dissent: Arab leaders
may be more wary of democratic consultation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE results of the first round of the Algerian elections at the end of last
year added fuel to what had already been a politically explosive year in the
Middle East. The Arab world, while adjusting to the disintegration of the
Soviet Union and the consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, saw in
the Algerian election another threatening challenge to established political
order in the region.
Whatever organisation takes responsibility for the assassination of Mohamed
Boudiaf, the rest of the Arab world will assume it is the work of Moslem
fundamentalists. By cancelling the second round of voting in January, the
Algerian government denied the Islamic Salvation Front victory, the Middle
East of its second Islamic republic and, for many, set the path for violent
confrontation between the military and the Moslem activists.
Political assassinations in the Middle East need not provoke turmoil. When
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt was murdered in October 1981 his enemies
predicted an uprising. Not only did Egypt remain calm but Hosni Mubarak
smoothly assumed power and to this day follows the broad foreign policy
lines laid down by his predecessor.
President Mubarak, who last year expressly warned the Algerian regime of the
dangers of holding elections which could be manipulated by the opposition,
will be in the forefront of those Arab leaders watching to see whether
yesterday's assassination heralds the start of a wider attempt by Algerian
religious extremists to confront the military-led government.
Throughout the Middle East there have been lesser signs of extremist
activity, accompanied by lurid warnings from a few Arab commentators who
believe the US, robbed of communism as its main international enemy, is
elevating Islam to take its place.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its subsequent defeat divided the Arab world
more sharply than was then apparent. With the probable exception of Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, the satisfaction derived from the setback to Saddam
Hussein was more than offset by the suffering caused to the Iraqi people and
the danger of further extremism being bred by Arab humiliation.
There are always dangers of taking isolated Middle East events and drawing
them into an ordered and ominous picture.
There is no immediate linkage between recent murders carried out by Islamic
extremists in Egypt, the increased militancy of right-wing religious police
in Saudi Arabia and the challenge to the PLO by Hammas in the Arab
territories occupied by Israel. But in each case a religious channel is
being used to articulate real grievances or simple political ambition.
Equally, yesterday's events in Algeria will be used by conservatives to
block or delay even modest moves towards greater accountability in
government and the introduction of political pluralism. The ruling al-Sabah
family in Kuwait, tested by fundamentalists in the 1980s, is likely to be
more than ever determined that its supporters win the October elections. The
names of those who will serve on Saudi Arabia's new Consultative Council may
not be known for some longer period.
The confrontation in Algeria will, if anything, make more difficult the
process of political evolution and make more probable the employment of
Islamic fundamentalism as the most potent vehicle through which to exploit
dissent.

</HEADLINE>

   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is ready to drop its long-standing opposition to the Community
legislating on value-added tax rates, provided its whisky exports are not
penalised by higher excise duties.
This was signalled last night by Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the
exchequer, during bargaining in Luxembourg on indirect tax rates in the EC.
Finance ministers had been instructed by their leaders attending the weekend
summit in Lisbon to try to align consumer goods tax rates from January 1
1993, when fiscal checks at internal EC borders disappear.
Such alignment is intended to prevent countries undercutting each other's
rates and drawing in shoppers from higher tax-rate states.
EC diplomats said that after Mr Lamont's concession they expected agreement
to be reached under the chancellor's presidency of finance ministers, in the
second half of this year.
Mr Lamont said he was willing to convert last year's political commitment on
a 15 per cent minimum standard VAT rate into 'a time-delimited, legally
binding' directive.
Germany and some other governments, with standard VAT rates below 15 per
cent, have said they need the force of an EC directive to justify
politically unpopular increases.
The idea being floated in Luxembourg last night was that the directive
should last for four years. Mr Lamont made it clear there would no question
of such a law being automatically prolonged.
EC finance ministers also reached agreement in principle on a life assurance
directive, which will complete arrangements for a single, EC-wide market in
various types of insurance.

allegations of fraud, malpractice and political connivance in Ireland's
multi-million pound beef industry.
Mr Des O'Malley, the Irish industry minister, stood by allegations he made
in parliament three years ago that there was political favouritism in the
beef industry and extensive abuse of the export credit insurance scheme,
while the present prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, was in charge of
administering the scheme in 1987 and 1988.
Mr O'Malley is the first cabinet minister to be called to give evidence in
the six-month long inquiry into the beef industry, and his declarations,
which are expected to continue throughout this week, could force a split in
the coalition.
Mr O'Malley, from the small Progressive Democrat party, joined the coalition
after the 1989 general elections. Mr Reynolds is leaders of the Fianna Fail
party.
Mr O'Malley told the tribunal that he believed his earlier allegations
'understated' the magnitude of what was happening in the beef industry, and
that in 1988 export credit insurance for beef sales to Iraq made up almost
50 per cent of all export insurance available at the time. 'This was to just
two companies, for one product to one country,' he said.
The companies involved were Goodman International and Hibernia Meats. He
said that 80 per cent of the insurance was given to the Goodman group,
Europe's biggest beef processor, and that at one point the contingent
liability of the government to cover the Goodman contracts was IPounds 172m.
Mr O'Malley said it was unjustifiable to have continued export cover to Iraq
as, although it was a very lucrative market, it was 'very high risk'.
'Iraq had to pay high prices for its beef because it was a high risk market.
Key to getting in there was export insurance. Those (companies) who were in
had a tremendous advantage,' he told the tribunal.
He said that some of the meat for the contracts had been sourced from
outside Ireland, contravening the rules for the granting of export cover,
and had disadvantaged 'many other Irish beef exporters that wanted to get
into the market'. He said that cover had also been given for 'abnormally
long periods of between 12 and 24 months' whereas the usual period for
comestible products was from 28-30 days. This locked up funds and was
prejudicial to other exporters, he said.
When Ireland raised its overall export insurance ceiling from IPounds 300m
to IPounds 500m in June 1988 he said 'No indication was given to the Dail
(parliament) that the reason for increasing the limit was because of what
was happening in the Iraqi market'. He went on to say that the Irish beef
sold under the contracts 'most likely went to feeding the Iraqi military'.
The tribunal heard in earlier evidence last month that several beef
companies made substantial donations to party funds, the majority going to
Fianna Fail. Fianna Fail has so far refused to divulge to the tribunal
details of political contributions arguing that they were made 'in
confidence'. The opposition Fine Gael party, and Mr O'Malley's Progressive
Democrats have also expressed reluctance to divulge details of
contributions.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Bonn decision on EFA hangs in balance: Kohl seeks compromise
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Germany's participation in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
project remained in the balance last night, only hours before key coalition
meetings were scheduled to decide the issue.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister, repeated his determination that
Germany pull out of the four-nation project. Yet leading proponents of the
scheme, being developed with Britain, Italy and Spain, are still fighting
for a postponement of the decision in the hope of maintaining German
involvement.
The whole issue threatens to split the coalition, as well as Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's own Christian Democrats (CDU). The party's defence working
group was meeting Mr Ruhe last night in an urgent effort to find a
compromise.
At stake is a decision whether to include in next year's budget - due to go
to Cabinet tomorrow - DM100m (Pounds 34.2m) for tooling up costs necessary
to prepare for EFA production. The German government has already committed
DM6bn to development costs, of which about half has been spent.
Mr Ruhe said earlier that the parties in the coalition - the CDU, Christian
Social Union (CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP) - should decide today to pull
out of EFA production, and open negotiations with the partner states on a
redesigned, cheaper and lighter aircraft. It was possible to put off any
final decision on a new fighter aircraft for the Luftwaffe, to replace the
present generation of ageing Phantoms, until 1996, he said.
The clear implication is that Mr Ruhe hopes to persuade the partner states
to switch development spending from the EFA to a new aircraft, and thus save
some DM3bn in further German development spending on an aircraft it does not
wish to buy. Until now, Germany insists it remains committed to the
development spending, even if it pulls out.
Speaking at a military airfield at Memmingerberg in the Allgau, Mr Ruhe
suggested three alternative plans: to build a new light-weight European
fighter; to buy one from abroad; or to build a foreign aircraft under
licence.
Whatever happened, the present EFA should not go into production, he said.
At the same time, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the
Bavaria-based CSU, rejected any suggestion of buying an aircraft from
abroad. To take a later decision to spend virtually the same amount of money
on a foreign fighter aircraft, when one could be built in Germany or Europe,
was 'scarcely credible', he said.
His party colleague Mr Max Streibl, the prime minister of Bavaria, which
stands to bear the brunt of job losses if Germany quits the EFA project,
warned that the very existence of the coalition was in doubt if outstanding
differences were not resolved.
The parliamentary group meetings of the CDU/CSU alliance, and the FDP, to
decide on the EFA have been twice postponed until today, in an effort to
resolve the internal differences.
Yesterday FDP members demanded that a final decision be taken.
'It will be very hard for us to accept another delay in the decision,' an
FDP official said yesterday. 'For us it is a point of no return. If there is
no decision, it will mean a new coalition conflict.'

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST German trade unions have called a demonstration outside the Berlin
headquarters of the Treuhand privatisation agency today against a new wave
of job losses which could put up to 600,000 people on the streets in the
next few months.
The first redundancies take effect tomorrow when former state companies
under the Treuhand's umbrella axe 150,000 jobs as a result of privatisation
and restructuring.
Another 10,000 jobs will be lost when the Treuhand lays off people currently
employed in job creation schemes. Some 436,500 other employees on short-time
work face possible unemployment as the Bonn government tomorrow halts
payment of half of their medical insurance costs. The financially strapped
companies employing them will be forced to pick up the entire bill. Most
survive only from subsidies paid by Bonn for job creation schemes and they
are considered unlikely to be able to absorb the higher personnel costs,
choosing instead to shed labour.
The massive dismissals will push up unemployment in east Germany, which
reached an official 14.1 per cent last month or, 1.1m people. Real
unemployment, however, estimated at close to 30 per cent, has long been
masked by the subsidised job creation and retraining programmes.
The rise in unemployment is a sign that the east German economy is
undergoing a painful but necessary transformation.
The grim employment picture came as east German manufacturing companies
reported only marginally improved business prospects. A monthly poll of 260
companies by the Institute of Economic Research in Halle disclosed that
orders in May scarcely rose from the previous month.
However, the percentage of companies reporting bad business prospects fell
to below 16 per cent for the first time this year.

A crowd of some 100,000 people gathered in the Serbian capital, Belgrade,
yesterday to protest against the government of President Slobodan Milosevic,
Reuter reports from Belgrade.
Mr Milosevic yesterday agreed to round-table talks with his political
opponents, but a delegation representing the protesters gathered outside the
Yugoslav parliament indicated after talks with the president that they may
not accept anything short of his resignation,
'The president of Serbia accepted round-table talks and a test of his
presidential mandate in elections or a referendum,' the five-man delegation
told the crowd in a brief statement after the one-hour meeting.
The president, a nationalist and former communist, has stubbornly ignored
pressure to resign, and his opponents' demands for more democracy, peace and
a change of policy to escape from almost total international isolation.

FT  30 JUN 92 / West may back Yeltsin on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE West is expected to offer a debt rescheduling package to Russia and
other former Soviet republics in what is intended as a show of political
support for President Boris Yeltsin when he meets leaders of the Group of
Seven industrial nations next week.
The package would give Moscow a grace period of up to five years to meet
principal and some or all interest payments owed on debts incurred before
January 1, 1991.
Details, such as whether the grace period will be three or five years, and
whether all or part of the interest will be covered, are still being
negotiated among creditor governments.
It is therefore not yet clear how much relief the former Soviet Union will
be offered on foreign debt totalling Dollars 65bn (Pounds 35.1bn).
The package is a response to strong political pressure to step up support
for Russia despite uncertainty over Moscow's economic reform schedule.
It is likely to upset an already irate banking community because the banks
could be forced to extend the same concessions on commercial debts as those
agreed by governments on official debts.
'It does not make sense for the West to inject large sums of money into
Russia if the Russians do not even have a tax system capable of preventing
capital flight,' said Mr Dominique Menu, the representative for Banque
Nationale de Paris in Moscow.
The package would be 'unorthodox' because it is being offered before a
standby deal with the International Monetary Fund is in place.
However, it would be a condition that the rescheduling package would be
withdrawn if Russia fails to agree a standby agreement by a deadline which
is expected to be set for some time this autumn.
The deal, which does not touch still substantial debts incurred after
January 1 1991, enables G7 governments to offer something concrete to
President Yeltsin in Munich next week, while attempting to keep up pressure
on Moscow to agree to a standby IMF programme.
The main difficulties in the standby negotiations between Moscow and the IMF
negotiators remain budgetary policy - it is not clear how far the Russian
government will manage to tighten the budget deficit - and the ability of
republics which remain in the rouble zone to conduct a concerted monetary
policy.
The rescheduling, which will drive Russia's creditworthiness to new lows,
follows the failure of attempts to make the former Soviet republics share
the debt burden under a more modest package of debt relief, which deferred
principal payments. This deferral was renewed only last week for commercial
bank debts for another 90 days.
Russia, which is the only republic actually repaying any of the debt not
covered by the deferral, is already in arrears, and proposed a five-year
moratorium in the first place.

FT  30 JUN 92 / European car output falls 3.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN car production fell by 3.4 per cent last year to 12.66m, the second
successive annual decline, according to figures released by Automotive
Industry Data, the UK-based automotive analysts.
Output declined despite virtually unchanged new car sales in west Europe at
13.49m, largely due to falling exports by European car makers to overseas
markets.
European car sales declined substantially in both the US and Japanese
markets last year.
At the same time additional overseas car makers, chiefly from Asia, are
beginning to gain a small market share in some European car markets,
increasing competition for the domestic producers.
West Europe is becoming a significant market for Hyundai and Kia, the South
Korean car makers, while Proton, the Malaysian car producer, is establishing
a firm presence in the UK. European car makers dominate the small market for
imported cars in Japan, but imported car sales fell last year in Japan by
11.1 per cent to 197,184.
At the same time European car sales in the US declined by 26 per cent to
338,985, and two European car makers Peugeot of France and Rover of the UK
were forced to pull out of the US car market altogether.
West European car production peaked in 1989 at 13.28m but has been pulled
down in the last two years chiefly due to lower output in Italy and in
France. (The AID figures report 'net' production and exclude double counting
in cases where the same car is included in the national production
statistics of two countries. This occurs because of parts or kits being
produced in one country, but the car being assembled in another).
According to AID, car output in Italy fell by 12.9 per cent last year to
1.63m, as the Fiat group's declining fortunes relegated it to an
unaccustomed fourth place in the west European car production league with a
share of 12.9 per cent.
Among the big six volume car makers in Europe only the Volkswagen group of
Germany, which includes Audi and SEAT, and Renault of France achieved higher
output last year.
The VW group accounted for 19.3 per cent of west European car production,
ahead of the Peugeot group of France which includes Citroen, with 14.5 per
cent and General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) of the US which includes Saab with
13.3 per cent.
BMW, the German prestige car maker which has recently announced plans to
build its first car plant in the US, increased its output last year by 7.2
per cent to 536,003. It has raised production for 17 years in succession
with output rising more than three-fold from 184,681 in 1974.
By contrast Volvo of Sweden was hit hard last year with output plunging by
26.1 per cent to only 273,465.
Several specialist European producers also suffered substantial declines,
with Porsche output dropping by 34.9 per cent to only 20,95 - output peaked
in 1985 at 54,458 - while Jaguar production dropped by 45.2 per cent and
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars output fell by 50.5 per cent.
Volkswagen's Golf/Jetta range remained at the top of the European production
league despite a 15 per cent drop last year due to the change-over to a new
model generation. The Ford Escort/Orion moved into second place with a 25.5
per cent jump in output as it enjoyed its first full production year after
the launch of a new Escort range in the autumn of 1990.

FT  30 JUN 92 / EC ministers open up rules on Community share deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT FIRMS will have a 'single passport' to deal in shares around the
European Community under an agreement reached among EC finance ministers
last night.
The new directive, reached after two years' wrangling, gives stockbrokers in
one country the right to deal in shares of any other EC country without
having to set up a local office or buy a local stockbroker.
The Investment Services Directive (ISD) is seen as the last important plank
in measures to open Europe's financial markets. The agreement still has to
pass through the European Parliament but Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor, said he was 'well satisfied'.
Many City institutions were anxious to avoid any directive which might
damage London's role as a financial centre. They were particularly concerned
about the question of transparency, fearing they would suffer if they had to
disclose full details of transactions - including sensitive information on
prices and volumes - immediately. Much of the debate on the transparency
issue concerned the question of allowing a time delay before disclosing
price and volume.
Under a complex formula setting out how soon off-market share transactions
should be made public, the final agreement would provide for:
A weighted average of prices and volumes in transactions over a six-hour
period to be published two hours later.
The highest and lowest prices, calculated over a rolling two-hour period,
would be published every 20 minutes, with one hour's delay.
As a safeguard - insisted on by the UK - these disclosure rules could be
suspended for very large trades or transactions in illiquid stocks.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for financial services,
said yesterday's accord gave legitimate investors 'a reasonable amount of
information, while enabling the markets to function with liquidity'.
Ministers also agreed on the final disputed aspect of the capital adequacy
directive. Under this, securities dealers would have to have a minimum
amount of capital, depending on the size of the investment firm and the
nature of the risk of its transactions to get their 'passport'.
The formula is designed to bridge the conflicting interests between Britain
and some other countries, particularly France.
The UK was concerned for its 'quote-driven' system, which depends on
market-makers' readiness to hold large blocks of shares while keeping the
exact size of the blocks private. In many countries, stockbrokers and banks
start hunting for shares only after receiving a client's order.
Ministers also agreed on a phased timetable for six countries to allow banks
direct access to their stock markets.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Algeria's leader assassinated in gun attack: Crackdown on
Islamic fundamentalists likely after death of Boudiaf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA'S military government last night looked certain to crack down harder
on Algeria's Islamic fundamentalists after Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the head of
state, was assassinated in a burst of machinegun fire.
The country's collective presidency vowed to take 'all steps' needed to
preserve security. Although the killer was at first reported shot dead, the
military leadership later disclosed he was seized and investigations would
uncover 'the instigators of the crime and their accomplices'.
Suspicion is bound to fall on supporters of the fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), who have killed up to 100 police and soldiers in
hit-and-run shootings since February.
The death of Mr Boudiaf, the 73-year-old head of Algeria's ruling High State
Council, comes just five months after his appointment blocked a Moslem
fundamentalist election victory.
Witnesses said dozens of people were injured in the attack which took place
as Mr Boudiaf was speaking at a cultural centre in the eastern city of
Annaba.
They said the killer, dressed in police uniform, struck from behind a
curtain behind Mr Boudiaf, hitting him in the back and head with a volley of
sub-machinegun fire. There were two diversionary explosions beforehand,
apparently grenades.
Mr Boudiaf's final words, heard on a newsfilm broadcast on television, were:
'We must know that the life of a human being is very short. We are all going
to die. Why should (the authorities) cling so much to power?'
Television showed Mr Boudiaf breaking off his speech because of a muffled
explosion on his left. The camera swung away from him to show people diving
under their seats.
Moments later it showed him sprawled on a stretcher and police with guns
drawn. Automatic gunfire and about a dozen single shots then crackled
through the hall.
Among the injured was Mr Abdenour Keramane, the industry and mines minister.
The official news agency APS initially reported that the assassin was killed
by the presidential bodyguard, but the collective presidency later disclosed
that the killer had been arrested and was being questioned.
The murder will be seen by many as a direct consequence of the government's
decision to declare the FIS illegal when it was poised to win January's
elections - Algeria's first since independence from France in 1962. The
event seems bound to harden government determination to curb the
organisation and its supporters. It also raises the danger that fresh
violence will break out on the streets of Algerian towns and cities.
The shooting took place almost a year after 55 people were killed in the
first serious clashes between FIS supporters and police in Algiers.
It came two days after the conspiracy trial of two FIS leaders, Mr Abassi
Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, was adjourned after a walk-out by defence
lawyers. Tension surrounding the trial had prompted diplomats to suggest
that FIS supporters would intensify violence against the government.
Mr Boudiaf returned to Algeria in January after 28 years' exile in Morocco,
to head the High State Council, which replaced the government of President
Chadli Benjedid who resigned after the first round of elections in which the
FIS scored a convincing victory.
The five-man council, which the FIS denounced as having grabbed power in a
coup, declared a state of emergency in February, banning the FIS, detaining
thousands of its alleged supporters in desert camps and stifling public
support for the group.

FT  30 JUN 92 / British Steel shares down 10% as Pounds 55m loss is reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in British Steel fell nearly 10 per cent yesterday to their lowest
level since privatisation in 1988 after the dominant UK steelmaker reported
a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss and cut its final dividend from 5.75p to 1.5p per
share.
The announcement of British Steel's figures for the year to March 28 - the
last in six turbulent years under Sir Robert Scholey's chairmanship  - was
coupled with the unveiling of a big stainless steel link-up with Avesta of
Sweden, creating one of the largest European producers with combined
revenues of Pounds 1.2bn and 9,000 employees.
The deal is one of the most important cross-border ventures aimed at
reducing the European steel industry's chronic overcapacity and increasing
its ability to weather recessions.
It was overshadowed, however, by the extent of the profit collapse at
British Steel, which had pre-tax profits of Pounds 254m in 1990-91 and
record profits of Pounds 733m in 1989-90.
British Steel's shares fell 6 1/2 p to close at 60 1/2 p, less than half
their value at the privatisation. The Pounds 55m loss was smaller than some
City analysts had predicted, and the dividend cut was widely expected after
warnings from SirRobert when the company announced its half-year figures.
'I said at the interim stage that there was no sign of an upturn in our main
markets, and disappointingly that still remains the case,' said Sir Robert,
who retires next month and will be replaced by Sir Alastair Frame.
British Steel's decline since privatisation is due to a worldwide steel
recession, exacerbated by overcapacity in Europe.
Prices for British Steel's products fell by an average of 8 per cent in the
year ended March, and in the European Community prices have fallen by nearly
20 per cent since late 1989.
The recession was the final straw for British Steel's Ravenscraig steel
plant in Scotland, where steelmaking ended last week, after the collapse of
the Scottish shipbuilding and motor industries which it served.
Sir Robert warned that the timing of UK market recovery was uncertain and
could be overshadowed by reduced demand in other main markets.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Major hits back at Thatcher over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR scornfully dismissed Mrs Margaret Thatcher's fears of a
European superstate yesterday as an unreal nightmare, underlining the depth
of his rift with his predecessor.
In an acerbic House of Commons performance, the prime minister flatly
rejected Mrs Thatcher's call for a referendum on the Maastricht agreement.
Speaking on the eve of Mrs Thatcher's entry into the Lords as Baroness
Thatcher of Kesteven, Mr Major did little to disguise his irritation with
the weekend tirade in which she described Maastricht as a 'treaty too far'.
Mrs Thatcher is expected to continue her onslaught in her maiden speech in
the Lords on Thursday.
Many Conservative MPs joined yesterday's concerted attack on their former
leader as Mr Major reminded her pointedly of how in 1975 she had approvingly
quoted Lord Attlee's judgment that the referendum was 'the device of
demagogues and dictators'.
Mr Major responded sharply to a sprinkling of attacks from Tory
Euro-sceptics. He repeatedly underlined his determination to ratify the
accords on European political and economic union, stressing that they would
reverse the 'centralising' trend of the Single European Act - an agreement
signed by Mrs Thatcher.
He said fears of a centralised European state was the 'stuff of nightmares'
for a few people. The reality was that we were 'now in a position to begin
to turn that tide back and it would be folly if we were to sideline
ourselves when we have an opportunity of achieving that'.
Mr Major acknowledged that the Maastricht legislation would not be debated
by MPs again until the Danish government had given a clearer indication of
its response to its electorate's rejection of the treaty. That response is
expected in the autumn, coinciding with the French referendum.
Mr Major said Britain's presidency of the Community, which begins tomorrow,
would give substance to the concept of subsidiarity enshrined in the
Maastricht treaty.
That would involve a review of all areas of EC activity to ensure that the
only decisions taken in Brussels were those which could not be effectively
taken by national governments.

FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo eroded by rumour and higher yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE erosion of the Japanese market continued last week, beginning with
rumours of major difficulties in real estate and closing with a decline in
blue chip electricals, sold on the potential effect of a higher yen.
Europe was also depressed, weighed down by the UK, which was worried about
the Wellcome share issue and staggered by the ousting of BP chairman and
chief executive Mr Robert Horton. At least Denmark was 2.1 per cent better,
enlivened in a week when the country's unfancied football team won the
European Nations' Cup.
With the US uncertain but neutral, perhaps ominously taking the view that
bad economic data might be good for an interest rate cut and, therefore, the
equity market, the World Index had nowhere to go but down, for the fourth
week in succession.
Hong Kong saw a renewed upsurge, taking its gain this year to 45.5 per cent.
Hoare Govett Asia says Hongkong Bank's successful conclusion to its bid for
Midland, of the UK, was one reason for the latest show of strength; in
addition, there was a corporate takeover 'which set a new benchmark for
rising office property values'.
'At a deeper level, however,' says the broker, 'the market's strength can be
attributed to an environment of cheap money and political reform in China.'
Mr David Pirkis, a director of Kim Eng Securities in London, elaborates on
the real estate angle, saying the office and residential property markets
have been 'out of synch' lately. Residential has been in the top quartile of
its cycle with capital gains of between 70 and 80 per cent last year, while
the office market only bottomed in the last quarter of 1991.
This year, he says, end users and investors have been buying offices, the
former thinking that rents will go up and the latter prepared to accept low
yields in an environment of negative interest rates.

FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt out performs easier
continental trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKER dollar was a source of concern, but one not always acted upon in
bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT expressed some worries about the lower dollar and last week's
money supply figures but its equities outperformed most of Europe as the DAX
index closed 2.99 higher at 1,757.12 after a 1.02 rise to 696.85 in the FAZ
at midsession. Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.7bn.
Mr James Cornish of County NatWest said that there was good economic news
yesterday, as West German import prices for May fell by 2.5 per cent year on
year and, after hours, as Bavaria became the fourth western German state to
report a slight easing in inflation trends in June.
County continues to see Germany on an improving economic trend in the second
half of this year. Mr Cornish's colleague, Mr Adrian Hopkinson, said that
disposable incomes could improve by 4 per cent in real terms in
July/December after some weakness in the first six months, as the solidarity
surcharge on income taxes is removed and inflation continues to fall.
Meanwhile, first half problems constraints were reflected, again, in the
packaging company Schmalbach-Lubeca and its parent, Viag. Destocking of
beverages and conserves has been unkind to Schmalbach, and its sister Viag
subsidiary, Gerresheimer Glas, said Mr Hopkinson. Schmalbach fell another
DM21 to DM474 yesterday, Gerresheimer by DM14.30 to DM320, just above its
low for the year and Viag by another DM14.50 to DM392.70.
ZURICH's SMI index ended 11.1 higher at 1,846.6 after an early high of
1,852.5. Pharmaceuticals rose in spite of the lower dollar, which tends to
hurt export earnings.
Ciba-Geigy recovered from last week's pressure on potential health risks of
nicotine patches, the registered shares putting on SFr60 to SFr3,310. Sandoz
was supported by presentations to analysts in the US, the certificates
rising SFr40 to SFr2,990.
PARIS ended lower in dull trading, unsettled by news in the afternoon of the
assassination of Algeria's head of state. The CAC-40 index, which had risen
as high as 1,925.62, fell back to close 8.01 lower at 1,907.30, just above
the day's low of 1,906.21.
Turnover, at a moderate FFr2.7bn, was mainly generated by trading in
Generale des Eaux, up FFr11 at FFr2,195 ahead of the expiry of its equity
warrants this week, and arbitrage activity in Total, which added FFr2.70 to
FFr235.5. Alcatel and Elf were also active.
Paribas was one of the day's more prominent losers, falling FFr11 or 3.1 per
cent to FFr346 on fears about its exposure to the real estate sector.
MILAN failed to be stimulated by the long-awaited nomination of the
government, or by Friday's agreement between Olivetti and Digital whereby
Digital would take 10 per cent in the Italian company. Dealers feared that
the failure of the four-party coalition government to get the backing of the
Republican and Communist parties would lessen its chances of tackling the
country's budget problems. The Comit index fell 1.56 to 460.56, its lowest
close since 16 February 1988 when the index closed at 453.59. Turnover was
estimated at more than Friday's L86bn.
Olivetti, which had been suspended on Friday, closed L89 down from
Thursday's close at L3,189 and fell to L3,120 after hours as the speculative
fizz evaporated from the stock. The holding company Cir stood L52 down at
L1,773.
Generali, initially boosted by its own results, closed L250 higher at
L28,300, but retreated to L27,875 later.
MADRID ended a fraction above its 1992 low on economic pessimism, the
general index closing 4.17, or 1.7 per cent down at 239.12, in turnover of
Pta13bn, a little higher than in previous sessions.
Construction saw the worst falls, led by Asland with a drop of Pta190, or
11.1 per cent to Pta1,525. Dragados fell by 6.6 per cent, and Uralita by 6.2
per cent. Telefonica was the most active stock, down Pta25 at Pta1,020 in
volume of 2.73m shares. AMSTERDAM was weighed down by a 3.8 per cent fall in
Hoogovens, the steel and aluminium manufacturer, which dropped Fl 2 to Fl
50.30 following Friday's news that it planned to make further cuts in its
already reduced 1992 investment programme.
BRUSSELS was narrowly mixed in thin trading as the Bel-20 index eased 1.40
to 1,165.28 in turnover of BFr569m. Petrofina bucked the trend, climbing
BFr125 or 1.2 per cent to BFr10,600.
STOCKHOLM fell on higher interest rates and the weaker dollar, the
Affarsvarlden General index closing 11.3 lower at 909.7, a new low for the
year. Ericsson B fell SKr4 to SKr137.
OSLO also hit a new 1992 low. The all-share index closed 5.45 lower at
399.31, depressed by high real interest rates and widening pessimism about
prospects for a quick economic upturn.
TEL AVIV, meanwhile, hit a new high in very active turnover of Shk137.2m
following news that Germany might grant Israel billions of marks in loan
guarantees. The blue chip index rose 2.55 to 148.05.

FT  30 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls again as
volume drops to 150m shares

JAPANESE share prices were dragged down by small-lot selling yesterday as
market volume dropped to only 150m shares, the smallest since June 9, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 71.46 to 15,741.27, its lowest close since May 20,
1986. The index fluctuated between 15,881.77 and 15,641.61. The market rose
on bargain hunting and short-covering before falling on small-lot
arbitrage-related selling.
Volume declined from Friday's 247m shares. Falls led rises by 641 to 278,
with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed
6.34 to 1,225.11. In London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.20 to
966.26.
Traders said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's economic stimulus
package, revealed broadly during the weekend, failed to generate activity.
'The market is absolutely inert,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. He
added that by the time the details of the government's supplementary budget
are announced, they will have been discounted by the market, and will not
provide any incentive for investors.
Even foreigners, who have been leading buyers of the market, were reported
as net sellers for the second week in succession. The Tokyo Stock Exchange
said foreign investors sold a net Y63.5bn in the week ended June 19.
Domestic institutions were net buyers for the fourth straight week. Traders,
however, pointed out that Japanese institutional investors were 'passive
accumulators', placing orders at lower levels, rather than being 'aggressive
buyers'.
Property-related issues were weaker. Misawa Homes, the house builder, which
plunged last week on fears of financial problems at Misawa's resort
development subsidiaries, receded a further Y7 to Y864. Daikyo, which has
also faltered on concern about its financial stability, picked up Y2 to
Y707. However, traders said the improvement was technical, and investors
remained suspicious about the company's soundness.
High-technology blue chips were higher on small-lot bargain hunting.
Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, gained Y10 to Y641 and Fujitsu
advanced Y13 to Y598.
Banks were easier, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y10 to Y1,450 and Fuji

pessimistic about prospects for the sector.
Speculative theme stocks ran into profit-taking. Meiji Milk Products

Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets started the week on a mixed note.
MANILA surged, triggered by the Dollars 2 1/8 advance to Dollars 39 3/8 of
PLDT on the American Stock Exchange on Friday. The composite index climbed
30.49 to 1,555.81 in turnover of 521m pesos, after Friday's 196m. Volume was
boosted by the listing of 15.5m shares of Union Bank of the Philippines
(UBP) on the local exchanges.
PLDT rose 50 pesos to 1,080 pesos while UBP gained 5.50 pesos to 27 pesos.
The market is closed today for the proclamation of the new president.
HONG KONG dropped solidly in moderately active trading, snapping a five-day,
record-setting rally. The Hang Seng index slid 55.20 to 6,057.90, after
surging 325 points last week. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 3.76bn from
Friday's HKDollars 4.72bn.
NEW ZEALAND closed lower in cautious trading ahead of the government's
annual budget statement, to be issued today. The NZSE-40 index drifted
easier throughout the session to end 8.43 down at 1,519.99. Turnover was
steady at NZDollars 21.8m.
Telecom Corp relinquished 5 cents to NZDollars 2.05, overshadowed by a
report issued by New Zealand's anti-trust regulator last week contending
that existing laws are not sufficient to encourage competition against
Telecom.
TAIWAN lost ground for the sixth consecutive day, on disappointing inflation
data. The weighted index declined 28.94 to 4,467.50 in unchanged turnover of
TDollars 21.1bn.
AUSTRALIA drifted to finish little changed in the penultimate trading day of
the fiscal year ending June 30. The All Ordinaries index settled 0.6 off at
1,642.3 in turnover of ADollars 242m, sharply down from Friday's ADollars
433m.
SINGAPORE closed weaker after light trading, with the Straits Times
Industrial index down 11.03 at 1,481.66.
KUALA LUMPUR was unsettled by the continuing slide in Japanese equities. The
composite index closed 5.41 lower at 591.14.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Newmont says bank interested in
backing Uzbek gold project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMONT MINING, north America's biggest gold producer, says the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development is interested in leading a syndicate
of European banks to provide about USDollars 60m of project finance for
Newmont's joint venture in newly-independent Uzbekistan.
Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont's chairman, says that the venture is 'a perfect
project for the EBRD and fits the bank's charter and purposes exactly'. He
points out that the main attraction from the bank's poimnt of view is that
Newmont and Uzbekistan, which used to account for about one-third of the
former Soviet Union's gold production, intend to export all the gold
produced from the venture for sale at world prices.
However, Newmont is still working on a bankable feasibility study so the
EBRD cannot yet give any commitment. Other European banks are 'queueing up
to get involved,' Mr Parker says.
Mr Peter Philip, Newmont's president, says the capital cost of the venture
is likely to be between USDollars 80m and Dollars 100m. Project finance will
provide about two-thirds of the cash while Newmont and Uzbekistan will share
the rest equally, as they will share the profit on the gold. Newmont will
retain its share of the revenue not needed for capital expenditure outside
Uzbekistan.
Newmont revealed earlier this year that it aimed to use its heap-leach
technology to extract gold from low-grade ore stockpiled at Muruntau,
reputed to be the world's biggest gold mine. The mine's mill cannot treat
this ore. The joint ventures estimate that there is 3m troy ounces in the
stockpile and hope to produce between 180,000 and 360,000 ounces annually
for at least ten years, starting in 1993.
Mr Parker says that Newmont's 20-year agreement with the relevant state
committee was, at the US company's request, given additional authority by a
cabinet decree. He says Newmont was careful not to drive too hard a bargain
so any new government was unlikely to throw out the deal because 'it is good
for Uzbekistan'.
The joint venturers have agreed to follow Swedish law as Uzbekistan has no
mining laws of its own.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Opening shots' in coffee pact
talks please delegates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DELEGATES INCHED along the road towards a new international coffee agreement
at talks in London last week, but once again left the world markets
unimpressed.
The hopes of producers that transitional measures could be put in place to
curb the slide in world prices to the lowest levels for more than 20 years
remained unfulfilled.
However, both producers and consumers left the meeting seemingly well
satisfied with the tiny amount of progress made. 'The negotiations for a new
international coffee agreement are under way,' said Mr Arnoldo Lopez,
chairman of the International Coffee Organisation negotiating group.
'Nobody in their right mind would have thought that in a week we could reach
an agreement,' said Mr Myles Frechette, head of the US delegation. 'We've
had the opening shots in a dialogue.'
The New York September arabica futures contract rebounded from a lifetime
low of 56.8 cents a lb on Friday to close at 59 cents after an upbeat radio
interview by Mr Jorge Cardenas, general manager of Colombia's National
Coffee Growers' Federation, who said: 'I would say the outcome is very
good.' But this still marked a fall of 1.8 cents on the week. In late
trading yesterday the price eased to 58.9 cents a lb. The London robusta
market rose yesterday, with the September contract closing at Dollars 700 a
tonne.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker, said that
yesterday's steady markets reflected the fact that the sell-off on lack of
progress at the ICO talks had already taken place last week.
Mr Lopez' final statement said a new coffee pact would be oriented towards
the market and 'provide for suitable means of access to the different types
of coffee as required by the consumers, with price stability being a medium
and long-term objective'.
Working groups have been set up to go further into detailed proposals and
will meet at the end of next month.
The statement reflects the determination of the US, the biggest consumer, to
get the next agreement fully thrashed out and ratified before there is any
talk of transitional measures to support prices. From the start Mr Frechette
pointed out that the US had very little flexibility in the negotiations. 'I
have to remind you of what the (US) National Coffee Federation says - they
prefer the free market,' he said.
The current purely administrative ICO pact continues until the end of
September next year, but the ICO was hoping to sign a new agreement before
the end of this year. That now looks unlikely.

decision

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS at Poland's KGHM copper-producing combine in Lubin are to wait
until July 8 before deciding on whether to proceed with a general strike by
the 40,000 employees. The decision came yesterday after talks in Warsaw at
the end of last week with senior officials from the PSL farmers' party whose
leader Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister designate, is attempting to
form a government. Last week nine out of ten of the 70 per cent or so of the
workers who took part in a referendum voted in favour of an all-out
stoppage.
Union leaders have evidently decided to wait to give Mr Pawlak a chance to
form a government before pressing on with their demand for a 30 per cent
wage increase. The increase would require an easing of prohibitive taxes
that control wages in state sector industries and Mr Pawel Ofman, the KGHM's
managing director has been quoted as saying that the issue is solely in the
government's hands.
The unions are arguing that agreements signed in 1989 with the then
communist government promising miners twice the average wage in
manufacturing industry still apply and this accounts for the 30 per cent
wage rise demand. Should they succeed they could be followed by miners in
the loss-making coal industry, who would demand rises and put pressure on
the government to renew subsidies for their sector, which ended this year.
Mr Ofman has said a day's strike would cost the combine 1,000 tonnes of
copper, which brings a profit of USDollars 400 to Dollars 500 a tonne. Last
year the combine produced 345,000 tonnes of copper, of which 241,000 tonnes
were exported.
The International Copper Study Group has cleared the way for Japan to join
the producer-consumer forum by modifying its terms of reference, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva. However, last week's inaugural meeting in
Geneva, held under the auspices of the United Nation Conference on Trade and
Development, failed to decide on a headquarters site or a secretary-general.
The next meeting is planned for November in Santiago.
The study group already has 18 member countries accounting for 61 per cent
of world trade. Apart from Japan, the world's largest copper importer,
Indonesia plans to join shortly and Zambia, the third largest producer, will
soon take a decision on membership. These three countries would bring the
group's coverage of world trade in copper to nearly 80 per cent.
Lisbon, Santiago and Montreal have offered to host the group's headquarters.
The three declared candidates for post of secretary-general are Mr George
Coakley of the US Bureau of Mines, Mr Gunther Behrendt, in charge of
non-ferrous metals in Germany's Economics Ministry, and Mr Francis Walter of
France, who heads the finance ministry's industrial commodities section.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world wheat crop
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD WHEAT production for 1992-93 will be the second biggest on record at
548m tonnes, according to the International Wheat Council.
This compares with 544m tonnes for 1991-92 and the record 594m tonnes the
year before.
Usage is predicted to fall by 10m tonnes to 553m tonnes in 1992-93 as less
wheat will go for animal feed. As a result there should be a 3m-tonne stocks
rise to 134m tonnes.
Mr Bill de Maria, the IWC's chief economist, points out that the IWC is now
measuring grain output in the former Soviet Union by net weight after
cleaning and drying, as opposed to bunker weight in previous analyses. Given
the size of wheat production from that geographical area (85m tonnes for
1992-93) the change could mean a difference of between 5m and 6m tonnes in
total world output.
On the world market, the former Soviet Union had switched from being a cash
buyer to a credit buyer. 'If they are to buy they will very much need access
to credit for both purchase and freight,' he says. While there are worries
about defaults, 'we have to assume credit will be available.' The IWC
estimates that total 1992-93 grain imports will be 25m tonnes (14m tonnes
wheat and 11m tonnes coarse grains).
World total coarse grain production is predicted at 824m tonnes for 1992-93,
up 26m tonnes and only 1m tonnes off the 1990-91 record. Consumption is
expected to edge ahead to 815m tonnes, leaving stocks at 122m tonnes,
compared with 115m tonnes in 1991-92.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buying burst lifts LME metals
to fresh highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED burst of enthusiastic buying yesterday boosted all prices on
the London Metal Exchange. Copper's price touched its highest level for 14
months; zinc was at a 20-month high, while tin reached a 29-month peak.
Traders suggested nothing had changed in the fundamental outlook for metals
so the very high volume of business had taken most people by surprise. Some
trading was technically-driven as prices moved up through technical
resistance levels and triggered 'buy' signals to computer-linked trading
programmes. Speculators were attracted by the sudden activity.
Analysts said the speed and size of the price increases would probably lead
to some profit-taking and retracement today and prices would almost
certainly diverge again to reflect each underlying fundamental situation.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, said: 'The market was looking to go up even though there
was no good reason, so it was seizing on every bit of potential bullish
news.' He thought copper's present price could be justified and any fall
would probably attract more buying. But there was no good reason for
aluminium or nickel prices to be buoyant. Both these markets were suffering
because of substantial imports from the CIS.
Zinc was a special case, said Mr MacMillan, because it was ignoring the
fundamentals and was in the grip of a long-running LME technical squeeze.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Summit hitch for plant breeders
 -Fears concerning the biodiversity convention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONVENTION on biological diversity, agreed at the recent 'Earth Summit'
in Rio de Janeiro could have the unintended effect of impeding the breeding
of new plant species, plant geneticists fear. The problem arises from
uncertainty over the convention's implications for the legal ownership of
plant resources held at 17 major international agricultural research
centres.
Maintaining biodiversity - that is, a wide range and assortment of plants -
helps to provide protection against pests and diseases and is vital for the
breeding of improved crop varieties; it is considered essential for food
supplies in both northern and southern hemispheres.
In Rio more than 150 countries signed the convention, the stated objectives
of which are: 'The conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use
of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits
arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources'. It will come into
force once it has been ratified by 30 countries - probably by early next
year.
The research centres, which make up the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research network, store about 600,000 plant samples in their
'geno-plasmic' banks. These amount to some 35 per cent of the world's
genetic plant material, including major collections of crops such as rice,
wheat, maize and other important cereals. Most of the centres are located in
developing countries, as the north is poor in genetic materials.
One of the centres, the International Rice Research Institute in the
Philippines, for example, has about 85,000 cultivated and wild rices in
store. Many of the wild varieties have been collected from fields, forests,
riverbanks and remote areas. According to the UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation, since the beginning of the century about three-quarters of the
world's genetic plant material has been lost, and some 50,000 more species
disappear every year, reducing the pool of material that is available for
breeding new varieties.
Over-harvesting, pollution, and the disappearance of tropical forest cover
are largely responsible for this loss. 'The current decline in biodiversity
is largely the result of human activity and represents a serious threat,'
says the Agenda 21 plan of action agreed at the Rio summit.
The biodiversity convention is designed to halt this loss of plant life and
will also mean that a country from which a plant originates can claim rent
if it is used in the development of a commercial crop variety. For some
countries this could mean sizeable increases in foreign earnings.
It is this question of property rights for the countries of origin that
could impede distribution of plant material from the 17 research centres a
year to crop-breeding programmes throughout the world - at present they send
out about 100,000 samples a year.
'One interpretation of the convention is that a research centre would have
to get permission from the countries of origin before it distributes
materials,' says Mr Geoffrey Hawtin, director of one of the centres, the
Rome-based International Board for Plants Genetic Resources. Some crop
varieties, he points out, may have 20 different 'parents' - meaning that
plants from 20 countries have been used in their development.
'The status of this material is unclear,' believes Mr Hawtin. Depending on
how the convention is interpreted, they are either covered by or excluded
from its provisions. If crop samples in the CGIR network are covered, then
centres 'would need the expressed permission of the countries of origin of
all their materials before they would be able to distribute them,' he says.
Such a bureaucratic nightmare could seriously slow down the distribution of
crop samples. It could hinder the development of new varieties and have
repercussions for food supplies, says Mr Hawtin, 'but it is clearly the
convention's intention to facilitate the movement of materials, rather than
impede them'.
He believes that it is necessary for the countries that sign the convention
 -expected to be all except the US - to clear up the confusion at an early
stage and agree on a protocol or similar legal mechanism to guarantee the
free exchange of genetic material.
Mr Hawtin expects the overall effect of the convention to be positive. 'It
calls for more attention to be paid to genetic diversity, for more
scientific research to underpin the efforts, and will help raise
consciousness of the issues.' The convention requires countries to establish
a system of protected areas 'where special measures need to be taken to
conserve biological diversity'. It stresses the importance of management of
resources and the rehabilitation of degraded areas.
It also states that industrial countries will provide 'new and additional
financial resources' for the preservation of genetic materials. Funds for
this are at present insufficient, believes Mr Hawtin, and efforts are being
made to obtain Dollars 300m a year for maintaining biodiversity, about three
times more than the present level of funding.
However, if the confusion over the status of genetic material is not cleared
up before the biodiversity convention takes effect, the world-wide
distribution of crop samples from the CGIAR centres could slow down
dramatically, causing serious delays in the development of new varieties.

A CANADIAN-AUSTRALIAN joint venture has confirmed the scope of last
November's diamond find 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the Northwest
Territories' capital.
The kimberlite find by Dia Met/BHP Minerals started the biggest Canadian
staking rush since the Hemlo gold discoveries in northern Ontario in the
1970s.
Dia Met said further US tests of a bulk sample of Point Lake kimberlite
showed the weight of the tiny diamonds recovered was 101 carats, compared
with 90 carats reported on May 20, and that about a quarter were gem
quality.
Dia Met emphasised that the 160-tonne rock sample was small and much more
exploration was needed. BHP, the Australian mining group, is the operator of
the Point Lake exploration programme.

London COCOA prices moved strongly ahead again. Dealers attributed the
advance mainly to a technical correction after last week's slump to the
lowest levels since the mid-1970s, and said they would use any extended
rallies as a chance to sell. Some technical analysts said September cocoa
could rally up to Pounds 580 or Pounds 590 a tonne, but the threat of fresh
supply still overhangs the market. SILVER prices fell on the London bullion
market after Comex opened below the crucial Dollars 4 a troy ounce level and
the dollar came in for more pressure on the foreign exchange markets.
'People are apprehensive that the US economic recovery might not be as
robust as they'd thought,' one dealer said. A fall in US new home sales for
May compounded fears. Traders said they were surprised GOLD had not
performed better with the dollar so weak. Nymex PLATINUM futures shot higher
in late trading as the market reacted to the base metals rally and the huge
strike in South Africa, the world's biggest producer, over the Boipatong
massacre. In Chicago SOYABEAN prices were well down at midsession on
expectations of rain in the Midwest later this week.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkish state-owned banks to
merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKIYE Ogretmenler Bankasi (Tobank), has been absorbed by Halkbank, after
five years of unsuccessful attempts by the Turkish Treasury to get it back
to profits.
Both banks are state-owned. Tobank did not publish accounts for 1991, but at
the end of 1990 it ranked 16th out of Turkey's 33 locally-owned banks with a
network of 93 branches.
Its total assets in its last published accounts for December 1990 were
TL1,861bn (Dollars 636m) when it reported a small profit of TL2.4bn.
Halkbank, which specialises mainly in loans to small businesses and
craftsmen, had assets of TL8,220bn in 1990.
The Treasury had been trying to nurse Tobank back to health for the past
five years, but this spring its loan book was hit by new losses and its
closure became a matter of urgency.
There was some surprise among bankers in Turkey that the Treasury selected
Halk Bankasi as Tobank's takeover partner, rather than much larger state
banks such as Ziraat Bank or Vakiflar Bankasi which have handled similar
operations in the mid-1980s.
Halkbank will place the residue of Tobank's losses in a special account.
Tobank's 93 branches are currently trading as part of Halkbank but some
closures are planned.
The closure of Tobank brings to an end one of the most curious institutional
histories in the Turkish banking world. The bank was founded in the late
1950s as a teachers' co-operative bank, but was later controlled by a single
shareholder. It was nationalised in 1987 as part of the Treasury rescue
operation.
Turkey is planning to offer its 18 per cent shareholding in Teletas
Telekomunikasyon Endustri Ticaret to local investors via a tender issue.
Teletas is 39 per cent owned by Alcatel Alsthom, the French
telecommunications group.

covered warrants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON WU, the principal shareholder of Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong
property and infrastructure developer, has issued covered warrants over
nearly 9.5 per cent of the company to relieve his personal debts.
The warrants, over 400m Hopewell shares, were issued at a strike price of
HKDollars 1.50 and initially raised Dollars HK578m (USDollars 74.76m). They
can be converted for either shares or cash at HKDollars 5.8 after two years.
The warrants have been placed with institutions.
Hopewell shares ended the day at HKDollars 5.60.
Smart Best, a personal company of Mr Wu, said proceeds of the warrants will
be used to reduce Mr Wu's personal borrowings arising from him subscribing
to a one-for-one rights issue in June last year.
That raised Dollars HK5.5bn of which Mr Wu personally funded 47 per cent.
Since then his personal control of Hopewell has fallen to 43 per cent
following the issue of 400m shares to investors in May which raised
HKDollars 2bn.
If the warrants are exercised Mr Wu will receive an additional Dollars
HK2.3bn, but would see his control of the company fall to 33.5 per cent.

the same rights of ownership as 'A' shares which are reserved for Chinese
nationals.
Currently there is only one 'B' share company listed on the exchange,
Shanghai Vacuum. This was the first company in which Beijing allowed
foreigners to own stock since the communists came to power in 1949.
Investors will be offered 24m 'B' shares in Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical
Company, representing nearly 30 per cent of Dollars 8 a share. Shanghai
Chlor-Alkali is one of the country's largest chemical companies and the
issue will raise around Dollars 200m.
The second large offering is for Shanghai Tyre and Rubber, China's biggest
tyre manufacturer. Some 17m 'B' shared will be offered at a price of about
Dollars 11.40 to raise around Dollars 200m.
the leaders of the two syndicates - SBCI Asia for Shanghai Tyre and N. M.
Rothschild and Smith New Court - are vying for the honour of bringing to the
international market the biggest China offering.
The depth of international investor interest in China is underlined by the
amount of money so far raised for various 'China funds'.
At the last count there were 18 funds dedicated to either direct or
portfolio investment in China. Total funds raised amounted to nearly Dollars
1bn.
Analysts in Hong Kong said that there was still a strong 'novelty' interest
in mainland Chinese stocks. But, they added, there was also a good
fundamental reason for investing in the Chinese mainland.
China has the potentially the world's largest economy and, with the recent
move towards faster economic reform by Beijing, it was set to grow at an
increasing rate, they said.
The injection of foreign capital in China's large state industries serves
two purposes. It relieves the central authorities from the responsibility of
funding their capital expansion and it also lowers the tax rate dramatically
on the companies concerned.
The Shanghai municipal government redefines a state industry as a foreign
joint venture if 25 per cent or more of its capital is foreign owned. This
allows the municipal taxation authorities to reduce taxes on profits from 55
per cent to 15 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: China Merchants seeks
HKDollars 92m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHINA'S willingness to experiment with new means of raising foreign capital
took another step forward yesterday when China Merchants, the large
shipping, industrial, finance and tourism concern owned by the Chinese
central government, went to the Hong Kong stock market seeking HKDollars
92m.
In the first such invitation of its kind, China Merchants is offering the
investing public a chance to buy into a mainland manufacturer of marine and
industrial paints. It will issue 61.25m shares in Hai Hong Holdings (25 per
cent of the company's capital) at HKDollars 1.50 a share.
At the issue launch yesterday, Mr Jiang Bo, China Merchants' managing
director, said that if the issue proved successful then the company would
consider using Hai Hong as a vehicle to float other China Merchants assets.
Mr Jiang also hinted at a possible listing in London for China Merchants'
Houlder Insurance Brokers (HIB). He said it had the 'financial conditions'
for listing and that there should be no problem with such a move. HIB was
acquired in 1987 and had revenues in 1990 of Pounds 11.4m (Dollars 21.09m).
The decision to float a subsidiary in Hong Kong is a significant development
for China Merchants, which is conservatively managed and secretive.
It also indicates a growing acceptance in Beijing for economic reform.
Analysts expected the issue to meet with widespread investor interest. The
issue had novelty value and investors have demonstrated their hunger to own
mainland assets, they said.
China Merchants is one of the 'four heavenly sisters' or old mainland
companies in Hong Kong. It is owned by the Ministry of Communications in
Beijing.
Mr Jiang said the float had been under consideration for the past year. He
said Hai Hong was chosen because it has a good track record and that the
outlook for the paints industry in China was bright. There were also few
difficulties in restating the company's accounts to conform to western
standards.
Advisers to the company said this float represented an experiment for China
Merchants. A relatively simple, single product company had been chosen for
the float.
They said, however, that Hai Hong would develop into China Merchants' listed
Hong Kong company. Much like Citic Pacific, the locally-listed vehicle for
Beijing's China International Trust and Investment Company, Hai Hong may
well end up owning stakes in China Merchants' extensive interests, they
added.
'They are just beginning to realise that you do not need to own 100 per cent
of something to control it,' said one adviser.

RJR NABISCO has made its biggest investment in eastern Europe, buying 87 per
cent of Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar, the Hungarian state-owned cigarette
factory.
The acquisition allows the US to make 5.5bn cigarettes a year in north-east
Hungary close to the large and undersupplied Ukrainian market.
Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar reported 1991 pre-tax profits of Ft123m (Dollars
1.6m) on sales of Ft4.8bn. Production volume represents about 20 per cent of
the Hungarian mar-ket.
The purchase was achieved against strong competition from Reemtsma, the
German tobacco company to which RJR Nabisco lost in the bidding for
Debreceni Dohanygyar, another Hungarian cigarette factory.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded the long-term debt rating of
Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker, citing 'fundamental
weakness' in the company's information systems and electronics operations.
The difficulties facing the business were illustrated by a 37.4 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits to Y128.9bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in the year to
March, mainly due to weak markets for computers and semiconductors.
Moody's said adequate returns on Hitachi's investment in electronics and
information systems would be hampered by excess capacity in semi-conductors,
which could take years to absorb, and by weakening demand for mainframe
computers.
'In consumer products . . . earnings have been suffering, primarily as a
result of market maturation and the lack of major new products,' Moody's
said.
The power and industrial systems division of Hitachi was expected to provide
increases in profits and cash flow in the years ahead, because of growing
demands for equipment.
Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, has been assigned the top credit
ratings for its short-term and long-term debt by the leading international
rating agencies, writes Sara Webb.
Standard &amp; Poor's has assigned an implied long-term triple-A rating and an
implied short-term rating of A1+ to the agency, while Moody's said it
expected to assign a Aaa bond rating to long-term debt issues once it began
its borrowing programme.
Treuhand, the government-owned institution charged with reorganising and
privatising the former east German state-owned assets, currently has about
DM7bn of debt issued in the German commercial paper market, and is able to
draw on a commercial paper programme of DM10bn.
In addition, the agency is expected to borrow outside the German commercial
paper market, possibly tapping the international capital markets, Moody's
said.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM and Microsoft settle PC
software dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM and Microsoft have reached an agreement on software licensing and patent
royalties that resolves a long-running dispute over personal computer
operating system software.
The agreement between IBM and Microsoft has been dubbed a 'divorce
settlement' because it ends almost two years of acrimony which began when
the companies chose different paths towards the development of a new
generation of PC software.
IBM and Microsoft had worked closely together since IBM chose Microsoft's
'DOS' program for its original PC 12 years ago. The companies went on to
collaborate in the development of a new operating system, called OS/2.
However, the first version was a flop and Microsoft chose to pursue
development of its own 'Windows' program while eventually dropping its
efforts to improve OS/2.
Windows has since become become a huge success, with sales of over 10m
copies. IBM, which continued work on OS/2 alone, recently launched a much
improved version of the operating system which, according to IBM, is selling
strongly although in smaller numbers.
Microsoft is expected to launch a new version of Windows, Windows Net
Technology, later this year, that will compete head-on with IBM's OS/2.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chief executive, has been scathing in his criticism
of IBM, while IBM executives, although more restrained, have been unable to
hide their annoyance over the embarrassing split.
The companies have now agreed to license each other to use IBM's OS/2 and
Microsoft's Windows programs until the end of 1993. The companies have also
entered into a long-term patent licensing agreement.
Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Microsoft is believed
to be paying IBM about Dollars 20m for rights to the computer giant's
extensive patent portfolio, which includes basic software technology.
Microsoft is the first large software company to reach a patent
cross-licence agreement with IBM, raising the prospect that IBM may seek
fees from other software publishers.
The battle between Microsoft and IBM has caused confusion among PC buyers
and throughout the PC software industry, so the resolution of the dispute
will benefit all, the companies claimed.
'With these agreements behind us, we will both be free to continue with our
individual business strategies to meet our customers' needs,' said Mr Lee
Reiswig Jr, the IBM executive in charge of personal computer software.
Mr Bernard Pache, the new chief executive of Groupe Bull, the loss-making
French computer manufacturer, yesterday confirmed the company's strategic
alliance with IBM. The US group is paying FFr540m (Dollars 7.51m), or FFr48
a share, for a 5.68 per cent stake in Bull.

<TEXT>
THE LIPPO Group, one of Indonesia's largest banking and insurance
conglomerates, has announced a Rp250bn (Dollars 123m) corporate
restructuring.
In a move similar to that last week by the Salim Group, Indonesia's largest
private conglomerate, large shareholdings in six Lippo Group subsidiaries
are to be transferred to Lippo Pacific Finance (LPF), a quoted company.
LPF, which is to be renamed Lippo Pacific, is to acquire stakes of between
40 per cent and 51 per cent in Lippobank, Lippolife, Lippoland, Lippo
Industries and Multipolar. All are quoted companies in which Mr Mochtar
Riady, the founder of Lippo Group, is a leading shareholder.
Most of the companies were listed in 1989, and only a minority of the shares
are traded publicly.
LPF is also to acquire 100 per cent of Lippo Merchants, a wholly private
finance company.
The Lippo Group has not announced at what price it will make the
acquisitions, but brokers estimate the deal will cost about Rp250bn.
The Lippo Group, which emerged during the 1970s to become Indonesia's fourth
largest conglomerate, with annual turnover of more than Rp1,800bn, has its
headquarters in Jakarta and offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the
US.
Brokers say LPF will finance the acquisitions with a four-for-one rights
issue, which will follow a two-for-one bonus issue.
The Lippo Group says that the deal will boost LPF's capital base and
cashflow.
A leading shareholder in many Lippo Group companies is Mr Soedono Salim, the
founder of the Salim Group which last week undertook a Dollars 848m
restructuring when it transferred ownership of the principal food divisions
to its subsidiary Indocement, Indonesia's largest quoted company.

SAMSUNG and Goldstar, the South Korean conglomerates, will co-operate in
acquiring foreign technology for liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
It is the first time that two South Korean competitors have agreed to share
technology in a cross-licensing agreement. About 8,000 patents are involved,
including those for Braun colour television tubes.
The government hopes the pact between Samsung Electron Devices and Goldstar
will pave the way for agreements among Korean companies in cars, machinery
and aerospace.
Officials have said the lack of co-operation among Korean concerns has
hindered the country's efforts to develop high-technology industries.
Previous attempts to share semiconductor technology have failed, leading to
unnecessary duplication.
Both Samsung and Goldstar believe LCDs will be one of key electronic
technologies of the 1990s. They hope to rival the Japanese, repeating their
success in challenging Japanese semiconductor manufacturers.
Some analysts doubt that the two companies could afford to develop LCD
technology while also spending large sums on the development and production
of semiconductors. The cross-licensing agreement will ease this problem.

Foods

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOODMAN Fielder Wattie (GFW), the Sydney-based food group, has announced a
two-pronged deal worth nearly ADollars 700m (USDollars 526.3m) which will
see it all but quit New Zealand while strongly expanding its international
packaged food brands.
Mr Michael Nugent, managing director, said yesterday the company planned to
sell its New Zealand-based Wattie Foods division through a public flotation
in November, raising about ADollars 350m.
GFW is also acquiring Uncle Tobys, the leading Australian breakfast cereals
group, for ADollars 330m from ICM Australia, a privately-owned Australian
agribusiness group. The price comprises 50m GFW shares at ADollars 1.70 each
together with ADollars 245m in cash.
Mr Nugent said the value of the Wattie flotation, scheduled for late this
year, was based on the company's ungeared assets at June 30. GMF would hold
no interest in Wattie once it was listed on the New Zealand stock exchange.
GFW shares closed up 4 cents at ADollars 1.61 on Australian stock exchanges
yesterday. Analysts view the deals as a continuation of a strategy of
concentrating on core businesses. This follows a chequered recent past which
involved GFW, among other adventures, in unsuccessful takeover bids for
Ranks Hovis McDougall, a UK-based food rival, and Industrial Equity, the
former Australian corporate raider.
Mr Nugent said the two latest deals would be executed independently and were
not conditional on each other.
'Over the past two years, GFW has orchestrated a major planned realignment
of its business mix and operational structure. This realignment has involved
the divestment of ADollars 350m worth of non-core assets and the acquisition
of ADollars 140m worth of core businesses,' he said. 'The company has
developed a smaller number of large, complementary businesses which have
international growth prospects.
'The divestment of non-core assets has enabled GFW to repay debt and reduce
its net gearing ratio from 100 per cent in 1990 to less than 65 per cent
today.'
Mr Nugent added that on completion of the two projects, GFW's gearing ratio
would fall by a further 15 per cent to about 50 per cent. Interest cover
would also improve and other key financial ratios remain well within the
limits set by the company's borrowing covenants.

Airways
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S caretaker government has ordered an investigation into seven
allegations of corruption at Thai Airways International (Thai), the national
airline whose shares are due to start trading on the country's stock
exchange next month.
One of the deals under investigation is Thai's order of Rolls-Royce engines
for a fleet of new Boeing 777s, a choice which government officials said
could increase maintenance costs because the airline normally uses General
Electric or Pratt and Whitney engines.
Thai, which is run as a fiefdom of the air force, has often been accused
privately of making questionable deals and of buying too varied a range of
equipment, but the state's sale of 7 per cent of the airline to the public
earlier this year has led to renewed calls for the company to be managed
more professionally.
Furthermore, the interim government installed this month has publicly
committed itself to reducing the influence of the armed forces in business
and politics.
Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai's chairman, is head of the air force
and military supreme commander, and has been blamed by pro-democracy
demonstrators for the violence in May in which troops shot dead at least 50
protestors. Some employees of Thai have called for his resignation.
The other deals under investigation on the orders of Mr Nukul Prachuabmoh,
the transport and communications minister, are: the sale of six Shorts
aircraft to Bangkok Airways, an airline with links to the military, for less
than the price offered by a rival bidder; waiving Thai's rights to fly to
Cambodia in favour of Bangkok Airways; the lease of a luxury executive
Challenger jet; plans to buy a plot of land from the wife of a senior air
force officer for what is seen as an unusually high price; overpaying for
another plot of land; and buying expensive limousines for executives two
days before the announcement of a cost-cutting programme.
Thai yesterday declined to comment on the allegations, the latest in a
series of blows for the company.
Net profit in the busy first half ended March 31 was only Bt1.2bn (Dollars
47.2m), compared with a forecast in the prospectus for the full year of
Bt5.3bn. The second half began dismally with the political violence in May,
which caused a sharp fall in tourist arrivals and in Thai's passenger loads
on international flights.
The privatisation in March was clouded by suggestions that some of the 100m
shares offered were withheld and sold at a premium over the Bt60 offer price
by senior Thai executives or their associates.
On the grey market, Thai shares rose to about Bt90, but have now fallen back
to be bid at about Bt65, reflecting investors' doubts about Thai's
management and profitability. The shares are due to start trading on July 20
although some brokers fear further delay.

DICKSON Concepts, the Hong Kong-based fashion retailer and wholesaler,
yesterday surprised stock market analysts with a 27 per cent increase in net
profit to HKDollars 281.8m (USDollars 36.6m) for the year to March 1992.
Turnover increased by 9 per cent to HKDollars 2.36bn. Earnings per share
rose to 53.8 cents from 52.7 cents.
Mr Dickson Poon, chairman, said the higher profits resulted from an
across-the-board improvement in trading last year. He forecast significant
growth and further development of Dickson Concepts in the coming year.
A final dividend of 18 cents a share is to be paid, making a total for the
year of 28 cents. Adjusted for the company's one-for-two rights issue last
September, the total dividend payout was up 61 per cent, the company said.
Dickson Concepts also announced a big push into China. It has reached
agreements to distribute ST Dupont, Charles Jourdan and Guy Laroche labels
on the mainland.
More importantly, the company will develop a comprehensive range of men's
and women's fashion products which will be manufactured and sold in the
China market. 'This strategy will undoubtedly make the group a pioneer in
the development of the brandname business in China,' the company said.
Mr Poon said 1991-92 saw a substantial turnround of the company's fortunes
in the UK and Taiwan. In October last year it bought Harvey Nichols, the
London luxury department store, for Pounds 53.7m (USDollars 99.3m) from
Burton Group. The company said the store was now operating profitably.
Dickson Concepts has expanded the retail space available by 20,000 sq ft and
opened another 20,000 sq ft for a specialty food store and two restaurants.
It plans to install real-time information technology systems shortly, and to
launch a collection of Harvey Nichols ladieswear in the UK and Hong Kong
later this year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor group, has filed a patent
infringement lawsuit against Sanyo Electric which, it claims, is using its
semiconductor patents without a licence.
The move follows indications from Sanyo that the Japanese electronics group
was, in turn, preparing to file patent litigation against Texas Instruments
both in the US and Japan.
Sanyo said last week that it would file a lawsuit against the US group
unless it reduced the amount of royalties it was seeking for its patents.
Sanyo's legal counsel has claimed that Texas Instruments' conduct in its
negotiations constitutes patent misuse and anti-trust activity.
The two groups have had a cross-licensing agreement but this expired at the
end of 1990.
At the centre of the trans-Pacific patent disputes are a broad portfolio of
semiconductor patents held by Texas Instruments.
Texas Instruments said it had been in negotiation with Sanyo for more than a
year over extending the two groups' licensing agreement.
The US group, one of the most aggressive companies in seeking royalty
payments for its intellectual property, is also involved in a dispute with
Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and electronics group, over the Kilby patent,
which is a basic patent for the invention of the integrated circuit (IC)
covering all ICs made, used or sold in Japan.
The litigation against Sanyo 'should not have an impact on the case with
Fujitsu', Texas Instruments said. A resolution of the Fujitsu case is
expected by the end of the year.
Texas has, nevertheless, successfully renewed licensing agreements with five
other Japanese companies, it said.
The five companies are Mitsubishi Electric, New Japan Radio, Nippon
Precision Circuit, Seiko Epson and Toko.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the US aircraft manufacturer, is to go ahead with the
co-production of 40 narrow-body commercial jetliners with the China National
Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, following Chinese government
approval of a Dollars 1.2bn joint venture contract.
The Chinese deal, in which McDonnell Douglas managed to beat a rival
proposal from Boeing, was being hailed yesterday by Mr John McDonnell,
chairman of McDonnell Douglas, as a major victory.
The deal calls for 20 147-seat MD-80 and 20 158-seat MD-90 twin jets to be
assembled in Shanghai, with many parts manufactured in the People's Republic
of China (PRC). The first deliveries are due to begin in 1995.
But McDonnell Douglas was, meanwhile, seeking to play down reports that a
key element of its planned Far Eastern expansion plans - its prospects of
concluding a separate accord involving a strategic alliance with Taiwan
Aerospace - was in jeopardy.
The Taiwan alliance plans stem from a memorandum of understanding signed
last November with Taiwan Aerospace in which the 29 per cent
government-owned company would pay Dollars 2bn for a stake of up to 40 per
cent in the Douglas commercial aircraft business.
Last month, Taiwan Aerospace appeared to be seeking to scale back the
planned accord amid concerns on the part of Taiwan legislators over the US
company's financial position and declining share of the commercial airline
market.
Yesterday, McDonnell Douglas said: 'As far as we are concerned the
proposition is very much alive. We expect to go forward with an agreement
with people in Taiwan. We are going to continue to talk with potential
Taiwan investors.' But the company did not say whether its discussions might
include investors other than Taiwan Aerospace.
It is believed that Taiwan Aerospace is seeking to play a lesser role in a
possible deal with McDonnell Douglas, which needs cash from an equity sale
to fund the development of it new MD-12 jumbo aircraft.

THE MEXICAN government has sold 51 per cent of Banco Internacional for
1,487bn pesos (Dollars 475m) to an investor group headed by shareholders in
Prime, a leading Mexican stockbroker.
Banco Internacional is the 17th to be sold by the Mexican government in just
over 12 months, and brings the total proceeds from the privatisations to
36,600bn pesos. Bids for the last bank to be sold, Banco del Centro, are due
on Friday, with the winner likely to be announced on Sunday.
The successful privatisation may boost confidence in the Mexican stock
market, which has suffered sharp falls for two weeks. On Thursday, Grupo
Banamex-Accival, comprising Mexico's largest bank, postponed a USDollars 1bn
global share offering for 220m 'C' shares, after the price per 'C' share had
slipped from an original 22,400 pesos to 16,600.
Prime outbid two other groups in the auction and paid 2.95 times book value
and 12.32 times prospective earnings for 1992. It will form an integrated
financial group, housing the bank, brokerage, and other financial
intermediaries.
Banco Internacional is Mexico's fifth-largest bank, with assets of 25,000bn
pesos, 5.8 per cent of the total, and annual profits to May of 123.69bn
pesos. The bank was one of the last to be sold because of its poor
capital-asset ratio, bad loan portfolio, and small deposit base. Recently,
provisions for bad loans have been made, and the capital-asset ratio has
improved.

ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, is increasing its stake in
its mobile telephone joint venture with General Electric of the US from 60
to 80 per cent. Terms of the deal, which involves a restructuring of
investments in Ericsson GE Mobile Communications, were not disclosed.
The two companies agreed to join forces in August 1989 when Ericsson took a
60 per cent stake and GE the remaining 40 per cent. Ericsson said yesterday
that it was 'a natural step' to increase its share as mobile telephones are
closely associated with the company's core business.
It pointed out that over the past two-and-a-half-years the market share for
the company in mobile telephone systems in the North American market had
risen from 25 to 30 per cent. Ericsson added that this had been helped by
the 'great success' of the new generation digital dual-made mobile
telephones.

<TEXT>
DOW CORNING, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, the
glassware company, hopes to sell most of the assets of its medical devices
business, except for assets related to its discontinued production of
silicone breast implants, by the end of the year.
Dow Corning expects its revenues - which come mainly from the manufacture of
artificial knees, hips and other metal orthopedic devices - to be about
Dollars 100m in 1992.
A buyer will be asked to take on 525 Dow Corning employees in Arlington,
Tennessee.
The production of breast implants, which was at the centre of a controversy
over safety earlier this year, was discontinued in January during a review
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dow Corning withdrew completely
from the breast implant business in March.
Dow Corning said the decision to sell its medical devices business was 'part
of our ongoing strategic review.' The company said it primary expertise had
come from materials innovation rather than fabrication and distribution.
Last year, Dow Corning made a net profit of Dollars 152.9m on turnover of
Dollars 1.8bn.

protection

<TEXT>
ERCROS, Spain's biggest chemicals company and the industrial flagship of the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in the country, may be forced to file for
protection from its creditors before the end of this week.
The group's board, in an emergency meeting in Barcelona yesterday, again
failed to solve its deepening debt crisis. Ercros employs 10,500, and a
collapse would be one of the biggest-ever corporate failures in Spain.
Ercros, which lost Pta16bn (Dollars 161.6m) last year, owes Dollars 2bn to
banks and suppliers and some of its fertiliser plants have recently had
their gas and electricity supplies cut off.
About Dollars 500m of the debt matures this year, and KIO, which controls 40
per cent of the group, has refused to make an emergency injection of Dollars
250m without the state making new capital available.
Madrid, however, has said it is legally unable to make new subsidies
available to Ercros.
The talks yesterday revolved around two proposals. KIO is insisting on an
immediate suspension of debt repayment while Mr Jose Piquet, Ercros's
managing director, is understood to be looking for an 'extra judicial'
solution. This would involve major shareholders and the government
restructuring Ercros's capital and later informal debt negotiations with
creditor banks.
The situation is complicated by an earlier agreement between Ercros and the
US commodities group, Freeport-McMoRan, under which Freeport was to invest
fresh capital into Ercros's fertiliser and mining divisions.
Madrid may at least be prepared to honour Pta10bn of debt guarantees and it,
too, is pressing KIO not to suspend payments in order to allow the Freeport
deal to go ahead quickly.
People close to the negotiations say, however, that KIO, as the largest
shareholder, will probably get its way and force a protection filing.
One last effort to avoid this will be made today when KIO and Ercros
officials meet Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, in Madrid.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Shake-up at O&amp;K after takeover
of Hoesch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Orenstein &amp; Koppel (O&amp;K), one of the most famous names in
German engineering, has been resolved after months of uncertainty caused by
the takeover of Hoesch, its parent company.
Plans to reorganise O&amp;K will be unveiled tomorrow in Dortmund, a week after
Hoesch shareholders gave the green light to the takeover by Krupp, its
German steel rival.
Fried Krupp Hoesch-Krupp is to retain the 75 per cent stake in O&amp;K
previously held by Hoesch. The remaining shares are widely held and publicly
quoted in Germany.
O&amp;K will lose its heavy plant and systems division, which will be combined
with its counterpart at Krupp.
This could lead to rationalisation in the combined plant businesses, which
overlap heavily. The deal unites the world's two dominant producers of
equipment such as large bucket-wheel excavators used in open cast mining.
O&amp;K will be left as a producer of excavators, loaders and other equipment
used in construction and mining, and as a big producer of escalators.
The resolution of O&amp;K's future comes after months of negotiations involving
Krupp, Hoesch, Mannesmann - the German engineering and electronics group,
its Mannesmann Demag heavy equipment business, and O&amp;K itself.
Demag and O&amp;K came very close to a co-operation deal in construction
equipment, but talks broke down about a month ago.
Mr Brian Brock, managing director of O&amp;K Orenstein &amp; Koppel in the UK, said
the end of the uncertainty was a great relief.
O&amp;K's construction and mining equipment business has been under pressure for
many years, due partly to the industry's overcapacity but also to losses in
the mining division.
Mr Brock said he was convinced O&amp;K had a future as an independent entity
with its new, financially-strong parent.

   VALDAGNO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARZOTTO, Italy's largest textile and clothing group, which bought Hugo Boss
of Germany in December 1991, expects an improvement in operating profit this
year.
The upturn should come in spite of the continuing slowdown in demand in most
main markets and the relatively high production costs facing Italian
manufacturers, said Mr Pietro Marzotto, chairman.
He forecast that efficiency improvements and cost-savings undertaken in
recent months would allow the group to improve its operating results,
adjusted for recent acquisitions and disposals, and generate a free
cash-flow which would 'certainly be better' than 1991. The improvement would
come despite the sharp rise in net indebtedness caused by the Hugo Boss
acquisition.
However, Mr Marzotto was reluctant to give any indication on net profits for
1992 or whether the group would restore the dividend, which was cut by 20
per cent last year. The outlook for net earnings, which fell by 12 per cent
at group level, to L39.8bn (Dollars 34m) last year was clouded by market
factors, notably sales by Hugo Boss in the final quarter, the company's key
period.
Mr Marzotto revealed that the group was continuing its strategy of selling
non-core activities.

VYMURA International, which makes vinyl-covered wallpapers in Greater
Manchester, has been bought by its management for Pounds 15.5m.
The buy-out secures 360 jobs because four rival bidders would probably have
rationalised production had any outbid the management team.
The company, which as Western Hyde Products developed the first stripable
vinyl wallpaper 30 years ago, was owned by European Vinyls Corporation, a
Brussels-based joint venture between ICI and Enichem of Italy. With sales of
Pounds 30m, Vymura was not big enough to be of strategic significance to
EVC.
Barclays Development Capital provided Pounds 5.5m of equity for the deal,
with the balance from Midland Bank as long-term loan and overdraft.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morland to buy 72 pubs from Inntrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer facing a hostile Pounds 101m bid
from Greene King, has agreed to buy 72 pubs for Pounds 16.9m from
Inntrepreneur Estates, the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture.
The deal, which would increase Morland's estate by about 25 per cent to 350
pubs, is conditional on Greene King's offer lapsing or being withdrawn.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland's chief executive, said the acquisition would
benefit the company's brewing, wholesaling and retailing operations. 'It
further enhances our excellent prospects as an independent company', he
added
The pubs, mostly let on 20-year leases at market rents, would extend
Morland's trading area in south-east England and make a substantial
contribution to profits in the first year.
'This further development in our business, following the trading agreement
with Courage and distribution agreements with Boddington and Everards, makes
us even more certain that the Greene King bid is too low,' Mr Clutterbuck
said.
Morland will finance the acquisition from existing cash resources and
committed bank facilities. Net borrowings will be contained at about 26 per
cent of shareholders' funds and the company does not plan to increase its
gearing significantly above that level.
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King chairman, described the deal yesterday as 'the
latest in a series of flawed actions by an increasingly desperate board'.
He added: 'Morland clearly regards a quick fix as a substitute for a sound
commercial strategy.'

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cold comfort from Alaska for BP - The
problems facing the UK oil company's US subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE boardroom upheaval at British Petroleum last week came at a difficult
time not only for the group, but especially for BP America, the US
subsidiary that is examining ways to reverse its flagging performance.
BP America, whose Alaskan oil fields last year provided more than half of
BP's worldwide crude oil production of 1.36m barrels, is of critical
importance to group strategy for a number of reasons.
Not only are the Alaskan oil fields one of the most valuable assets owned by
any British company outside the UK, but some 47 per cent of total BP oil and
gas reserves are in the US.
Operating profit from the US, before stockholding gains and losses and
interest expenses, was Pounds 1.04bn last year - the single biggest con-
tributor to the group figure of Pounds 2.6bn and more than twice the level
generated in the UK. Of the Pounds 1.04bn US profit, some Pounds 988m came
from oil production, mainly in Alaska.
Unfortunately, BP America's 1991 operating profit was 29 per cent lower than
the previous year, due mainly to sharply lower refining and marketing
earnings, losses from the chemicals division and a decline in Alaskan output
income that Wall Street analysts say is destined to continue throughout the
1990s.
Worse still, energy sector analysts in the US are almost universal in
predicting a gloomy outlook for BP America - in terms of profits - for the
next couple of years.
The Cleveland-based operation has also been harshly criticised by several
analysts who perceive a reversal in strategy on the downstream (refining and
marketing) side of the business and an almost inevitable decline in the
amount of cash that will be thrown off by the all-important Alaskan
operation.
Problems in the US are nothing new for BP. Indeed it was Mr Robert Horton,
ousted as chairman last Thursday, who was despatched in 1986 to Cleveland to
clean house and plot a new strategic thrust.
Mr Horton slashed employee numbers and within a year of arriving helped
engineer the Dollars 7.7bn purchase of the remaining 45 per cent of Standard
Oil of Ohio (Sohio) that BP did not already own. The Sohio link had been
forged back in 1969 when BP traded its Alaskan oil interest for an initial
25 per cent of the Ohio company that was originally founded as John D
Rockefeller's sprawling Standard Oil Trust.
Just before the Sohio refining and marketing business was melded with the
Alaskan oil operation and transformed into BP America, British managers
forced Sohio to take a Dollars 1.4bn writedown on half of its exploration
leases, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. BP later also unloaded Kennecott
Copper, which was bought by Sohio in 1981.
Then, armed with a network of 8,000 petrol stations, two thirds of which
were former Gulf Oil outlets acquired in 1985, BP America proceeded with an
ambitious expansion strategy that was aimed at creating an integrated US
energy business.
A central pillar of this strategy was an attempt to correct the geographic
imbalance that stemmed from having a huge crude oil output from Alaska, but
refining operations located in faraway places such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and
Louisiana.
By October 1988, after Mr Horton had already returned to London as a
managing director, the effort moved ahead with the Dollars 152m purchase of
a Mobil refinery in Washington state and a campaign to bolster west coast
downstream operations including a network of petrol stations in California.
The west coast strategy came crashing down just four weeks ago, when BP, as
part of its asset disposal plans, put both its California and Florida
filling stations up for sale. A further element of the shift came just 24
hours before Mr Horton's ousting last week, when US job cuts included not
only half of the Cleveland headquarters staff, but up to 500 positions on
the refining and marketing side.
'BP's American strategy,' says Mr Frank Knuettel, an energy analyst at
Prudential Securities, 'has been changing more rapidly than the guard at
Buckingham Palace'.
'The foray into the west coast has met with disaster,' opines Mr Michael
Young, a BP watcher at Smith Barney in New York.
Rising costs related to the need to upgrade BP refineries in light of the
Clean Air Act in the US - which are estimated by analysts at between Dollars
800m and Dollars 1bn between now and 1997 - are one factor making for the
gloomy outlook. Another is the depressed state of margins on this side of
the business.
Nor is the outlook from Alaska especially rosy.
Mr John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation,
notes that as the largest single producer of Alaskan oil 'BP is obviously
here to stay and will continue to be a major force in the US oil market.'
While no one questions the importance of Alaska, BP America acknowledges
that output from Prudhoe Bay is declining by 10 per cent a year. By the end
of the 1990s, output is likely to have fallen from its 1991 level of 717,000
barrels a day to less than 200,000 a day.
In addition, BP's hopes of extending the life of it Alaskan investment by
drilling in the nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - the last potential
major field left in North America - have been on hold since the Exxon Valdez
oil spill disaster in 1989.
Unit operating costs in Alaska are meanwhile rising as the decline in output
continues.
This leads Mr Knuettel to a pessimistic overall assessment that is shared by
other analysts: 'BP America today is not particularly different from Sohio
prior to the 1987 takeover - except that now their main source of income is
decelerating and the Clean Air Act is going to be very costly to them.'
Against this backdrop, BP group directors are expected to be presented
shortly with a series of US options.
The underlying problem appears to be that there are no easy solutions for BP
America because it is hard to identify current businesses that can be grown
without an acquisition or a scale of investment in the US that the BP group
debt burden may well preclude.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bibby raised offer poised to clinch Spanish
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the UK industrial and agricultural conglomerate, is finally
poised to acquire Finanzauto following a new bid that has raised the value
of Spain's sole Caterpillar distributor by 13 per cent to Pta15.9bn (Pounds
86.2m).
Mr Jose Antonio Gonzalez, Finanzauto's chief executive, said yesterday that
the company would drop its two month long hostility to Bibby's bid at an
extraordinary meeting scheduled for yesterday evening.
Finanzauto's decision to adopt a neutral position brings to an end one of
the roughest foreign takeovers of a Spanish company.
Madrid analysts said yesterday that the change of stance by Finanzauto paved
the way for Bibby to acquire the greater part of the equity at the increased
offer price of Pta1,500 (800p) per share.
To Finanzauto's extreme irritation, Bibby, which is owned by Barlow Rand of
South Africa, had originally valued Finanzauto at Pounds 75m in late April
and had offered Pta1,300 per share to the Spanish company's fragmented
equity holders.
Claiming that the value of the company's stock was closer to Pta1,700,
Finanzauto mounted a stiff defence, which included the strategy of newspaper
announcements that is unusual for Spain.
After a series of angry exchanges over Finanzauto's true worth, the UK
company grudgingly raised its bid two weeks ago.
The new offer represents a p/e multiple of 22 on Finanzauto's 1991
consolidated profits. These fell to Pounds 4.8m from Pounds 11.4m in 1990.
Mr Paul Farrow, head of research at FG Inversiones Bursatiles, the Madrid
brokers, said Bibby 'got cold feet' when its first pricing raised a storm
and the UK group had been forced, 'as a foreign company bidding in a foreign
market', into raising the offer.
Analysts believe that Bibby may have paid too much from the point of view of
a stock market investor, but that the final price could be justified as a
long term industrial investment.
Finanzauto is suffering the consequences of a deep recession in the Spanish
construction sector, but it has close to 25 per cent of the domestic earth
moving market.
Its chief rival, which imports JCB equipment, is understood to be in a
critical position after sustaining far heavier losses.
Bibby has nevertheless requested Madrid's stock market commission to
investigate Finanzauto's share price movements over the past two months.
When trading in Finanzauto's stock ceased after the announcement of Bibby's
original bid, the company was quoted at Pta1,075 per share.
Subsequently there was heavy buying, which pushed the share price over
Pta1,300, when trading recommenced and just before Bibby announced its
improved bid.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Carclo shows 30% decline to Pounds 5.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARCLO Engineering Group reported a 30 per cent fall in annual profits after
a tough trading year but maintained its final dividend.
Mr John Ewart, chairman, said that the order intake in the last three months
was higher than in the corresponding period last year and that sales had
stopped falling. This period in 1991 immediately followed the Gulf conflict
when orders were affected.
'We expected not very good results and we got not very good results,' Mr
Ewart said. 'But having had sales 7 per cent lower last year, which reduces
profits by a multiple of 7 per cent, order intake is now up.'
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 8.04m to Pounds 5.63m on sales of Pounds
78.8m (Pounds 85m). Earnings per share also fell 30 per cent, to 9.6p. A
recommended final dividend of 6.1p gives an unchanged 7.81p for the year.
The outcome was struck after a Pounds 1.17m exceptional charge to cover the
transfer of a business and further redundancy costs. In addition the group
took an increased extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.29m, net of tax, to cover
the write down in the value of businesses up for sale and the write off of
relating goodwill.
All Carclo's main divisions suffered during the year. Sales in the card
clothing division were 5 per cent down and operating profits fell 23 per
cent to Pounds 2.23m.
General engineering sales were 10 per cent lower and operating profits fell
21 per cent to Pounds 1.98m.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: In Shops considers bid for troubled Amber
Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SHOPS, the Birmingham-based stores group, yesterday said it was
considering making a bid for Amber Day, the discount retailer which has
recently seen its share price collapse.
Amber Day's shares yesterday rose 33p to 51p, giving the group a market
value of Pounds 62m - well down on November's peak of Pounds 158m. In Shop's
shares closed 10p lower at 74p, valuing it at Pounds 27m.
The contrast in size between the two companies means that In Shops would
need considerable support from the City to make a successful bid. However,
Mr Tim Brookes, chairman, said he had not approached the Amber Day board and
would not launch a bid without making further inquiries.
Shares in Amber Day have fallen sharply following persistent criticism
concerning Mr Philip Green, the group's flamboyant chairman and chief
executive. They were also hit by a profits warning and the simultaneous
departure of the group's finance director and only non-executive director.
Mr Green is expected to appoint a finance director this week and intends to
split his role with a new chairman.
In Shops was outbid by Amber Day two years ago when they both sought What
Everyone Wants, the discount retail chain which now accounts for most of
Amber Day's business.
Mr Brookes said: 'We believe the underlying business is sound and just needs
the credibility at the top which we think we can provide.'
Meanwhile, In Shops blamed the unexpected severity of the recession for a
drop in its pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.8m in the year to
March 31. Turnover rose to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 21.3m), boosted by the
opening of several new retail centres, where it rents out units to small
retailers.
In spite of a drop in earnings per share from 7.3p to 5.3p, the final
dividend goes up by 10 per cent to 1.97p, giving a total of 2.63p (2.45p).
The group had net cash of Pounds 3.3m at the year-end.
Mr Brookes said: 'I believe that trading conditions will remain extremely
tough for some considerable time and the end of the recession is not in
view. We are planning our business for the prevailing economic conditions
because in so doing we will make it stronger and more able to enjoy an
economic recovery if it comes.'

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Buckingham plans to raise Pounds 30m in
wake of plunge into losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM International, the hotels, tours and nursing homes operator,
yesterday announced plans to raise about Pounds 30m in the wake of a plunge
into pre-tax losses for the year to November 3 and static losses for the six
months to May 3.
Mr Nick Jivraj, chief executive, said Buckingham, having breached its
banking covenants, had the option of either 'a firesale of the company's
non-income producing assets' or a refinancing.
The company is to issue for cash Pounds 33m nominal of secured redeemable
loan stock 1995 at par and 23.1m convertible deferred shares at 0.14p.
Mr Jivraj said that the Pounds 30m net proceeds would: pay off Pounds 19m of
bank loans; provide working capital; give the company a three-year breathing
space in which to sell the non-income producing assets; and allow the
completion of the apartment complex in Portugal.
The Gulf war had caught Buckingham with a third of its room stock under
development and Mr Jivraj said that the conflict had an immediate and
detrimental effect on its hotel operations. Cash dried up and covenants were
heavily breached - particularly those relating to interest cover.
Jivraj family interests and investment trusts under the management of Robert
Fleming will take up all their entitlements in the placing. The family
interests will be putting up about Pounds 18m of the Pounds 33m raised and
loan stockholders will end up with 73 per cent of the enlarged equity.
In the year to November 3, turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 49.1m (Pounds
37m), although operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 6.17m (Pounds
7.04m). However a jump in interest to Pounds 4.92m (Pounds 1.14m) and
exceptional charges of Pounds 9.47m - write-down of assets of Pounds 8m and
loan renegotiation fees of Pounds 1.5m - left pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.21m
(profits Pounds 5.9m). Losses per share worked through at 7.01p (earnings
5.4p) and the final dividend is omitted, as the interim had been. The
previous year's total was 2.1p.
Borrowings had risen by Pounds 24.2m over the year to Pounds 81.2m, giving
gearing of 82 per cent.
In the six months to May 3 turnover advanced 40 per cent to Pounds 21.9m
(Pounds 15.6m) reflecting first-time trading from the Holiday Inn Crowne
Plaza in Lisbon and two hotels in San Antonio, Texas. Operating profits
almost trebled to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 440,000). However, pre-tax losses
crept up to Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.15m) after interest charges more than
doubled at Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 1.73m).
Losses per share were 1.84p (1.78p) and Mr Jivraj said the company would not
resume dividend payments until after a substantial disposal.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mosaic makes Pounds 10.4m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mosaic Investments is to sell the bulk of its engineering and automotive
division for Pounds 10.4m cash in a management buy out.
The management team, comprising certain Mosaic subsidiary directors, is
supported by equity funding arranged by Midland Montagu Ventures and
co-underwritten by County NatWest Ventures.
Mosaic said the sale would substantially reduce its current high level of
borrowings and materially increase net assets.
The engineering and automotive division consists mainly of Press Tools
Holdings and T Turner, but Stainless Steel Services, which forms only a
small part of the division, is not presently being sold.
Although trading conditions generally continue to be difficult, Mosaic
expects that results for the year to April 30 1992 - due late next month -
will be in line with market expectations.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tighter margins behind Pounds 55m deficit
at British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER DEMAND and continuing excess capacity worldwide lie behind yesterday's
announcement by British Steel of a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for 1991-92, a 9
per cent fall in turnover, and a final dividend cut from 5.75p to 1.5p.
The year ended March 28 was a testing one, said the company, with big
reductions in selling prices in most product areas. Turnover fell from
Pounds 5.04bn to Pounds 4.59bn, reflecting the lower prices, although
deliveries of steel products were stable at 12.2m tonnes and exports from
the UK rose from 4.9m tonnes to 5.6m.
The overall effect on costs of inflation and exchange rates was virtually
neutral, but severe price competition cut deeply into margins, more than
offsetting the significant benefits from cost reduction and improved
operating efficiency.
Trading profit dropped from Pounds 323m to Pounds 17m but, after exceptional
and other items, British Steel had a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss compared with a
profit of Pounds 254m in 1990-91. Exceptional items of Pounds 100m (Pounds
192m) related largely to the closure of the Ravenscraig steel plant in
Scotland but included a provision for future cost reduction measures.
After tax and minorities, the loss attributable to shareholders was Pounds
34m, compared with a profit of Pounds 193m. Losses per share were 1.7p,
against earnings of 9.65p a year earlier.
In the UK, British Steel said, the economy was particularly weak, causing
demand for the company's main products to fall 11 per cent to 9m tonnes.
This represents a 22 per cent fall from the peak year of 1988-89. UK market
share slipped last year to 56 per cent from 57 per cent in 1990-91.
The cut in the final dividend reduced the annual pay-out to 4.5p (8.75p) and
reflects uncertainties about the projected economic background and concern
about the timing of the recovery.
Sir Robert Scholey, chairman, reminded shareholders of his statement at the
half-year stage that a marked improvement in trading prospects would be
needed to keep an appropriate balance between operating cash flows,
investment requirements, the cost of continuing rationalisation, the payment
of dividends and the need to maintain a robust capital base.
'As yet,' he said yesterday, 'the timing of recovery in the UK is uncertain
and any such recovery could be overshadowed by the reduction in demand in
other major markets, especially mainland Europe, and the prevailing level of
world steel prices.'
Given the severity of trading conditions, he added, the preservation of cash
was of great importance. Accordingly, the capital investment programme has
been cut to Pounds 200m in 1992-93, with spending limited to finishing big
schemes in progress, together with environmental and essential small schemes
focused on cost-cutting with quick paybacks.
On the outlook, the company said difficult conditions were expected to
persist throughout 1992-93. While steel demand in the European Community was
likely to remain flat, all producers recognised the need to improve selling
prices.
British Steel said it would continue to reduce costs, improve product
quality, streamline further its management procedures and look to develop
more attractive relationships between the steel mills, distribution outlets
and customers.
As for the balance sheet, the company said it remained strong. Net
borrowings at the year-end were Pounds 11m, against net funds of Pounds 342m
at the start of the year. The movement of Pounds 353m included capital
spending of Pounds 255m (Pounds 459m in 1990-91).

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs push Lovell into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YJ LOVELL Holdings yesterday showed the darker side of UK construction and
housebuilding after Berkeley Group's sparkling results, writes Andrew
Taylor.
The group, which at the beginning of this year had to renegotiate its
banking facilities, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.49m during the six
months to end-March.
The losses included exceptional provisions of Pounds 2.37m to cover the
legal and professional costs of restructuring its finances and redundancy
arrangements.
The agreement with the banks runs until December when the group will needto
renew or renegotiatea new deal over loan arrangements.
Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said yesterday that the company had kept
within the terms of the agreement negotiated in January and had managed to
fund interest payments out of cash flow without recourse to further
borrowing.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said: 'We could say that we are no longer a
stretcher case but are among the walking wounded.'
Group debt, including off-balance sheet financing, was 10 per cent lower
than at the corresponding stage although still higher than the Pounds 111.4m
announced in September.
Lovell had hoped that debts would have been lower by this stage but sales of
properties were taking longer than had been expected.
The group, which made losses per share of 1.8p against restated earnings of
1.9p last time, said that there was still no sign of any improvement in the
housing and commercial property market despite a brief flurry of interest in
house sales immediately after the general election.
During the period under review the housing and commercial property division
made a loss of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.14m loss). The construction division,
which would have been profitable but for a near Pounds 1.5m loss from plant
hire, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 1.16m profit).
COMMENT
The question analysts were asking themselves yesterday was not what level of
losses Lovell might make this year but whether it will generate sufficient
cash from its hard pressed divisions to keep the bankers at bay and ensure
its survival. Contracting should continue to generate cash although less
than previously. Plant hire, the group says, is broadly cash neutral
although losses seem likely to continue. The US housing investments have
also reached the stage where they are starting to generate a cash return.
That leaves the British housing and commercial property division where the
group needs badly to generate sales. Shareholders with nowhere to bail out
have no choice but to stick with it even though losses this year could be
anywhere between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie launches Pounds 27.6m bid for
Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TAKEOVER battle broke out yesterday in the motor sector when T Cowie
launched a Pounds 27.6m bid for rival Henlys Group. Henlys rapidly rejected
the offer.
The bid could presage other takeovers as motor dealers are expected to seek
acquisition opportunities in the wake of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report in February which recommended that the UK's system of franchised
dealers should be allowed to continue largely unchanged.
On Wednesday Henlys saw its shares fall 22p to 55p after it warned that
problems in its coach and bus building business would result in an interim
loss. The shares rebounded yesterday, closing at 78p, up 21p.
Cowie's bid of one new share for every two Henlys shares, is worth 73p per
Henlys share with Cowie's shares closing at 146p, down 2p. Brokers said
Henlys' share price suggested that Cowie would have to raise its offer or
that another bidder would come in. They said Cowie might have to offer a
cash alternative as well.
Cowie also forecast a one-third increase in its interim dividend to 2p.
Analysts are forecasting profits of Pounds 23m for the year, up from Pounds
18.2m in 1991. Henlys is expected to incur a loss in 1992 of about Pounds
2.5m compared with a Pounds 6.8m loss in 1991.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, Cowie chief executive, said his company had been looking
at Henlys for some time before the profit warning but the share price had
been too high. He said there was a good fit between the groups in three
areas - motor dealerships, bus and coach distribution and bus and coach
leasing.
Mr Robert Wood, Henlys chief executive, condemned the bid as derisory,
unsolicited and unwelcome. He said Henlys, which recently changed its name
from Plaxton, had only one problem area which the management was attacking
in a resolute way.
The bid was 'well off the mark' when net assets were 126p a share, he said.
Cowie is being advised by Noble Grossart, Henlys by Charterhouse and Hill
Samuel.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Berkeley builds up to Pounds 12.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY GROUP yesterday vied for the title of Britain's top performing
housebuilder when it announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m for the year
to the end of April, compared with just Pounds 925,000 last time.
The company also recommended increasing its final dividend from 3p to 3.5p,
making a total of 5p (4.5p) for the year.
Few British housebuilders will be able to report any increase in profits,
let alone one of such magnitude, during one of the worst years the industry
has experienced.
The absence of provisions against falling property values which cost
Berkeley Pounds 760,000 at the corresponding stage last year helped earnings
per share rise from 0.3p to 13.6p.
Group turnover advanced from Pounds 99.7m to Pounds 126m. Housebuilding
profits increased from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 11.2m as the group took
advantage of its strong financial position to buy lower priced land.
Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, said the average cost of a site for each
house sold last year was Pounds 35,000 compared with Pounds 55,000 during
the previous 12 months, boosting net margins to 10 per cent.
'Buying land is never easy but this is the best market I have known in my 16
years in the business,' said Mr Pidgley. 'We recently paid Pounds 1m for a
site near Heathrow airport with room for about 400 homes.'
The number of homes sold by the group increased by almost three quarters
from 491 to 858. Average sale prices fell from Pounds 204,000 to Pounds
147,000, due mainly to distortion caused by the inclusion, since September,
of St George as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
St George, formerly 50 per cent owned by Speyhawk, the troubled property
development group, builds mainly lower priced social housing in London.
The construction of homes largely for housing associations remains one of
the few growth sectors in the market, and St George last year made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 3m (Pounds 1.6m).
Berkeley has also been seeking to invest in commercial property while prices
are at basement levels, and its joint venture with Saad Investments of the
Middle East has so far spent Pounds 65m.
COMMENT
The secret of investment is getting the timing right and Berkeley, during
the last few years, has got it right in spades. The decision in 1989 to
liquidate land holdings and work in progress means that the group's gearing
today, is just 2 per cent - leaving it admirably placed to take advantage of
distressed land and property sales by others less well placed. There can be
few companies better sited to take advantage when the recovery in the
housing market finally gets under way. Profits - given any sort of following
wind - should top Pounds 20m this year. At Pounds 22m, this would put the
group on a prospective p/e of just under 12 - definitely an under-rated
stock given ratings elsewhere in the sector.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams shares dive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Heywood Williams yesterday dived by 41p to 288p after the UK's
largest glass distributor became the latest company to warn of lower profits
due to the deepening recession in the building industry.
The company said that as a result it would be unable to increase its interim
dividend which would be held at 4.5p.
Shares of other construction related companies fell following the
announcement, as concern continued to mount over the extent of the downturn
in UK construction markets.
Mr Ralph Hincliffe, Heywood's chairman, said trading conditions in the UK
building materials market had continued to deteriorate and profits for the
second quarter would be well below those of last year. Pre-tax profits for
the first six months would be in the region of Pounds 5m (Pounds 8.1m).

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Stainless steel deal with Avesta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AVESTA, the Swedish steel company, and British Steel announced yesterday
they intend to create Europe's largest stainless steel group through the
merger of almost all their stainless steel production facilities and
distribution networks in a Pounds 199m deal.
The new company, called Avesta Sheffield with headquarters in Stockholm,
will have initially an annual turnover of about SKr12.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn),
production of 600,000 tonnes of stainless steel a year and employ 9,000
people. Net assets are valued at Pounds 547m.
It is hoped to begin operations by the end of the year. But this is subject
to the deal being approved by the European Commission and Avesta
shareholders.
Under the deal British Steel will hold 40 per cent of the equity in the new
company while the other main shareholders are Swedish companies which hold a
majority stake in Avesta - NCC, the Swedish construction group, with 25.1
per cent; Axel Johnson, the trading company, with 7.5 per cent; and AGA, the
industrial gases group, with 7.2 per cent.
The group's first chief executive will be Mr Per Molin, currently Avesta's
chief executive. Mr David Grieves, British Steel vice-chairman, will chair
the company.
The merger will involve Avesta issuing 55.3m new shares worth Pounds 164m to
British Steel in return for its stainless steel business.
In addition, British Steel will receive a 5 per cent loan note amounting to
Pounds 35m from the new group repayable in instalments over the next four
years.
British Steel's stainless operations had turnover of Pounds 458m last year,
60 per cent from outside the UK. It has production plants in Sheffield and
Panteg, south Wales, and distribution facilities in the UK, continental
Europe and North America.
Avesta, with sales of Pounds 697m, last year is solely a stainless steel
producer.
Mr Molin said Avesta Sheffield should benefit from an annual Pounds 40m
costs savings by the middle of the 1990s. He said there would be a 'sharp
cut' in the cost per ton of stainless steel produced.
The stainless steel market is forecast to grow at an annual 4 per cent in
the 1990s after a 5-6 per cent increase in the late 1980s.
Mr Molin emphasised that the new company would benefit from having a strong
capital base, a wide sales organisation around the world, the high
utilisation of production capacity, and a complementary product range.

FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Jack Chia in two-tier bid for Boustead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON yesterday witnessed a novel attempt by a company to gain a stock
market listing when Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company,
announced a two-tier recommended cash offer for Boustead, the languishing
industrial trading group.
Mr Jack Chia, the chairman who already owned 29.4 per cent of Boustead and
is on its board, said he planned to become a majority shareholder and use
the London quote as the plank from which to expand his group in Europe.
Sir Thomas Macpherson, Boustead chairman, said shareholders who sold all
their shares were being offered a 'fair' price that valued the group at
Pounds 20.2m.
Boustead shareholders are also, however, being offered what Sir Thomas
called an 'attractive' higher price for selling only some of their stake and
staying with Mr Chia as he develops his group's interests in confectionery
manufacture, property and book publishing and distribution.
The novelty lies in the pricing of the two tier offer. Jack Chia-MPH is
offering 38p for the first 60 per cent of shares held in Boustead; this
represents a 52 per cent premium over the 25p price prevailing in the market
before the bid was announced yesterday.
For their remaining shares, Boustead shareholders are being offered only
20p. Shareholders who choose not to go along for the ride will therefore
exit at an average 30.8p, some 25.7 per cent above the closing price on
Friday.
Shareholders who sell only 60 per cent of their stake effectively retain the
other 40 per cent at a price equivalent to about 5.5p.
Early yesterday Jack Chia-MPH raised its stake by 0.6 per cent to 30 per
cent, triggering a mandatory offer. Mr Chia bought a 22 per cent stake in
Boustead in 1989 at about 70p.
Should the offer go unconditional, Jack Chia-MPH will also have to bid for
the 34.6 per cent of the shares in Bousteadco, Boustead's listed subsidiary
in Singapore, which it does not already own. That offer would be
unconditional at a price of SDollars 1.271 per share in cash and would value
Bousteadco at Pounds 13.7m.
Shareholders will also be asked to 'help ensure the offer becomes
unconditional' by agreeing to elect for a so-called 'participation
election'. While agreeing to accept the cash offer for 60 per cent of their
holdings, they will be asked to indicate willingness to accept the offer for
more shares (at the lower price) to the extent necessary to ensure the offer
becomes unconditional.
Jack-Chia-MPH made a pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 1992 of SDollars
7.2m (Pounds 2.5m), down from SDollars 16.5m (Pounds 5.3m), on sales of
SDollars 250.4m (Pounds 86.9m).

FT  30 JUN 92 / Black Bob bows out on a sombre note: The swan-song of Sir
Robert Scholey, British Steel's retiring chairman, made for gloomy listening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robert Scholey's nickname 'Black Bob' seemed more than usually
appropriate yesterday as the chairman of British Steel rose to present the
privatised UK steelmaker's results for the last time before retirement.
The occasional shaft of deadpan humour is all that Sir Robert will allow to
disturb the sombreness of a British Steel press conference. And yesterday,
Sir Robert's swan-song before he hands over next month to Sir Alastair
Frame, was no exception.
The atmosphere was appropriately gloomy. British Steel plunged from a Pounds
254m pre-tax profit in 1990-91 to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 55m in the year
ended March 28.
British Steel has a mountain to climb if it is again to reach the record
profits of Pounds 733m achieved in 1989-90. The share price, at 60 1/2 p, is
64 per cent below its peak and 45 per cent below the price at which it was
first traded after privatisation in 1988.
The outlook, coming less than a week after British Steel ended steelmaking
at its Ravenscraig plant in Scotland, appears just as depressing as the
recent past.
The steel industry is in the middle of its worst recession in at least 50
years; prices in the European Community have fallen nearly 20 per cent since
late 1989; concern is growing about subsidised exports of east European
steel to the EC; and a US trade row is simmering.
The immediate future is uncertain, and has prompted Sir Robert to cut
British Steel's dividend for 1991-92 from 8.75p to 4.5p.
Yet the Ravenscraig closure, painful though it is for the 1,200 workers who
are losing their jobs, comes just a few days after two lesser-noticed
events. Taken together, these suggest a slightly more hopeful future for
British Steel.
Last Tuesday, British Steel announced that its Llanwern works in South Wales
had set a new world record for operating performance in the continuous
casting of steel slabs, beating a previous Japanese-held record. The
achievement was a milestone in efficiency at Llanwern, and reflects British
Steel's continuing drive for improved performance and quality.
Two days later, the steel consultancy Meps Europe suggested that east
European companies should take British Steel as their model for
rationalisation.
'British Steel were successful in doubling the output per man from 1981 to
1991,' said Meps in a report on the prospects for the east European
steelmakers.
It is a backhanded compliment of which Sir Robert can be proud. The
rationalisation carried out in the six years he has been chairman may have
made him a monster in the eyes of workers who lost their jobs, but it is
fundamental to British Steel's future.
In an industry that is rapidly globalising, and where external factors are
largely beyond an individual company's control, Sir Robert's approach has
been to press ahead with action in those areas that can be tackled at
company level.
UK employment at British Steel has fallen from 53,900 before Sir Robert's
fresh push for rationalisation in the autumn of 1990 to 44,800 at the end of
March. It will drop below 42,000 by the end of the current year, a 17 per
cent drop in two years. Across the company, man hours per ton have fallen
from 6.3 to 4.4 during Sir Robert's tenure. 'We've done our whack,' said Sir
Robert yesterday, adding his now traditional pleas for continental European
producers to follow suit.
It is in this context that yesterday's deal with Avesta of Sweden, to create
a strong competitor in the European stainless steel industry, should be
seen.
'It is the sort of move that needs to be repeated in Europe to achieve,
through restructuring and profitability, the stability that is required,'
says Sir Robert.
But the essential problem for British Steel is that much of the pace of
restructuring in Europe, as with many of the factors affecting steel prices,
is out of its hands. When so many of Eur-ope's steel companies are
struggling, where will the money come from to finance restructuring?

UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, one of the biggest US parcel delivery companies
yesterday bought Carryfast, the UK's largest privately-owned express parcels
service.
This is the fourth and largest of UPS's acquisitions in Europe in the last
year. It adds about 8m packages a year to UPS's European total of 120m.
The long-awaited deal, which completes UPS's European network, affirms the
Atlanta-based company's confidence in Europe. UPS has spent Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 524.5m) on European acquisitions since 1987, building up a
comprehensive network, although it would not say how much it paid for
Carryfast.
UPS's commitment to Europe is in marked contrast to the recent retrenchment
by Federal Express, the Memphis-based express delivery company and a fierce
domestic rival.
FedEx, which accounts for about half the overnight package market in the US,
pulled out of intra-European deliveries in March, laying off thousands of
employees. It blamed the withdrawal on tough competition and
slower-than-expected growth in demand, which in turn caused heavy losses,
although industry observers also cited integration problems. FedEx is now
subcontracting these services.
UPS is also losing money on its international operations, but the company
maintains that its strong finances and private ownership - shares are held
largely by employees - mean that it can ride out the situation. 'We are on
target to achieve profitability in Europe in 1994,' said UPS. With solid
domestic earnings, the US company made Dollars 700.2m in 1991.
Carryfast said it needed an international owner because an increasing number
of its customers wanted to send packages between the UK and the continent.
The company, a management buy-out from Unilever in 1984, has almost all its
business within the UK. 'The single European market is getting closer and we
only had an ad hoc agreement with one continental company,' said Mr Tony
McClellan, marketing director.
UPS set up its UK base in January 1989 after acquiring IML Air Service
Group.
Before its acquisition of Carryfast, UPS had bought 15 European companies
including Prost Transports, the French carrier, last July, and Beemsterboer
in Holland and Star Air Parcels of Austria this year.
Carryfast made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 35m for the
year to December 31.

FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Building materials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any lingering hopes of imminent revival in the UK building sectors will have
been dashed by yesterday's grim news from Heywood Williams. Recent profit
warnings from Taylor Woodrow and Tarmac have underlined the precarious state
of contracting and the weakness of demand for aggregates. The announcement
by the UK's leading glass distributor that second quarter profits will be
well down on last year - only three months after a relatively upbeat
financial year-end statement - is a reminder that the so-called light end of
the market is in the doldrums too.
Yesterday's 12 per cent fall in the Heywood Williams share price will not
have made the task of Anglian Windows' advisers any easier. It will be no
surprise if today's flotation price for Anglian is pitched rather lower than
the level being talked about even a week ago. The reality is that May was a
terrible month for the building materials manufacturers and that June is
unlikely to have been much better. The best that most companies are now
hoping for is second half volumes comparable with the first half, and that
the pick up will not be delayed too far into 1993. No wonder Heywood
Williams is not prepared to go further than guaranteeing the interim
dividend at this stage.

FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In an equity market already weighed down by dividend worries yesterday, it
was distinctly unhelpful that sterling should have slipped back below DM2.90
for the first time since the UK election. In one sense, it is hard to see
what the fuss is about. Sterling is once more caught in the crossfire
between a weak dollar and a strong D-Mark, the belief being that whereas US
interest rates may well be cut again in the near future, a cut in German
rates looks more remote by the day. But whereas sterling's trade-weighted
level of 93.0 is a touch off its peak, it is still higher than at almost any
time in the past year and the same level as a week ago.
All the same, it does not do to be complacent. Sterling is now back at the
bottom of the ERM, with the gap between it and the next lowest member - at
present the Italian lira - the widest since before the election. Since the
Danish vote on Maastricht, the market has seen both Denmark and Italy raise
rates. It is perhaps now minded to see if the UK government can be pushed
into doing the same: or if not, to find out just how strong is the Tory
party's commitment to the system in the light of the latest sniping from Mrs
Thatcher.
All the same, it is worth recalling that sterling is still some 12 pfennigs
above its absolute floor against the D-Mark. Back in January, the gap was
less than half that. It would doubtless be embarrassing if sterling were to
fall through its narrow band floor of DM2.8844. But the government still has
plenty of ammunition in hand before resorting to the nuclear option of
raising interest rates.

FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strategic link with a US airline is probably BA's number one priority so
as to realise the full profit potential of its North Atlantic routes.
Nevertheless, investors should not hold their breath over reports that Lord
King plans to take a minority stake in a business formed from the merger of
US Air and the assets of TWA.
Stranger things have happened, of course, but given the enormous financial
pressures on the airlines industry it seems everyone is talking to everyone.
US Air's network of mainly East Coast services would certainly be a useful
feeder for BA - but then Lufthansa is also said to have its eye on the same
prize. BA, meanwhile, has also been talking to Continental, and is no doubt
still keeping its options open with North West and KLM.
Besides the plethora of possibilities, the sheer complexity of a BA/US
Air/TWA tie-up makes it a longish shot. Given the British airline's
indications that it will not enter a deal which dilutes shareholders'
interests - a principle which it stuck to in negotiations with KLM - it
would be hard to justify investing substantial sums in two carriers which
between them lost more than Dollars 600m last year and carry combined debt
of Dollars 3.7bn.

FT  30 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Scholey's final cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The assumption by many investors at the time of British Steel's dividend
warning last November was that, if it did come to a cut, the new payout
level would at least be sustainable. The message from yesterday's results -
which may also be relevant to other recession-bound companies whose
dividends are vulnerable - is that even this may turn out to be an illusion.
The pre-tax loss of Pounds 55m was considerably better than worst
expectations, but the damage was contained only by cost cutting and careful
cash management. Volume was flat, and much of the 9 per cent fall in
turnover was the consequence of lower prices.
Only if its market recovers can British Steel feel confident about its
dividend. The company says a 5 per cent increase in prices would produce
enough earnings to cover the reduced payout twice. The trouble is that there
is little on the horizon to stop prices continuing to fall. The US recovery
is weak and protectionist pressures are growing. There is a question mark
over Japan. Western Europe faces the twin problems of excess capacity and
cheap imports from the former East bloc.
British Steel thus has to fall back on its ability to cut costs, and the
forlorn hope that its European competitors will finally take an axe to their
own surplus capacity. There may be room for more savings, but there is a
cash cost to restructuring and the company has already pruned capital
spending to a minimum. Ultimately it risks jeopardising its chances of
exploiting recovery when it eventually comes.
Against this backdrop, its joint venture in stainless steels with Sweden's
Avesta is at least a sensible strategy. It will deconsolidate a loss-making
division, as well as taking future capital spending and restructuring
charges off British Steel's own balance sheet. The venture will have a
viable share of the European market and eventually earn more than British
Steel could make from stainless steel on its own. But the benefits will not
be sufficient to solve the problems of the group as a whole. Even after
yesterday's 9 per cent fall, the shares are hardly a bargain.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: International airport charges not increasing burden
for airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GAMPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Clouds over open skies' (June 24), is informative and
mostly beyond dispute.
However, there is one misleading impression which could have been created
inadvertently. You state that airlines are 'burdened by increasingly heavy
navigational and airport take-off and landing charges' (my italics). AACI
can certainly leave it to the air traffic control authorities to speak for
navigation charges, but as for airport charges, there is good impartial
evidence from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to show
that the burden is not increasing.
In fact, these ICAO figures show that airport charges have formed a stable
and modest proportion of total airline operating expenses, falling from 3.8
per cent of expenses in 1988 to 3.5 per cent in 1990, the last published
data. In the period 1978-1990 the proportion has always been between 3 per
cent and 4 per cent. During this time, most airports have kept their
increases below inflation.
Some airports have had to impose higher increases, but this has often been
linked to the provision of new facilities to ease congestion.
You also mention the 'start-up costs' estimated by European airlines. These
are actually dominated by fixed overheads, such as aircraft leasing costs,
station expenses, staff costs and marketing. Airport charges, which are in
any case only 'paid as you go', are not so significant.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: A crucial factor in assessing TV merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS DICKENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex's comments are customarily fully informed. His observations on the
Yorkshire/Tyne Tees merger, however, left out a crucial factor.
Using his own Treasury figures, the gap between payments to the Treasury by
Granada (Pounds 27m) and Yorkshire/Tyne Tees (Pounds 63m) is Pounds 36m.
As I understand it, Yorkshire/Tyne Tees between them are currently taking
Pounds 30m more than Granada in advertising revenue.
Simple mathematics therefore suggests very little difference in the profit
and loss position of the companies. And the fact that both Yorkshire and
Tyne Tees have substantial cash balances, whereas Granada has a very heavily
borrowed position, suggests at least equality in strength between Granada
and the 'merged moguls', as Lex would have it.
The truth in this case is at odds with Lex's deduction. As chairman of the
company which has attended to YTV's corporate identity and objectives in the
run-up to the recent licence changes, and as someone with an interest in the
changing developments within ITV, I thought it needed pointing out.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEB FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the examination of Robert Horton's resignation from BP, people may
naturally focus on the reasons for his departure and not on his achievement.
However it took great personal courage to set a radical course for the
company towards a more productive workplace; one with dignity, meaning and
community. Mr Horton was no doubt aware of the personal risk this involved,
yet he accepted it willingly.
Through his leadership, BP has set an example for a much needed change in
western business. That the process of change has been reaffirmed after his
departure is a tribute to his choice to act in the interest of BP, not of
himself. We should remember that.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOOP VAN ANTWERPEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reading your article 'Germans urge rethink of European Union' (June
25), I was struck by the statement that Germany's industrial federation
(BDI) has traditionally been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of EMU
among Europe's employers' organisations. In my view, BDI never was a
front-runner in EC matters, nor were German trade unions. It took several
years before they mentally endorsed the success of the EMS.
When BDI quotes that 'the speed of integration has been too fast', I wonder
what kind of integration they are after. Is dismantling 280 trade fences
installed on nationalistic subsidiarity level, for instance, already a
bridge too far? How many bureaucrats were maintaining these obstacles?

FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: Initiative represents real training opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY BAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Ansel Harris (Letters, June 24) described Training and Enterprise
Councils as being 'essentially a repackaging of earlier government
initiatives'.
Of course, the Tec movement has inherited some programmes from government
but the focus is substantially different from any previous measures. Tecs
are principally catalysts for bringing about a cultural change of attitude
to training - they are not simply about the delivery of government funded
programmes or narrowly focused schemes. Will Tecs be able to bring about the
change required? Only time will tell, but early indicators are promising.
The Tec initiative was launched in 1989 and the last of the Tecs was
operational almost two years ahead of schedule. Furthermore, investment in
training is, as a consequence of Tec endeavours, increasingly being seen by
business leaders as a means of improving the bottom line benefits of company
performance.
The new Tec initiative, Investors in People (IiP), is a major part of Tec
strategy to increase the momentum of change. At last, companies which
demonstrate a commitment to increasing skills will receive public
recognition. The focus for IiP is clear. Approximately 80 per cent of the
workforce in this Tec area are employed by the largest 20 per cent of
companies. Inevitably, Tecs will focus their endeavours where there will be
greatest impact so larger companies will be targeted, but not to the
exclusion of smaller businesses which may have already recognised the
benefits of investing in their people.
IiP will increase the demand for training and I am hopeful that colleges,
and in particular, The College of North West London, will respond to this.
In the meantime, this Tec will continue its financial support for the
college. It is regrettable that Mr Harris appears to link the IiP initiative
with the underfunding of The College of North West London. In doing this,
not only is he adding oranges and apples to arrive at bananas, but he is
failing to recognise that IiP could open up new markets and sources of
income.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: No home, no job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG PEOPLE entering higher education in the UK are privileged in many
ways. Universities and polytechnics offer a form of training which can bring
rich rewards in later life. They also assist their students in making the
transition from living at home to independence, with low-cost accommodation
in halls of residence or approved lodgings.
For those who will not sample these opportunities, entering the world of
work can be much harder. Without a job, most young people cannot afford to
live away from home. Yet for many, the best hope of a job lies in moving
away from home. Thousands of young people end up on the streets of UK
cities, from which the chances of finding employment are greatly diminished.
Others languish at home in unemployment blackspots. Providing these young
people with opportunities requires the sort of low-cost accommodation that
helps students make the transition from home to work.
One solution lies in foyers, institutions which have flourished in France
for decades by providing young people with affordable accommodation, skills
training and help in finding jobs - all under one roof. Two foyer projects
are already being piloted in Nottingham and Norwich, with five more due to
start later in the summer. The launch yesterday of the Foyer Federation is a
welcome sign that the concept is about to take root in the UK.
So far the pioneering has been done by the voluntary and private sectors.
But it is hard to see how affordable accommodation can be provided in
high-cost areas such as London under the present system of housing subsidy.
French foyers subsidise some of their costs from commercial activities such
as running restaurants. While British foyers might hope to do the same in
the future, there is a case for public support now to get them established.
The cost of dealing with youth homelessness is significant enough to make
foyers a horse worth backing.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Loss of lustre in the golden state: California's economic
dynamism is being tested by recession, budget deficits and social pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a drink in his hand and a spectacular view of the sun setting over the
Golden Gate bridge behind him, Mr Peter Schwartz ticks off the advantages of
San Francisco bay: near perfect climate, stunning scenery and one of the
world's most vital intellectual communities.
A former head of strategic planning at Shell in London, Mr Schwartz now
lives in a spacious home in the hills above Berkeley and runs his own
consulting company, Global Business Network.
'This is not utopia,' he says, 'but it is the wealthiest place on earth
where people have the highest aspirations.' Don't pay too much attention to
press reports predicting the end of the Californian dream, he warns. 'This
state will always reinvent itself.'
As an enthusiast for California, Mr Schwartz is in good company. After
decades of effortless growth, the state's economy is larger than that of all
but seven nations. The population is 30m, having grown by more than a
quarter during the 1980s. As immigrants swarm in, the number of Californians
is set to rise by a further 6m in the 1990s.
Yet the Golden state's capacity to realise its citizens' dreams is being
doubted as never before:
Jolted by the worst recession since the 1930s, Californians are questioning
the long-run competitiveness of the state's economy;
The second year of budget crisis points to a basic incompatibility between
Californians' demand for public services and their reluctance to pay taxes.
Failure to agree a way to cut the prospective Dollars 11bn deficit means the
state will almost certainly begin the new financial year tomorrow without a
budget. In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riot, the state's ability to
assimilate immigrants and bridge a growing divide between rich and poor is
in doubt.
Whether measured by jobs, income or spending, California's recession is more
severe than the nation's. The state's gross domestic product, for example,
fell 3.4 per cent last year compared with 0.7 per cent in the US as a whole.
Employment has contracted by more than 600,000, or about 5 per cent, more
than twice the US rate of decline.
The national economy is growing, sluggishly. In California, by contrast, few
definite signs of recovery are discernible. 'This trough is so deep,' says
the state department of finance, 'that employment may not return to the
pre-recession peak until late 1993 or early 1994.'
Is California experiencing more than just a cyclical downturn? Mr Bob
Arnold, a veteran forecaster at the Centre for the Continuing Study of the
California Economy in Palo Alto, remains optimistic. He says the depth of
the downturn is fully explained by three factors: national recession,
defence cuts and sharp retrenchment in commercial real estate. The ill
effects, moreover, are mostly being felt in the Los Angeles basin, which
accounts for 80 per cent of the job losses.
He points out that defence spending as a share of state output is less than
8 per cent compared with 14 per cent in 1967. Since California adjusted
successfully to defence cuts following the Vietnam war, it should absorb
today's cuts relatively easily. Indeed, he claims clean-air legislation will
lead to greater economic disruption than will the loss of Pentagon
contracts.
Sceptics, however, worry that public policy is much less supportive of
growth than in the past. After the second world war, says Mr Bruce Cain, a
political scientist at the University of California's Berkeley campus, the
state created the world's finest system of publicly financed higher
education, built an unrivalled network of highways and turned semi-deserts
into fertile farmland by investing heavily in water infrastructure.
The trouble is that belief in public goods rapidly dissolved. As people
moved into the state in large numbers during the 1980s, public services
deteriorated. Californians now face rationing of water, cuts in higher
education and chronic congestion in some urban areas. The quality of life
and economic efficiency are both threatened.
Many businessmen claim the public sector is impeding rather than
facilitating growth. The charge is made most eloquently in a recent stinging
critique of public policy by a council on competitiveness set up by
Republican governor Pete Wilson. Led by Mr Peter Ueberroth, the businessman
appointed by President George Bush to oversee the reconstruction of
riot-torn Los Angeles, the council claims that companies are being
'discouraged, harassed, shut down and driven off'. It says corporate
migration to states such as Idaho, Nevada and Utah reflects a 'regulatory
quagmire that overwhelms small and medium-sized business managers'.
So far only a trickle of companies is leaving the state. But there is truth
in the Ueberroth committee's claim that poorly implemented public policies
are impeding economic growth. Does southern California, for example, really
need 72 agencies to oversee environmental controls?
The casual visitor to Sacramento, the attractive seat of state government,
would hardly guess that California also faces chronic budgetary problems.
The restored State Capitol stands serenely in a park dotted with cedars,
elms and cypresses.
Inside, officials are frantically looking for ways to eliminate a projected
deficit of Dollars 11bn, which is equivalent to almost 20 per cent of
revenue. The scale of the deficit came as a cruel shock because Mr Wilson
supposedly resolved budgetary problems last year with a Dollars 7bn tax
increase, the largest in US state history.
The immediate cause of the deficit is a collapse in revenue growth. But the
state finance department draws attention to adverse demographic trends. In
the 1980s rapid population growth was manageable because the fastest-growing
group was taxpayers aged 18-64. The 1990s look very different because the
number of children aged five to 17 is expected to jump by 40 per cent, far
outweighing the growth of the tax-paying population.
The surge in the number of children - many from minority groups - critically
affects the budget, because four-fifths of spending goes to education,
health and welfare. The state expects welfare cases to more than double
during this decade, and forecasts a 60 per cent rise in the numbers
receiving subsidised health care. With 100 languages spoken in Californian
schools and a majority of pupils in many areas from disadvantaged
backgrounds, the cost of special educational services is soaring.
The Republican state government is in a fiscal straitjacket, largely as a
result of voters' refusal to face reality. In 1978 Proposition 13 halved
property taxes and left the state precariously dependent on income and sales
taxes. A decade later the public voted for Proposition 98, which effectively
dictates that education spending rises in line with enrolment and the cost
of living. Aware that nobody wants higher taxes, Mr Wilson is trying to
achieve big cuts in the less well-protected welfare budget.
Mr Russ Gould, the state secretary for health and welfare, recognises that
welfare cuts are not a long-term solution to budget problems. 'We have to
reassess the government's role,' he says. 'We need a new social covenant.'
Mr Alvin Rabushka, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, agrees. He points out that real per capita state spending has
more than tripled in three decades, while real per capita incomes have less
than doubled.
His solution is to challenge the philosophical rationale for the single
biggest item of state spending: elementary and secondary education. In a
state as rich as California, he argues, it makes no sense to offer publicly
financed education for all children. Most parents can afford to pay at least
part of the cost. He thus favours the sale or contracting out of schools to
private groups and the restriction of state support to means-tested
educational credits for poor families. Such policies could save about
Dollars 9bn a year, enough to halve the state income tax.
Mr Rabushka's radical plans are rejected even by tough-minded Republican
politicians such as Mr Gould, the welfare chief. He stresses the importance
of education as a melting pot, pointing out that in his own child's class 19
out of 29 children are from minority backgrounds.
Adverse demographic trends, corporate complaints about excessive regulation
and the rioting in Los Angeles pose challenges to the Californian economy,
but are unlikely to prevent a cyclical recovery. California's natural
advantages are then likely to reassert themselves: it has more than its
share of rapidly growing high-technology businesses and is perfectly
positioned to benefit from expanding US trade with the Pacific Rim economies
and Latin America. But the longer-term strains have to be addressed.
California's ability to generate wealth at the pace demanded by its third
world rate of population growth is already in doubt. In 1980 per capita
incomes in California were 17 per cent higher than in the US as whole; by
1990 they were only 11 per cent higher. By 2000, many expect the gap to be
only about 5 per cent.
If the state is to return to its previous growth path, reform of the public
sector is necessary. The root problem is voters' reluctance to pay the taxes
required to finance the needed improvements in education, transport
infrastructure and so forth. This is partly a reflection of the growing
heterogeneity of the population: affluent whites in northern California have
no wish to pay for services that mainly benefit minority groups in the Los
Angeles area. Some, indeed, are pressing for a division of the state.
One radical option would involve a retreat from the universal provision of
free public services. It would be easier, for example, to meet the
educational and social needs of poor immigrant families if affluent
Californians paid directly for schools. The cost of relieving congestion in
urban areas, meanwhile, could be greatly reduced if road pricing were
introduced. And water shortages could be eliminated, some believe, if water
were priced and traded like other scarce commodities.
A 'fee-for-service' market-oriented public sector may seem unthinkable
today. Yet it is consistent with fundamental Californian values - such as
reverence for personal autonomy - and may prove the only way to resolve
deep-seated conflicts over the appropriate level of taxation. If by
reinventing the public sector the state can again play the nurturing role it
perfected in previous decades, the instinctive economic optimism of Mr
Schwartz and other entrepreneurs is unlikely to prove misplaced.

The truth about Mr John Major is slowly dawning on a fractious Conservative
party. The prime minister is draped in Europe. His government has no
strategy that is not European. If it succeeds in maintaining Britain's
position at 'the heart of Europe', it may well survive to the end of the
decade. If it fails over, say, Maastricht, it fails altogether.
The flurry of questions that followed Mr Major's statement on the Lisbon
summit yesterday should have demonstrated as much to the Commons. Never mind
the details of his replies on this or that technical interpretation of
subsidiarity. Here was a man steeped in the dealings of the European
Community. 'I am not prepared to see this country sit on the sidelines,' he
said - rubbing the obvious into the noses of the new puppies behind him.
This is not to say that the prime minister is an enthusiastic proponent of
what would, if Maastricht were ratified, be called the European Union.
Clearly he is not. Quintessentially English, he would prefer as few rules as
possible, although he recognises that on transnational matters, such as the
establishment of the single market, transnational legislation is
unavoidable. But a Europe of dominant central institutions is not attractive
to the inhabitants of its offshore islands. The very idea is anathema to the
Tory party.
The prime minister cannot but be aware of this. That is why he talks the
language he does: of moving away from the nightmare of a superstate. It is
what he needs to say and, I suspect, what he believes. Europe expressed as a
congeries of freely co-operating nation states is more appealing to him, as
it is to all politicians of his cast of mind.
If this is so, his Conservative opponents continue to ask, why did he do the
deal at Maastricht? If you have to put the question you understand neither
Mr Major's thought processes nor the nature of what was agreed. The deal was
done because it was the best that could be negotiated at the time. Britain
had to take part in the negotiations, in good faith, or be left out of the
process. Outside, it would be unable to do anything at all about the plans
being hatched by its continental neighbours. The essence of Britain's
policy, as expressed by Mr Douglas Hurd and accepted by both Mr Major and Mr
Norman Lamont, is that it is the government's job to find out what the
continentals are up to and put a stop to it. If that cannot be achieved,
damage limitation is the next best option.
This strategy is not as effective as most Conservatives would like. For
example, Maastricht undoubtedly extends the potential powers of the European
Commission. Worse, from the nationalist point of view, it lays the
foundations for monetary union. If everything works, the end result is to be
the creation of a single bank and a single currency. Plenty of dominant
continent-wide central institutions there. From the point of view of Mr
Major, the answer is clear. The subsidiarity clause creates opportunities to
decentralise. The structure of the new European union, which keeps defence,
foreign policy and internal security separate from the Treaty of Rome, is a
step away from the evolution of a superstate.
I wonder if the underlying argument will ever be completely resolved. As a
new book* by the pro-European Labour MP, Mr Giles Radice, reminds us, doubts
about Britain's place in Europe have plagued political leaders of both major
parties for half a century. In the end they all had only one option: to get
in, or try to, and do deals - usually along the lines the others preferred.
Lady Thatcher's weekend outburst, highly entertaining though it was,
expresses nothing new. She was irritated by the Germans when she was prime
minister, and, now that she is out of office, her pronouncements are more
apocalyptic than ever.
Yet when she was in Number 10 Downing Street the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher
was just as pragmatic as Mr Major is now. She screamed and shouted, but her
government bludgeoned the Single European Act through the Commons. That act
gave rise to most of the recent directives from the Commission. It might as
well be relabelled the Nooks &amp; Crannies (Enabling the Commission) Act.
It was also Mrs Thatcher who presided when Britain joined the exchange rate
mechanism. Had she not been ejected from office in November 1990 she may
have refused to sign at Maastricht, but her track record suggests that she
would have caved in after further argument and accepted, say, a treaty of
Lisbon. It is the opinion of certain French officials that this would have
been more to the centralisers' taste than the deal negotiated by Mr Major.
He is now stuck with that deal. The derision that would be poured upon his
head if he abandoned it at the first sign of unrest on his own backbenches
would so diminish his stature that his effectiveness as prime minister would
be neutralised. In any event, the danger that he will go to the Commons with
a bill, only to have it rejected, is slight. He will not move unless the
French vote 'yes' in their referendum in September; nor will he present the
bill unless there is a clear strategy to bring the Danes on board. Even
then, the whip in him is likely to prevail. He will have the vote sewn up
before it is taken, or it will not be taken.
All this presupposes that the opposition remains immobilised by the shock of
its election defeat. It may not be. On July 18 there will be a new leader,
Mr John Smith. He is likely to encourage his party to join with Conservative
rebels in opposing a guillotine on debate. That would be damaging for the
government. The parliamentary timetable would be upset. In the end, however,
Mr Major would make it a matter of confidence and have his way. As it
happens, the prime minister should have little to fear from the benches
opposite him. The Liberal Democrats are the most pro-European group in the
house. And, as Mr Radice points out, the next Labour leader 'has been a
convinced European for more than 30 years . . .'. In theory Mr Smith may be
tempted to unite his party around a call for a referendum. Today's
conventional wisdom is that Labour would be deeply split by such a proposal.
The prime minister can therefore safely don his lederhosen, his plumed cap,
his onion-necklace and his other continental apparel when he becomes
Community president tomorrow. The rebels behind him are loud, and
persistent. They are not invincible.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Dividend reality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INEXORABLY, dividend cuts are moving closer to the centre of the British
corporate establishment. Companies like Lonrho and Pilkington have led the
way: yesterday, British Steel also wielded the axe, and it seems inevitable
that the uncovered payout at British Petroleum will soon be pruned heavily
following last week's boardroom coup.
On a trailing one-year basis, aggregate dividends in the UK are still
showing a nominal gain of about 1 per cent, but that implies a fall in real
terms, the first since the last recession ten years ago. During the 1980s,
British companies became very keen to satisfy the hunger of their
institutional shareholders for higher dividends. Although profits have been
falling for two years now, the dividend response has been slow. Cover in
aggregate is down to the historically very low level of about 1.7 times, and
excluding the still well-heeled utilities it may be only about 1.5 times.
Under pressure from their shareholders, British companies appear to have
accepted that dividend payments should be smoothed over an economic cycle,
generously interpreted. The extreme case of this may be the composite
insurance sector, where many payments have been maintained or even
increased, in the face of serious losses. But this attitude has emphasised
the dangers of a downturn which might prove protracted. Britain's present
recession, as it seeks to adjust to the rigours of the European exchange
rate mechanism, is much more than a simple 1960s-style four-year cycle. The
inflexible attitude to dividends has posed the risk that some companies
might seriously deplete their capital resources, and that there would have
to be a confrontation with reality as a hoped-for early profits recovery
failed to materialise. We are now at that critical stage.
It is important now that a more flexible approach should be restored.
Companies should not allow themselves to be put under pressure to weaken
their balance sheets or to abandon capital spending required to secure their
longer-term competitive position. Unfortunately, the BP example appears to
show that fundamental dividend misalignments are often tackled through
violent boardroom upheavals rather than through orderly responses. And the
severe share price reaction at BP implies that the stock market is still not
disposed to view such adjustments constructively.
But the dividend-paying abilities of British companies are bound to be
curtailed over the next several years, a reality to which the market has
begun to adjust over the past few weeks.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: On the Town - Musical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There seemed to be two performances of Bernstein's On the Town going on,
more or less simultaneously, at the Barbican Hall on Sunday evening. The
first was a glittering revival of one of the quintessential Broadway scores,
glamorously cast (Thomas Hampson, Frederica von Stade, Tyne Daley, Samuel
Ramey, Marie McLaughlin, Cleo Laine etc.) brilliantly played by the London
Symphony Orchestra, conducted with native wit and zest by Michael Tilson
Thomas, neatly semi-staged - altogether a rare treat.
The second was a Made-For-Video Spectacular - the concert was indeed being
filmed and recorded - decked with garish visual trimmings and a thick smear
of plasticky showbiz gunk. The model was the LSO's similarly-styled, and
much more ghastly, Candide a couple of Christmases ago; the same vile
amplification of the singers was redeployed. (Why not reduce the orchestra
to pit-band size and let these fine voices ride free?)
The presence as narrators of the show's celebrated authors, Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, proved a distinctly mixed blessing (though Miss Comden's wry
delivery managed to hit points home more than once); the danger of slipping
from direct involvement in the musical into a mode of self-congratulatory
sentimentality was avoided by the merest hair's breadth. Mr Tilson Thomas,
waggling his behind and jumping in the air while conducting the show's
nightclub sequence, seemed to be attempting a version of Lenny-on-the-podium
 -one instance of 'period' practice which would have been better avoided.
One resented any intrusive sentimentality in the re-creation of On the Town
above all because its analysis of urban pleasures, urban affections and
urban loneliness is so free of stickiness and schmalz. At a distance of half
a century from the original Broadway first night, the piece grows ever more
significantly in stature and proclaims its richness of substance with
ever-louder voice.
The schematic plot-line - three sailors on a 24-hour furlough in New York -
is no more than a peg for a fresh, compassionate observation of the comedie
humaine, focused in a tone of rueful verbal wit that remains authentically
the city's own, and achieved in a musical language no less so. Bernstein's
idiom, his mining of his Stravinsky and Copland inheritance for the purposes
of popular lyric theatre, seems to me one of the great outbursts of
genuinely original 20th-century creativity; this 1944 musical was its first
expression, and in many ways its purest.
Is there anything more touchingly, bittersweetly 'New York' than the show's
Abschied, 'Some other time'? Led by Miss von Stade's Claire, in melting
voice and enchanting humour, it was one of the evening's peaks. As Gabey,
romantic lead of the three sailors, Mr Hampson's elegantly unforced vocal
manners and handsome presence approached the ideal - his 'Lonely Town' was
another moment of bittersweet sentiment finely turned.
The casting of Tyne Daley as Brunnhilde Esterhazy, the wise-cracking,
sexually voracious taxi-driver, was a stroke of pure genius; no less so that
of Mr Ramey in two cameo roles, a master of dry, throwaway comedy. Kurt
Ollman (Chip), David Garrison (Ozzie), and Marie McLaughlin (in the tiny
part of the elusive Miss Turnstiles) gave lovely, spot-on accounts of
themselves.
The pianist, Michael Barrett, the saxophonist, John Harle, and whole
handfuls of LSO wind and brass soloists deserve equal mention. In the end,
thank heavens, the good, true, tough-minded LSO On the Town won out over the
vulgar.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Poulenc - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Friday, encouraged by Credit Lyonnais Securities sponsorship, the Royal
Philharmonic and the London Choral Society devoted a whole concert to
Francis Poulenc. That must have seemed risky, given his status as an
endearingly idiosyncratic, backward-looking, narrow-range composer. In the
event, it was a red-blooded tonic success. The programme was admirably
planned, no doubt by the conductor Jane Glover: no 'light relief' items, but
four considerable pieces which tracked Poulenc from his early Diaghilev days
to his last years.
The ultimate impression was much deeper than many would have expected. Even
the beguiling suite from the ballet Les Biches at the start served a vital
function, fixing the composer's winsome terms-of-reference the better to let
us hear how soberly, sweetly and cogently he developed them later. One
hadn't expected Miss Glover to be so sympathetic and searching an exponent
of Poulenc, but she turned up trumps.
In the Organ Concerto - with Simon Preston, whose registration was
brilliantly judicious but his fingers oddly slack in passages that should
have a hard tempo giusto sheen - she was far more than an accompanist. She
had looked thoughtfully into what Poulenc's orchestra of strings and timpani
actually does, and articulated it in pungent detail. The result had a rare
poignancy and breadth. After Handel, is there any other organ concerto with
such monumental expressive power? The 1959 Gloria was no less persuasive:
Lynne Dawson wonderfully melting in the soprano-solos, the chorus by turns
warm, elevated and robustly playful. The programme-book (at Pounds 1.50)
should have included the text, but it didn't.
The particular revelation of the concert was Poulenc's choral cantata
Secheresses, commissioned by an eccentric English Maecenas, Edward James, to
his own decadent French texts - sun-dried desolation, barrenness, the
hurtful indifference of young men. It was not material that the composer
would naturally have chosen, but he strove manfully to give it musical life.
The cantata had a ruinously under-prepared premiere in 1938, and it remains
the most under-performed of the key Poulenc works.
Key Poulenc is nevertheless just what it is, and Miss Glover's account of it
 -with the London Choral Society in scrupulous dramatic form - opened up
dark vistas. With not only the extraordinary orchestral inventions of its
four movements, but its abrupt switches between near-atonal scene-painting
and stark, heartfelt admissions, it sounds like the matrix for his most
sober, most tenderly disillusioned postwar music; it supplies a crucial
link. Miss Glover made that crystal clear, as only a clear-eyed devotee
could do.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Obituary - John Piper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death on Sunday of John Piper, at the age of 89, removes from the
British art world its last familiar figure of the pre-war avant-garde. But
Piper was the least radical of his peers, and it is the great irony of his
long and distinguished career that he should have become the one modern
artist with whom the educated, literary middle classes were at all
comfortable.
After early experimentation with abstraction, he found his true metier as a
romantic painter and illustrator of architecture and the architectural
landscape, and his long mutually complementary collaboration with John
Betjeman will long stand as a major popular achievement in mid-century arts
and letters.
At his best, which was at his most natural and uninhibited, he was capable
of producing images of a true romantic sweep and grandeur, in the great
English landscape tradition. During the war, he was commissioned to make a
number of water-colour studies of Windsor Castle, wonderfully dramatic
beneath lowering stormy skies. 'You don't seem to have had very good
weather', said the King.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Elton John/Eric Clapton - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eric and Elton held a party last weekend and 200,000 friends turned up. You
could tell they were friends because they did not mind that it was all a bit
cosy, slightly sedate, and not much of a rave.
Elton John is much more sombre figure these days. OK, so not many
45-year-olds wear canary yellow jackets and diamante waistcoats, but for a
man who used to appear in public dressed like the sugar plum fairy it was
the soul of restrained elegance. His set was also stripped bare - just black
keyboards behind which Elton seemed as restrained as a bank clerk. Once this
functional machine did spiral upwards like a demented cinema Wurlitzer, but
in the main Elton was not the clown of old. The sad songs, which littered
his repertoire, were almost painfully apt.
Elton was also hampered by a sound system more suited to Guns 'N' Roses than
to one of the most lyrical giants of pop. Some of the faster numbers were
loud to the point of incomprehension. But there were still shivery moments,
especially 'Sorry seems to be the hardest word' and 'Rocket man', and for
once the songs off the new album, especially 'The One', held their own. Just
when it seemed Elton was warming to his work there was a blistering
'Saturday night's alright for fighting' and he was gone.
Before the end he had been joined by Eric Clapton for one of the most costly
duets of all time in their joint country rocker, 'Runaway Train'. Soemhow
the sight of these two multi millionaires still working their way was
re-assuring: pop stars can grow old gracefully.
On Friday, the first of three nights, Clapton had the easier option of
closing the show. He has never majored on personality - his guitar
virtuosity shouts his presence loudly enough. He touched the memory chords
of his audience in a dreamy kind of way and, with matchless precision,
called down dusk on cue with 'Wonderful Tonight'. Eric and Elton did not lay
on the most exciting party but it was certainly extremely agreeable.

We are promised that BBC2's Black And White In Colour will tell us about
'Television, memory and race, 1968 to 1992'.
Will it celebrate the success story of black people on British television?
Will it point out that in a population more than 95 per cent white, the
proportion of prominent black sportsmen, comedians, and pop groups on
television is well above the proportion of black people in the population?
Will it applaud a system which, despite some racist feeling of the sort you
find the world over, in populations of all colours, brings us journalists
such as Zeinab Badawi, Stuart Hall, Trevor McDonald, Trevor Phillips and
Moira Stuart?
Or will it be the usual old resentful defeatism that we get from
television's race industry depressives? We shall see (8.10).
Tonight also brings Rear Window (9.00 C4) which visits Rajasthan for its
account of Indian miniatures; Madhur Jaffrey starring in the drama about two
women who start a catering business, Firm Friends (9.00 ITV); and a repeat
of a 1964 documentary about Afro-Caribbeans living in Birmingham, The Colony
(11.15 BBC2).

The Isles of Scilly is set to become the first UK local authority to buy a
desalination plant to beat the drought in the south of England.
The island's council has agreed to spend nearly Pounds 200,000 on a high
technology water-making system similar to one used by British troops in the
Gulf War.
The plant will be supplied in five weeks by a Scottish company, WEIR
WESTGARTH, which has also made desalination equipment for the Channel
Tunnel.
It will use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater taken from beach
wells into drinking water, and is designed to produce 50,000 gallons a day -
about two-fifths of the island's peak summertime needs.
The extra water would supplement supplies from underground boreholes and
should avoid rationing on the island, whose 1,500 population trebles in
August.
The council decided to buy the plant because its natural supply of water
from wells has been drying up over the last five years due to dry winters
and lack of rainfall.
The desalinated water will be blended with well water to reduce nitrate
levels, which are presently higher than European Community limits.

Peter Shakeshaft, who left the privately-owned Drambuie company in February
after an unexpectedly brief stay, has resurfaced. He has bought Bryant of
Scotland, a small high quality knitwear company, from the receivers Ernst &amp;
Young, and plans to develop it.
Shakeshaft, 44, a Glaswegian, was a director and divisional chief executive
with John Waddington before joining Drambuie in Edinburgh in late 1990. But
after making one acquisition with a view to diversification, little was
heard of him until news leaked out of his resignation, apparently because he
found Drambuie resistant to change.
Bryant employs 131 people and exports 90 per cent of its output. It went
into receivership in April 18 months after a management buyout from Laura
Ashley.

<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow's materials handling specialist, BIRTLEY ENGINEERING, is to
set up two modular coal preparation systems for a new open-cast mining
operation at the former Nadins colliery at Cadley Hill, near
Burton-on-Trent.
The work is part of a Pounds 35m contract awarded to Taylor Woodrow by
British Coal Opencast, covering extensive mining, civil engineering and
restoration work at Nadins and at neighbouring High Cross, Derbyshire.
Taylor Woodrow Civil Engineering is responsible for winning more than two
million tonnes of coal by opencast methods at the two sites.
At Nadins, Taylor Woodrow is undertaking a six-year programme to extract
coal and prepare the 128-hectare site for industrial and leisure
development.
Birtley's contract is in two major parts. The first is the design, supply
and installation of the washery, a twin plant system consisting of two
Birtley Tornado dense-medium cyclone plants to process coal at 300tph. Worth
Pounds 750,000, this part of the contract will be to reclaim coal-tip
reserves.
The second part, valued at Pounds 100,000, is a management contract for the
plant peripherals, including the washery feed, handling of processed coal,
fines and discard.
A raw coal section allied to the open-cast mining will comprise reception
area, crushing, screening and a stocking-out system utilising a Didcot tube.
It is anticipated that the plant will be commissioned and in operation by
mid-July.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Design study at Moorgate Station
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Architectural practice A&amp;DG (ARCHITECTURE &amp; DESIGN GROUP) has been awarded
the design contract for one of CrossRail's two City gateway stations which
will be sited at Moorgate.
This commission will be the first significant project undertaken by the
practice following the completion of its designs at Liverpool Street Station
and the restructuring of the group from a British Rail in-house
architectural unit to a largely independent stand-alone practice.
A&amp;DG were selected for the Moorgate project from a nine-strong list of
invited practices. The practice now joins an architectural CrossRail line-up
which so far includes Alsop &amp; Stormer at Paddington and Ralph Erskine with
BDP who will jointly be looking at all internal platform and tunnel designs.
A&amp;DG will for an initial 12-week period be producing conceptual feasibility
studies for both the internal design of the ticket hall and possible options
of ensuring that the CrossRail has a distinctive public image at street
level.
The civil engineering team for the project will be appointed later in order
to give the architects a creative breathing space.
Moorgate Underground Station currently suffers from having three separate
entrances with no distinguishable main entrance or sense of identity. A&amp;DG
has been asked to look at ways in which the entire site can be reconciled -
a task which is complicated by the existence of some listed buildings and
the conditional planning approval for the redevelopment of Moor House.

FT  30 JUN 92 / People: Barclays' private banker plans to stay put
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays' intention to expand its private banking presence in the UK is
underscored by the arrival of Michael Tomalin as managing director of the
newly structured private banking division, replacing Alan Hogg, former head
of international private banking, who is posted to Barclays Northern Region.
Tomalin, 45, has moved at considerable speed round the Barclays group -
Barbados, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Tokyo and back to London (as head of
financial institutions) within the past 12 years. 'Yes, I have flitted
around a bit, but I now hope to stay put for some considerable while. As a
private banker you should grow grey with your clients.'
Hogg, 47, who was in charge of international private banking, had little
time to grow grey companionably; he was transferred to become corp-orate
director of the northern region after two and a half years on international
private banking. 'He is an extremely strong commercial banker and comes from
that part of the world,' explains Tomalin.
The division has been renamed - dropping the 'international' - to reflect
ambitions of building the UK end of what has hitherto been very much a
cross-frontier operation. Tomalin sees private banking - a concept much
trumpeted in the 1980s that is still adapting to the leaner 1990s - as the
provision of 'corporate finance for private individuals'. Hinting that the
bank intends to aim its service further up-market than are some of its
clearing bank competitors, Tomalin will not be tied to setting a specific
financial threshold. 'You don't set a minimum net worth for prospective
purchasers of a Savile Row suit.'
He sees his job as 'creating a honeypot' to encourage existing wealthy
clients to put more of their assets with the bank, as well as attracting new
money. 'And that is done by the quality not of our ads or livery but by the
quality of the service,' he says after a month with his feet under the desk.
*****
John Cotton is the new director of personnel for Barclays, succeeding Bill
Gordon, recently appointed managing director of the banking division. Cotton
was previously regional director covering south west London.
*****
Martin Chick, previously publisher of Flyer, an aviation monthly from
Insider Publications, has moved to become managing director of Rococo, a
growing publishing and event management group based in Islington.
Having helped take the circulation of Flyer from 0 to 35,000 in just over
two and a half years, Chick's new job is to build the Rococo business,
centred around the publication of annuals principally in the sporting field,
towards the goal of a stock market flotation in a few years. Rococo is
putting together the official review of the Barcelona Olympics, and has just
signed an agreement with the Test and County Cricket Board for its major
publications.
Chick describes his two years with Edinburgh-based Insider as 'a rest
because of the incredibly slow pace of life (in that City)'. Clearing up
after a break-in at Rococo's premises last week, he maintained he was
'delighted to be back in the thick of it'.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: Future is home to odd ideas / Outlining a
curious Californian vision of tomorrow's house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EVELYN BRODIE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only in California, perhaps, could a house with a three car garage be built
to exhibit the latest ideas in energy conservation and efficiency. Yet E3,
the 'Energy Efficient Environment' project in Rocklin, near Sacramento, is a
serious attempt to encourage builders and homebuyers to adopt energy waste
reducing technology. The experimental 'thinking, talking home for the 21st
century' is a project of the Building Industry Association, the California
Energy Commission and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
Californians are not ready to sacrifice their cars for the cause, but they
are concerned about the economic and environmental costs of squandering
energy. In a state where homes have long been built without regard for
energy conservation, E3 may signal change.
E3 is full of electronic gadgetry that is fun, but impractical. The house
boasts a Dollars 100,000 computer network linking appliances and a security
system. It can be operated by touching the computer screen, voice
activation, hand held remote control, wall buttons or touch tone telephone.
The awakening occupants of 'E3' can switch to 'Good morning mood', turn on
their favourite TV programme, open the motorised blinds, and run a bath at a
specified temperature, merely by touching a screen. Returning in the evening
Mr and Mrs E3 might call from their car phones; he to turn on the lights and
start the garden hot tub, she to select music for the outdoor speakers.
Although such automation may seem to be anything but energy efficient, the
computer is crucial in reducing energy consumption and bills. Stan Kataoka,
PG&amp;E's Program manager, says that his company recognises the difficulty of
changing people's habits. The aim is to mitigate energy use for a
Californian life-style and to spread the demand for electricity more evenly
across the day. PG&amp;E charges customers different rates for electricity at
different times. The computer ensures that dishwashers, washing machines
etc. operate only during low-rate periods. The heating system can be
programmed to warm the house to, say, 72 degrees when rates are low,
allowing it to cool to 65 degrees before activating the boiler during peak
periods.
The system is too expensive for most homes, but simpler versions that
control basic functions such as lighting and security are available for less
than Dollars 10,000.
Some of the construction aspects are more widely applicable. Indeed, some of
the energy saving techniques are available now and are only a matter of good
design and construction practice, costing little. The orientation of the
home and the siting of the rooms within it are examples of that. More
costly, but estimated to pay for itself within a year, is the use of an air
infiltration barrier. That is a layer of energy saving synthetic material
wrapped around the home before the external facing is applied.
Those who want to lower their energy bills without buying a new home can
also incorporate some of E3's features. State of the art gas boilers, low
emissivity glass, and low voltage fluorescent lighting can be fitted in
older homes. Glazing which reduces heat loss in winter and reflects the
summer sun is estimated to pay for itself within 5 to 10 years.
Does energy efficiency really bother home owners? Garen McCune, President of
GLM Custom Homes Incorporated, which built the Rocklin house, says American
consumers generally are becoming more worried about the energy efficiency of
their properties. Energy savers like those on display in E3 are requested
more frequently.
The Building Industry Association admits that not all the show home's
features are likely to catch on. For example, E3's extra thick building
shell requires 50 per cent more timber for the studs. Techniques such as the
raised heel truss on the roof - to prevent compression of the insulation -
or the method of wiring to reduct air penetrations are unlikely to be
worthwhile except in extreme climates. Even so, California, which has led
the world in many technological and environmental trends, will be only a
follower when it comes to energy efficiency in the home. Blessed with a mild
climate and relatively low energy prices, Californians have not made energy
use in the home a high priority until environmental concerns forced a change
of attitude. In Rocklin, E3 will be tested and monitored for two years, with
families living in the home during 1993. Meanwhile, builders are expressing
interest and the project's sponsors hope that at least some of E3's features
will become standard in California, long before the 21st century.

FT  30 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Swiss estate agents excluded from
Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Rome Treaty's right of establishment rules may not be relied on by
non-Community nationals to override national laws of an EC member state, the
European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The case, which involved the same Spanish estate agency law considered by
the ECJ in a recent case involving the right of British estate agents to set
up in Spain (FT, May 12), highlights the benefits enjoyed under the Rome
Treaty right of establishment rules by EC nationals.
Mrs Michele Laderer, a Swiss national, was prosecuted for practising as an
estate agent in Alicante without the requisite professional qualifications
and relevant authorisation from the Spanish authorities.
The ECJ ruled that EC law did not prohibit national laws reserving certain
activities to estate agents. But the Court would not answer the question
whether particular aspects of the Spanish rules were compatible with
Community law as the question arose in proceedings concerning a Swiss
national. Mrs Laderer was not a national of a member state and therefore was
not entitled to take advantage of the rules relating to freedom of
establishment within the EC.
C-147/91: Ministerio Fiscal v Michele Ferrer Laderer ECJ 2CH, June 25 1992.
British Gas and Tachometers
In the latest of a long line of cases involving tachographs referred to
Luxembourg by UK courts, the ECJ last week imposed a very narrow
interpretation on an English exception to the general EC rule that all
vehicles used for carrying passengers or goods must be fitted with a 'spy in
the cab'.
English law, in implementing EC law, generally prohibits the carriage of
persons or goods in vehicles not fitted with tachographs, but contains an
exception for vehicles used in connection with certain public services
including those relating to the supply of gas.
In a case involving British Gas vehicles used to carry products connected
both with the supply and distribution of gas, and the selling of gas
appliances, the Court ruled that the exception related to public services
only and the selling of gas appliances to the public was not a public
service. Vehicles used for both purposes must be fitted with tachographs.
British Gas has an exclusive right to supply and distribute gas, whereas it
competes with other companies in selling gas appliances to the public, the
Court said.
If British Gas were allowed to enjoy the benefit of the exception for its
gas appliance activities, it would have an advantage over its competitors
who must fit tachographs to their vehicles.
The ECJ said it was irrelevant that internal UK legislation contained
provisions similar to the EC provisions on driving time, breaks and rest
periods. British Gas would still have a competitive advantage from saving
the cost of installing and maintaining tachographs in their vehicles.
The court interpreted the public service exception to mean that only those
vehicles wholly and exclusively used in connection with the production,
transport or distribution of gas or for the maintenance of installations
used for that purpose could benefit from the tachograph exemption.
C-116/91: Licensing Authority South Eastern Traffic Area v British Gas plc,
ECJ 2CH, June 25 1992.
Greek cash register restrictions removed
In enforcement proceedings brought by the Commission against Greece, the ECJ
held that Greek rules on the certification and purchase of cash registers
infringed the free movement of goods rules in the Rome Treaty. The Greek law
prohibited the sale of cash registers in Greece if the percentage of Greek
value added to them was less than 35 per cent.
The European Commission twice asked for information and explanations from
the Greek government. After two years, the Greek government gave the
information reque-sted. This, however, was outside the time period allowed
by the Commission for replying.
As the Greek government did not contest that the law, which has since been
repealed, was contrary to Community law, the Court had little difficulty in
finding an infringement. Moreover, the behaviour of the national
authorities, in failing to reply in time to the questions put by the
Commission, constituted a breach of Greece's general obligations under the
Rome Treaty.
C-137/91: Commission v Greece, ECJ FC, June 24 1992.
Uniform EC law
In a highly technical case relating to the determination of the price of
certain quantities of olive oil stolen while in intervention storage in
Italy, the ECJ reiterated the principles applicable to a legal situation
purely internal to one member state.
Where the relevant rules to be taken into account were EC provisions, it was
essential that these provisions were uniformly interpreted by the ECJ
notwithstanding the internal situation to which they were being applied.
C-88/91: Federazione italiana dei consorzi agrari v Azienda di stato per gli
interventi nel mercato agricolo, ECJ 4CH, June 25 1992.
Italian Lottery
ECJ President Ole Due has refused to review an earlier interim order made by
him that Italy should take the necessary measures to suspend national
provisions giving the concession for the automatisation of the national
lottery to a particular consortium.
The president held that Italy had not provided evidence of a material change
in circumstances as required under the ECJ's Rules of Procedure for a
successful review.
The position in Italy had changed, to the extent that the national
provisions had been amended. However, the public tender and the grant of the
concession to the consortium in question were still irregular in terms of
Community law.
The basis for the original order requested by the Commission remained
unchanged, therefore.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: Desktop jungle grows more dense - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be a strange thing to complain about, but arguably to day's PC buyer
is spoilt for choice.
In the early 1980s, with desktop computing in its infancy, the serious PC
buyer had a straightforward choice: an Apple II driven by a Motorola 6502
chip; an IBM PC with an Intel 8088 chip inside; or one of the machines with
a Zilog Z-80 central processor unit.
Today there are hundreds of computer manufacturers, many little more than
garage assembly lines, putting their names on boxes of components and
calling them computers.
Most manufacturers offer at least half-a-dozen varieties of desktop PC built
around different microprocessors.
The proliferation of models reflects two factors. Firstly, the rapid advance
of chip technology means the time gap between successive generations of
microprocessor is shrinking. Secondly, growing competition in the
microprocessor market, from companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix and
Chips and Technologies, has prompted Intel, the dominant manufacturer, to
retaliate.
Until recently, the microprocessor market was a sedate business. Ever few
years Intel introduced a new, faster chip which gave PC buyers a relatively
easy upgrade path.
Within each generation, the faster the cpu 'clock' speed (indicated by the
Mhz number), the faster the processor and usually the computer.
For example, a 386 chip running at 33MHz was faster than a 386 running at
25Mhz, but both were slower than any 486.
Things began to get complicated when Intel launched stripped down and
cheaper (SX) versions of its 80386 and 80486 (DX) chips. Then its arch
rival, AMD, launched a 40Mhz version of a 80386 chip which was faster than
Intel's 20Mhz 80486SX chips and stole a sizable chunk of the PC market.
Intel's response has been to launch wave after wave of new 486 processors in
an apparent attempt to plug every conceivable marketing gap. Early this year
it went on record saying it would launch 30 of these new 'second generation'
products in 1992.
To date it has unveiled 16, 20 and 25MHz 486SX chips, a low power 486SL
designed for portable computers, 25, 33 and 50MHz 486DX chips and two 'speed
doubler' 486 DX2 chips which, by using some clever technology, run twice as
fast internally as the rest of the computer.
As if that wasn't enough, it is also launching a set of 'OverDrive' chips
which effectively double the speed of existing 20MHz and 25MHz 486SX
machines.
Intel argues that the new chips are in response to customer needs, and that
the user-installable 'Overdrive' chips, in particular, allow customers to
upgrade their existing machines rather than forcing them to buy new
computers in order to get better performance.
However, more cynical commentators suggest that Intel is simply attempting
to ensure that its chip-making rivals are locked out of the market. Whatever
the motive, the proliferation of chip types is confusing for the end-user,
particularly because there is no agreed way of measuring performance.
PC manufacturers will often quote a machine's 'Landmark' speed as an
indication of performance. Although a large number of performance
benchmarking tests exist, the results can be misleading. Even two machines
built around the same chip running at the same speed can deliver
dramatically different performances.
That is because performance also depends on a wide range of other factors
including what software is being run, the speed of peripherals such as hard
disks, and the speed of the random access memory and other chips and
components in the machine.
Confused yet? Even if you are not, the chances are you soon will be. Intel
will shortly be launching a brand new, high-end microprocessor, code-named
P5, and we can only guess how many flavours that will come in.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Technology: What you see is what you get / Examining an
electronic publishing system that maintains its 'look and feel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal computers are great for producing feature-rich documents enhanced
with special typefaces, colour graphics, photographs and charts which make
them more lively and easier to read. When someone else wants to read the
document in its original form, the problems begin.
Unless the recipient is using the same sort of computer equipment and the
same software packages, a document can usually only be electronically
transmitted in a dull basic (Ascii) text form, losing most of its special
features when it is viewed on another screen.
Usually, therefore, the document is printed out before being distributed,
adding to the piles of paper which already clutter offices. Not only has
this meant that the paperless office remains a dream, it has also imposed
severe limitations on the format of electronic publishing, including
electronic mail.
However Adobe Systems, the Californian company which has pioneered the
sophisticated PostScript page description language for printers, believes it
has the answer with technology which was code-named Carousel during its
early developmental stages.
Carousel software can distribute electronically a document from one desktop
computer to any other computer while preserving its exact 'look and feel'.
For example, a document could be sent via an office network from an IBM PC
on one desk to an Apple computer running a different operating system and
software on another desk, and then viewed on screen, manipulated, or
printed.
Adobe claims its new technology, based on PostScript, may have a profound
effect on the electronic distribution of information and on business
electronic publishing.
The technology will make it much easier to publish electronic documents on
computer disks or on CD-Rom and will reduce the need to distribute
documents. Today, a CD-Rom publisher must prepare data in different forms
for every type of computer, but by including the Carousel software on the
disk any PC could read it.
A newspaper, magazine, or newsletter publisher will be able to transmit to a
subscriber's screen an electronic version that looks exactly like the
original. If required, the subscriber could then print out the page, or read
it on his computer screen. Electronic newspapers could even be distributed
via cable TV.
Carousel raises some thorny legal questions. How will publishers protect
copyrighted materials if computer users can rapidly and cheaply reproduce
and distribute them? It may also prove impossible for the recipient of an
electronic newsletter to verify that the text he is reading on what looks
like a genuine copy has not been altered. For publishers, the advent of this
new generation of electronic publishing technology represents both an
opportunity and a challenge.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to help yourself -
Britain's small firms' minister is keen to make the most of existing
enterprise networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike Belgian small businesses, which have their own Ministry for the
Middle Classes, Britain's small firms must make do with a junior minister at
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
But just two months into her new job, Baroness Denton, the first woman to
hold the small firms' portfolio, has already impressed business lobbyists
with her practical approach to the issues. Unlike her immediate
predecessors, Baroness Denton has a business background. She spent much of
her career in marketing in the motor industry followed by five years as
deputy chairman of the Black Country Development Corporation.
Not that any radical change in government policies towards small firms seems
imminent. Concessions to small businesses in the shape of subsidised loans
or other special programmes would have to be paid for by loading the cost on
to other businesses. 'I am not sure that either money or legislation is what
small business needs,' she says.
The baroness is no more willing than her predecessors to give way to the
small firms' lobby for changes in the law to overcome the problem of late
payments.
She has been writing to the chairmen of selected large companies - some of
whom sit with her in the House of Lords - urging them to pay more speedily.
But she believes small businesses could do more to solve the problem
themselves, by tightening up on the terms in their contracts and complaining
more loudly if customers delay.
The British government is anyway waiting to see what proposals on late
payments come from the European Commission, which has been working on this
issue for more than a year.
As part of a programme to get to know the small business sector, Baroness
Denton has been holding talks with the banks, who have been criticised for
their high-handed attitudes. 'I have no illusion about the fact that the
banks will remain the chief source of finance for small business,' she said.
But they may have make do without the protection of the government's Loan
Guarantee Scheme, which has been under review. The banks regard loans made
under the scheme as last resort lending and in the present economic climate,
many banks are reluctant to make loans to good quality businesses, the
baroness notes. 'The scheme started in 1981, which is not a bad life. The
climate now is very different to the one in which it was started. There
should be evolutionary change going on.'
The main thrust of the government's small firms policy appears to be towards
getting the best value from partnerships: between small businesses and
large; between business support networks such as the Training and Enterprise
Councils (Tecs) and the chambers of commerce and small firms; and between
academic institutions, including schools, and business.
'How can we transfer wealth - not just finance but knowledge - from large to
small companies?' Baroness Denton asks. Large companies could make unused
space on their in-house training schemes available to small businesses or
open their training centres to small firms at weekends, she suggests.
This marks a continuation of the direction which policy has taken in recent
months. Two initiatives were a pilot scheme run by five local enterprise
agencies to establish 'marriage bureaux' to bring private investors and
entrepreneurs together and a scheme to help trade associations develop ways
of overcoming the problem of the slow payment of debts.
The new small firms' minister also wants business organisations such as the
Tecs and the chambers to play a greater role in helping businesses in
trouble. 'I am concerned that we are losing companies which are trading
profitably.' Banks might be persuaded to let these organisations help
businesses sort out their problems instead of rushing to call in the
receiver.
Baroness Denton believes there is scope for the Tecs to do more to develop
their enterprise role alongside their more generously funded responsibility
for training. It should also be possible for the DTI's regional offices to
make more use of their industry knowledge, she says.
It remains to be seen whether this hands-off approach, persuading a myriad
of intermediary agencies to work more effectively, will prove effective.
Small business owners themselves often prefer to work with independent
organisations rather than those which they see as representing the heavy
hand of government. But making the spark of enterprise travel along this
network may need a more obvious and more generously-funded commitment from
government.
And even if this issue can be tackled, Baroness Denton faces a problem which
dogs all small firms' ministers. Many of the decisions which most closely
affect small firms, on interest rates, taxes and social security charges,
are taken in other departments - the Treasury or Social Services. Over these
she can have little influence.

business culture
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few areas of business can have received quite the degree of attention over
the past decade as that accorded to the small business and its owner writes
Charles Batchelor.
Surprisingly, for all this scrutiny, large gaps still remain in the picture
we have of small firms.
A wide-ranging survey of the sector has now been completed by Cambridge
University's Small Business Research Centre.
The State of British Enterprise* provides the first comprehensive overview
of Britain's small firms since the Bolton Committee Report 21 years ago, its
authors claim.
The study, which will be launched at a one-day conference in Cambridge today
provides some unexpected insights into the small firms' community while at
the same time confirming some of the conclusions reached by earlier
research.
The typical business leader was aged between 45 and 49 years and had headed
the business for eight years at the time of the survey. The typical company
board was composed of three directors, one of whom had a degree or
professional qualification.
On average, businesses made a pre-tax profit of 7.5 per cent of turnover,
though this figure was higher for enterprises employing fewer than 10
people, fast growing businesses and those in the services sector.
Among the areas covered by the researchers were:
MARKETS AND COMPETITION
Most of the businesses surveyed depended on a relatively small number of
customers - a factor which may explain their reluctance to take a tougher
line on the late payment of debts - and had few competitors.
More than 70 per cent said they did not regard overseas competition as a
serious threat.
Business owners ranked 'personal attention to client needs' as the most
important competitive factor followed by an established reputation,
specialised expertise and product quality.
They put a low priority on product design, cost advantage and marketing,
while price was given a middle rating.
Collaboration agreements were common with nearly one third of enterprises
having agreed formal or informal partnerships with other organisations,
mainly suppliers or customers.
GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND CONSTRAINTS
The availability and cost of finance remained the most serious constraint
despite the range of government and bank schemes which have been launched.
A lack of marketing, sales and management skills and a shortage of skilled
labour were also barriers to growth, indicating a need for more action by
Training and Enterprise Councils and the government.
Most firms - 64 per cent - said they wanted to grow moderately over the next
three years but 23 per cent planned substantial growth. This suggests that
the small firms' sector has considerable potential despite the recession.
Many of the companies used outside advisers, with a strong link apparent
between the amount of external advice taken and the rate of growth of the
business.
Tax and financial management was the most common area in which outside
advice was used (62 per cent of firms) followed by computer services (48 per
cent) and marketing and business strategy (30 per cent).
PROFITABILITY AND FINANCE
Profit margins had declined over the previous three years, particularly when
interest payments were taken into account.
Despite their having identified raising finance as their main constraint,
two-thirds of the businesses surveyed had sought additional finance in the
previous three years and most had found it.
Banks were the most important source of finance but hire purchase and
leasing also played a significant role.
There was some evidence that businesses were diversifying their sources of
finance.
Fewer depended exclusively on overdrafts and greater use was being made of
fixed interest borrowing.
ACQUISITIONS
About one-fifth of the businesses surveyed had acquired one or more firms in
the previous five years and between them, the total number of acquisitions
amounted to 600.
The main motives were to capture market share, to diversify and to achieve
economies of scale.
One in five had also been the target of a bid approach, usually from a
larger company, though most were against being acquired in the short-term.
ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY
Nearly one-third of the firms considered they had received no help from
government policy over the past decade.
The way the government had conducted interest rate policy was seen as
particularly harmful.
Lower taxes and improved incentives to invest were perceived as the most
beneficial policy initiatives which government could take.
The particular value of the Cambridge research lies in the number of
enterprises questioned - more than 2,000 in both manufacturing and service
sectors from throughout Britain - and the opportunity it provided to impose
a common format on questions over a wide range of business issues.
The research covered businesses which employed up to 500 people although
half employed between 10 and 99.
Half of the enterprises had been formed during the 1980s while 28 per cent
had been set up before 1969.
Densely packed with graphs and tables and with a text which makes no
concessions to the casual reader, The State of British Enterprise is more a
work of reference than a book to be read for its narrative thread.
It should provide a valuable source of material for organisations which
provide services to business and policy-makers in both the private and
public sectors.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour women to flex poll muscle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S women MPs are planning to use their muscle for a collective assault
in the forthcoming elections to the shadow cabinet.
With their numbers up from 21 in the last parliament to 37 today, the newly
energised women's committee believes that careful strategic voting might
even double female representation in the parliamentary leadership.
There are at present just four women occupants - Mrs Margaret Beckett, Ms
Ann Clwyd, Ms Ann Taylor and Ms Jo Richardson - of the 18 shadow cabinet
seats elected each year.
But at a Commons meeting of the committee last week, an outline plan was
agreed to try to secure six or more places when the votes are counted next
month.
Under Labour's rules - aimed at improving the gender balance - ballot papers
for shadow Cabinet positions are only valid when MPs have included at least
three votes for women. With 271 Labour MPs, that guarantees 813 votes for
women candidates.
The plan now being discussed by the group is to create a 'recommended' list
of women candidates and to ensure that others who might not normally be
expected to win enough votes are given substantial support by their female
colleagues.
Labour's women MPs were wary of discussing the plan in detail yesterday, and
one prominent member of the women's committee insisted it was too early to
talk of a formal 'slate' being drawn up. That would suggest specific
candidates were being picked out, she said. Instead, women would merely be
asked to ensure that they included more than three votes for group members.
Beneficiaries might include Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Clare Short, Ms Marjorie
Mowlam and Ms Hilary Armstrong.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Buildings shake-up urged in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH of the increase in UK student numbers planned for the 1990s could be
accommodated in existing buildings if better use was made of them, according
to a report by the university and polytechnic funding councils.
More than half the 300,000 increase in students could be accommodated if
higher education institutions improved space management and remodelled
existing buildings, the report says.
An additional 117,000 places would be needed by the end of the century,
however, plus extra spending on equipment, libraries, central support and
social facilities. The report, published yesterday, recommends the creation
of a higher-education finance corporation to facilitate borrowing from
financial institutions.
Proposals for making better use of existing space in universities and
polytechnics include:
Increasing the size of teaching groups.
Opening teaching space for longer hours and on Saturdays.
Addition of a fourth term or switching to the three-semester system (where
the present three terms are lengthened, with students divided into groups
that attend only two of the three terms).
Universities and polytechnics would find it easier to raise finance on the
capital markets if government-imposed restraints on using their assets to
raise funds were lifted. Lincolnshire County Council is likely to provide
Pounds 10m as initial financing for a university in Lincoln, Paul
Cheeseright writes.
Nottingham Polytechnic has been chosen to supervise the opening of and
manage a university college in the city by 1996, and create an independent
university early next century. A meeting of the council's education
committee recommended the funding.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Annual statement pledge for pension schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS OF occupational pension schemes are to be given a new entitlement to
an annual statement saying how much their savings are worth, the government
said yesterday.
The government committed itself to the move in its formal response to the
report on the Maxwell affair from the cross-party social security committee
of the last parliament.
The change in the law is, however, unlikely to be immediate. It will
probably be carried out along with the conclusions of the committee given
the task of reviewing pension law and regulation earlier this month. The
committee, to be chaired by Professor Roy Goode of Oxford University, is to
publish a consultation paper within a few weeks.
While the government has accepted the main recommendations of the social
security committee, it continues to argue that it does not have any special
responsibility for members of the BIHL pension scheme - the company that was
sold to Robert Maxwell by British Airways in 1986, when BA was still
publicly owned.
Ministers say BA's articles of association meant that the transport
secretary had to be notified of the decision, but did not have any right of
consent.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has also moved to tighten
information provision for pension scheme members. Information that must now
be provided, under regulations laid yesterday, includes details about the
Occupational Pensions Advisory Service and the ombudsman.
The other members of the pension law review committee were announced
yesterday. They are: Mr Tony Atkinson, professor at the London School of
Economics, Mr David Berridge, Scottish Equitable Life Assurance chief
executive, Mr Harvie Brown, actuary at William Mercer Fraser Ltd, Mr Bryan
Hines, former ICI general manager of insurance and investments, Mr Stuart
James, a partner at Rowe and Maw, Mr Terence Libby, Morrisflex chief
executive, Mr Alastair Ross-Goobey, James Capel chief investment strategist,
Ms Patricia Triggs, a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock and Ms Sue
Ward, a freelance journalist and researcher on pensions issues.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Call for government review to cover state benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Institute of Actuaries, the trade association whose members advise the
pensions industry, has called for the government to expand its review of
occupational pensions to cover state benefits as well.
Mr John Martin, president of the Institute of Actuaries, said yesterday that
the patchwork legislation underpinning state benefits was becoming
unworkable and hampered effective private-sector pension provision.
He said: 'Unless the tax and regulatory regime for pensions in the UK is
given a thorough overhaul, employers will become increasingly discouraged
from making proper provision for employee pensions.'
He criticised the recent trend of employers to provide so-called 'money
purchase' pensions, which guarantee a lump sum upon retirement that is often
too small because of inflation.
Mr Martin urged actuaries to encourage employers to guarantee annual pension
increases pegged to inflation, and said that schemes that allowed increases
at trustees' discretion 'give rise to insecurity and discontent'.
He added: 'I believe that the much sought-after financial comfort in one's
physically uncomfortable old age can come more readily from an index-linked
scheme related to earnings near retirement.'
The government has deferred introduction of a law passed two years ago that
would have required employers to guarantee annual pension rises equal to 5
per cent or the retail prices index, whichever is lower.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Lending underlines economic troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LENDING by the nine biggest commercial banks has remained subdued, according
to figures released yesterday supporting theories that the economy is still
some way from a strong uplift.
The British Bankers Association, which released the statistics, said
sterling lending by the nine totalled Pounds 706m in the three months to
May, compared with Pounds 2.2bn in the previous three months.
On a seasonally adjusted basis - which takes into account the normally weak
demand for borrowing by companies and individuals in the spring - the figure
for between March and May comes to Pounds 3.1bn. That is in contrast to the
Pounds 1.8bn seasonally adjusted figure for the previous three months.
The association warned that the seasonally adjusted figures may give a
flawed view of borrowing trends. In recent years, companies have especially
required smaller loans in the spring, when cashflow is traditionally high.
But such seasonal fluctuations - for which the adjusted figures attempt to
compensate - may not apply when the country is in recession.
According to the unadjusted figures, people borrowed Pounds 1.6bn from the
nine banks between March and May, while companies repaid about Pounds 900m.
Manufacturers repaid Pounds 511m and construction groups Pounds 370m.
The increase in personal borrowing was largely accounted for by lending for
house purchase. However, the association said the rise was probably due to
banks' taking a greater share of the mortgage market, rather than to an
upturn.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Councils close to a deal with white-collar workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities moved close to a pay deal with 750,000 white-collar
workers yesterday as union leaders advised that rises of between 4 per cent
and 4.4 per cent were the best that could be achieved through negotiation.
The proposed deal will set the tone for talks covering 1m blue-collar
workers. It would raise the pay bill by 4.1 per cent, although an earlier
settlement covering residential social workers will add another 0.2 per
cent.
The offer is weighted to favour the lowest-paid, who would gain rises of 4.4
per cent. Those at the top end of the scale would receive 4 per cent.
Although it would be the lowest settlement for white-collar workers in
recent years - and below the inflation rate of 4.3 per cent - it comes at a
time when workers generally are reluctant to take industrial action.
Negotiators for Nalgo, the largest union among council white-collar workers,
traditionally recommend strike action, but only once in the past seven years
has their advice been heeded.
Union leaders want to concentrate on winning a 'yes' vote for a merger with
the Nupe and Cohse unions. The amalgamation ballot is scheduled to take
place at the end of this year.
Nalgo negotiators believe industrial action would achieve little. Mr Dennis
Reed, Nalgo's local government officer, said the offer did not meet the
union's objectives but members were presented with the stark choice of an
unsatisfactory offer or strike action.
The proposed deal will be be presented to the union's local government group
on July 22.

<DATELINE>
   NUMISMATISTS have struck gold
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Royal Mint has issued 35,000 gold 50p pieces to commemorate Britain's
presidency of the European Commission.
The gold version costs Pounds 375 and weighs 26.32 grammes. Shoppers will
have to make do with a lighter version, in cupro-nickel, the alloy used in
the present 50p pieces.
Perhaps in an effort to mirror the EC itself, the meaning of the design on
the reverse side is less than immediately apparent.
Its freelance designer, Ms Mary Milner Dickens, won an international
competition to design the coin. Her 50p depicts the 12 EC capitals as stars
on a conference table. The criss-crossed lines represent the national
interconnections formed by the completion of the single market in 1993.
More confusingly, around the table are 12 cubes, intended to represent
member states' seats, although some appear to be less firmly under the table
than others.
'It was purely to make an interesting design on the face of the heptagon, to
make it look good and to fill the space in an interesting way,' Ms Milner
Dickens said yesterday. 'I don't expect everyone to like it; they never do.'
Mark Wickens, creative head of Wickens Tutt Southgate, the London design
agency, said: 'I think it's awful. It's over-complex. There are the stars of
Europe and the seats, 24 elements on a coin just one inch high.
'Quite a lot of British coin design is pretty good, there's a classic
simplicity that makes the coins look like they are worth the money they
represent. With this . . . it's almost lowest common denominator styling.
Very bland.'

FT  30 JUN 92 / BCCI creditors drop compensation appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK creditors' committee of Bank of Credit and Commerce International has
dropped its appeal against a High Court ruling that sanctioned a Dollars
1.7bn compensation package negotiated between Touche Ross, the liquidators,
and the bank's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
The creditors abandoned their appeal when they were told that they might be
personally liable for costs in the action rather than being able to recover
appeal costs from BCCI assets.
A similar ruling to the UK approval in Grand Cayman left the liquidators
seeking one final approval in Luxembourg today to get all the court
approvals necessary for the agreement to proceed.
Agreement to the package by the Luxembourg court would leave Touche Ross
needing acceptances from creditors representing 51 per cent of the
identified liabilities before it begins making staged payments to creditors
early next year.
According to Touche Ross, the deal should return to the creditors between 30
and 40 per cent of their original investment.

ABOUT 400 aircraft maintenance staff at Dan Air Engineering have started a
work-to-rule and partial overtime ban to force FLS Aerospace, the Danish
owner of the company, to improve a 6 per cent pay offer. They expect flights
from Manchester, Stansted and Gatwick airports to be disrupted.
Dan Air, which is not involved, sold its maintenance business to FLS last
year. Employees say they have not had a pay rise for more than two years.
Meanwhile, FLS has since acquired FFV, another maintenance company, staff of
which are higher-paid.
MSF, the management, science and finance union, says some FFV employees earn
up to 20 per cent more than Dan Air Engineering counterparts. The union may
recommend acceptance of 8 per cent this year if movement is promised towards
parity between the two sets of workers.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Job survey lifts hope for union chiefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   UNION density figures
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the proportion of union members to the total workforce - have made gloomy
reading for union leaders for more than a decade.
The latest Department of Employment Labour Force Survey (LFS) showed density
slipping to 37.5 per cent of the workforce last year.
However, the survey, plus unpublished data from the Engineering Employers
Federation, provides a few fragments of hope for union bosses as well as
some statistical curiosities.
The density figure for part-time workers - a growing but
difficult-to-unionise part of the workforce - grew slightly from 21 per cent
to 22 per cent last year, according to the Labour Research Department
analysis of the LFS.
That helps to explain why union density for women, who make up the bulk of
part-time workers, stayed at 32 per cent last year while male density
dropped from 43 per cent to 42 per cent.
Manual workers are still more likely to be in unions than white-collar
workers - 41 per cent compared with 35 per cent - but union density is
highest of all in 'professional occupations', possibly explained by high
unionisation among teachers. The lowest level of unionisation is among
'sales occupations', at 15 per cent.
Only nine of 49 job categories saw union density rise last year - one was
property dealers, no doubt responding to the threat of redundancy in the
troubled estates market. The biggest fall in union density was in the water
industry - 82 per cent to 74 per cent - probably as a result of
privatisation in England and Wales in 1988.
Next came telecommunications (80 per cent to 73 per cent) as a result of job
transfers from unionised British Telecom to non-union Mercury.
In the 1980s, union density fell sharply everywhere except in the public
sector. Even manufacturing, the heartland of unionisation in the private
sector, saw a big fall in density and not just in absolute numbers. The
manufacturing workforce has fallen from 7m in 1979 to about 4.5m.
According to LFS figures, union density was about 58 per cent in
manufacturing in 1984 and had fallen to 47 per cent by 1989. Department of
Employment statisticians believe it is now just above 40 per cent. That is
not because there has been widespread derecognition where unions are already
established, but because the few new manufacturing jobs, often in the
electronics sector, are generally not unionised.
Within manufacturing companies there has been a reduction in hourly paid
manual employment and an increase in white-collar and professional jobs,
which are less likely to be unionised.
A detailed survey of about a quarter of the 5,000-plus companies affiliated
to the Engineering Employers Federation shows that the engineering core of
manufacturing remains solidly unionised. Of 1,300 companies surveyed, 62 per
cent recognise unions for collective bargaining, representing 79 per cent of
the total number of workers employed by the sample.
A total of 86 per cent of hourly paid workers in those companies are covered
by collective bargaining and a surprisingly high 69 per cent of staff. There
is interest in simplifying collective bargaining and harmonising conditions
between white and blue-collar workers, but only 7 per cent of the companies
negotiate for both groups together.
The likelihood of collective bargaining rises with the size of
establishment. All those with more than 1,000 workers have collective
bargaining.

GALLAHER, the US cigarette manufacturer, is to be sued by a smoker with a
rare circulatory disorder.
The case, believed to be the first of its kind in the UK, is expected to go
before the Northern Ireland High Court in 1994.
Mr John Dean, 37, from Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease,
which causes the veins and arteries to close.
He claims he had to quit work as an electrician seven years ago because of
the disorder, allegedly caused by smoking since he was a teenager.
Mr Cormac Fitzpatrick, his solicitor, said yesterday that the action could
have far-reaching implications for the tobacco industry. 'There are at least
three other cases pending in the background,' he said. 'Other solicitors
will be looking to the result of this hearing.'
Gallaher said it would defend the case vigorously. 'We are confident that we
have a good defence,' it added.

<TEXT>
THE CROWN Estate, which manages property owned by the sovereign, is being
sued by the operators of one of the oldest ferry services in Europe over
moves to close the route.
White Horse Ferries is seeking damages after the Crown Estate ordered the
company to halt services between Tilbury and Gravesend, the Thameside towns
linked by a river crossing uninterrupted since 1086.
The estate commissioners say White Horse is breaching the sovereign's
'ancient rights to run a ferry' on the river. The company bought the service
last year from Sealink Stena, but lawyers acting for the Crown say the route
franchise was non-transferable.
Franchises from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign. The
Crown says White Horse has the right to operate in one direction only, from
Gravesend to Tilbury.
White Horse says moves to close the route have depressed passenger numbers
and increased operating losses.
The Crown Estate is seeking talks in an attempt to avoid legal action and
negotiate a franchise. It said it had taken legal advice and decided it had
no obligation to keep the service running. 'We hope it won't come to that,'
it added. A high-speed cross-Channel passenger-only ferry service will link
Brighton with Dieppe from July 18. It will be run by Advanced Channel
Express, a subsidiary of Constructions Mechaniques de Normandie, the
military shipbuilder.

FACED with a challenge, the Japanese reach for a catchword. Grappling with
the problems of an economic downturn and of economic frictions with the US
and Europe, Japanese industrialists have lighted on kyosei - symbiosis.
The word first appeared a few weeks ago in speeches by Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa,
the chairman of the Keidanren, the powerful employers' federation. Last week
it was enshrined in a Keidanren report which urged Japan and its trading
partners to 'find a way to accomplish kyosei'.
In the Keidanren's view, kyosei means establishing a framework for fair
competition between companies by harmonising rules and business conditions
in the world's three largest markets - the EC, the US and Japan.
The report takes the federation into a controversial area. It acknowledges
that reforming trade regulations will not of itself create fair markets or
ease trade frictions. Instead, companies themselves must change.
Keidanren says American (and by implication European) companies must become
more competitive, partly be adopting well-respected Japanese practices such
as long-term business planning, comprehensive quality control and close
relations between management and labour.
For their part, Japanese companies should abandon the excessive pursuit of
market share, over-long working hours, and opaque commercial relations with
business partners. In other words, western companies must try harder while
Japanese groups should ease up a bit.
While western companies might bristle at being given advice by the
Keidanren, few would seriously quarrel with the federation's prescriptions.
What is far less clear is whether Japanese companies really will change in
the direction the Keidanren suggests or whether kyosei is just a verbal
smokescreen.
Perhaps change will come, in response to pressures such as a huge leap in
the cost of capital since the late 1980s, coupled to growing labour
shortages in Japan. These forces will eventually compel companies to pay
more attention to securing profits and less to winning market share at any
price.
But such a shift will not necessarily make Japanese companies any less
competitive in international markets. Moreover, changes could take a long
time to start working. 'If Japanese companies are to change at all, it will
take 50 years,' says Mr Masashi Kojima, president of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, Japan's largest corporation.
The argument started with an article in Bungei Shunju, a magazine, by Mr
Akio Morita, the outspoken chairman of Sony, the electronics group, which
said western companies paid their employees more than Japanese groups,
granted longer holidays, handed out higher dividends to shareholders and
made greater voluntary contributions to charity. Mr Morita urged Japanese
corporations to close the gap to head off criticism that Japan had unfair
advantages in competing with the west.
Mr Morita's comments provoked strong reactions, mainly from those who
believe the Japanese economic system has great merits which should not be
forgotten in some chimerical pursuit of international norms. Mr Haruo
Hamada, a professor of Keio University, argued in the same magazine that
Japan's economy suffers from the legacy of post-war protectionism and
government intervention. These elements had to be reformed by deregulation.
But the economy had also developed great strengths - including keiretsu,
industrial groupings in which companies forge close mutually-supporting
links.
Mr Yotaro IIda, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the engineering
combine, wrote that there was nothing new in western criticism of Japan, so
there was no need for a new response. 'The basic attitude of Japanese
industry is to work with sweat on your brow and oil in your hands and to
make money from the results of hard labour.'
This argument about the virtues of Japanese workers was made in extreme form
by Mr Shintaro Ishihara, the maverick right-wing politician, who wrote, also
in Bungei Shunju, that Japan's competitive advantages were due to its
long-standing cultural differences between Japan and the west, not to
commercial rules introduced in the last 100 years. Mr Morita had denied the
'history and the uniqueness of the Japanese race', said Mr Ishihara.
However, within the Keidanren, Mr Morita's views gained ground, not least
because as a vice chairman he is one of its most influential members.
Nevertheless, as the report shows, exhortations to Japanese companies to
change their ways have been matched with an acknowledgement of some of
Japan's industrial strengths and an appeal to western companies to study
Japan's merits.
In one important way, Japanese companies are already committed to putting
the report into practice - they are reducing working hours by cutting over
time. The aim is to achieve a target of 1,800 hours work a year, down from
2,050 hours, including 185 hours of overtime, in 1990. However, current
reductions in overtime are largely a response to the economic slow down. The
real test will come when the economy recovers.

power station development.
Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), Siemens, Maeda Corporation, and Ringo Trading of
China, said they would build a combined cycle gas and steam power station
with a final capacity of 1,300MW. The first 450MW unit would cost HKDollars
2bn (Pounds 139m).
Earlier this year Kumagai was awarded the right to develop the Yangpu free

PRESIDENT Patricio Aylwin's government has won a solid vote of confidence in
the first municipal elections to be held in Chile since 1973, with the
ruling coalition of Christian Democrats and left-wing parties polling 53.3
per cent of the votes in Sunday's contest.
The president, who is now more than half way through his four-year term,
said the vote gave him a clear mandate to reform the anti-democratic
constitution inherited from the military.
Having cleared the municipal hurdle, the government appears set to win
presidential and parliamentary elections, to be held in December 1993.
Chile's right-wing opposition alliance fell short of expectation, polling
29.8 per cent of the votes - four points below their showing in the 1989
general election.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Fed chairman faces pressure for rates cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, is under increasing pressure to
lower US interest rates following a presidential demand last week to do so.
Whether or not he will resist this pressure is to be settled at today's
meeting of the Fed's open market committee, which sets guidelines for
monetary policy.
President George Bush said in an interview with the New York Times last
week: 'I'd like to see another lowering of interest rates. I think there's
room to do that.'
Unless a batch of economic statistics due this week is stronger than
expected, the betting on Wall Street is that the Fed will lower rates again.
Mr Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,
believes pressure on Mr Greenspan will prove 'irresistible'. However, he and
other analysts say the Fed may delay the cut to avoid appearing to respond
to overt political pressure.
If the Fed decides to ease, a move could come before Mr Greenspan delivers
his Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony on July 21. Most likely would
be a quarter point cut in the overnight federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent.
This might be accompanied by a half point cut in the discount rate to 3 per
cent if the Fed felt the need to send a powerful expansionary signal to
financial markets.
The mounting pressure for another interest rate cut will seem puzzling
outside the US.
The Commerce Department has just reported growth in the first quarter at an
annual rate of 2.7 per cent, stronger than in most big economies. The dollar
is weak and inflation is running at about 3.5 per cent, well above the level
that would be regarded as desirable in Japan or Germany. US rates, moreover,
are already at their lowest level in a generation.
US analysts see things differently. They fear economic growth in the current
quarter will fall well short of the first quarter rate, mainly because of a
slowdown in consumer spending and housing, which powered the first phase of
recovery. Figures for new home sales released yesterday showed a 5.6 per
cent decline in May, the fourth monthly fall in a row.
The fear is that a slowdown in domestic demand will feed through into
renewed weakness of industrial production and jobs.

<TEXT>
MR S. Venkitaramanan, India's central bank governor, yesterday sharply
criticised unnamed foreign banks which he accused of fraudulently making
profits on their Indian operations. In an interview for Eyewitness, an
Indian video news magazine, Mr Venkitaramanan said that among those who
would have to bear losses of the Bombay financial scandal were 'the banks
from outside who have defrauded us in order to make profits'. He did not
spell out which banks he had in mind.
Earlier, he said Standard Chartered, the British bank which is one of two
foreign institutions so far officially implicated in the scandal, had been
'responsible for part of the system's failure; its own systems failed, its
management did not know'. The bank had 'brought in Dollars 800m (Pounds
432m) already' to cover its losses or strengthen its liquidity in India.
The bank, which has not been charged with any offences, declined to confirm
this figure, far exceeding the Pounds 50m provisions Standard Chartered had
earlier announced. It is known to have brought in further funds to
strengthen its liquidity in the event of a run on its branches. Mr Parvesh
Nat, Standard Chartered's chief executive, was suspended by the bank on
Friday. Four expatriate employees also face possible questioning, Central
Bureau of Investigation officials said.
Mr Venkitaramanan's remarks came on a day when the Australian-owned ANZ
Grindlays announced it was making Rs5.06bn available against anticipated
losses by its Indian branch. In making provisions, it was following Reserve
Bank directives. Grindlays had credited the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, the
Bombay broker now under arrest, with cheques for over Rs5bn (Pounds 96m)
made out to National Housing Bank.
The Australian bank, in dispute with NHB, claims it was following normal
securities trading practice in crediting Mr Mehta's account. Mr
Venkitaramanan said he believed banks in India would recover over two-thirds
of the Rs30bn they are officially said to have lost. He declined to accept
moral responsibility for the scandal, claiming credit for uncovering it.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese cabinet today is set to approve a five-year economic plan
stressing growth in domestic demand, as Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister,
prepares to leave this afternoon for Washington, London and the Munich
economic summit.
The plan, however, includes no immediate stimulus to the economy as called
for by the business community in Japan and by foreign political leaders. It
has nothing to do with a separate package of measures to stimulate the
economy proposed at the weekend by the ruling Liberal Democratic party, on
which the government is not expected to act for at least 2 1/2 months.
In effect, Mr Miyazawa will embark on his trip empty-handed in the face of
rising international pressure on Japan to take measures that will reverse
the steep decline in economic growth. The government is none the less hoping
the five-year plan will help to deflect criticism that Japan is not doing
enough to spur the economy and tame its huge trade surplus.
'The main thrust of the measures is that Japan is still determined to pursue
internal demand-led growth,' said Mr Koichiro Matsuura, deputy foreign
minister, yesterday. 'We made a departure from this growth plan in the past
year.' Japan's trade surplus has soared in the past year, as the economy has
slowed down.
The plan calls for Japanese economic growth to average 3.5 per cent over the
next five years, with an annual 3.75 per cent expansion of domestic demand
and an annual 0.25 per cent shrinkage in external demand. This is to be
achieved in part by increased government spending aimed at improving the
quality of life, for example in housing. Working hours are also to be cut.
Mr Miyazawa will stop for two days in Washington where he and US President
George Bush will review the progress of an action plan on bilateral trade
agreed by the two leaders in January, when Mr Bush visited Tokyo. A speech
at the National Press Club and an interview on ABC television by Mr Miyazawa
are aimed at sprucing up Japan's tarnished US image.
Mr Miyazawa will then travel to London, where he will confer with Mr John
Major before proceeding to Munich. Britain tomorrow takes over the
presidency of the European Community.

ISRAELI police yesterday detained, questioned and then released 17 members
of the Palestinian Middle East talks negotiating team who broke Israeli law
by holding a public meeting in Jordan with Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, reports Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The Palestinian negotiators from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, led
by Mr Faisal Husseini, met Mr Arafat a few days before the Israeli election
in an attempt to embarrass Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the outgoing prime minister,
and his Likud party.
The episode has highlighted the tenuous nature of Israel's claim to have
kept the PLO out of the negotiations and is awkward for Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Labour party leader and prime minister-elect.
Labour policy is to repeal the controversial laws which forbid contact with
the PLO, but Mr Rabin wants to avoid a de facto endorsement of negotiations
with it, especially during delicate negotiations on a Labour-led coalition.

EC FINANCE ministers yesterday set minimum capital requirements for banks

which shares could be traded across the Community.
The last piece of a ministerial accord on the Capital Adequacy Directive
(CAD) fell into place when ministers agreed levels of start-up capital for
new dealers in securities. These were set at Ecu50,000 (Pounds 35,100) for
firms acting as middlemen, but not allowed to hold clients money or
securities themselves; Ecu125,000 for firms dealing on investors' orders or
managing portfolios; and Ecu730,000 for large firms allowed to take market
positions on their own account.
The UK expressed itself satisfied these had been brought down from levels
earlier demanded by Spain and some other countries. Earlier this month
ministers agreed other aspects of the CAD, which is to provide the
prudential underpinning for investment firms - banks as well as stockbrokers
 -to get a 'single passport' to trade EC-wide.
On the highly political issue of aligning indirect tax rates attempts were
made to get Britain to drop its objection to the Community legislating on
value added tax (VAT) rates.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Italy fields economic team with attacking flair: The Amato
government is facing an uphill task imposing unpopular measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RED chair reserved for the finance minister was noticeably empty when
the new Italian cabinet of Prof Giuliano Amato met to be sworn in.
Mr Giovanni Goria, the new minister, kept everyone waiting for 40 minutes
because his aircraft had been delayed. The new government can ill afford
delays as it sets out to tackle an alarming array of problems, the most
pressing being the economy.
Mr Goria, the 49-year-old Christian Democrat agriculture minister in the
outgoing government, is the one politician in the new economic team. This
underscores Prof Amato's intention to allow as much space as possible to the
technocrats, even if politically unpopular polices have to be introduced. Mr
Goria was finance minister from 1982 to 1987 under Mr Bettino Craxi, the
Socialist leader; and in that period he had to tackle the end of a recession
similar to the present. This experience should stand him in good stead and
ensure proper co-ordination at the political level with the prime minister
and the parties in parliament.
One of the most negative features of the previous Andreotti government was
that the budget and finance ministries, along with the prime minister's
office, constantly outmanoeuvred the Treasury, staffed by Mr Guido Carli,
the former governor of the Bank of Italy.
Indeed, Mr Carli was used as a front to impress the international community
of the seriousness of the government's economic intentions, while the
government behind the scenes treated all commitments with the respect of
calculations on the back of an envelope.
This fate is unlikely to await Mr Piero Barucci, who has been drafted into
the treasury from running Credito Italiano. Mr Carli has also left behind a
beefed up treasury team.
Mr Barucci, an academic economist, has been a banker since the eighties. He
admits his appointment was a complete surprise and it is not clear how the
Treasury will co-ordinate with the finance and budget ministries. Originally
it seemed Prof Amato would merge them - their previous justification as
separate ministries has merely been as a means of providing jobs controlling
sensitive matters of money to members of the different parties in coalition.
He has gone some way towards this by putting in two technician ministers and
eliminating the Ministry for the South. This great uncontrolled dustbin of
state aid and favours has been merged into the Ministry of the Budget run by
Prof Franco Reviglio, an economics professor at Turin and a former finance
minister. Prof Reviglio was also in charge of ENI, the state oil concern
during the eighties, which had considerable investments in the South. The
immediate task will be to draw up a special budget to cover 1992 budget
deficit which has slipped from L128,000bn (Pounds 58bn) to L175,000bn
(Pounds 79bn). Prof Amato has indicated that curbing the deficit will
involve new fiscal measures plus spending cuts, most likely in the pensions,
welfare benefits and local authority transfers. With trades unions already
locked in inconclusive talks about the future of wages and labour costs, the
economic team faces an uphill task imposing unpopular measures.
Despite a slim 16-seat government majority in the chamber of deputies, the
Amato government has several factors in its favour which can be exploited.
The main political parties are weak and divided while firm leadership from
the prime minister could create unexpected room for manoeuvre. Secondly,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro appears determined to give the premier his
full backing.
Finally, there is the plight of the lira and unsustainably high interest
rates. The lira is under heavy pressure close to its floor of L765 against
the D-Mark and will remain so until the markets detect signs of concrete
government measures to tackle the deficit. Equally, interest rates are
creating tensions at close to 15 per cent or nearly 10 per cent above
inflation.
Such high rates are part of the Bank of Italy's defences against the lira
speculation; but they push up the cost of debt service and delay any
recovery.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY has called for autonomy for ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring
Slovakia and said that the common border would need to be reconfirmed if
Czechoslovakia splits.
The calls came as proposals to limit the use of the Hungarian language in
Slovakia have given edge to fears in Hungary about intolerant Slovak
nationalism.
Budapest is particularly sensitive to events in Czecholovakia because it is
the third of Hungary's multinational neighbours to have disintegrated
leaving large Hungarian minorities under leftist- nationalist rule.
Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungary's foreign minister, said he favoured a
settlement for the 600,000-strong Hungarian minority in Slovakia on the
model of the German-speaking South Tyrol region of Italy.
Dismissing nervousness about the proposal, he said autonomy was a basic
requirement of democracy.
Budapest is exerting subtle pressure on its neighbours for concessions on
autonomy by implicitly linking the rights of ethnic Hungarian minorities to
recognition of the border lines which left them outside Hungary.
Hungary maintains that the country's borders with both Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslavia are defined in relation to the united federations and would need
technically to be reconfirmed with separatist states. At the same time
Hungary wants what it calls 'transparent borders' so that the question of
minorities loses its relevance.
Mr Jeszenszky justified the linkage of the security of minorities and
borders, saying: 'The real solution (for fixed borders) is to make
minorities happy and content.'
Although the Budapest government has consistently denied any territorial
claims, its statements introduce an element of doubt about the frontiers and
reawaken memories in neighbouring countries of Hungary's occupation of the
Hungarian-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania during
the second world war.

FT  30 JUN 92 / Port industry signs a fragile peace treaty: Longer-term
solutions are needed to avoid further discord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than two years of bitter infighting, a deal has been struck that
may bring temporary peace to Portugal's best known industry and Europe's
oldest delimited wine region.
An agreement signed last month by port wine producers, shippers and
regulators, resolves an immediate problem - what to do with excess
production - and sets the stage for avoiding future surpluses. Current
stocks of surplus wine will be withheld from the market to maintain price
stability, but longer-term solutions are needed to avoid further discord.
The row has pitted farmers against the traditional port shipping houses, and
the shippers against the regulatory authorities. It also caused the
resignation last July of the president of the Port Wine Institute, which
sets the production ceiling for each harvest.
It has brought the Casa do Douro, the main regulating body, close to
bankruptcy, and helped to create a surplus wine lake which may be good news
for drinkers, but is a disaster for producers.
The recent row started in 1990, when the Casa do Douro announced it was
buying a 40 per cent stake in Real Companhia Velha, one of the largest
shippers, thereby becoming a leading producer in its own right. This caused
an outcry from other shippers who argued that the Casa do Douro could not be
regulating body, producer and shipper at the same time. 'It's the sort of
thing that happens in a banana republic,' said one shipper.
These conflicting responsibilities are central to the dispute. The Casa do
Douro, established in 1932 as a para-state institution to regulate
production and to assist and protect farmers, operates under the tutelage of
the agriculture ministry. It directly controls production by issuing the
individual beneficios or licences to the farmers, stating how much wine and,
equally importantly what sort of wine each can produce.
It also supports producers by buying up surplus stocks, as well as acting as
a farmers' union - all producers are legally obliged to be members. This
multiplicity of roles has given it considerable influence and power over
some 30,000 farmers, whose livelihood depends on selling their grapes and
making wine. With the price of a pipe of wine for port (one pipe contains
534 litres) fetching Esc130,000 (Dollars 1,000) compared with Esc20,000 for
ordinary table wine, farmers naturally want to produce as much as possible
of the former.
'The Casa do Douro is like a big daddy. It tells you how much you can
produce and if you can't sell it, it buys it,' says Mr Paul Symington, from
one of the largest port shippers.
The system of beneficios has been fraught with difficulties for years, says
another shipper. 'It's arbitrary; it's open to fraud, and everybody knows
it. The farmers are starting to realise they've been led down the garden
path.' Critics say only a new independent institution, with farmers and
shippers equally represented and the Wine Institute acting as neutral
referee, could bring back sense to the industry.
The Casa do Douro's purchase of a stake in Real Companhia Velha, was the
final straw, turning it into a battleground for competing interests. The row
was fuelled by Mr Manuel da Silva Reis, Real's managing director and
majority shareholder. He hatched the deal after he fell out with Cofipsa,
his main partner, which is partly owned by Italian financier Mr Carlo De
Benedetti. That partnership collapsed within months after acrimonious debate
and irreconcilable differences over strategy.
All of this came at a difficult time for the port industry, which was
beginning to feel the effects of a worldwide decline in demand for alcoholic
drinks. Port sales have fallen steadily since 1988, when they peaked at
9.23m cases (of 12 bottles of 75cl). Exports last year were worth Dollars
272m, down almost 5 per cent on the previous year, while the volume of sales
including domestic sales fell by about 3.5 per cent from 8.98m cases to
8.66m cases in the same period.
Overproduction depressed prices, and rising costs contributed to lower
margins and profits. The Port Wine Shippers Association (AEVP), which
represents all port shippers except Mr Silva Reis's Real Companhia Velha,
expects profits to fall by 40-50 per cent this year.
The Casa do Douro, already financially strapped by its Esc9.6bn (Dollars
73m) purchase of the stake in Real and increasing costs of buying up rising
surplus production, is negotiating a World Bank loan in efforts to remain
above water. Shippers are not brimming with sympathy: 'It's the result of
its own incompetence.'
They say the industry was put at risk by the Casa do Douro's irresponsible
behaviour in allowing farmers to produce more than was authorised. In 1989,
29,000 pipes of must - the wine base for port - were produced illegally,
bringing total production to 174,000 pipes; in 1990, 42,000 pipes out of a
total of 157,000 pipes were produced illegally. Last year, the authorised
production ceiling of 110,000 pipes was respected, but shippers say it was
set far too high and 38,000 pipes remained unsold at the end of the season.
Faced with the prospect of large excess stocks flooding the market, the
shippers have agreed to buy the surplus for Dollars 34m and will release it
gradually on to the market in 1992-93. The 1992 harvest will be calculated
on the basis of world sales to June less the amounts that will be released
from surplus stocks.
'Buyers abroad will know that production in this harvest (1992) will be
based on demand and nothing more,' says one shipper. Enthusiasts who may
have hoped for more and cheaper port are likely to be disappointed, but they
need not be despondent: despite the downturn, world sales of port have
doubled in the past 20 years, and there should be no shortage of premium
wines in years to come. Illust. Handle with care: tempers are frayed in
Portugal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT MIDNIGHT tonight Portugal's six-month stint at the helm of the European
Community presidency will end, and Portuguese officials will heave a sigh of
relief.
It has been a gruelling task for a small country with relatively limited
resources. It was Portugal's first presidency, and some 2,500 officials had
to be specially trained to cope with the work.
The concluding summit in Lisbon at the weekend failed to live up to earlier
Portuguese expectations, but there have been some important successes.
Portugal faced an unusually difficult agenda. On the internal front there
was the thorny question of finding agreement on a financing package for the
Community for 1993-97; agreement was also needed to reform the Common
Agricultural Policy; and further measures had to be implemented to
consolidate moves towards the internal market.
On the international front, the crises in Yugoslavia and the former Soviet
Union placed additional demands on Portuguese diplomatic skills.
The verdict appears to be that Portugal ran a workman-like and relatively
successful presidency. There were no major mistakes, and some significant
achievements. Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese agriculture minister, took
risks but succeeded in winning agreement on a farm reform which will have a
long-term impact on the Community.
'It certainly wasn't obvious that a small country like Portugal could
complete such a negotiation,' says one foreign diplomat.
The view from Brussels is that Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime
minister, did good work behind the scenes, Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, his
foreign minister, was effective, and Mr Cunha pulled off a big gamble by
watering down Commission proposals on farm reform but keeping everyone on
board.
Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, who had only just been appointed finance minister,
after spending some years at the Commission, was not intimately known by his
ministerial colleagues, though he showed himself to be effective in the
debate on convergence.
'The Portuguese presidency was overshadowed by the important decisions taken
at Maastricht. After that, time was needed to prepare the follow-up. There
was an obvious conflict between rich and poor over a new financial package,
then the Danish referendum made things even more difficult,' says one
official.
The biggest disappointment was the failure to achieve a breakthrough on
finances for the Community. This was a particular blow for the Portuguese,
as well as for Spain, Ireland and Greece, the main beneficiaries of planned
increases in resources.
However, Portugal oversaw progress towards harmonising EC legislation before
the abolition of internal trade barriers on January 1, 1993.
Over 90 per cent of the agreements, including an 'open skies' policy on
liberalising air transport, will be in place when Britain takes over the
presidency tomorrow.
Because of its low profile and desire to find consensus, Portugal was
criticised at times for being over-cautious. However, in view of the
difficulties facing its presidency, that may well have been one of its
greatest virtues.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Reluctant trustee of transition - Anand
Panyarachun, Thailand's prime minister, speaks to Victor Mallet and Peter
Ungphakorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET and PETER UNGPHAKORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anand Panyarachun, the suave, Cambridge-educated businessman, who this
month became reluctant caretaker prime minister of Thailand for the second
time in less than two years, has survived some remarkable ups and downs in
his relations with the country's influential military establishment.
Thais were surprised but relieved when he was appointed by the king on June
10 to resolve the crisis which followed the killing of at least 50
pro-democracy demonstrators last month.
Sixteen years ago, as a senior diplomat responsible for negotiating the
withdrawal of US forces from Thailand at the end of the Vietnam war, he was
forced by the generals to undergo a humiliating investigation for alleged
communist sympathies.
He was cleared of the charges, but disillusioned. Two years later he quit
the foreign service for the boardrooms of some of Thailand's biggest
companies. It was not until last year that he came into close contact with
the military again. Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, a deputy military attache under
Mr Anand when he was ambassador in Washington, had risen to become head of
the army, masterminded a coup d'etat and asked Mr Anand to lead the
government until elections this March.
To the surprise of many of his colleagues, the enigmatic Mr Anand accepted.
He was praised at home and abroad for liberalising the economy with a
torrent of legislation during his 14-month term of office, but stood down
with no intention of returning to politics. Then Gen Suchinda became prime
minister, the people of Bangkok took to the streets, troops fired on
protesters, and Mr Anand replaced the general.
Sitting in the ornate Government House where the prime minister has his
offices, Mr Anand is philosophical - in fluent English - about this second
accident of history. 'I have never been interested in political office and
it doesn't conform with my character. I do not aspire to be a public figure.
I lead a private life, a quiet life. I enjoy my family, my children, and
having spent 23 years in the diplomatic service and nearly 15 years in the
private sector, I thought I was entitled to some kind of less troublesome
lifestyle.'
It was not be. Mr Anand finds himself charged with three difficult tasks in
the next few months: dealing with the generals responsible for the shootings
in a way which will satisfy public opinion without provoking a dangerous
response from the generals themselves; supervising fair elections in a
country known for corrupt electoral practices; and restoring foreign and
domestic confidence in an economy where the generals (and air chief
marshals) have granted themselves lucrative sinecures to match their
political influence. A process of political and military 'structural
adjustment' will at least have started by the time he leaves, Mr Anand
hopes.
'The objective is to try to lower the army profile,' he says. 'It is not
aimed at destroying the institution or defaming the institution. I'd rather
look at the positive side of the structural adjustment, in the sense that it
will enhance the army's professionalism, enhance the effectiveness of their
management and make them into a more efficient fighting force.
'In the past 60 years - and this is not really the fault of the army, I
think it's the fault of the entire system in Thailand - somehow
inadvertently we have acquiesced in the acquisition of this very high
profile role of the army. We have to take moderate and gradual steps. We
cannot just charge into a china shop and break everything, so if we can
begin demilitarising the political process and decommercialising the armed
forces, perhaps this is the direction that I'm aiming at.
The generals are aware that for the first time their position is being
seriously threatened by Thailand's rapid economic advances and the rise of
the middle class professionals who formed the core of the demonstrators last
month.
'Out of every crisis there are both positive and negative side-effects, and
I think that there are many good people in the army establishment who are
convinced that the year 1992 is different from the year 1960 or 1970.
Mentally, they have already adjusted, but the structure of the army is such
that open debate about their role, or about their power, is something which
is alien to their culture. We must take that into account. We must strive
not to make them feel that they are being cornered.'
Mr Anand will have to use all his diplomatic skills in behind-the-scenes
negotiations with the military, and he declined to be drawn on how he hoped
to achieve his aims or on whether he was pressing for the resignations of
senior military officials.
Restoring confidence in the economy - still buoyant by international
standards - will be easier. 'Well, I hope my name means something,' he says
with a laugh. 'I think that the integrity of my previous cabinet and my
present cabinet would go a long way to restoring confidence. I always
believe that if the people at the top are not corrupt and are not even seen
to be corrupt then that's going to be a natural curb on the corrupt
tendencies of the bureaucrats.'
Unable to formulate new legislation for the parliament about to be
dissolved, Mr Anand intends in the short time available to entrench the
economic reforms of his previous administration, including trade
liberalisation, the establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission to
police financial markets and the introduction of value-added tax.
Does that mean he wants to consolidate his policies before another
government can mess things up? 'You said it,' he replies. 'Partly this is an
indirect way of further opening the political system. If you have an open
economic system, then the opening up of the political system is inevitable,
so this is part and parcel of the process of structural adjustment.'
Mr Anand recognises that Thailand's recurrent political problems owe as much
to the inadequacies of the Thai parliamentary system as to the influence of
the military. He is urging businessmen and other urban professionals to
become involved in a political game which has been dominated by personal
influence and patronage. He wants a poll as soon as is practicable - four
months' time is the arbitrary deadline he has set himself - but he does not
hold out great hopes for a clean election. 'Don't expect miracles, because
we have toyed with the democratic process for 60 years and I only have four
months to deal with the fundamental flaws, but I believe that it can be no
worse than the last elections, so any improvement is already a plus. As
Winston Churchill said, the democratic process is perhaps not the best
system but it is the least evil.'
In the same vein, Mr Anand rejects suggestions that his much-applauded
unelected governments show the validity of the authoritarian political
arguments of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's statesman, which are often quoted
in Asia to justify undemocratic regimes.
'It's all wrong in a way, when you listen to all these foreigners comparing
the May events in Thailand to the Tiananmen Square incident in China or when
people try to compare my previous administration with Mr Lee Kuan Yew's
style of management, because here we have unlimited freedom of the mass
media - that was only interrupted during that fateful week (in May) - and on
the whole this is something that I'm personally proud of.
'Mr Lee Kuan Yew's thesis is that development and stability must come before
democracy. I do not got that far. But I would say that he is partially
right, and in terms of Singapore society, who am I to say that it is not
right for the Singaporeans? But Thailand is a different country in terms of
the size of the land and the size of the population . . . I mean you can
discipline 2m citizens but you cannot really discipline 56m to 57m people.'
Does that make Mr Anand, who abolished labour unions in government
enterprises in his first term, a democrat rather than an authoritarian? 'I
know what I am and I think that most people in Thailand know what I am. I'm
a liberal. I'm not a misguided liberal. I hope that they see me as an
enlightened liberal, but not an en-lightened authoritarian. There is a vast
difference in that.'

FT  29 JUN 92 / The genetic threat to capitalism: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the advantages of Washington, FT colleagues assured me before I left
London, is the intellectual stimulation provided by its extensive network of
well-funded thinktanks. You will be one step ahead of us, they said, because
most of the new ideas in economics and social policy originate in the US.
Perhaps I have been asleep, but the intellectual excitement has been
strictly limited in the past 18 months. By and large, the conservative
thinktanks are still recycling ideas advanced by Friedrich Hayek in the
1950s. The liberal (left of centre) groups remain knocked off balance by
this resurgence of authentic liberalism.
At last, however, I can report a faint whiff of something new, or at least
something a little less hackneyed. Several analysts are worrying that the
American ideal of an open, mobile society is being undermined by a growing
genetic stratification of the population.
The fear, baldly put, is that America is heading towards a nightmarish
science fiction future in which a clever and affluent elite effectively
walls itself off (physically as well as socially) from the bulk of society,
which lives in comparative poverty. The twist is that the affluent group is
self-perpetuating because members marry each other, thus transmitting their
genetic advantages to future generations. Those outside the charmed circle
remain socially and economically depressed because of an unfair distribution
of innate ability.
This disturbing thesis is explored by Mr Mickey Kaus in a recent cover story
for the New Republic magazine based on his forthcoming book 'The End of
Equality.' As Mr Kaus notes, the argument was first advanced more than 20
years ago by Mr Richard Herrnstein, a Harvard psychologist. Mr Herrnstein is
himself writing a book on the subject, in collaboration with Mr Charles
Murray, the social critic who stunned Washington in the early 1980s by
advocating the abolition of welfare.
In a meritocratic society, the Herrnstein argument runs, social standing
reflects the pay and prestige attached to your job. Your ability to succeed
in the workplace in turn depends on your mental abilities. The implication
is that if mental abilities are heritable, social standing is heritable. The
sons and daughters of the successful will therefore tend to be atypically
successful. This raises the spectre of horrible new class divisions based on
genes rather than titles or property.
The irony is that the greater the efforts to eliminate traditional obstacles
to personal advancement, the greater the risk of genetic stratification. For
example, as educational opportunities are broadened, it becomes more rather
than less likely that those gaining the top qualifications - and hence the
top jobs - will have the greatest innate ability. The feminist revolution,
while increasing opportunities for women, has also exacerbated the problem.
With both partners now typically working, the pay and employment status of
women has a bigger impact on marriage decisions. A generation ago, doctors
often married nurses; now they are more likely to marry fellow physicians.
In business, MBAs are more likely to marry fellow professionals than
secretaries and so on.
In days gone past, Mr Kaus points out, people who failed economically could
blame their misfortune on extraneous factors, such as lack of education or
social barriers. But if such obstacles are removed, people will be forced to
confront their own natural limitations. The risk is an ugly society in which
the successful consider themselves superior rather than merely privileged or
lucky.
It is probably too early to judge whether genetically-based social
stratification is a serious threat. But the argument can be challenged on
several grounds. The linchpin is the assumption that mental abilities are
largely inherited. If IQ and other purported measures of ability are mainly
determined by environmental rather than genetic factors, the thesis
collapses. I hope this is the case, but I do not pretend to have thoroughly
reviewed the scientific evidence.
The other weakness in the argument is the claimed link between abstract
measures of mental ability and economic success. At present, the US system
favours those who shine in academic aptitude tests. It is difficult to get
into the top universities without high test scores. And America is so sold
on qualifications that it is difficult to get a top job without several
badges from one of these institutions - usually a PHD or professional
qualification as well as a first degree. But nobody has shown that this very
lengthy mental training is actually necessary or indeed relevant to job
performance. It could be little more than a comfortable cartel run by, and
on behalf of, the upper middle classes.
In a truly entrepreneurial society, personality and energy are likely to be
as important determinants of success as academic aptitude. After all, there
is nothing inherently complicated about most of the services that people
want. And while technology is getting more complex, it is often surprisingly
easy to use.
There is no denying, however, that Mr Kaus and others are raising troubling
issues. An aristocracy founded on differences in innate ability potentially
poses a bigger threat to social harmony than all the kings and queens of
history put together. We should no longer fight shy of a public debate about
the social implications of genetic differences.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Justinian: Dear Lord Chancellor . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your intention to publish a detailed consultation paper on the question of
continued bewigging and begowning of only the judges and advocates of the
High Court of Justice seems an unnecessarily elaborate process to determine
a straightforward and uncomplicated issue that sharply divides the
rationalist from the traditionalist. Cannot that simple issue be left to the
Council of Judges to decide, since it is the judges who, apart from any
statutory provision, exclusively define their own practice and procedure as
part of the inherent jurisdiction of the court?
Few, if any, seem to want to be rid of the gown. It is the recognised symbol
of authority in all civilised legal systems. And no one suggests that it is
anachronistic to require uniform dress in the cause of majestic justice.
Even the most plebeian of contemporary legal systems - the US - has
discarded most of the accepted habits of decorous forensic behaviour, but
not the black gown.
Contrariwise, the wig is an anachronism. Apart from some quiddities of the
parliamentary scene of which you, Lord Chancellor, are an exemplar - the
wig, as opposed to the toupee, is worn only ceremoniously. There is no great
harm in that. To sustain the links with our legal ancestors by a visual
display at the annual parade of the judiciary is a mark of historical
development. We need to be reminded whence we have come.
The retentionists argue, rightly, that the legal process is a public
service, and if the public want to dress up their judges and legal
practitioners in horsehair, so be it.
We should bow to the popular voice. This would perhaps carry the day if the
public were regular users of the courtroom. Happily they are not. Those who
undergo the rigours of the litigious pro-cess are a largely self sel-ective
and partially selected number.
The overriding impression that any participant in the forensic process gets
is the awesomeness of the law in action.
Witnesses - those who by definition are largely dragged to court to support
one side or another - universally find the experience intimidating. The
process should be designed to reduce the element of unfamiliarity
commensurate with a decorous procedure that befits a civilised country's
means of resolving the citizenry's disputes. Anything that is distinctively
out of accord with customary standards of dress should be avoided.
Wigs are at best theatrical; at worst they belong to the kindergarten.
Then it is said, with appropriate seriousness, that the wig provides an
anonymity so necessary to protect the judge - even physically, it seems -
from streetwalk or shopfloor recognition by disgruntled litigants motivated
to inflict injury.
Does Lord Donaldson of Lymington really believe that the wig disguises the
judge sufficiently to allow him to pass unnoticed from a civilian shopping
in Marks and Spencer?
I am afraid experience is to the contrary. The wig - not the full-blown
variety used for ceremonies - distorts but does not obliterate the
physiognomy. The Master of the Rolls will have to wear a mask if he wants to
hide his handsome countenance. My respect for him is not one whit enhanced
for the piece of horsehair that sits unevenly on his ample locks.
Lord Brightman, apparently a convert to retentionism through a
methodologically unsound poll conducted by familial pollsters, says that it
is no hardship for us lawyers (and judges) to bow to popular demand.
Hardship, no. But the thing I have had to wear for nearly 40 years is a
confounded nuisance. I can testify to being the less-than-proud owner of a
frowzy wig, much like that described as possessed by Dr Johnson -
out-of-court, of course.
It is time that the English and the Scots took a leaf out of the book of
their kinsfolk in the Channel Islands.
The Court of Appeal for Jersey and for Guernsey was formed a quarter of a
century ago out of a panel of twelve English and Scottish QCs. We wear a
jabot (rather more elegant than the English white bands) and a French style
hat. But as soon as the court assembles, the hats are removed and replaced
only on the court rising. That combines a due respect for tradition and does
not detract from the due process of law.
So, Lord Chancellor, to adopt a Chestertonian phrase directed at one of your
predecessors on the woolsack, chuck it. You have done much to modernise our
profession. You will go down in history as the moulder of a vital public
service. Don't tarnish that reputation by condescending to the forces of
reactionism.
Out with the horsehair. In with the public demonstration that the law is
here to serve a public that no longer wants the histrionics of advocates
detracting from day-to-day problems that beset the ordinary citizen. The
courtroom is not a place for pantomime, but for serious problem-solving.
Yours,
Louis Blom-Cooper QC

FT  29 JUN 92 / International Bonds: HSBC's deal may herald similar funding
of bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMOOTH completion of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's crucial
bond financing of its Pounds 3.6bn takeover of Midland Bank could herald
further bond market funding of bids.
Two working days after Hongkong Bank won acceptance for its takeover offer,
the first round of the underwriting of HSBC Holdings' Pounds 448m 10-year
subordinated Eurobond has been completed, and investors are queueing up to
buy further bonds issued, as shareholders' acceptances continue to drift in,
until July 10.
Companies typically raise funds to finance takeovers through bilateral or
syndicated bank borrowing, or by issuing shares. Often, bank loans are
subsequently refinanced in the bond market, but bond offerings are rarely an
integral part of a takeover bid.
However, the diminishing availability of bank financing and a less bullish
stock market could encourage more companies to consider tapping the bond
market. From Hongkong Bank's point of view, the subordinated Eurobonds
provide useful capital and avoid excessive dilution of shareholders' funds.
In retrospect, it was the offer of more generous terms on the bonds - and a
cash alternative - when Hongkong Bank increased its bid on June 2, which
helped secure the deal by edging out rival Lloyds Bank.
Initially, the bonds were to be priced to yield 160 basis points above the
10-year gilt yield, a spread which was widely considered inadequate given
the credit quality of the offering: deeply subordinated debt issued by a
bank holding company.
Research circulated by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew concluded that the bank 'has
significantly over-valued its proposed issue of subordinated bonds,' and
suggested a valuation of around 210 basis points.
Under the increased bid, Hongkong Bank offered par bonds at a spread of 240
basis points above the comparable gilt yield, and a cash alternative for
investors who did not want to take the bonds. For each 100 shares in
Midland, shareholders were offered 120 shares in the new Hongkong Bank
holding company after the merger and either Pounds 65 of bonds or Pounds 65
in cash.
Although existing shareholders who do not wish to take up the bonds can take
the cash alternative, many may have taken the view that the bonds offer
better value. Since the spread has already tightened, shareholders who took
the bonds are set to make a tidy profit.
The offering is the first of its kind in the Eurobond market. Because
Eurobonds are internationally-traded bearer instruments, the structure has
facilitated distribution to a much wider range of investors than would have
been possible with a domestic sterling bonds.
For example, a substantial portion of paper is expected to end up in the US.
The existence of broad overseas demand has helped buoy confidence in the UK,
where the structure of the deal could have severely limited distribution.
For lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston the underwriting risk was
substantial. When CSFB agreed to underwrite the offer on June 2, the
underwriting period could have lasted for 10 weeks, with no protection under
force majeure or material 'adverse change' clauses.
To compensate for the high level of the underwriting risk, CSFB was paid
fees of 1 percentage point. In addition, the generous 240 basis point spread
was designed to provide a certain cushion for potential adverse market
movements.
CSFB and other members of the syndicate began taking orders late Tuesday,
and book-building continued on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday night,
the number of investors opting for a cash alternative created a tranche of
bonds for sale on Friday totalling Pounds 101m.
This represented around half the total amount of acceptances. The bonds were
sold at a fixed price of 101.20, indicating a spread of 220 basis points,
but by the end of trading on Friday the bonds were bid at 102.45 for a
spread of 204 basis points. A further Pounds 15m tranche of bonds is to be
sold today.
According to Mr Hugh Corbett, a UBS analyst, the spread was 'quite a bit
wider than necessary to get the issue away', an opinion borne out by the
substantial tightening of the spread. Officials at CSFB expect that 'the
spread will settle at around 200 basis points. If the bank performs, there
is room for further tightening'.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Pemex launches further one-year Dollars
100m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROLEOS Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state-owned oil company, is
launching a Dollars 100m loan facility and hopes to raise a total of up to
Dollars 400m in the syndicated loans market in the immediate future, writes
Sara Webb.
Mexican borrowers have been absent from the syndicated loans market for
several years. However, Pemex launched a one-year Dollars 100m syndicated
loan through Chase Manhattan earlier this year and is now launching its
second one-year Dollars 100m deal through ANZ.
The deal is a syndicated revolving credit which may be funded either in the
interbank market or by using the sterling Bankers Acceptance market and then
swapping the proceeds into dollars, whichever proves cheapest.
The maximum margin is 87.5 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate (Libor), with a commitment fee of 12.5 basis points and management fees
of 12.5 basis points for commitments of Dollars 10m, 10 basis points for
Dollars 5m and above, and 5 basis points for Dollars 2m and above.
Pemex plans to use the Dollars 100m facility to finance the import and
export of oil and oil products.
The Mexican oil group, which has borrowed occasionally in the international
bond markets, is expected to raise a total of up to Dollars 400m in the
syndicated loans market and may try to raise medium-term funds next by
tapping the three-five year area of the market.
Pemex is Mexico's largest company, with sales of Dollars 18.6bn last year.
The government plans to divide the group into four semi-autonomous divisions
in an attempt to improve productivity.

<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale has become the latest big French bank to be put under
surveillance by Moody's, the international credit rating agency, with a view
to downgrading the ratings of its long-term deposits and debt.
The French banks have had a difficult time in the past year because of the
slowdown in France's economy and their exposure to bad loans. The rating of
Paribas, the prestigious investment bank, was recently downgraded by
Standard &amp; Poor's, although it emerged unscathed from a review by Moody's.
Societe Generale, which currently has an Aaa rating, recently reported a
return to profits growth when its net profits rose from FFr2.68bn in 1990 to
FFr3.37bn (Dollars 630m) in 1991, although it has not yet returned to its
1989 level.
Moody's said it had put Societe Generale under surveillance because of the
fall in its net margins and the high level of its loan loss provisions.
Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino had its senior debt downgraded from
AA1 to AA3 by Moody's.

FT  29 JUN 92 / IMF in Moscow for talks on Dollars 24bn aid deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN International Monetary Fund team will today hold talks in Moscow to try
to salvage an aid agreement with the Russian government against a backdrop
of faltering economic reforms.
The Fund is facing one of the most difficult dilemmas of its post-war
history. Thrust by western governments into assessing the fitness of Russian
reform to receive a package of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.9bn) worth of aid, it
is balancing political pressure to 'help the Russians' against its own
judgments that the economic reforms are in peril.
'There will be a financial Chernobyl in this country,' said Professor Steve
Hanke, head of economics at the US John Hopkins University and a member of a
free market economic institute in Moscow. 'And the IMF is trying to save its
credibility from the meltdown.'
He is not alone in his assessment. 'Every time they (the IMF) negotiate with
the Russians the budget deficit seems to go up by another Rbs100bn,' said
one economist, in Moscow last week for a session of the World Economic
Conference.
A senior World Bank official sees a larger problem: 'The real danger is not
that the money will be 'wasted': it is not much money compared to their
needs. The danger is that it will not attract other, private investment, as
it is supposed to do. It will remain as a political gesture which the
private investors are not willing to follow. The rigour of the first three
months of reform has now largely gone. The story now on subsidies and credit
is worse all the time. The IMF looks at this and can't really do much.'
Budget figures estimate that subsidies, held down to Rbs55bn (Pounds 347m)
in the first quarter of the year, will grow to Rbs500bn during the year -
but foreign economists believe that might swell to Rbs800bn or more. At the
same time credits, held down to Rbs37bn in the first quarter, are expected
to rise to a yearly total of Rbs470bn, which does not include a recently
announced sum of Rbs500bn for inter-enterprise debt and payments to
non-Russian plants for deliveries.
The IMF has already moved from what was seen by its many critics in Russia
and abroad as a rigid position to a more accommodating one: it will soon
provide a Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' payment. According to Mr Alexander
Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of overseas economic affairs,
the money will go towards supporting the rouble when a unified exchange rate
comes into force on July 1.
It seems certain the IMF will ultimately agree a programme with the Russian
government, unlocking the Dollars 24bn foreign aid. But insiders think it
will do so reluctantly, and with concern that its approval will be held
against it if the reforms collapse.
Diplomats in Moscow feel the IMF has been made into an advance guard for the
Group of Seven industrial countries - but left to bear all the fire without
support from the rear.

FT  29 JUN 92 / MGN board given record of meetings beforehand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS OF Mirror Group Newspapers were presented with detailed minutes of
board meetings before these were held, according to MGN directors.
When directors arrived for the first board meeting after the company was
floated on the Stock Exchange in June 1991 they found red leather folders
around the boardroom table, say three directors present.
The name of each director was embossed in gold letters on each folder.
Inside were the minutes of the meeting that was about to be held.
One director said he thought it 'a bit odd. It was my first public company
directorship and nothing was said so I assumed that such things happened'.
The board meetings of the newly publicly quoted company followed a period of
five years when no formal board meetings of Mirror Group, then a private
Maxwell company, were held, say directors.
A confidential report into the events at MGN by accountants Ernst &amp; Young
has blamed some directors for being too afraid of being sacked or sued by
Robert Maxwell to carry out their duties as effectively as they might. This
is denied by the MGN directors.
On October 29, a week before Robert Maxwell's death off the Canaries the
last MGN board meeting failed to confront him with the issue of 'unusual
transactions' although by then some knew these were occurring.
Instead, Mr Clements and Sir Robert Clark, the new MGN chairman, raised the
issue with Mr Maxwell after the meeting.
The Ernst &amp; Young report also raises the possibility that MGN's 1990
accounts, upon which the flotation offer was based, were padded by an
injection at the last minute of Pounds 30m worth of short-term loans.
Some directors believe the Pounds 30m in fact only became available to MGN
much later and that the investment was only there for a few days.
A letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell to Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that the purchase
of Pounds 30m in commercial paper from Midland Bank was carried out by LBI,
a Maxwell Pension Fund vehicle, on December 27 1990 and was available to the
Mirror at year end. It was redeemed on April 16 1991.
The letter says that the money was held on behalf of MGN and would be
returned to the newspaper group no later than April 30 1991.
Ernst &amp; Young says it cannot think of any reason for a retrospective
arrangement other than to 'window-dress' the balance sheet by showing a
liquid asset in place of an inter-company debt of the same amount.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has since been replaced as MGN auditors, says that
so far as it is concerned it was a bona fide transaction that was settled
after the year's end.
Coopers' auditors, it is believed, were shown the book transactions covering
the return of the money by Mr Michael Stoney, then deputy managing director
(finance) of MGN. The sum appears as a short-term investment in the 1991
accounts published last week and no provision is made for any loss
concerning it.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Kidnapped Exxon man found dead by FBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BODY of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's international division, was
found at the weekend, ending the most prominent US kidnapping case for
nearly 20 years.
The FBI confirmed that officers had positively identified the corpse of Mr
Reso, 57, who was abducted two months ago. His body was found on Saturday in
a wooded section of southern New Jersey.
The discovery came eight days after the FBI arrested a former Exxon security
guard and his wife. They were indicted last week on kidnapping and extortion
charges.
The FBI declined to say if the two, who had initially refused to co-operate
with investigators after being captured, supplied the information that led
police to find Mr Reso's body.
They are alleged to have participated in the abduction of Mr Reso on April
29. Mr Michael Murphy, a New Jersey county prosecutor, said yesterday state
murder charges would be filed against one or both today or tomorrow.
The full details of Mr Reso's death are not yet known, but the FBI said an
autopsy was being performed last night.
The FBI, which at the height of the search for Mr Reso had deployed 250
agents, said it had conducted the most exhaustive kidnapping investigation
since the 1974 abduction of Patty Hearst, a member of the Hearst publishing
family.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon, said he was deeply distressed to learn
of 'the tragic and senseless death' of Mr Reso, who had worked for the oil
company for 35 years.
The former security guard and his wife, both 45, allegedly sent messages to
Exxon, demanding Dollars 18.5m (Pounds 10m) of ransom money for Mr Reso.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: A formula to quantify risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R J BARTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Incledon (Letters, June 22) is right. Capital, and an acceptable
return on it, are Lloyd's most urgent needs.
The Council is understood to be proposing that, from 1993 onwards, a Name's
liability be limited to 80 per cent of his/her premium allocation over a
four-year period. Presumably, one result of this will be for each Name to
demonstrate acceptable liquidity equal to at least his/her chosen liability
limit. This will go a long way to restoring confidence, and delight the
rating agencies.
The council's proposal will mean that for the first time Names will be able
to quantify their risk capital and, also for the first time, will be able to
calculate their actual pre-tax rate of return on that capital. But if
Lloyd's is to attract fresh capital, there will have to be at least the
prospect of a venture capital rate of return.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP WHITELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was with a depressing sense of deja vu that I read your praise
('Health Care in London', June 24) of the government's intention, veiled
beneath the King's Fund report, to close large specialist hospitals and
divert the resources to preventative health.
Ten years ago we were told the out-dated psychiatric institutions would be
replaced with non-institutional alternatives. The hospitals were closed, but
much of the money saved did not go into community care. As a former manager
of a voluntary agency for homeless people, I know of countless cases of
former patients ending up on the streets. Some were referred directly from
hospital to a rundown, insanitary hostel.
If this government does announce a plan to transfer resources directly from
acute to primary care by closing hospitals, it does not deserve to be
believed.

Trimming expenses is one thing, but Royal Bank of Canada has ruffled more
than a few hairs by doing away with its corporate barbers.
For a modest CDollars 26 (about Pounds 12) a quarter, employees have for
years been entitled to as many haircuts as they need from a brace of barbers
installed in the bank's head offices in Montreal and Toronto.
But with the man in Montreal about to retire, and his counterpart in Toronto
topping only 35 polls or so weekly, the bank has elected to cease
subsidising the said fringe benefit.
The bankers should have seen the scissors coming a couple of years ago, when
Royal gave the boot to the man who polished senior executives' shoes each

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who has ever turned on a television set in America this year must
know who Dan and Dave are and what they put on their feet.
Indeed so ubiquitous and intrusive had been Reebok's multi-million dollar
campaign promoting the expected Olympic tussle between US decathletes, Dan
O'Brien and Dave Johnson, that there seemed to be a case for changing the
rules at Barcelona - for example, by insisting that all runners wear
hobnailed boots or go barefoot.
Remarkably these subversive dreams have been suddenly realised. O'Brien  -
unbelievably since he probably is the best decathlete in the world - failed
to qualify for the US Olympic team last weekend.
NBC television, which paid a small fortune for the rights to televise the
Olympics, covered the event as if it were a national, rather than a
personal, tragedy.
Reebok, on the other hand, quickly substituted Dan and Dave on the air with
an older commercial, promoting two sportsmen who go by the name of 'rocket'.
But it must be wondering if it has lost its marketing touch.
For, at the same time as Dan was flunking his pole vault, Roger 'Rocket'
Clemens, the wonderful Boston baseball pitcher, was being hit all over the
ball park in his worst performance of the year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market has become tired of ambitious British media companies, such
as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, WPP and Shandwick, which made too many acquisitions
and issued too much paper.
So it is bound to be a mite suspicious about the surprise departure of
Aegis's well-paid chairman Peter Scott, and David Reich, a key lieutenant.
Certainly, the reason given for the departures - they did not want to move
to Paris - does not sound terribly convincing. At 44 Scott is at an age when
most executives are just getting into their stride and not retiring.
British shareholders will be left with a company which is run by an elderly
Frenchman based in Paris and is facing increasing competitive pressures. It
is not the basis on which most of them made their investment.
Perhaps Mr Scott can be persuaded to rethink his hasty decision?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As pressure to resign seemingly mounts on George Nissen, chairman of the
Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, because of Imro's failure to
spot the antics of Robert Maxwell, the whole future of the investment
watchdog could be affected.
The embattled self-regulating organisation is currently fighting a plan for
Imro to lose a chunk of its membership list to the new Personal Investment
Authority which is to be formed out of two other SROs, Lautro and Fimbra.
This could make it a tricky time to lose Nissen. There is something of a
lame duck air too about Imro's chief executive John Morgan, who has already
announced his intention to retire in 1993.
Nissen, a former senior partner of stockbrokers Pember &amp; Boyle, one-time big
wheels in the gilts market, is said to have been 'a superb committee man' in
the old Stock Exchange. But both Nissen and Morgan are over 60 and made
their reputations in a less dangerous environment. The new chief executive,
according to the recent recruitment ad for the post, should be 'a leader
with diplomatic skills'. It would have taken much more than diplomacy to
stop Maxwell, however valuable such skills might be in the boardrooms of the
blueblooded accepting houses which dreamed up Imro in the first place.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: Weasel words are no basis for economic and monetary
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICK PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan argues most cogently (Economic Viewpoint, June 25)
that 'I am not advocating short-termism but merely avoiding a pretence to
knowledge that we do not have'. He also states that, the Maastricht
guidelines (on deficit/GNP ratios) 'are probably meant to apply over a cycle
as a whole'.
Surely we have no knowledge that this is implied by the Maastricht criteria?
If it were then we could argue that every country is currently meeting the
deficit/GNP targets by virtue of the different lengths of their economic
cycles. Such an interpretation would be a gift to finance ministers
currently struggling with their own definitions of 'medium term', 'long
term' and 'over the course of the business cycle'. An inability to meet
deficit reduction targets in both absolute and proportional terms can be
blamed on below-trend economic growth or actual declines in output. As this
year's UK Financial Statement and Budget Report states: '. . .that judgment
must be made in the light of all the circumstances, including the medium
term economic and budgetary position.'
Can we really move to closer economic and monetary union based on weasel
words and is it likely that the German authorities would permit such a
subjective interpretation of quantifiable convergence criteria?
If European countries want to join a hard-core D-Mark bloc it is entirely up
to them. They can all move to narrow bands in the ERM; they could
individually move to permanent fixity of exchange rate parities. But to
claim that convergence is proceeding were it not for the nasty economic
cycle is surely to miss the point. It is the cycle itself we should be
concerned about.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: Wrong to assume that all hostages in Lebanon have
been freed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE TOMBS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree wholeheartedly with Observer's assessment of Mr Giandomenico
Picco ('Smart choice', June 23). The outgoing UN hostage negotiator has done
a tremendous service to the cause of world freedom.
However, international media such as the Financial Times have done a
disservice by assuming the 'last of the western hostages' have been
released, now that two German hostages have returned home.
Henriette Haddad, a Canadian-Lebanese dual citizen, was kidnapped on
September 26 1985, in west Beirut. There is no substantive proof she is
dead. Actually, a mountain of evidence suggests she is still alive, and held
by fundamentalists in the Bekaa Valley. Mr Picco added her to his list of
hostages on March 31 last. Several cases of other westerners have never been
resolved: Alberto Molinari, an Italian kidnapped on September 11 1985;
Florence Raad, a French-Lebanese dual citizen kidnapped in May 1985; Alec
Collett, a British journalist working for UNRWA, kidnapped in March of the
same year.
We might also consider that the distinction, western/Middle Eastern, is an
arbitrary one. Lebanese hostages, who may well number in the hundreds, no
less deserve our support and sympathy. We must not bury people until they
are proven dead.

FT  29 JUN 92 / An alliance that seeks strength in numbers: Michael Smith
examines plans to create the UK's largest union through a merger of three
public service organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe chose to stay on as leader of Nupe, the UK's
fifth-largest union, some of his fellow trade unionists found the decision
puzzling. They believed he was the ideal candidate for the post of
general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, representing almost 10m
workers.
Since that decision back in 1984, events have moved in Mr Bickerstaffe's
direction and, at a time when membership of TUC-affiliated unions is
declining - to less than 8m now - he could soon wield more influence than Mr
Norman Willis, the man who became TUC leader.
After a series of votes at union annual conferences over the past month,
Nupe is almost certain to join with fellow public service unions Nalgo and
Cohse to form Unison, a TUC-affiliated organisation with 1.5m members. From
its formation in July next year, it would be Britain's largest union and the
second biggest for public service workers in Europe. It will represent
workers in the gas, electricity, water, transport and further education
sectors, but its main areas of influence will be local government and
health. For the first two years, Mr Bickerstaffe will share the leadership
with Mr Alan Jinkinson of Nalgo and Hector Mackenzie of Cohse. After that Mr
Bickerstaffe is almost certain to take sole control as general-secretary.
While Mr Bickerstaffe's election would be welcomed by many colleagues, who
see him as an effective advocate of trade unionism, the consequences of the
merger will affect more than Mr Bickerstaffe and Unison members.
The grouping of three unions into one would hasten the trend in Britain
towards a smaller number of larger unions. Of wider importance still will be
the effect of the amalgamation on the employers which currently deal with
the three constituent unions.
The union's creation comes at a time when the government is pressing public
sector employers - local councils and the National Health Service - to
devolve power to local managers. It wants local pay bargaining to replace
existing national bargaining structures; performance-related pay
significantly extended from managers to workers; and more services,
particularly those in white-collar areas such as housing management and
planning, to be put out to competitive tender to allow private-sector
organisations to run them more efficiently.
Where health and local government employers push through such changes, the
unions, under their present fragmented structure, will be relatively
powerless to resist. They believe the merger will result in one organisation
speaking with a single voice and thus with a better chance of fighting what
they see as the worst effects of reform. The contracting out of services,
for instance, has cost thousands of local authority jobs.
The merger should also increase the ability of union leaders to co-ordinate
the action of their members, particularly in local government. Councils have
been able to exploit a lack of common interest between white-collar staff,
represented mainly by Nalgo, and manual workers, mostly in Nupe. Last year,
as Nalgo was balloting its members over a strike on a 6.4 per cent pay
offer, local authorities reached agreement with leaders of Nupe and other
unions representing blue-collar workers on a similar offer, sweetened by a
promise of shorter working hours. The proposed pay deal was believed to have
weakened the resolve of white-collar staff, who voted against taking action
over the offer.
'Divide and rule tactics like that will be less easy in the new set-up,'
says one employer. 'It will be the same union negotiating for both blue and
white-collar workers.'
But not all employers are pessimistic about the proposed merger. Mr Charles
Nolda, lead negotiator for UK local authorities in national pay talks, says
the unions are likely to be 'forced to come to terms with the case for
fundamental reform' in pay bargaining as a result of competitive tendering
and of the growing number of councils opting out of national arrangements.
The merger could hasten any rethink.
In the past Nalgo in particular has opposed most attempts to add local
flexibility to national pay negotiations, and in 1989 staged a series of
nationwide strikes that succeeded in resisting the abolition of national pay
grades. Nupe has been more amenable to change partly because its members
have faced competition for jobs from lower-paid private sector workers.
Employers hope that Nupe's pragmatic approach will have a strong influence
in the new union. They also hope the merger will lead to 'single-table'
bargaining for all workers below executive level. This would enable the
current system of separate pay talks for white-collar, blue-collar and craft
workers in local authorities to be replaced by one negotiating forum,
thereby simplifying procedures.
Similar arguments in favour of Unison are promoted by health service
employers. They applaud the trend towards local bargaining and
'single-table' bargaining, and say the setting up of the merged union should
speed these developments. However, few health trusts are likely to follow
the example of Northumbria Ambulance service, which this year withdrew
recognition from three unions so that it could negotiate solely with the
Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel.
Like employers, unions have mixed feelings about the creation of Unison.
Some will benefit from increased membership, as workers unenthus-iastic
about the merger resign. Others, particularly the TGWU general workers, will
be concerned that the formation of such a large union will eclipse their own
organisations. For more than 60 years, the TGWU has enjoyed the influence of
being Britain's largest union, and many of its officials are unhappy at the
prospect of losing that distinction.
Over the past six months, the TGWU has buried its traditional enmity with
the GMB general workers; many within both unions believe that a merger will
eventually take place between them.
If that happens, Mr John Edmonds, GMB general-secretary, may view his
prediction that there would be four or five dominant unions by the end of
the century as an over-estimate. Three or four might be more accurate:
Unison and the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (formed earlier
this year) are certainties, with a question-mark hanging over the TGWU-GMB
merger.
Although some specialist unions such as the Fire Brigade Union and the
Association of First Division Civil Servants could, and probably will,
survive as independents, most others would be forced to seek refuge in
alliances as their memberships decline and funds dwindle. Though there would
still be a need for the TUC to lobby the government, many trade union
leaders foresee a smaller organisation than exists today. In such
circumstances, Mr Bickerstaffe's job judgment of eight years ago looks
increasingly sensible.

FT  29 JUN 92 / A state of limbo in Lisbon: Real progress on EC integration
awaits ratification of the Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes an event, or the recollection of it, is entirely dominated by its
post-script. So, President Mitterrand's personal bid to 'do something' to
relieve the siege of Sarajevo threatened to eclipse entirely the EC summit
in Lisbon that seemed to 'do nothing' except wring its hands about the
rising toll in the Yugoslav civil war.
Indeed, it could hardly be more dramatic than for an ageing French president
to wend his unarmed way into war-torn Bosnia, after a summit at which
British officials were estimating that it would take no fewer than 100,000
troops to open, and keep open, Sarajevo airport to relief supplies.
It could also hardly be more erratic than to have the leader of France leave
a summit, dedicated above all to saving the EC's Maastricht treaty and its
commitment to a common European foreign and security policy, without
breathing a word of his mercy mission to his fellow summiteers.
It was not the first, nor is it likely to be the last, freelance act of
French diplomacy. But the gall of Gaul seemed particularly ironic to other
EC diplomats when Mr Mitterrand had just joined other leaders in signing a
document calling for 'a strict discipline among member states' in joint
implementation of Maastricht's intended common foreign policy.
Yet, Lisbon was not a 'do nothing' summit, despite the best efforts of many
leaders to make it so. True, perhaps the summit's main achievement was for
the leaders of the 12 EC states, including Denmark, to record that Denmark's
popular rejection of Maastricht did not sway their 'determination to press
ahead with European construction'. That does not sound earth-shaking. But
that had not been said, at the highest level of government, since Denmark's
referendum on June 2 went against the Maastricht treaty.
There is still a sense of illegality, or at least doubtful legality, about
Denmark's 11 partners going ahead with ratifying the Maastricht treaty on
political and monetary union, when the Treaty of Rome clearly says that
constitutional revisions must carry the unanimous assent of all EC states.
But, in the final resort, EC government leaders can make the rules up as
they go along.
In going along, 'we should keep all 12 passengers on the train', said
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Mitterrand was not so sure on this count. In the
end, 'those countries which do not ratify the treaty will simply have to
count themselves out', he said. But, then, the French president was busy
during the rest of the weekend showing his rather idiosyncratic view of
collective action.
Lisbon's second achievement was to signpost how the Community might, as the
final communique put it, 'bring the process of European Unity closer to the
citizens' through subsidiarity. Making EC decision-making more open and
decentralised promises to pay dividends in aiding Maastricht ratification in
several countries this autumn and in prompting Danish second thoughts,
perhaps next year, about Maastricht.
In one of the rare moments on Friday, when he was not either anticipating or
celebrating his country's 2-0 victory over Germany in the European soccer
final, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, said he hoped
for 'a new political landscape in which new decisions can be taken'. This
was as near as he or any Danish government leader came to hinting at a
possible second referendum on Maastricht.
But the summiteers said they were also convinced that subsidiarity -
confining legislation at the Community level to a carefully justified
minimum - could contribute to the 'harmonious development of the (European)
Union over the coming years'. In a general debate on the issue, several
leaders aired pet candidates for the legislative scrap-heap.
Mr Kohl said he saw no reason why the EC should have legislated on toy
standards, bathing water purity, or safety roll bars for tractors. It was a
little ironic that the Chancellor should have so complained. Although he has
good reason to placate his Lander - the 16 federal states - which fret about
rule from Bonn, let alone Brussels, the fact is that Germans are among the
most pernickety Europeans when it comes to technical and environmental
norms.
But there are plenty of other ironies in the subsidiarity debate. One is
that the push for interventionism often comes from member states, not
Brussels. Mr Jacques Delors, for whom subsidiarity is clearly going to be
the theme of his newly-extended term as Commission president, pointed out
that, in passing a recent measure on free circulation of poultry, the
Council of Ministers had asked the Commission to set the point in time at
which slaughtered chickens should have their feet cut off. The Commission,
said Mr Delors, refused to make such a determination.
EC leaders eagerly took up two ideas from Mr Delors. One was that the
Commission would report to them in 18 months' time on what existing EC laws
and rules it reckoned could be scrapped or modified in the light of
subsidiarity. Mr Delors also promised to justify future legislative
proposals on grounds of subsidiarity, a test that the Council of Ministers
would also have to apply in modifying such plans.
But making the EC less intrusive in the lives of citizens and companies
should not, in Mr Delors' view, lead to any scaling down of the Community's
core policy ambitions - or their cost. Indeed, at Lisbon he reverted to his
original plan to raise EC spending by a third, from Ecus 66.6bn (Pounds
47.5bn) this year to Ecus 87.5bn in 1997.
This was the upshot of a few genuinely acrimonious hours on Saturday, when
the richer northern countries pocketed a compromise proposal, hatched by Mr
Delors at the Portuguese presidency's request. The compromise would have
stretched the rise in the EC's revenue ceiling two years longer (until 1999)
but the northern countries flatly refused to commit themselves to double
structural aid to southern countries. The north would only agree, in the
final communique, to give the south an 'appropriate' amount.
So, Mr Delors pulled what he considered a lop-sided bargain off the table.
Prime Minister John Major termed this 'progress', even though his UK
presidency, which starts in two days' time, will now have to begin the
financing negotiations all over again. It does not mean that Britain will
not broker a budget deal at December's summit in Edinburgh. Indeed, the
supposedly neutral presidential role now imposed on it removes from the
budgetary fray one of the toughest protagonists for EC austerity. And, if
and when they ratify Maastricht, other richer countries may change their
tune.
But the key country here is Germany. Mr Kohl complained at Lisbon that
southern EC leaders did not seem to realise that there were wider calls
these days on Germany's diminished largesse. He cited demands by the third
world at Rio's recent Earth summit for environmental help and the needs for
Germany to help its eastern neighbours improve the safety of their nuclear
power plants.
But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was unimpressed. Asked if he minded being
considered 'the stone in the richer countries' shoe', the Spanish leader
replied: 'Not only am I not bothered by that, I consider it a positive
compliment.' It seemed a far cry from 1988, when a Kohl-Gonzalez deal
settled the EC's budget guidelines for the subsequent five years.
Nor is it likely that Mr Kohl will feel much mollified, if as now expected,
he wins agreement within the next six months that the European Central Bank
should be based in Germany. He feels he almost got that in Lisbon. An
elaborate Portuguese plan to share out EC institutions chiefly foundered on
Mr Major's refusal to see the ECB go to Germany. According to Portuguese
ministers, all other leaders accepted Bonn as the sole seat of the ECB, and
its planned precursor, the European Monetary Institute. Again, the
constraints of his impending presidency will hamper Mr Major in continuing
to seek at least the ECB's foreign exchange arm for London, a quest made all
the harder by the UK's Maastricht treaty reservation about joining the final
stage of economic and monetary union.
Mr Major came to Lisbon, keen that the hallmark of his presidency should be
an openness to the outside world, as symbolised by an uncomplicated and
early start to enlargement negotiations with European Free Trade Association
(Efta) countries. But the first part of this battle was won before he
arrived in the Portuguese capital.
When the Danes voted Maastricht down, they also killed the Commission idea
that the early stages of enlargement would have to go in step with further
institutional changes inside the EC, like more majority voting, which would
be highly unwelcome to the UK.
What remained to fight over in Lisbon was the timing of the start of
negotiations. Mr Major pushed hard. He got agreement that he could start
preparing the EC's negotiating position before Edinburgh, but that 'official
negotiations' could only take place after the Maastricht treaty is ratified
and the EC's future financing is settled.
The UK had long agreed with its partners that a budget deal must precede
enlargement, but had hoped to avoid Maastricht ratification, with its
unknowable timetable, also becoming a pre-condition. Thus, the UK leader
used up some valuable political capital with his colleagues to get informal
preparation of enlargement this autumn. This was a gain, the usefulness of
which was questioned even by diplomats from Efta countries hovering around
the Lisbon summit.
For, in the end, Mr Major, like everyone else at Lisbon, found himself
bumping up against the one hard reality facing the Community today. That is
that, unless and until the Maastricht pact is put solidly in place, the EC
cannot emerge from its current state of limbo. For the UK presidency, this
means hard pounding on the budget issue all autumn, whether it likes it or
not.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Intervention in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLIGHT of the 300,000 people cut off in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
by Serb militias is now so serious that it is difficult for the
international community to stand back any longer. More than 7,000 people
have been killed in Bosnia during the three months since the beginning of
the conflict and hundreds of thousands of others are on the point of
starvation. Yet all efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the dispute
undertaken by the European Community's peace conference chaired by Lord
Carrington, or even to implement cease-fires, have failed.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, who took the dramatic decision to
visit the besieged Bosnian capital yesterday, clearly believed that he had a
chance of bringing the combatants to their senses where others had failed,
thanks to France's historically close relationship to the Serbs. It cannot
be excluded that such shock therapy could have a beneficial short term
effect and, indeed, late last night it appeared that the Bosnian-Serb
leaders might be ready to hand control of Sarajevo airport over to UN
peacekeeping forces. But it is, to say the least, disturbing that his
personal initiative was undertaken without the prior knowledge or backing of
EC colleagues who, just before he left the Lisbon summit, had adopted a
common position on Bosnia.
Even in the absence of a common foreign policy, one could have expected the
French president to inform the other 11 heads of government of his
intentions, particularly on an issue which demands the closest possible
international co-operation if it is ever going to be resolved.
One of Mr Mitterrand's ulterior motives could well have been to pre-empt US
involvement in a matter which he believes is very much a European
responsibility. Yet it is clear that no effective international action to
tackle the Bosnian and wider Yugoslav crisis can now be contemplated without
US participation. The EC has had the opportunity to act alone and has failed
to find a solution.
Military intervention
The challenge since the very beginning of the Bosnian and entire Yugoslav
crisis has always been to find an acceptable alternative to the failed
policy of conciliation and negotiation. To advocate international military
intervention without fully facing the consequences of such a course of
action would be to court disaster. Military experts consider it would take
hundreds of thousands of troops to enforce peace on the warring factions in
Bosnia and even to guarantee that Sarajevo airport remained open in the
absence of a cease-fire. How long would such an international force have to
remain on the spot and what casualties would it have to bear over an
extended period? The disastrous experience of the US and French
expeditionary forces in Lebanon in the early 1980s should serve as a
salutary example to those wishing to do something similar in Bosnia.
Humanitarian airlift
Neither the US, particularly in a presidential election year, nor any EC
country can contemplate a prolonged international military presence on the
ground in Bosnia for those reasons. They are moving instead towards an
international humanitarian airlift, under the UN's aegis, on the assumption
that such aid to the beleaguered population would be flown under conditions
of at least a temporary cease-fire on the ground.
It is not certain, however, that what is intended to be a more limited
airlift operation would avoid all the dangers of a much more extensive
military action. Neither the European Community nor Mr Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, has ruled out the use of military
means to ensure that the humanitarian aid arrives at its destination, if the
fighting in Bosnia is not halted quickly. In practice, this would have to
involve putting in troops at least round Sarajevo airport, along the road to
the city and inside the city itself indefinitely.
If such a longer term military commitment is undertaken under the UN
umbrella, the ultimate political objective must at least be clear. Is it to
partition Bosnia-Hercegovina into separate ethnic states or should it be to
establish a UN trusteeship over the region? For the international community
to decide on military intervention would be an extremely hazardous step. To
do so in the absence of clear strategic and political goals would be sheer
folly.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Lufthansa Baroque Festival - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eighth Festival of Baroque Music sponsored by Lufthansa has run its
course. A mark of success is that the London musical calendar now seems
inconceivable without this annual summer enterprise at St James's Church,
Piccadilly: a hole in it was perceived and has been filled (as the long
queues outside St James's for tickets regularly proclaimed).
New explorations into the vast continent of Early Music (the 'baroque' in
the umbrella-title being only a loose generic appellation) are constantly
mapped out, new performers to lead those explorations constantly introduced.
The church just off Piccadilly may have its inconveniences as a festival
home - bus and car brakes and police sirens forcing upon the listener sudden
intrusions of 'real' time and place - but the pleasures of the church
itself, the facilities it offers (including an agreeable cafe and a
blessedly cool church garden for strolling), and the imaginatively planned
events it houses, outweigh them.
Two instances on this year's schedule: on Wednesday the Lufthansa Festival
provided the British debut of the Quatuor Mosaiques in a programme of Haydn
and Mozart string quartets. This group has already become known to
record-collectors; on a first encounter, last summer at the Grange de Meslay
Festival in Tours, I joined the ranks of its most passionate admirers.
Formed by the French cellist Christophe Coin and three Austrian colleagues,
it brings 'period' practice - sparing use of vibrato, unpressured tempos,
flexible phrasing - to bear on the Classical quartet repertory.
In this case, though, claims of authenticity should be argued much harder
for the corporate musicianship of the players than purely for their
stylistic traits. The Mosaiques are one of the most blessedly chamber-like
of modern chamber-music groups. There is no forcing. The exchange of
performance ideas is intimate and exhilarating. The music speaks. The
accounts of Haydn (Op. 20 no. 1 followed by the two 'torso' movements known
as Op. 103) forged an ideal combination of calm wit, spontaneous expressive
impulse, and lyrical freshness. In the Mozart 'Dissonance' Quartet after the
interval, the players penetrated realms of erotic tension in the music that
are generally left entirely untouched.
The Quatuor Mosaiques will no doubt be back in London soon (their regular
presence in the programmes of the soon-to-be-reopened Wigmore Hall is a
foregone conclusion). My other festival experience, the joint Hilliard
Ensemble and Concerto Palatino account of the Cavalli Vespers the previous
Wednesday, afforded a discovery of rather more marginal significance.
Cavalli, known for his operas but in his day no less important as a Venice
church-composer, left behind a volume of Musiche sacre (1656) out of which
these Vespers were assembled by the Concerto Palatino directors, Bruce
Dickey and Charles Toet.
Though originally the various Vespers-related items might well have been
performed as they were on this occasion, consecutively, an 'opus' called the
Cavalli Vespers is in effect a late-20th-century editorial supposition. The
strongest argument against it was that - particularly with the unavoidable
comparison of Monteverdi's Vespers in mind - the quantity of music proved
too great for its strength and intensity of character.
There were many delights in the individual movements: dancing rhythms,
enchanting vocal and instrumental combinations, the captivating humanity of
invention that marks all Cavalli's music. The performers gave delight
(particularly the soft, suave tones of the Concerto Palatino cornetts and of
the Dutch bass Harry van der Kamp, a Hilliard guest). Yet to my mind the sum
of the parts added little except for a vague feeling of overlong-ness and,
indeed, too-much-ness.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Ives' Fourth Symphony - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During concert intervals at the Festival Hall audiences are regularly
treated to Ivesian collages, when the gentle reverberations of the South
Bank's gamelan ensemble merge into the assorted muzak rising up from the
record stall. On Saturday there was an opportunity to sample the real thing:
the Philharmonia, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, gave a rare London
outing to Ives' Fourth Symphony, with the Philharmonia Chorus and Gareth
Morrell drafted in as second conductor. It was a vivid, excellently
co-ordinated performance; there is little expression 'interpretation'
involved in such a piece, just a need to render these effects as carefully
as possible.
As one of the most hallowed icons of American experimentalism the Fourth
Symphony continues to receive respectful performances; but it is not really
a concert work, much more an interesting idea, a notional model that has
served as inspiration for subsequent generations of American composers.
Compared with their achievements - think of Carter's Concerto for Orchestra
 -and, indeed, with Ives' own orchestral success Three Places in New
England, it is awfully hit and miss, with so much textural mush to negotiate
before the few moments of genuine poetic inspiration.
Earlier Dohananyi had conducted Haydn's Symphony No 12 and accompanied
Krystian Zimerman in Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Despite the rather
martial orchestral contribution it was a wonderful performance, full of
exquisite touch and colour, moments of unexpected wit and occasional fierce
explosive emphases. In such form Zimerman is matchless; he has a range of
articulation beyond the reach of any of his contemporaries, and a musical
sensibility that puts these gifts to the best possible use.

FT  29 JUN 92 / IBM forms alliance to develop PC multimedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer
manufacturer, has formed an alliance with Videologic, a small UK electronics
company, to accelerate the growth of one of the most promising new computing
technologies.
The technology, 'multimedia', combines computer text and graphics with
moving video images and stereophonic sound on a personal computer screen. It
promises to bring greater verisimilitude and ease of use to computing
applications ranging from business analysis to games.
Industry experts believe the development of multimedia applications could
rejuvenate the personal-computer sector, which is flagging because of market
saturation and a decline in product innovation.
Multimedia has been slow to take off, chiefly because of the difficulty of
developing applications that use its full potential. Creating a multimedia
computer program has so far been the province of experts using expensive
equipment.
The goal of IBM and Videologic, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avesco, a video
equipment supplier, is to create products that will make the writing of
multimedia programs cheaper and simpler.
Videologic is a world leader in interactive video technology. In 1989 it
pioneered a way of controlling moving video images on a computer screen
which significantly cut the cost of image processing. Avesco made a profit
on sales of about Pounds 20m last year.
No equity or board-level participation is involved in the joint venture, but
there will be close co-ordination between the two companies as they develop
semiconductor chips, electronic circuitry and software that can be slotted
into personal computers to enable them to be used as workstations for the
development of multimedia applications.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Kinnock predicted defeat in election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK yesterday said that four days before the general election he
had realised that his party's internal strife during the early 1980s would
lead to its defeat.
Speaking two weeks before he stands down as Labour leader, Mr Kinnock said
that on the Sunday before the election his personal instincts and polling
data had signalled that Labour had not done enough to win back the trust of
the electorate.
Between 4 and 5 per cent of the electorate did not have sufficient trust in
the party because of the 'months of turmoil' under the last Labour
government in 1979 and the 'years of conflict' in the early 1980s.
Speaking to Mr David Frost on TV-am, Mr Kinnock said that to win back that
trust Labour would have to further reduce the power of the trades unions in
decision-making.
In spite of last week's decision by Labour's National Executive Committee to
delay any change for at least a year, Mr Kinnock said he was convinced that
the party would move to a one member, one vote system for the selection of
parliamentary candidates.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Auditors' duties to regulators defined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS to investment businesses must examine any breaches of rules that
might lead to de-authorisation of the businesses, new notes from the
Auditing Practices Board said yesterday.
The notes cover the reporting requirements of regulatory bodies for
investment businesses, including the Securities and Investments Board.
While auditors are not responsible for checking compliance with rules - such
as the requirement to give 'best advice' to clients - they must take into
consideration any claims or fines that might lead to withdrawal of
authorisation to conduct business, they say.
Auditors' main responsibility is to provide assurance to regulators on the
financial information provided by businesses, the accounting records and
control systems, and the stewardship of client assets.
The notes lay out a standard form for reports to regulators that provides
clear, unambiguous wording.
The APB has deferred potentially controversial amendments to existing
guidelines on 'ad hoc' or whistle-blowing reports to government regulatory
bodies.
Those allow auditors to report matters to the regulator without breaching
client confidentiality.
APB Practice Note 1. PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes. MK9 2JX. Pounds

FT  29 JUN 92 / Lloyd's moves on efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST STEPS towards possible broad changes in the management of Lloyd's of
London will be taken this week as the troubled insurance market braces
itself for the results of two extensive inquiries.
The opening on Wednesday of an office intended to raise the efficiency of
claims processing may be followed by a rationalisation at the Lloyd's
corporation, which regulates and provides services to the 278 underwriting
syndicates.
The management of the market will figure prominently in one of two
long-awaited reports, scheduled to be considered by the Lloyd's Council, the
governing body, also on Wednesday. The report, drawn up by a committee
headed by Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, will also focus on the
regulation of the market.
A second report, prepared by a separate committee led by Sir David Walker,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the City watchdog, will
also be put before the council. Sir David has investigated allegations that
working Names - individuals who provide the market's capital - have
benefited at the expense of outside Names.
Last week Lloyd's reported its worst-ever losses of Pounds 2.06bn for 1989,
in time with its three-year accounting system.
The market, which faces legal action from financially embarrassesd Names, is
under pressure to adopt wide reforms.
The new claims office will have more freedom to operate along commercial
lines than its predecessor, the marine claims office. It will assume the
functions of the aviation and non-marine claims offices, owned by
associations of Lloyd's underwriters.
The office will have wide powers to set staff levels and pay and will be
able to buy in services rather than rely on the corporation's resources. In
the past, underwriters and the agencies which manage them have criticised
what they have seen as excessive bureaucracy in the market.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Cabinet plans watchdog for secret services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE intelligence services are to be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny for
the first time as part of Mr John Major's drive for more open government.
Senior Whitehall officials confirmed yesterday that the cabinet committee
charged with oversight of MI5 and MI6 had agreed in principle to set up a
parliamentary watchdog to oversee the services' activities.
The watchdog - likely to have members from all three main parties - would
have authority to review the domestic and overseas intelligence policies,
including the electronics eavesdropping operations of GCHQ. It might also be
given the right to investigate particular intelligence operations.
Officials expect its membership to be drawn from the substantial number of
privy councillors on the Commons back benches and in the House of Lords. Its
deliberations would remain secret, but it might publish general policy
recommendations.
Mr Major, who chaired the ministerial meeting that last week approved the
system, has already said he intends to legislate to put MI6 - the overseas
intelligence service - on the same statutory basis as MI5, its domestic
counterpart.
Last month the prime minister confirmed formally, for the first time, the
existence of MI6 and named its chief as Sir Colin McColl. MI5 was put on a
statutory basis in 1989 but is only accountable to parliament through
ministers.
Both services would be treated in the same way under the new system, with a
complaints procedure for MI6 similar to that for MI5. Complaints by members
of the public or by employees against MI5 are examined by a commissioner
appointed by the government.
The Whitehall officials said a number of further ministerial meetings would
be needed to work out the details but the government expects to pass the
necessary legislation within a year.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Bank succeeds with republican coup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL bankers from the republics of the former Soviet Union will enrol in
London today on a special two-week Bank of England seminar.
The Bank's Centre for Central Banking Studies - sometimes known as the Old
Lady's Academy - is expecting to play host to the heads of 10 of the 15
central banks set up since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including those
of Russia, the Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Senior representatives of three other
central banks from former Soviet republics will attend the course.
It will be the first time the heads or their representatives of the
republics' central banks will have met abroad since the break-up of the
USSR.
Subjects to be covered include monetary policy, the creation of separate
currencies, currency convertibility and the development of financial
markets. Relations between fiscal policy and monetary policy, banking
supervision and press relations are also on the agenda.
The Bank believes it has achieved something of a coup in attracting nearly
all the former Soviet republics' top central bankers to a single event.
Providing the former eastern bloc with central banking knowhow, and the
influence that goes with it, has become a highly competitive field, with
foreign central banks such as the German Bundesbank and Austrian National
Bank also playing an active role.
The Bank has provided training for staff of other central banks since the
1950s. In September it set up the Centre for Central Banking Studies to meet
increased demand for such training after the demise of communism in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.

Only 30 per cent of those interviewed had used solicitors more than twice,

charge less than Pounds 50 an hour, while the true rate was from Pounds 60

FT  29 JUN 92 / Paisley may meet Irish ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and Irish governments are preparing for a potentially difficult
meeting tomorrow on the future of Northern Ireland that may bring the Rev
Ian Paisley, the hardline Democratic Unionist party leader, face to face
with Irish ministers, Ralph Atkins writes.
The London meeting, agreed only after two weeks of wrangling between the
governments over dates, will officially be to 'give preliminary
consideration to the issues likely to arise' in the third 'strand' of the
nine-week-old all-party talks process. This strand is concerned with
relations between the two countries.
Unionists regard the meeting as a crucial time for British ministers to
press for removal of the Irish constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. The
Irish government is putting more emphasis on persuading Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, to formally start 'strand two' of the talks - on
relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic.
Tomorrow's agenda was confirmed in talks between Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish premier, at the European Community summit in Lisbon. The
meeting is part of the complex deal struck by Sir Patrick this month to keep
the talks going even though agreement has not been reached in 'strand one' -
on models of government for the province.
The meeting is meant to be between the two governments, but Northern
Ireland's main political parties will send observers. The DUP is expected to
decide today to send Mr Paisley - more to ensure that the UK government is
sufficiently forthright than to put pressure on the Irish.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Commercial whaling ban faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX-YEAR moratorium on commercial whaling will be challenged this week
as 37 nations gather in Glasgow for the annual meeting of the International
Whaling Commission.
Japan, Norway and Iceland still have whaling industries and want a
resumption of the hunting of minke whales. They say stocks have recovered
sufficiently to permit whaling in the Antarctic and in the north-east
Atlantic.
Mr John Gummer, secretary of state for agriculture and fisheries, who is to
open the week-long meeting tomorrow, is expected to say there can be no
resumption of commercial whaling while there is no humane way of killing
whales.
France, which is proposing the creation of a whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic, is leading the opposition. It is backed by Britain and other
European countries.
The International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1986. The moratorium has not been complete, however, partly
because Japan, Norway and Iceland carry out scientific whaling, which they
say is conducted for research.
Yesterday 3,000 people at an anti-whaling rally in Glasgow were urged by Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North-West, to boycott products made by the
three whaling countries.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Thatcher sets stage for bitter confrontations: The former
PM's latest European onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR JOHN MAJOR had harboured hopes that Mrs Margaret Thatcher's elevation
to the House of Lords would signal a period of silence, they were
comprehensively shattered by her onslaught yesterday against virtually all
things European.
The startling passion with which Mrs Thatcher denounced Maastricht - on her
entry into the Lords tomorrow she will become Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven
 -set the stage for a series of bitter confrontations over the next few
months.
As worrying for the government was that, as standardbearer of the Tory
rebellion over Maastricht, she signalled she felt she would feel free to
attack her successor over a broad range of issues.
Cabinet ministers were horrified by the content and tone of her remarks. The
former prime minister should be reminded, they suggested, that she had
campaigned in the general election on a manifesto that hailed Maastricht as
a triumph. But after a period of erratic loyalty during the approach to the
election, her friends say Mrs Thatcher sees no reason to keep quiet now
about issues of 'principle'.
Her warning that Britain could not expect economic recovery until it
decoupled its borrowing costs from high German rates echoed a series of
attacks by rebel Tories on sterling's participation in the exchange rate
mechanism.
Mrs Thatcher - who was persuaded by Mr Major two months before her
resignation to take sterling into the system - was careful not to advocate
withdrawal from the ERM. But she backed calls for immediate cuts in interest
rates to get the economy moving, if necessary at the expense of devaluing
sterling against the D-Mark.
A policy of high interest rates that was right for Germany, she said, was
causing growing unemployment in Britain. 'You will not get economic recovery
in this country while this interest rate stays as high.'
There was also a warning shot over public spending, as Mrs Thatcher reminded
Mr Major that while she was prime minister the government presided over
large surpluses. Her successor had to be 'very careful', as sound finance
was the basis for commanding respect abroad.
But it was on the future of Europe that Mrs Thatcher was at her most
scathing. For her, Maastricht is irredeemable. Even with its opt-outs for
Britain on monetary union and the social charter, it would strike at the
heart of parliamentary democracy.
It would create a European union that had its own citizenship, currency and
foreign and defence policies. 'It is the structure of a federal state,' she
said.
Mrs Thatcher dismissed as 'gobbledegook' the principle of 'subsidiarity'
which Mr Major has put at the centre of his approach to European
integration. She attacked his decision to back the extension of Mr Jacques
Delors' term as European Commission president. She applauded the Danish vote
against Maastricht. She argued that it had 'saved parliamentary democracy in
this country'.
If Mr Major pressed ahead with ratification of the treaties, she warned, she
would vote against him. Even if Mr Major's leadership was threatened by such
a rebellion, although Mrs Thatcher did not believe there would be such a
challenge. She told Tory opponents of Maastricht to 'vote on what you
believe'.
Mr Major's colleagues believe that in the end such attacks will be
counter-productive. The Conservative party in the country had worshipped Mrs
Thatcher, but it would not back disloyalty. Though guaranteed publicity this
week, her attacks would be a 'devaluing currency'.
Ministers also believe that if the legislation to ratify Maastricht is
framed as a confidence issue, then only a small hard core of Tory
'irreconcilables' will vote against it.
Until then, they acknow-ledge that Mrs Thatcher is likely to provide a focus
for a damaging and distracting rebellion.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Breaking a run of bad luck: The casino industry's hopes for
better times ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCK has been running against the casino industry. The Gulf war hit Kuwaiti
gamblers, then the recession knocked British confidence, and finally London
Clubs, the capital's leading casino group, fell out of favour with the
gaming authorities.
In spite of all that, Mr Norman Ward-Jones, whose term as Gaming Board
chairman ends tomorrow, believes that casino gaming has held up better than
might be expected.
'Times are changing, and we have tried to change with them,' Mr Ward-Jones
says. 'I suppose my main aim has been to preserve the character of British
gaming - the club atmosphere.'
Mr Ward-Jones's term of office has been generally calm and uneventful, apart
from the debacle over London Clubs, which started a year ago with police
raids on its Mayfair casinos.
The board and the police have lodged objections to renewal of London Clubs'
casino licences. No official comment is being made on the matter, pending a
magistrates' court hearing set for October. However, after the sudden
resignation of the top managers of London Clubs this spring - 'in the best
interests of the majority of the company's employees' - the outlook has
changed.
It may be open to Sir Gordon Booth, new chairman of what is in effect a new
company, to apply for a transfer of the licences.
If the police and the Gaming Board chose not to oppose such a transfer, the
casinos - which include the Ritz Club in Piccadilly and Les Ambassadeurs in
Park Lane - would be saved.
One of the main achievements of Mr Ward-Jones's six-year term as chairman
was to secure an amendment to the Gaming Act to give the board proper
control of casinos when they changed ownership.
During the casino scandals at the end of the 1970s and 1980s, a casino in
conflict with the authorities could simply try to sell its licences to a new
company.
Now, if 15 per cent of a casino's shares are sold, it is deemed a change in
control and the company must seek a fresh certificate of consent.
There have been one or two changes that have helped the gambler. For
example, cheques may be consolidated - that is, a player who cashes cheques
with the casino and goes on to win money that night may use the winnings to
redeem the cheques.
Mr Ward-Jones says: 'Obviously casinos have been hurt by the recession, even
in the provinces. But it is surprising how well business has held up.
'The big money never came from the British, anyway. Overseas players still
seem to be coming to London. In some of the provincial casinos, though the
stakes are far less, the Chinese are the keenest punters.'
New legislation is always difficult to promote. An attempt to raise the
maximum number of slot machines allowed in a club from two to four failed in
the Lords.
Mr Ward-Jones has visited most of the 120 casinos in the country during his
term, but has never felt drawn to gambling, beyond the typical Englishman's
enthusiasm for the Derby.
His successor is Lady Shirley Littler, who among other things chairs the
Department of Health committee inquiring into stillbirths and deaths in
infancy.
She was previously director-general of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, which she joined on leaving the Home Office, where she was
under-secretary in charge of the immigration and nationality department.
Mr Tom Kavanagh, the new secretary of the board, also comes from the Home
Office's immigration department.
The European dimension is likely to play an increasingly important role in
the board's affairs.
The European Commission is considering proposals to harmonise gambling
regulations in the European Community to ensure 'a level playing field' for
operators and consumers - although the plans are at an early stage.
So far as casinos are concerned, each country's traditional way of doing
things is likely to be the prevailing factor. To meet the challenge of the
single European market, Mr Ward-Jones has set up a Gaming Regulators
European Forum for gambling authorities in EC states.

FT  29 JUN 92 / ICI warns of risk to chlorine business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has warned that its high energy-consuming
chlorine businesses have been made uncompetitive by a 30 per cent rise in
electricity prices since April last year.
The company has attacked the pricing policies and profits of Britain's
electricity producers and those of the regional electricity companies,
warning that its chlorine plants required immediate price cuts if they were
to survive against foreign competition. Energy represents about 70 per cent
of chlorine raw materials costs.
ICI's chlorine businesses are the second largest in Europe, employing 7,000
people in the UK and contributing Pounds 1.5bn to the balance of payments,
according to the company.
The warning follows campaigns by the Chemical Industries Association and the
Major Energy Users Council about the high cost of electricity following
privatisation. The users council has asked for the two large electricity
generators, National Power and PowerGen, to be referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
ICI said it had had lengthy discussions with the electricity generators but
had been unable to gain better prices.
Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers said: 'We
have worked hard to keep all our other costs competitive and an immediate
cut on electricity price is crucial if we are to maintain the jobs in the
industry. Given the huge price increases suddenly imposed on us we were not
surprised by the massive profit increases recently recorded by the
electricity producers and the figures now being unveiled by the regional
distribution companies.'
In February, ICI said it might have to shut its chloralkali plant at
Hillhouse, Lancashire, because of falling demand and rising electricity
costs.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Union levy move rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has decided against introducing proposals which would require
trade unions to obtain regular permission from members on contributing to a
political fund. The move would have seriously depleted Labour party
resources.
However, an employment bill expected this week is expected to include
Conservative manifesto pledges to give the public the right to take legal
action against illegal strikes and individuals greater freedom over which
union they join.
It also seems certain to require unions to obtain the written permission of
members every three years before asking employers to deduct subscriptions at
source. That is expected to reduce union funds significantly.
However, Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, has decided against
introducing a similar clause on the political levy which is used for union
contributions to the Labour party.
The government is undecided whether to include changes to maternity pay
entitlements. The Conservatives are committed to European Community
proposals that would give all employed women, regardless of length of
service, the right to 14 weeks maternity leave on levels equivalent at least
to sick pay, and to the right to return to their job within six months. The
proposals would also make it illegal to dismiss any worker for reasons
connected with pregnancy.
However, the government may want to delay legal implementation after the
failure of EC employment ministers to agree the proposals last week.
Under this week's legislation, the Department of Employment plans to appoint
a commissioner to help the public sue unions that mount unlawful strikes
anywhere in the private and public sectors.
The bill is also understood to include a seven-day 'cooling-off' period
between unions calling strikes and taking action. It is expected to include
proposals for strike ballots to be conducted by post and subjected to
independent scrutiny and the introduction of strengthened rights of union
members against fraud in elections and mismanagement of finances.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Committee boost to top pay seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF EXECUTIVES whose pay is determined by remuneration committees are paid
nearly 20 per cent more than colleagues at companies without such
arrangements, according to a report which will fuel the debate over the role
of non-executive directors.
The study, led by Professor Brian Main of Edinburgh University's economics
department and published in today's Personnel Management magazine, is based
on a survey of 220 of the UK's largest companies, 67 of which were
identified as having a remuneration sub-committee of the board.
The establishment of remuneration committees was one of the main
recommendations of the recent Cadbury committee report on corporate
governance.
The research by Prof Main and Mr James Johnston, a research fellow
colleague, found that the average chief executive salary was Pounds 313,500
in companies with remuneration committees and Pounds 245,700 in those
without them. With the value of executive stock options added, the figures
were Pounds 1.15m against Pounds 930,000 in favour of companies with
remuneration committees.
In an additional article in the magazine, Prof Main and Mr Johnston say the
challenge to committees is 'not so much to hold pay levels down as to
structure pay in a way that provided the maximum incentive by linking pay to
performance'.
The study, however, found no significant difference in the proportion of
options, one gauge of performance pay, in the executives' remuneration
package. It also found that a chief executive whose compensation committee
includes non-executive directors who are particularly well paid by their own
company is likely to be paid more in turn.
The authors conclude that 'merely setting up a remuneration committee is no
answer to the problem of controlling top executive pay'. It adds: 'At the
moment in Britain, these committees seem to do little more than legitimise
generous pay awards. In general, these findings suggest that innovations in
corporate governance do not promise an immediate or radical transformation
in the way top executives are paid.'
The report says attention should be paid to the way non-executive
directorships are filled. 'There is clear scope for greater shareholder
activism, both in demanding greater disclosure of the nature of the
deliberations of the committees and by securing non-executive directorships
for shareholder representatives.'
The survey found that remuneration committees were more common among larger
companies - 40 per cent among those with an annual turnover of more than
Pounds 1.5bn and 17 per cent among those with less than Pounds 500m. Less
than half of the 67 remuneration committees were totally free of executive
membership. There were many cases where executives sat on the committee that
determined their own pay.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Company failure rate sharply up: Number of collapses rises
17% - West Midlands shows the steepest fall in output - Interest-rate switch
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of company failures due to the recession has risen by 17 per cent
while the number of creations has fallen by the same percentage, according
to two studies.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says 1,320 businesses have
collapsed each week in the second quarter of this year - about 17 per cent
up on the same period last year.
Meanwhile Jordans, a supplier of company information, said about 2,000
companies were formed each week in April and May, 17 per cent down on the
same two months last year.
Although the two sets of figures are not strictly comparable, they suggest
that the healthy surplus of company creations to failures, a feature of
recent years, may soon no longer apply.
Even last year - when company failures set a new record - more than twice as
many businesses were formed as disappeared. In the boom year of 1988,
creations exceeded failures by a factor of six.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that in the second quarter 15,841 businesses in the
UK, excluding Northern Ireland, failed due to bankruptcy or liquidation. In
the equivalent period last year, the figure was 17 per cent less at 13,539.
Most of the businesses going under appear to be relatively small
partnerships or sole traders.
During the first six months of this year, failures rose to 30,722, 33 per
cent up on the 23,161 recorded in 1991. Over the whole of last year,
failures reached 47,777. Bankruptcies during the first six months came to
19,263 (as opposed to 12,725 last time) while liquidations totalled 11,459
(10,436).
There were wide regional variations, with 7,015 business failures in the
south-east, not including London, in the first six months of this year, a
rise of 57.9 per cent on the same period last year.
According to Jordans, 16,194 companies were formed in April and May in
England and Wales, compared with 19,599 in the same two months last year. If
Scotland is included, the number of company formations is increased by about
6 per cent.
In the year to the end of March, 105,865 companies were formed, 3 per cent
down on the 109,865 total in the previous 12 months.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Broader range of indicators sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ECONOMISTS mull over their inability to plot the path of the longest UK
recession for 50 years, they are examining a broader range of indicators.
But many economists and statisticians are sceptical about data that provide
a less than complete picture of a specific part of the economy, or are
derived from relatively new surveys and so lack historical perspective.
Many potentially interesting statistics are also guarded jealously on the
grounds of commercial secrecy.
The new approaches attempt to add new sources of data. They include:
A new industrial panel convened by the Treasury. This met for the first time
last week. It comprises Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser,
and Mr Colin Mowl, head Treasury forecaster, with about eight industry
economists. It is an effort by the Treasury to build stronger links with
private-sector economists.
Better insights into retailing. The Central Statistical Office is attempting
to improve its monthly survey of the sector while 30 large retailers are
providing their own sales index, updated weekly. The figures are not made
public because some stores are concerned about giving information to rivals.
Monitoring the telephone system. The Treasury put out feelers to British
Telecom, Britain's biggest telephone group, to see if it would provide
regular statistics on voice and computer traffic, which could provide useful
clues to economic activity. BT refused, saying the statistics could be
commercially sensitive. But Mr John Leighfield, chairman of AT&amp;T Istel, a
large manager of private-sector computer networks says he is keen in
principle to make some sales data available to the Treasury to help monitor
economic change.
Information from specific industries. Detailed statistics on recruitment
advertising - a useful bellwether of confidence and activity in large
companies - are available from a range of consultancies. Hotel occupancy.
That is thought to be a good indicator of trends in the consumer and
business sectors. Horwath Consulting, leisure consultants, every month asks
a sample of about 400 hotels about business patterns. New packages of
indicators. The consultancy Oxford Economic Forecasting says it has had a
lot of interest from the private sector in efforts to provide a snapshot of
change in the economy based on specific figures about, for instance,
electricity use. The CSO is also attempting to modernise its package of
'cyclical indicators' which attempts to do much the same thing.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Recession overturns southern and regional divide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE lingering recession has overturned the caricatured relationship between
Britain's southern economic core and its regional periphery. The southern
regions have fared badly while Scotland and Northern Ireland have escaped
relatively unscathed.
Yet the slow spread of the recession from services into manufacturing means
the west Midlands has suffered the sharpest fall in output over the last
eight quarters, according to Business Strategies, the regional consultancy.
The service and consumer-oriented recession was largely a punishment for the
excessive growth rates enjoyed by London and the south-east in the latter
half of the 1980s. Rapid southern growth and the lingering side effects of
the last, northern-biased recession, opened wide north-south gaps in
unemployment rates, house prices and incomes per head.
But Britain's economic boom proved unsustainable and the combination of
heavy debts, high real interest rates and falling house prices affected the
spending power of southern consumers worse than less indebted consumers
elsewhere.
Across a wide range of economic indicators - unemployment, house prices,
bankruptcies - the southern regions have fared worst. The south-east may
still have a lower unemployment rate than the average, but the difference
has closed to 0.5 percentage points from 1.5 percentage points when the
recession started, and 2.8 percentage points in 1987.
The south's hangover is likely to impede economic recovery this year.
National Westminster Bank expects a sluggish recovery to be led by Wales,
the north of England and Scotland. The wealth and economic power of southern
Britain means that those regions are expected to experience above-average
growth rates when the economy shakes off its lethargy.
NatWest expects the fastest growth rates in the next five years to be
experienced by the four regions bordering the south-east.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ANATOMY OF THE RECESSION
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
NORTH-WEST
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Slowdown rather than shutdown, thanks to the diversity and strength of
Greater Manchester. Bus scars from the last recession remain,
particularly in Merseyside.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Our central concern is the contraction of the defence and aviation
industries. We have a skilled workforce increasingly without work,
markets and prospects.'
Basil Jeuda, managing director of Inward, the north-west investment
agency.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOTLAND
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mild recession caused much less pain than in the over-borrowed south.
North Sea oil industry has flourished and manufacturing exports have
held up well.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'If the recovery does come to the south east it will be a challenge
for Scotland to match it. People down there still have more money to
spend.'
Ron Garrick, chief executive of the Weir Group, the engineering company
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WEST MIDLANDS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep recession interrupted recovery from the early 1980s shakeout in
engineering and halted the more recent service sector expansion.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Business across a wide spread of products and services is, at best,
flat and the economy is likely to remain that way for the rest of the
year.'
Gareth Davies, chairman of Glynwed International, the engineering group.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
SOUTH-EAST
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bore the brunt of the service-sector recession, but the region's wealth
and proximity to Europe make it a good growth bet when the recovery
finally materialises.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'We would expect the recent, very gradual uplift in the retail sector
to continue. How the south responds will largely determine the strength
of Britain's economic recovery.'
Nigel Whittaker, director of Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Amato cuts Italian cabinet posts: Fifty-first post-war
government is committed to institutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night swore in Italy's 51st post-war
government. Headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, the new government has committed
itself to implementing urgent measures to restore the country's public
finances and to introducing institutional reform.
Mr Amato, 54, failed to obtain the formal backing of any of the parties
outside the outgoing coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social
Democrats and Liberals.
This four-party coalition was discredited by a large protest vote in the
April 5 general election and their majority has been reduced to 16 in the
630-seat chamber of deputies. Despite a fragile majority and serious
internal differences, especially within the Christian Democrats, Mr Amato is
expected to survive tomorrow's vote of confidence in parliament.
The new government fills a power vacuum which has lasted nearly three
months. Mr Amato has faced considerable difficulties in building up a
consensus and took the unusual step last week of issuing a 23-page policy
paper to the 16 parties represented in parliament. The paper laid out four
priority areas for action - restoring Italy's public finances, the fight
against organised crime, institutional reform, and cleaning up public
morality.
At one stage over the weekend he was close to giving up as the party bosses
persisted in their traditional tactic of dictating the composition of the
government. However, backed by President Scalfaro he has achieved a measure
of independence.
This is reflected in the reduction of the cabinet from a record 32 to 24
portfolios, new faces and the presence of six 'technicians'. The Christian
Democrat leadership also sprang a surprise by insisting that anyone wishing
to hold a ministerial post had to resign from parliament to demonstrate the
cabinet's independence from the parliamentary party. Nine new ministers are
Christian Democrat, six Socialist and two each from the minor coalition
partners.
Mr Amato has retained the three unwieldy finance ministries but the choice
of ministers underlines his commitment to curbing the public sector deficit.
The Treasury goes to Mr Piero Barucci, currently managing director of
Credito Italiano, and the budget portfolio is held by Prof Franco Reviglio,
an academic who has been finance minister as well as head of ENI, the state
oil concern.
In a significant move, the Ministry for the South - the worst area for
wasted public investment - has been merged into the Budget Ministry. The
Ministry of State Shareholdings has been incorporated into the Ministry of
Industry which should accelerate privatisation. The only politician in an
economic portfolio is Mr Giovanni Goria, the reformist Christian Democrat
premier from 1987-88, who takes over as finance minister.
Notably absent is Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing premier and veteran
Christian Democrat politician. Although tipped to move to the Foreign
Ministry, the party has preferred to let the younger generation advance. The
new foreign minister is Mr Enzo Scotti, former interior minister. Mr Carlo
Ripa di Meana, EC Environment Commissioner, returns to take over the
environment portfolio.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party has increased pressure on the
government to boost the country's flagging economy by unveiling a package of
proposals costing up to Y7,000bn (Pounds 29.5bn). The LDP's announcement,
made on Saturday, comes amid intense debate among party chiefs and
government officials over the need to boost the economy.
While the party has won some support for action from some ministries,
including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the powerful
Ministry of Finance has so far resisted demands for immediate increases in
public spending. The Bank of Japan has also fended off calls for further
cuts in interest rates.
The LDP's plans were criticised in newspapers yesterday for containing no
specific reference to a supplementary budget, or any other means of raising
money to pay for the proposals. But by making an announcement ahead of final
agreement with the Finance Ministry, the party achieves an important goal.
It signals to the Japanese people and the outside world its willingness to
increase government spending at a time when the economy is slowing and the
US is pressing Japan to take action to revive economic growth.
The announcement comes before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, leaves
tomorrow for a meeting with President George Bush in Washington, followed by
the Group of Seven summit of leading industrialised countries in Munich.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the LDP's policy committee, who announced the
package, declined to comment on the size of a possible supplementary budget.
His reticence reflects party officials' caution in the face of the Finance
Ministry, which has yet to give a firm indication about authorising
additional spending in the current financial year.
The LDP's plans propose Y1,000bn in low-interest loans for small businesses,
hard hit by the economic slow down. They also include tax breaks for
investment in equipment, plus extra spending on science, technology and the
environment, and help for repairing nuclear power stations in the former
Soviet Union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S interim government will attempt to reduce the military's role in
politics and business before new elections later this year but will avoid
confrontation, according to Mr Anand Panyarachun, the prime minister.
Mr Anand said his objectives were to increase participation of businessmen
and the public in politics and to lower the profile of the army, which has
played a prominent role in government since the end of the absolute monarchy
60 years ago.
'We have to take moderate and gradual steps,' Mr Anand said. He was
appointed prime minister to resolve a political deadlock after troops shot
dead pro-democracy demonstrators in May.
Mr Anand's cabinet has already replaced Air Chief Marshal Anan Kalinta,
former interior minister, as chairman of the Communications Authority of
Thailand, which controls international telecommunications, and questioned
the validity of a Thai-Malaysian fibre-optic cable contract he approved
while in office.
At the same time, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the military supreme
commander, has been criticised by his employees and the media in his role as
head of Thai Airways International, the national airline whose shares are
due to start trading on the stock market next month. Critics of the military
want him and other military commanders to be punished for the shootings.
Mr Anand said the military was accepting that the role of the armed forces
in Thai society was changing. He said he expected to call elections soon,
probably for September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A nation-wide display of grief and anger is expected to mark today's mass
funeral for 36 of the 42 victims of the Boipatong massacre in South Africa.
It remains unclear who was responsible for the killings, which led to the
African National Congress deciding to suspend constitutional talks with the
government. But the political significance of the occasion will be
heightened by its location.
The dead will be buried in the cemetery at Sharpeville, the township where
in March 1960 police opened fire on an unarmed, retreating crowd, leaving 69
dead. The ANC has called for a day of mourning, and the funeral will be
marked by services around the country.
President F W de Klerk has said government employees would be given
permission to attend services. He urged the private sector to do the same.
Police have blamed residents of a hostel complex in Boipatong, near
Johannesburg, for the killings. The incident is now being investigated by a
judicial commission to which two legal experts from India and Britain have
been appointed at Mr de Klerk's request.
Efforts to resolve the crisis precipitated by the slaughter continued over
the weekend, with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general, accepting Pretoria's invitation to visit South Africa.
The invitation was conveyed by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister, during talks
with Mr Boutros Ghali in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Saturday. Officials
in Pretoria maintain that such a visit is part of efforts to pre-empt the
ANC, rather than a concession towards the 'internationalisation' of the
South African problem.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, will discuss the crisis with Mr Boutros
Ghali at this week's Organisation of African Unity summit in Dakar, Senegal.
Mr Mandela is expected to press for Security Council intervention in the
form of an international peacekeeping force.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S Likud party, reeling from its election defeat by Labour last week,
announced yesterday it would choose a new leader by the end of the year to
succeed Mr Yitzhak Shamir, who has already said he will stand down.
President Chaim Herzog is due later this week to call on Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Labour leader, to form a new government. Mr Rabin says this could be in
place by mid-July and will be committed to speedy progress in Middle East
peace talks.
The Likud, in government for 15 consecutive years, is resigned to a spell in
opposition during which it will attempt to renew its electoral appeal. As a
first step, Likud ministers yesterday decided to hold a ballot of its
100,000 members by the end of the year to elect a new leader.
The main prospective contenders are Mr Binyamin Begin, son of the late
Menachem Begin, Likud's first prime minister, Mr David Levy, the outgoing
foreign minister, Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, and Mr Binyamin
Netanyahu, Israel's spokesman at the Middle East peace talks.
The party, its morale in tatters after losing one fifth of its parliamentary
strength, will also hold its first full party convention since 1985, when
bitter internal arguments over its defeat and future policy will be aired.
None of the leadership contenders has yet suggested any shift away from the
Likud's hardline policy of holding on to the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, although several leaders have acknowledged that the public spurned
this. In an interview, Mr Shamir said he realised a majority of Israelis
rejected the policy, but he hoped they would come to accept it.
With startling honesty, he confirmed suspicions that he was never seriously
committed to the peace talks, an attitude which contributed to his defeat.
Mr Shamir said he had intended spinning out negotiations on the first stage
of Palestinian self-rule 'for 10 years' while he filled the occupied
territories with Jewish settlers.
'Moderation can only be tactical and not the goal,' he said.
Mr Rabin's hope of wrapping up in two weeks negotiations with the small
parties that Labour needs for a majority coalition may be possible as many
of these parties are eager not to be left in opposition.
As well as Meretz, an alliance of pro-peace groups which is a natural Labour
partner, two ultra-orthodox religious parties have signalled their
willingness to join Labour. Tzomet, an extreme right-wing party, also says
it may be prepared to swallow its ideology for the sake of seats in
government - as has the National Religious party, which is close to the
Likud.
Reuter adds from Jerusalem: The US Congress has sent a team of investigators
to Israel to probe the troubled Arrow anti-missile project.
The visit has fuelled speculation that the Arrow, a favourite scheme of
outgoing Defence Minister Moshe Arens and designed to be part of the US
Strategic Defence Initiative, may be axed. The missile failed in its three
main prototype tests.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Clamour for Collor's impeachment: Scandal has left Brazilian
president's empire in tatters

<TEXT>
WHEN Fernando Collor de Mello swept into office as Brazil's first directly
elected president for 30 years, he expected to go down in history as the man
who saved the Brazilian economy.
Now, with his empire in tatters amid Brazil's worst corruption scandal, Mr
Collor seems more likely to enter the history books as the first Brazilian
president to face impeachment.
In a nation obsessed by soap operas - more people have access to television
than to clean water - viewing figures are at record levels for live coverage
of the congressional inquiry into Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a close friend and
campaign treasurer of Mr Collor. Known as 'Collorgate', the scandal directly
implicates Mr Collor and many senior presidential aides accused of running a
'parallel scheme of government' to line their pockets.
Instead of glory, Mr Collor is facing calls for his impeachment.
The former leader of his government in the Congress is demanding he undergo
a lie detection test while his younger brother Pedro, who initiated the
investigation, insists he be submitted to medical examination to assess his
sanity.
When the inquiry began four weeks ago it was expected the matter would be
quickly buried.
But after the distraction of the Earth Summit, the last two weeks have seen
dramatic revelations which have paralysed the economy and caused the stock
market to drop 20 per cent.
Businessmen and politicians have given detailed evidence of the alleged
parallel scheme of government, telling of 30 per cent kickbacks - apparently
the highest in Brazilian history - and cajoling phone calls from
presidential aides. The latest bombshell was dropped by Mr Renan Calheiros,
the government's former congressional leader, who said that he had warned Mr
Collor of the situation 20 months ago. More damaging testimony is expected
today from Mr Luis Octavio Motta Veiga, a former head of Petrobras, the
state oil company.
Mr Motta Veiga has already claimed that presidential aides were using the
company for their own ends and he was dismissed because he would not
collaborate in agreeing a Dollars 40m (Pounds 21.6m) interest-free loan for
an airline which already owed money to Petrobras.
Although little concrete proof has emerged, a poll last week found 65 per
cent of the population believes Mr Collor to be personally corrupt.
He did not help matters with an emotional address to the nation in which he
could barely control his anger. Nor did Mr Mario Amato, president of the
powerful Sao Paulo Business Federation, who, attempting to ease the
situation, said 'we're all corrupt'. He later insisted he was referring only
to the 'widespread culture of tax evasion'.
The only thing likely to save Mr Collor is fear of what would happen to the
newly democratic system were he forced out.
Brazilian politics is highly fragmented and there is no obvious alternative
candidate for the unenviable job of rescuing an economy from its third year
of recession and monthly inflation of 23 per cent.
Mr Collor's vice-president is widely considered unfit for office and the
military has shown no desire to return to power.

Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani, a 50-year-old Islamic scholar and guerrilla
leader, was yesterday named president of Afghanistan, the fourth man to hold
the post in 10 weeks, Reuter reports from Kabul.
Mr Rabbani is the second president of the Islamic government of Afghanistan,
established by rebel forces in April after the capture of Kabul. He took
over from Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, who served two months under an agreement
signed by resistance leaders in the Pakistani city of Peshawar before Kabul
fell.

TWO powerful earthquakes, including the biggest in the US for 40 years,
rocked southern California yesterday, killing a small child, injuring about
100 people and destroying buildings in remote desert areas, Reuter reports
from Los Angeles.
The first earthquake, the third strongest to hit the US this century and
registering 7.4 on the Richter scale, came before dawn and was felt from Los
Angeles to Phoenix, Arizona, 370 miles away. A second quake - measuring 7.0
 -rumbled through the area three hours later, cracking roads.
The quakes were bigger than the tremor that hit the San Francisco area in
1989, killing 70 people and causing billions of dollars in damage.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Message to Europe and France

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand, with his surprise flight from the European
Community summit in Lisbon to Sarajevo, intended to make a spectacular
gesture of support and solidarity for the suffering people of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, his aides said yesterday.
The most immediate practical purpose of his dramatic visit was to clear the
way for the arrival at Sarajevo of two French Transall C-160 transport
aircraft, loaded with medicines, rations and other humanitarian supplies,
which took off from Toulouse and Orleans yesterday afternoon.
But there seems no doubt that the French president was also seeking to
deliver a strong political message to his own domestic audience, to offset
the prevailing impression that the outside world is impotent to halt the
civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
Like other European leaders, Mr Mitterrand has become distressed at the
bombardment of the Bosnian capital and the loss of life. 'This catches us by
the throat,' he said in Lisbon on Saturday, and called for a strong reaction
by the European Community.
On paper the Community leaders did produce a strong reaction, with a
declaration which explicitly laid most of the blame for the Yugoslav crisis
on the Serbs, and held out the possibility of the use of military force, if
only in the pursuit of humanitarian aims.
In declaratory terms, this statement represented a marked shift from the
traditional French line, which has tended to oppose any categoric
condemnation of Serbia, and sought to stress the priority of diplomatic
negotiations.
But French officials are concerned that the new firm tone of the EC
communique may not sufficiently impress French public opinion, at a critical
moment in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum in September.
In particular they are worried that the EC may appear almost completely
impotent in the face of the Yugoslav crisis, despite the Maastricht Treaty's
declared ambitions to develop a common European foreign and security policy.
At his closing press conference in Lisbon on Saturday, Mr Mitterrand
rejected the implication that the Community was failing to live up to its
new ambitions. The Maastricht Treaty had not yet been ratified, he insisted,
so the EC had not yet assumed its new competences in the field of foreign
and security policy.
The French political establishment reacted to his surprise trip with
confusion and ambivalence. Mr Jean-Francois Deniau, of the centre-right UDF
group, said his initiative was 'rather good', but it was not the president's
job to distribute aspirins.
Mr Bernard Stasi of the Centrist party said 'Bravo]', but Mr Francis Bayrou,
secretary general of the UDF, said the president should not have taken an
individual initiative.
Mr Mitterrand's plan to fly to Sarajevo was not in fact a sudden impulse, it
emerged yesterday. He kept it a secret from the other European leaders, and
even from most of his own officials, until the closing minutes of the Lisbon
summit. But the idea had been taking shape in his mind since earlier in the
week.
It firmed last Thursday, after he met the French philosopher Mr
Bernard-Henri Levy, who passed on to him a personal appeal for help from
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.
This is not the first time President Mitterrand has made a surprise dash
into dangerous territory, for the purpose of delivering a strong political
message. In 1983 he made an equally spectacular trip to Beirut, after the
bomb attacks against French and American forces in Lebanon, as a gesture of
moral support.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Croats 'undermining UN'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIA is undermining efforts by United Nations peace-keeping forces in
that republic, and is destabilising chances of any ceasefire in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali told the
security council in a report published in New York at the weekend.
In the most damning criticism yet of Croatia's activities in both Croatia
and Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Boutros Ghali appealed to Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman to withdraw Croatian forces from Bosnia and refrain from
attacking UN-protected areas in Croatia.
'Tudjman gave us no assurance whatsoever that he would meet our requests,'
an EC official in Belgrade said this weekend. 'We warned Tudjman that
Boutros Ghali was becoming increasingly impatient with Croatia's obstructive
and dangerous activities,' a UN official in Belgrade said yesterday.
In a memorandum to Mr Boutros Ghali by the UN officials who drew up the
report - not yet a public document - he was told that Zagreb was using the
international focus on Sarajevo as a smokescreen to pursue its own aims in
Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, that Croats were increasingly confident
because they were now heavily armed, and that they sensed that the Yugoslav
army and Serb irregulars were overstretching themselves.
Croatia's aims include regaining all its territory seized by Serbs last
year. But those regions are now under UN protection. Western diplomats said
the Croatian government believed the presence of the UN was allowing the
Serbs to hold on to the areas.
'In fact, the UN is trying to prevent Serbs and Croats from killing each
other. That is one of the reasons why we are here,' a UN official said.
In his report on Croatia, Mr Boutros Ghali said the Zagreb government was
hindering the UN's work in several ways. The memorandum refers to a case in
sector west, a UN protected region in central Croatia, where a bomb exploded
in the house rented by UN officials on June 5. A local Serb, despite threats
by the Croatian army, had rented the house to Canadian UN officials.
'The Croats do not want us there (UN-protected region in central Croatia)
because they, like the Serbs in eastern Croatia, are involved in their own
form of ethnic cleansing. They want to expel the local Serbs and regain
control over the region. They do not want to let us see what is going on,' a
UN official said.
Of more concern for UN activities in the region, and reflected in Mr Boutros
Ghali's report, the Croatian army last week launched an offensive in the
Serb-inhabited region of Krajina, south-west Croatia - also a UN
protectorate.
'The Croatian army attacked these areas last Sunday, and bombarded Knin (the
capital of Krajina) last Monday,' said Mr Cedric Thornberry, head of the
UN's civilian operations.
The Serbs have since declared a state of mobilisation against the Croatian
offensive. 'The UN forces are now right in the middle of the firing line.
They can hardly defend themselves,' said a UN official.
In Hercegovina, western Bosnia, UN officials have repeatedly asked local
Croatian forces to allow them to visit the region: 'We were told by the
Croats that they could not guarantee our safety,' an official said. He said
Croatian forces had destroyed dozens of Serb - and Moslem - villages in the
region and forced thousands of civilians to flee.
During a meeting of the charges d'affaires of the five permanent members of
the security council last week in Belgrade, a diplomat suggested that the
west should consider sanctions on Croatia if it refused to withdraw its
forces from Bosnia and stop hindering UN operations in Croatia.
'No one questions that Serbia is the aggressor. But like Serbia, Croatia is
also creating its own Greater Croatia,' a UN official said.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Day when rivers run with blood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY yesterday rose from the mortar and artillery smoke of the besieged
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo as French President Francois Mitterrand's
armoured helicopter landed at the city's airport, writes Judy Dempsey.
But it will take more than Mr Mitterrand to destroy the myths which surround
June 28, St Vitus's Day. Every year on that day, according to legend, the
rivers of the Balkans will run blood red at midnight.
Indeed, it was on June 28 1914 that Gavrilo Princip, a 20-year-old Serb
revolutionary student, shot dead Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary
in Sarajevo. That event sparked the first world war, after Austria declared
war on Serbia.
On that day in 1921 the Constitution of Yugoslavia - the Kingdom of Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes - was proclaimed, amid suspicions among the latter two
that Serbia would dominate the new state.
On June 28 again, 27 years later, the late Josip Broz Tito stunned the world
by breaking with Stalin, a move which earned him friends in the west and
which saw the beginnings of the establishment of the neutral and non-aligned
states.
But the significance of St Vitus, a 14th-century Sicilian martyr, goes back
many centuries. On St Vitus' Day in 1389, Ottoman troops defeated the Serbs
on the fields of Kosovo Polje, the cradle of the Serbian kingdom.
Six hundred years later to the day, Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic
sought to redress this ignominious defeat by addressing a crowd of over
250,000 people at Kosovo Polje. Amid sweltering heat, and an atmosphere of
nationalist fervour, he vowed to create a Greater Serbia in which all Serbs
would live.
In 1991, on June 28, a humiliated Yugoslav army, backed by Mr Milosevic,
declared a ceasefire in the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, after they
had failed to quash Slovenia's quest for independence.
That same day, the army started turning its attention to Croatia, leaving
over 6,000 dead in a war which soon spread to Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: Bosnians leave cellars to hail
unexpected visitor - French president's arrival lifts the spirits of a
besieged capital city near to starvation

IN the midst of the devastation of Sarajevo, people came out of their
cellars to greet the French president yesterday with cries of 'Vive La
France]' and hastily-scribbled placards proclaiming: 'Merci Mitterrand'.
'This visit could be a step towards ending the horror and avoiding military
intervention,' said Mr Nikola Bilic, an editor of Sarajevo Radio, who for
three months has been surviving on rice and macaroni. 'We have too many
dead, too many wounded, who, if they survive, will be invalids. Bombs do not
discriminate their targets.'
Undaunted by the security risks, the 75-year-old president spent part of his
six-hour trip walking through the centre of the shell-shocked city with
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. They visited the military hospital,
where they wished a speedy recovery to some 150 patients.
When Mr Mitterrand arrived at Mr Izetbegovic's office, a large crowd chanted
'Mitterrand, Bosnia, France'. Some had tears running down their faces.
Later, the unexpected visitor from Paris laid a red rose on an altar at Vase
Miskina street, where 20 people were recently killed in a Serb mortar attack
as they queued for bread.
'The efforts of Mitterrand are more than symbolic. The president of a great
country shrugged off warnings of danger in a bid to show solidarity with the
people of Sarajevo,' said Mr Bilic.
The president appeared shaken by the devastation. He told journalists he
felt saddened by the visit which recalled images from the second world war.
'I didn't think it would be like that because really most buildings are
destroyed,' he told Reuters.
'It is destruction of great magnitude, nearly all the houses. After three
months of siege it's become very dangerous and very sad.'
Mr Bilic explained: 'He saw buildings that were once our treasures.'
His visit lifted the spirits of a people at their wits' end after weeks of
near-starvation.
'We had stopped hoping it would be possible to receive humanitarian aid by
air. There was food for only two days more,' said Mr Zoran Pirolic, a
Sarajevo editor. 'If the French manage to send a plane with food and
medicine here, it will save the lives of many people.'
But jubilation was mixed with apprehension about the coming days, and fears
that this gesture would not end the bloodshed, or the fighting. Some
inhabitants of Sarajevo feared the killing would not stop without foreign
military intervention. Mr Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, the crown prince of
Serbia, and the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church joined a
demonstration of up to 100,000 people in Belgrade yesterday to demand the
resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. A group of 20,000 demonstrators
remained on the streets last night blocking the city centre.
Since the imposition of UN sanctions against Serbia, the opposition has
grown more confident in its calls for the Serbian president to step down. Mr
Vuk Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement party, accused Mr
Milosevic of leading Serbia and Montenegro, members of the reconstituted
Yugoslavia, into an abyss of international isolation and condemnation.
'Far before the sanctions of the UN, the ruling (Socialist) politicians had
excluded us from Europe. our economy has collapsed and unemployment has
soared. They have created an atmosphere of national hysteria in Serbia,' Mr
Draskovic said.
The crowd shouted 'We want the king' and 'Slobo, get out'. The call to
restore the king may find a groundswell of support in Serbian society, where
backing for the monarchy has deep roots among the peasantry. In his halting
Serbian, Prince Aleksandar at the weekend told students, in their third week
of anti-government protests, that he was 'here to stay'.
But the return of the heir to the throne may revive divisions in Serbia
between royalists and republicans. Royalists Chetniks fought against
Communist partisans during the Second World War in Serbia.
Prince Aleksandar yesterday pinned his future to the opposition, criticising
the warlike policies of the ruling Socialists (former communists).
But the prince's open support for the opposition may backfire. His inability
to speak Serbian weakens his appeal to the masses and may strengthen
government claims that the opposition are agents of the CIA, the Vatican or
Germany.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand in Sarajevo: EC pins blame on Serbia

THE European Community agreed at the weekend to step up pressure on Serbia,
called for the dispatch of observers to Kosovo and neighbouring countries,
and moved a step closer towards granting full recognition to Macedonia.
EC leaders, fearing that the war in Yugoslavia will spread to other Balkan
countries, said they would not recognise the new federal republic of Serbia
and Montenegro as the successor state of the former Yugoslavia until other
international institutions had done so, and demanded the suspension of the
delegation of the former Yugoslavia at the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe and other international organisations.
At the same time they left open the possibility of force being used by the
UN to re-open Sarajevo airport and allow humanitarian supplies to be flown
in.
In Washington yesterday, President George Bush, who again conferred with EC
leaders by telephone, said the US 'will do its part' to see aid was
delivered. He said Washington intended to handle the situation in accord
with the UN and he declined to comment further on possible US actions.
In a further development last night, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency,
said that the Bosnian-Serb leadership had handed over control of Sarajevo
airport to UN peace-keeping forces. This could pave the way for humanitarian
aid, although the UN commander in Sarajevo denied later that his troops had
full responsibility for the airport yet.
The EC declaration firmly pinned blame on Serbia for the continuing violence
in Bosnia. 'Although all parties have contributed in their own way (to the
fighting), by far the greatest share of responsibility falls on the Serbian
leadership and the Yugoslav army controlled by it,' it said.
Some EC states, led by France and Italy and followed by Germany, had wanted
the Community to adopt more specific measures to ensure emergency supplies
could be flown in. Italy argued that force should be used to reopen the
airport, while France and Germany pressed for tough action, though they fell
short of calling for direct military intervention.
Others remained cautious. The British prime minister, Mr John Major, argued
that a ceasefire would have to be in force before an airlift could be
carried out.
In the end leaders agreed the EC would not act alone but back any United
Nations initiative.
The Community also called for the immediate dispatch of international
observers to the Serbian-controlled province of Kosovo and neighbouring
countries, to prevent an escalation of the conflict.
Under pressure from Greece, EC leaders said they were ready to recognise
Macedonia's independence provided it chose a name which did not include the
term Macedonia.

All series seasonally adjusted. Statistics for Germany apply only to
western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA.  Retail sales
volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy
(value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales
except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department
stores only). Industrial production: data from national government
sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water
supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK
(also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD
standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different
definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate
indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian
employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies.
Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series,
cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in
general economic activity.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Russia's reformers must disguise their success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund is at present trying to draw up an economic
agreement with the Russian government on the basis of, at best, crude and
partial economic information. But the scale of Russia's task means that even
the statistics that do exist are tricky to interpret. The Russian economy is
shrinking and unemployment is rising.  But does this prove that the reforms
are failing, as opponents argue?  Or, conversely, that a rapid economic
transformation is under way?
Confusion over measures of success and failure have dogged every
reform-minded east European government. Even more than in the west, Russian
policy-makers and headline writers have been educated to believe that rising
production is good and unemployment is bad. Reports that industrial output
fell by 13.2 per cent in the first five months of 1992, compared to the same
period a year ago, or that unemployment has risen by 140 per cent since last
December, must bring beads of sweat to Mr Boris Yeltsin's brow.
Unemployment in Russia is, in fact, very low by western standards.  The
government reports 151,000 registered unemployed in April, just 0.2 per cent
of its 75m workforce, although many of these employees are at present on
semi-permanent paid holidays. Once credits to enterprises dry up, and some
go bankrupt, this hidden unemployment will emerge. The government has
forecast a sixty-fold increase in unemployment to between 3.5m and 4m by the
end of this year, while the International Labour Organisation, an arm of the
UN, expects 10m-11m. But even if the UN's pessimism proves correct, an
unemployment rate of 14.5 per cent would not be much higher than in many
western European countries and lower than in both Spain and Ireland.
A western-style unemployment rate in Russia is necessary to control the
pressure for inflationary wage increases, argues Professor Richard Layard,
of the London School of Economics, and currently an adviser to the Russian
ministry of labour. 'Responsible monetary policy works by creating enough
unemployment to control inflation. . . substantial unemployment is in fact
an inevitable price that is paid for freedom and prosperity.'
Yet while the unemployment side-effect of tight monetary policy in Poland
has proved similar to that of Germany in 1948 or Spain in the late 1970s -
Polish unemployment had to rise further because it started lower, as the
chart shows - its output response has been very different. Output per worker
rose in both Germany and Spain from the beginning of their stabilisation
programmes, although Germany had experienced falls in output in the years
before 1948. But rising unemployment in eastern Europe has been accompanied
by sharp falls in output.
Yet Russia, unlike Spain in the late 1970s, does not need rapidly rising
industrial output. Indeed, it needs the opposite:  de-industrialisation and
the transformation of much of what remains.  Many Russian enterprises are
unviable not because their wage bills are too high but because the market
for their products has disappeared, particularly in the defence industry or
where they relied on intra-eastern European trade. Falling industrial
output, far from being a sign of failure or a necessary evil, will allow the
puny service and retail sectors to expand. Rising unemployment, far from
being a necessary evil, will encourage workers to change jobs.
The Russian government has to ensure that economic upheaval occurs at a
politically acceptable pace. 'As a matter of political economy,' argues
Professor Stanley Fischer of MIT, in a forthcoming Brookings Institute
paper, 'a very rapid decline in production, even production that has
ultimately to disappear, may stop a reform programme in its tracks.' The
Russian government is disguising the true level of unemployment by paying
subsidies to unviable enterprises. The success of its stabilisation
programme will depend on whether it can continue to so until privatisation
nurtures alternative opportunities but without financing its budget deficit
by printing money. Enter the IMF.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Major satisfied UK has room for manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were no great triumphs for Mr John Major at Lisbon. But then neither
was there the uncomfortable isolation to which Britain has become so
accustomed at European Community summits. So, as he prepares later this week
to take over the EC presidency, Mr Major had few complaints about the
overall outcome.
He lost some battles, notably over the pace of future negotiations on
enlargement, but returned to London content that the tone of the final
communique left plenty of room for Britain to set the agenda over the next
six months.
From his perspective, the summit confirmed that the certainties which had
led many of his colleagues into the Maastricht accord had been replaced by a
more appropriate humility about federalist blueprints following the Danish
people's rejection of the treaty earlier this month.
President Francois Mitterrand - so often scornful of his British
counterparts - added his voice to a barrage of promises from the leaders to
make the Community less remote from its citizens.
Subsidiarity - the principle that power should be devolved to the lowest
possible level - has yet to catch the imagination of Britain's partners. But
Mr Major's colleagues no longer raise their eyes to the heavens when he
argues that the British presidency should place it at the centre of EC
decision-making.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl - repaying the efforts that Mr Major has made to
establish a Bonn-London axis within the Community - proved a stalwart ally.
When German journalists quizzed the chancellor in private over the direction
of the British presidency, he told them not to under-estimate Mr Major's
tenacity and negotiating skills.
Mr Major has no cause for complacency. If he could claim with some justice
that the Community is now ready to debate its future on the basis of his
agenda - above all on decentralisation and the principle of enlargement -
there was much evidence also that his partners believe the European train
has come to only a temporary halt.
For all the compliments offered to his British counterpart, Mr Kohl made it
clear that Bonn will not abandon its ambition to lock Germany into a federal
Europe.
This precarious balance between the pragmatism forced on the Community by
Denmark and federalist ambitions will remain at the heart of the debate over
Europe's future during the presidency, Mr Major's advisers acknowledge.
By the Edinburgh summit in December, Mr Major will have to give substance to
the notion of subsidiarity.
It will not be easy. While Britain sees it as the instrument to tame
Brussels, Mr Jacques Delors has a rather different concept.
The Commission president is happy to devolve back to national governments
much of the policing of Community law. But he - and many of Mr Major's
European counterparts - do not see that as a brake on greater authority at
the centre for decisions on economic, foreign and security policies.
The debate, though, is on ground chosen for once by Britain.
Mr Major is confident that by the Edinburgh summit there will be a stronger
recognition that his agenda matches the mood of Europe. But, as Mrs Margaret
Thatcher reminded him yesterday, he has first to demonstrate that he can
deliver on his promises.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Cancer charity in pioneer drug deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANCER Research Campaign, the UK charity, has signed a deal with a US
pharmaceuticals company to develop a pioneering cancer treatment which could
earn the charity as much as Pounds 20m a year.
The drug, called Temozolomide, is the first effective treatment for glioma,
a form of brain-tumour. Cancer Research funded research and development of
the drug which was originally discovered by Aston University in Birmingham.
Further clinical trials to establish the drug's effectiveness on other forms
of cancer are being set up. Professor Edward Newlands, the head of cancer
medicine at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School and director of the
drug's clinical trials, said it may prove effective against bone marrow
cancer.
The agreement with Schering-Plough, the largest ever concluded by the
charity's wholly-owned technology transfer company, is worth an immediate
Dollars 1.5m with a further Dollars 4m paid to the charity during
development.
Once the drug is launched, the charity will receive royalty payments. These
could be worth up to Pounds 20m a year, according to Dr Sue Foden, managing
director of Cancer Research Campaign Technology, the charity's technology
transfer subsidiary. Last year the charity's income, raised mainly through
voluntary contributions, was Pounds 40.6m.
Under the agreement, the charity will receive about 40 per cent of royalties
which are worth between 2 per cent and 8 per cent of sales depending on
volume.
The remaining 60 per cent of royalties will be paid to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer,
the Franco-American company that helped with initial research, Aston
University which discovered the molecule, and Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical School which developed it.
Professor Newlands explained that half of glioma patients using the drug had
shown clinical benefit, and as many as 40 per cent had demonstrated an
improvement when examined with brain-scans. Patients with skin cancer had
also shown some improvement. He said this was the first time a drug had had
a repeatable noteworthy effect on brain tumours.
The charity said that it hoped Schering-Plough would be able to use the US
Food and Drug Administration's accelerated licensing programme so that the
medicine would be on the American market within five years.
The potential market for Temozolomide was difficult to predict because it
depended whether it worked against other cancers, Professor Newlands said.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Mitterrand praised for daring visit to Sarajevo: Shelling
erupts after French president seeks to bring hope to embattled Bosnians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SARAJEVO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH president Francois Mitterrand flew out of the besieged Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo yesterday evening after a daring visit by helicopter to
the city's 300,000 starving inhabitants.
The dramatic six-hour stopover ended with the 75-year-old head of state in a
flak jacket, taking shelter in a building near Sarajevo airport after Serb
tanks and heavy machine guns on the runway renewed their assault on the
suburb of Dobrinja. As the president's helicopter took off, Serb irregulars
and Serbia's proxy Bosnian army based at the airport began shelling
Dobrinja, under siege for more than 50 days.
Mr Mitterrand said a second helicopter carrying aides and French security
men was hit during the skirmish, in which Moslem snipers wounded five
Serbian fighters.
Last night Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported that the
Bosnian-Serb leaders had handed over control of the airport to United
Nations peacekeeping forces. This could pave the way for humanitarian aid
but Gen Lewis MacKenzie, UN commander in Sarajevo, said his troops could
still not claim full responsibility for the airport because the Serbs were
still there.
President Mitterrand finally flew out of the airport in his helicopter at
14.40 GMT to Split, where his Falcon 900 jet took him to Paris. One of its
wings was taped up after being damaged by a police vehicle at Sarajevo's
Butmir airfield.
His visit to what was once one of the finest cities in the Balkans started
soon after the European Community heads of state summit ended in Lisbon, the
Portuguese capital, on Saturday.
His EC colleagues were apparently kept in the dark about his intentions. But
Mr Mitterrand told Portuguese president Mario Soares and German chancellor
Helmut Kohl about his plans by telephone before leaving.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'It's a brave act by an elderly
president . . . I take my hat off to him.'
In Paris, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, deputy secretary-general of the conservative
Rally for the Republic, the main opposition party, saluted the panache of Mr
Mitterrand's 'beau geste'.
French officials said the president had wanted to fly on Saturday directly
to Sarajevo, whose airport has been blockaded by Serb forces for nearly
three months, but it was too dangerous. The airport has no lights, and the
runway was strewn with military equipment and shells left from weeks of
heavy fighting.
Instead, on Saturday night, Mr Mitterrand flew to the Croatian city of
Split, on the Adriatic coast. Officials there advised him against travelling
to Sarajevo.
Undaunted, the president, apparently deeply affected by an impassioned plea
of help and support last week by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic,
refused to abandon his mission.
'I hope to contribute to the opening of Sarajevo to the outside world,' Mr
Mitterrand said as he left Split for Sarajevo.
'I want to see, witness, observe and hear.'
Two Transall transport aircraft of the French air force, each carrying 6.5
tonnes of food and medicine, set off for Sarajevo immediately after Mr
Mitterrand's visit. But last night they were unable to proceed beyond Split.
Mr Mitterrand's mission began as the white presidential helicopter touched
down at Butmir airfield, about 15km south of the city centre.
Armed UN peacekeeping troops fanned out across the runway as the president
emerged from the aircraft. He was bundled into a UN armoured vehicle and
driven at high speed through the centre of Sarajevo to UN headquarters.
Undaunted by snipers, Mr Mitterrand made an impromptu walk through the city
with Mr Izetbegovic. Both presidents laid a red rose on a makeshift altar at
the central street where at least 16 people were killed in a Serb mortar
attack last month.
Mr Mitterrand held talks in the pock-marked presidency building with Mr
Izetbegovic and Mr Stjepan Klujic, a senior Croat member of the Bosnian
government.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, and a close ally of Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic, flew in from Pale, his headquarters east of
Sarajevo, to talk to Mr Mitterrand.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Bonn likely to be site of European central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY looks almost certain to be chosen as the home for the planned
European central bank after the European Community summit in Lisbon at the
weekend.
Ten of its EC partners agreed, under a plan put forward by the Portuguese
presidency, that Bonn could be the site of the Bank and its planned
forerunner, the European Monetary Institute.
However, the plan foundered on Britain's opposition. Mr John Major killed an
agreement by saying the UK was not prepared to decide on the bank's site
now.
The UK still hopes that the bank's foreign exchange operating arm will be
based in London, British officials have indicated privately. But a
Portuguese minister said Britain knew this was not possible, given the UK's
Maastricht treaty reservation about joining the final stage of economic and
monetary union.
The summit endorsed the need to ratify the Maastricht union treaty after the
reverse it suffered in the Danish referendum.
The summit also agreed to settle by December the question of future EC
financing, after an acrimonious debate in Lisbon that ended in deadlock
because of conflicting interests of northern and southern EC states.
EC leaders agreed that negotiations to take applicant countries from the
European Free Trade Association (Efta) could start immediately the goals of
a budget deal and ratification of Maastricht were reached.
On the European Central Bank, Germany said it would prefer Frankfurt to be
its home, but it could accept the choice of Bonn if its partners wanted to
prevent the bank's presence making one of Europe's main financial
marketplaces dominant.
The vexed issue of where to site the bank and nearly a dozen other planned
EC institutions, which have still to find a home, was discussed over a late
dinner on Friday night by EC leaders.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister, who put forward the
compromise, said: 'We have never been so close to a solution (on EC
institutions' sites) as this'.
Four previous EC summits have ducked the issue. But it has been given
urgency by the Maastricht treaty commitment to agree a site for the
institute - and, by implication, for the central bank - by the end of this
year.
President Francois Mitterrand of France apparently agreed to the Bonn
compromise, as did Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, who had been pushing
the rival site of Amsterdam.
Decisions on siting other EC institutions is far more confused. Because of
uncertainty about Denmark's eventual place in the Community, Portugal
switched the planned EC environmental agency away from Copenhagen to Madrid.
This prompted changes in the institutions being offered to other EC states.
But it was a measure of the air of compromise in Lisbon that France and
Belgium seemed close to settling the EC's longest-running institutional war
 -to decide whether the French city of Strasbourg or Brussels, the Belgian
capital, should be the permanent home of the European Parliament.
Portugal has suggested that Strasbourg should continue to host a minimum of
12 plenary sessions of the parliament, but that members of the European
Parliament could hold up to five 'extraordinary' full sessions in Brussels.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Tricky week for Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battering of the dollar is likely to continue this week with a host of
economic indicators due and the foreign exchanges braced for a possible cut
in interest rates.
The US currency has been struggling against a background of a faltering
economic recovery, falling interest rates, political uncertainty and high
German interest rates. Poor economic indicators last week, including worse
durable goods figures than expected, a big jump in weekly jobless claims and
slow M2 growth, added to the currency's woes.
According to Mr Michael Feeny at Sumitomo Bank in London, there is a lot of
potential demand for dollars but the interest rate differential with Germany
is still great enough to discourage holding the US currency.
'There still seems insufficient economic justification for the Fed to ease,
but politics is a different matter,' he said.
All eyes this week will be turned to the June employment report released on
Thursday. A payroll gain of less than 100,000 would increase pressure on the
Fed to cut rates again. Economists' forecast is for a gain of around this
level.
The yen has remained firm so far, in spite of the weakness of the Nikkei
index. In fact, the value of the Japanese currency has risen against the
dollar ahead of the G7 summit in Munich.
However, Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese Bank,
believes that if the Japanese stockmarket remains weak then the yen could
suffer a setback.
'It is not too difficult to envisage such a situation,' he said.
'Yen appreciation in the run up to the G7 meetings in January and April met
with a sell-off given the absence of anything concrete in the communique.'

RESULTS DUE
ONE OF THE most important results of the week will be announced today when
British Steel reports figures for the year ended March.
Investors will be hoping there is no repetition of the near 20 per cent fall
in the share price immediately after the half-year figures, but the numbers
this time are likely to make grim reading.
City forecasts vary widely but are all negative, from pre-tax losses of
Pounds 75m to Pounds 165m - against profits in 1990-91 of Pounds 254m.
The big question is what happens to the final dividend - the interim was
unchanged at 3p but was accompanied with a veiled warning about the final
pay-out. The total dividend payment in 1990-91 was 8.75p a share.
Steel industry watchers will also be looking out for any news on an
important link-up in stainless steel being discussed by the UK company and
Avesta of Sweden.
General Electric Company will disclose on Wednesday in its results for the
year ended March that it is building up a 'cash hillock', a smaller version
of the cash mountain it built in the 1970s. It should have net cash of
around Pounds 600m, with about the same amount tucked away in its
joint-ventures with Siemens, Alcatel Alsthom and General Electric of the US.
Most analysts expect GEC to unveil pre-tax profits of between Pounds 820m
and Pounds 840m against Pounds 818m a year earlier. Kleinwort Benson
forecasts that profits of about Pounds 840m should allow a marginal increase
in the divided to 9.5p from 9.3p last year, with earnings per share up to
18.7p from 16p last time.
However, the GEC-Alsthom strong performance in the last year, capped this
week by a huge order for high speed trains will be offset by growing doubts
about the future of the Eurofighter project, which could force GEC to make
larger than planned provisions.
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, is expected tomorrow to
report a significant fall in pre-tax profits and a cut in the interim
dividend when it announces its results for the six months to March 31.
Pre-tax profits are expected to be between Pounds 25m to Pounds 50m compared
to Pounds 109m. Most analysts expect the dividend to be cut in half, from 5p
to 2.5p. Some commentators believe it may be passed altogether.

FT  29 JUN 92 / A bulletin from Gordon Pepper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE red Queen commanded Alice to believe 12 impossible things before
breakfast every morning. The financial markets are less ambitious: they
cling to only one impossible thing, but they cling to it with a passion.
The efficient markets hypothesis is often demonstrably untrue; but it is
taken as the basis for rules which have put hitherto respectable men in
prison. Some hypothesis.
It states simply that market prices reflect all the information available at
any given moment - a tautology; but it goes on to draw some very strong
conclusions, which as any logician will tell you is a very dangerous thing
to do with a tautology.
The hypothesis implies that markets can only be efficient, and thus price
assets correctly, if all information is instantly available to all traders
at all times. This has led to fierce regulations, demanding what can be
summed up in a word, transparency.
Hence the laws against insider trading, and the argument over disclosure of
trading information which is holding up the European directive on investment
service, and which so long delayed the merger of the London futures markets.
Hence the Blue Arrow affair; and hence, too, the flight of investment
professionals to over-the-counter markets; and much else. It's all so
logical that it's a wonder how we ever got on without it.
Yet we did get on without it, as Professor Gordon Pepper points out in a
fascinating and refreshingly lucid paper* for the Capital Markets Forum. He
reminds us that the after-market in new issues was blatantly managed by the
issuing houses in pre-Big Bang days, and were applauded for their efforts.
They were thought to be preserving orderly markets. The government still
does something rather similar with privatisation issues, and nobody raises
an eyebrow. The same eyebrows, however, shoot up when the government changes
the regulations under which privatised utilities work.
Muse about that contrast for a moment, and you may arrive for yourself at
the central insight of Prof Pepper's paper: that there are two quite
different classes of information in the market. One information set covers
the operations of companies, and the economic forces acting on them. A quite
different set concerns trading positions in the market itself.
Prof Pepper broadly accepts that the first class should be displayed
transparently - though as company chairmen agonising over the timing of a
profits warning know very well, it can be awfully difficult to distinguish a
fact from a queasy feeling.
It is during this uneasy time, as he points out to my delight, that insider
traders can actually perform very useful functions, by feeding their
well-informed hopes and fears into the price.
When it comes to trading information, however, Prof Pepper takes the
opposite view: he argues that the knowledge, say, of a large forced seller
in the market actually unsettles trading, reduces liquidity, and can push
prices a long way from what would be justified on the fundamentals.
This is surely a matter of everyday market experience. It helps to explain
the choppy price movements in Tokyo, where an instinct that bargains are now
available fights rumours that this or that strapped bank will have to sell,
regardless.
Prof Pepper's analysis also helps to explain the central difficulty with the
efficient market hypothesis: the fact, accepted by every investment house
which buys chart analysis, that prices do not simply respond to information
shocks about the fundamentals, but display clear trends, resistance points
and the rest. This is the work of trading information, not fundamentals.
It is a pity that Prof Pepper does not go on to suggest rules to fit his
analysis, but merely warns that regulations based on efficient market theory
can be badly flawed. But regulators should study his paper, and hope for
more in his forthcoming book.

FT  29 JUN 92 / French Bonds: Prices shadow Maastricht moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER else happens, or is about to happen, on the political and economic
front, one word will dominate the fortunes of the French bond market over
the summer - Maastricht.
President Francois Mitterand has hitched the tricoleur so firmly to the
cause of European union, that the slightest hint of a setback to the
Maastricht Treaty has a negative effect on French government bonds.
French bonds were faring well until the beginning of this month when the
Danes voted 'no' to Maastricht. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT
government bonds closed last week at 8.77 per cent, compared with 8.53 a
month ago. Significantly the spread of French OATs over German bunds, which
had been hovering at between 50 and 60 basis points before the Danish vote,
has since risen to around 80.
'The French government would like to think it has convinced the market that
France is so stable that the franc is as good as the D-Mark and OATs are as
good, if not better, than bunds,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, an
economist at Salomon Brothers.
'But the reaction to the Danish referendum shows that investors still have
their doubts about the French economy and the government's long-term
commitment to low inflation. The problem is that this uncertainty will
continue until the French referendum on Maastricht, which probably won't be
held until early autumn. That means we may face three months of
nervousness.'
Maastricht apart, the outlook for the French economy seems reassuringly
stable. France began to benefit from the policy of low inflation pursued by
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, first as finance minister and now as prime minister, in
the middle of last year. The recovery is still relatively weak, with high
interest rates restraining both consumer spending and industrial investment.
This moderate revival seems set to continue. France cannot really hope to
reduce its interest rates until German rates come down without running the
risk of putting undue pressure on the franc. And there is little chance of a
reduction in German rates until the autumn.
However there are signs of a stronger recovery on the trading front. Last
week Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, trade and industry minister, announced a
trade surplus of FFr4.5bn in May, which was not only the fifth monthly
surplus in succession but the biggest single surplus for 20 years. This news
has added weight to the bullish statements on growth made by Mr Michel
Sapin, who recently replaced Mr Beregovoy as finance minister.
The latest forecasts from Goldman Sachs anticipate a fall in French
inflation from an average of 3 per cent in the second quarter to 2.8 per
cent in the third and 2.6 per cent in the fourth, with 1.9 per cent growth
in gross national product for the full year.
Accordingly, most analysts seem sanguine about France's economic prospects.
The bond market has already recovered from the rumpus caused 10 days ago by
the French Treasury's announcement of an exchange offer of new bonds for
older outstanding issues, which catalysed both an increase in yields and in
the spread over the bund.
'All in all the French market represents good value,' said Mr Francois
Xavier Chauchat, market economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'But there is
still some nervousness about Maastricht after the Danish vote and it will be
some time before it disappears.'

FT  29 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Speculation mounts over Fed easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS in the US Treasury bond market will be glued to their video monitors
this week as a raft of fresh economic data is expected to provide clues as
to whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.
The most important indicator will be the unemployment data to be released on
Thursday, a day after the Fed's policy-making open market committee holds
its monthly meeting.
The FOMC meeting could be one of the more lively to be chaired in recent
months by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman.
Recent reports suggest that FOMC members are sharply divided over the need
for further easing of monetary policy, with some persuaded that the current
3 3/4 per cent Federal funds target is sufficient to help the US economic
recovery, and others convinced the recovery is faltering even more than has
been apparent.
If a decision to ease is made, it is nonetheless unlikely to come until
after the release of the June employment data, which market watchers expect
will show a rise of 50,000 non-farm jobs.
Mr Greenspan and his colleagues will be acutely aware that they are
deliberating in the political shadow of President Bush, who last week issued
an unusually explicit call for the Fed to cut interest rates.
Mr Robert Di Clemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said
the recent weakness of M2 money supply and other signals of a flagging
recovery could well 'tilt the probabilities toward an eventual easing move,'
perhaps before the Fed chairman delivers his mid-year report to Congress on
July 21.
The Salomon Brothers economist said, however, that he did not believe this
Thursday's jobs data would be sufficiently conclusive to resolve the debate
about the strength of the US recovery.
Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, on Friday called for
a minimum 50 basis point cut in both Fed funds and the discount rate 'in
view of the increasing risk that the recovery is aborting'.
Last week, as more data showed the fragility of the US economic recovery,
the Treasury market staged something of a rally, boosting the price of the
benchmark 30-year bond by nearly a full point, to 102 9/16 . This provided a
yield of 7.77 per cent, down from 7.83 per cent a week earlier and the
lowest yield level for more than a month.
Last week's rally was fuelled by a 2.4 per cent fall in durable goods orders
in May, the first monthly drop after four months of consecutive increases.
Other indicators that showed the recovery to be flagging included a 1.8 per
cent drop in sales of existing homes, the decline in M2 and a slight rise in
initial claims for unemployment benefits by mid-June.
Aside from the important jobs data, this week's diet of macro-economic
figures will begin today with the release of new home sales for May, which
could be slightly improved on April.
Tomorrow brings the leading economic indicators for May, which are likely to
be 0.7 per cent higher. Also to be unveiled tomorrow will be the latest
consumer confidence measure, which could be slightly improved.
Attention will also be focused on the National Association of Purchasing
Managers index on Wednesday, which may well be unchanged on May.

FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Traders brush off funding worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG support for the largest gilt auction yet boosted the gilt market last
week, enabling bond specialists to brush off worries about the large volume
of funding expected later this financial year.
Further signs that the UK economy is likely to grow only modestly over the
next year gave a further lift to gilt prices, on the basis that inflationary
pressures look like staying weak.
The large underlying demand for gilts from many UK investors - who in recent
years have run down their gilt portfolios - was evident from the success of
the Bank of England's auction of Pounds 2.75m of 9 per cent stock due in
2012.
As a result, with the financial year just three months old, the Bank has
found buyers for about half the securities it will need to issue to fund
this year's expected public sector borrowing requirement of around Pounds
30bn.
With demand during the week steady rather than spectacular - and with the
market's appetite for gilts weakened by the auction - movement in terms of
prices was slight.
At the long end of the yield curve, prices moved up slightly, corresponding
to a fall in yields of about 10 basis points.
This small movement, however, does not disguise the general change in the
yield curve over the past few 18 months. This has flattened - with short
yields coming down by more than those at the long end - as a result of
expectations of low inflation.
Thus in January last year, five-year gilts had yields roughly 80 basis
points higher than those for 20-year gilts. At the end of last week, the
difference was just 15 basis points.
While for much of the past year gilt yields have generally fallen, they have
been pushed up during the past month, a factor of concern about funding and
speculation that the trend towards European inflation convergence may have
been blown off course by the problems of implementing the Maastricht
agreement on European economic union.
Between June 1 and last Friday, according to figures from Deutsche Bank,
10-year gilt yields have increased by 26 basis points. Gilts have shown a
worse performance than the equivalent German, Belgian and Dutch bonds -
where yields have increased by 12, 9 and 5 basis points respectively - but
have been more resilient to price falls than French, Danish, Italian and
Spanish bonds - which have seen yield increases of 30, 32, 52 and 57 points.
A reminder that any recovery from the recession will be weak came with
reports of a sharp slowdown in the growth of bank notes and coins in
circulation during June, adding to evidence of poor trading conditions in
Britain's high streets.
The Bank of England reported that banknotes in circulation increased by only
0.5 per cent in the week to June 24 compared with the equivalent week of
1991, following a 0.8 per cent annual increase in the previous week.
The banknote figures were issued as the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development was releasing its latest forecasts for the UK.
It said the UK economy would grow this year by a paltry 0.4 per cent and at
less than a third of the rate projected for other the other Group of Seven
industrial nations. The OECD also warned the expected recovery later this
year would be constrained by high unemployment, the weak housing market and
large debts.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN economic data dominated the European government bond markets last
week, as higher-than-expected M3 figures dashed hopes of lower interest
rates in Germany and in the other European bond markets, writes Sara Webb.
Germany's annualised M3 growth rose to 9 per cent in May, from 8.9 per cent
in April, prompting a sharp sell-off in the bund market as investors and
dealers feared that the Bundesbank would be unable to lower interest rates
before the end of the year.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at BKB International, says: 'Continued
strong monetary growth has reinforced our view that we are unlikely to see
an easing by the Bundesbank until the fourth quarter of the year at the
earliest. And even then it is unlikely there will be a sharp fall in view of
persistent budget and inflation problems.'
The rise in money supply is mainly attributed to the continued strength in
bank lending. Economists see little scope for a sudden slowdown although S.
G. Warburg believes M3 growth will show some sign of deceleration towards 7
per cent over the next six to nine months.
Mr George Magnus, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, says: 'This trend
will satisfy the Bundesbank that some initial monetary relaxation is in
order after the summer - with more to come around the turn of the year and a
lot more in 1993.'
The Bundesbank is due to meet on July 16 to discuss its monetary target,
providing a focus for bond markets, although it is widely expected to stick
to its stated M3 target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.

LALIQUE, the French manufacturer of fine crystal, is expanding its porcelain
interests by taking a 20 per cent stake in Bernardaud, a Limoges porcelain
maker, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Bernardaud, like Lalique, is a family-controlled company. However, another
20 per cent of its equity is owned by Clinvest, part of the Credit Lyonnais
banking group. The company's sales were FFr200m (Dollars 38m) last year.
Lalique already has a foothold in the porcelain field with its Coquet
business. It has not disclosed the value of the Bernardaud deal.

<TEXT>
FINLAND'S insurance industry is being restructured through a new grouping
under the direction of Union Bank, the country's largest commercial bank.
This follows agreement between five Finnish insurers to combine, in response
to the integration of the European insurance market in the 19-nation
European Economic Area beginning next year. The new grouping creates the
largest non-life insurance concern in Finland and starts in 1994.
The Sampo insurance company and Industrial Mutual Insurance will merge to
form a non-life insurance group with about 30 per cent of the Finnish
market. Meanwhile, the direct insurance business will concentrate on three
non-life insurance companies under Sampo as the parent company listed in
Helsinki.
A further group will cover life insurance. Union Bank will set up a life
company and establish a division of responsibilities through cross-share
ownership with two other life companies: Kaleva and Nova.

US COMPANIES raised a record Dollars 420bn in new equity and debt issues
during the first half of this year, according to preliminary figures
released by Securities Data, the US financial information specialist. In the
first half of 1991, Dollars 280bn was raised in new issues,
Two factors were behind the record financings: historically low US interest
rates, and buoyant stock markets. The lowest interest rates in almost 30
years fuelled a boom in the corporate bonds market, with companies raising
Dollars 146bn in 929 issues of new debt, 43 per cent more than in the first
half of 1991.
Even the much-derided junk bond market enjoyed a banner first half.
Offerings of high-yield corporate bonds reached a record Dollars 18.8bn,
beating the Dollars 16.7bn raised in the second half of 1986.
In the equity markets, the continued strength in prices resulted in a record
603 issues worth Dollars 41.3bn being sold to investors, topping the
previous year's first-half record of Dollars 27bn. Initial public offerings
(IPOs) of stock also set a record at Dollars 19.6bn.

for tough year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH insurance industry is poised for another difficult year in 1992
according to Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the state-controlled companies which are two of France's
largest insurance groups.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of UAP, warned a shareholders' meeting in
Paris that his group faced a tough time in some areas of business. He said
its performance in the intensely competitive French non-life sector would be
'at least as bad as last year'.
His concern was echoed by Mr Michel Albert, chairman of AGF, who told
shareholders the situation was particularly serious in the motor insurance
market because of the steep increase in car theft. He also expressed concern
about the 'extremely worrying' state of the commercial risks sector across
Europe.
Both UAP and AGF, like almost all the other leading French insurers, came
under intense pressure in 1991 because of competitive market conditions and
exposure to the unstable Paris property sector.
These difficulties come at a sensitive time given that UAP and AGF, together
with GAN, the other leading state-controlled insurance company, are
candidates for the French government's partial privatisation programme.
Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was ready to increase its capital, but that the
share sale should wait until stock market conditions were more favourable
and its share price was higher.
Both UAP and AGF are pressing ahead with plans to expand into Germany.

CORPORACION Alba, the holding company controlled by Spain's wealthy March
family, has applied to buy Banco de Progreso, the investment bank in which
it has a 40 per cent stake.
Alba plans to merge Progreso with Banco Urquijo, the medium-sized domestic
retail bank also controlled by the family.
Through indirect shareholdings, the March family owns about 70 per cent of
Progreso. Alba will pay Pta2,700 a share, at a 12.5 per cent premium, for
outright control valuing the bank at Pta20.1bn (Dollars 207m). The Madrid
stockmarket commission suspended trading in Progreso following the
announcement of the bid.
The acquisition and the subsequent merger have been prompted by the
breakdown of negotiations to sell Progreso to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based
savings bank that ranks as Spain's biggest financial institution. La Caixa
is understood to have objected to the concentration of Progreso's loans and
to the Pta18bn to Pta20bn price placed on bank.

OLYMPIA &amp; YORK could face a court-ordered damages payment of Dollars 120m
following a US court ruling that the troubled Canadian property group was in
breach of a 1983 contract with a US pension fund.
If such damages were to be ordered, this could affect O&amp;Y's efforts to avoid
filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
But O&amp;Y stressed last night it might appeal against the ruling and that a
decision on damages was in any case some months away.
Judge Herman Cahn ruled on Friday in favour of the Teachers Insurance and
Annuity Association of America, a pension fund that in 1983 agreed to lend
O&amp;Y Dollars 250m to refinance an office block it built as part of the World
Financial Center in New York.
O&amp;Y did not go ahead with the loan, deciding in 1984 to borrow instead from
a bank group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
Mr Michael Lesch, the lawyer representing the pension fund, said the ruling
referred to 'a classic case of a borrower walking out on a commitment and of
a court holding the borrower accountable for its breach.'
Judge Cahn has yet to decide on the actual damages, a process that could
take several months. The pension fund is seeking Dollars 120m, but O&amp;Y is
believed to have set aside around Dollars 23m for possible damages.
O&amp;Y said last night it had not yet decided whether to appeal. It called the
Dollars 120m claim 'grossly exaggerated'.
In a separate development, O&amp;Y severed its ties with two of its three main
financial advisers - J. P. Morgan and Burns Fry, the Canadian investment
bank. O&amp;Y said this was because it had completed 'the intensive planning,
research and analysis phase on its long-term Canadian restructuring plan'.
O&amp;Y continues to employ James D. Wolfensohn, the New York firm.

<TEXT>
GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, may be recovering from the
deteriorating market trends which have depressed its domestic earnings in
recent years.
Mr Eugenio Coppola di Canzano, chairman, said there were signs of 'a certain
improvement' in the market, based on figures for the first four months of
this year. 'I see 1992 as a bit better than the previous year, and I think
1993, for some sectors especially, should allow us to get back to break-even
at the underwriting level.'
Generali, like all Italy's insurers, has suffered from growing underwriting
losses on its non-life business domestically, particularly in motor
insurance. Last year, parent company losses amounted to L112.8bn on non-life
activities, against underwriting earnings of L493.4bn on the life side.
The company said it expected a 'slight improvement' in its domestic
underwriting results this year. In spite of warning signs of some slowdown
in generating new premiums, 'we expect profits to rise in 1992', it
forecast.
Group net earnings before minority interests rose to L672.2bn (Dollars 576m)
last year from L546.3bn in 1990. The parent company's share reached
L563.9bn, up from L467.8bn in 1990. Group premium income, adjusted for
inter-group reinsurance business, rose by 17.1 per cent to L16,005bn. Some
L6,243bn stemmed from life business and L9,762bn from non-life activities.
The Italian market comprised 37.7 per cent of the total.
Mr Coppola di Canzano said the group was now aiming to plug gaps in its
foreign network, notably in Latin America and eastern Europe, while
consolidating existing activities in Europe. Generali's joint venture with
Banco Central Hispanoamericano, should give it about 10 per cent of the
Spanish insurance market, and would also be used to establish a bridgehead
in Latin America.
He said liberalisation in a number of Latin American countries had created
new opportunities, persuading Generali to reverse a decision taken almost
three decades earlier to pull out.
In the US, he ruled out any direct investment in Equitable, the US insurer
in which Axa-Midi of France has taken a stake. Generali has a substantial
holding in Axa-Midi. However the company said any decision to participate in
a possible Axa-Midi rights issue linked to the transformation of Equitable
from its current status as a mutual insurer would be decided 'at that
moment'.
Mr Coppola di Canzano said that by the end of April, 46 per cent of the
warrants linked to last year's big rights issue by Generali had been
exercised.

FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: Total share offer well
oversubscribed

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government's FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.8bn) sale of shares in the Total
oil group, by far the biggest issue so far in France's partial privatisation
programme, has been healthily oversubscribed.
The finance ministry announced it received 27m applications for the 8m
shares on offer to French investors and 14.9m applications from foreign
investors, almost twice as many as the number of shares allocated to them.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, described the sale as 'a great success'.
He said the response from investors reflected 'their positive views of
Total's development'.
When the issue is completed, the French government will have reduced its
holding in Total - and that of state-controlled institutions - from 34 to 15
per cent. The state will directly hold 5 per cent of the group with the
remaining public sector stake divided among such institutions as the
Assurances Generales de France insurance group and the Credit Lyonnais bank.
The healthy response to the domestic issue means the state will exercise its
clawback powers by adding an extra 750,000 shares, originally earmarked for
international investors, to the tranche reserved for the French.
When the government first unveiled details of the Total sale it stressed it
would only proceed if market conditions were favourable. Last year it was
forced to postpone its planned sale of shares in the Elf Aquitaine energy
group because of the weakness of the Paris stock market.
Mr Sapin said the success of the Total issue justified his confidence in the
market. The French government is now expected to proceed with the rest of
its partial privatisation programme which will include the state-controlled
insurance groups.

FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hobson cuts losses and calls for Pounds 2m
via rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOBSON, the USM-quoted toiletries and homecare equipment manufacturer, is
raising up to Pounds 2m through a rights issue. It also announced a reduced
pre-tax loss of Pounds 210,000 and that it was in the early stages of making
an acquisition.
More than 40m shares are being offered on 1-for-1 basis at 5p. The shares
closed at 7 3/4 p on Friday down 1 1/4 p on the day.
The issue is being underwritten by Hawknote with the limitation that it does
not exceed a 55 per cent stake in the enlarged capital.
Mr Richard Thompson, Hobson's chairman is a director of Hawknote.
The loss, for the year to March 31, compared with a deficit of Pounds
270,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.35m (Pounds 2.68m).
The company said that the toiletry manufacturing side continued to suffer
from the recession and sales were short of expectations.
No improvement was expected until the economy improves.
Trading in physical commodities increased significantly after September 1991
and has continued to make a positive contribution.
Losses per share came out at 0.52p (0.74p).
If Hawknote increases its holding as a result of the underwriting to more
than 30 per cent, Mr Richard Thompson will resign as director of Hawknote
and Thompson International, Hawknote's parent, and Hobson will cease to
conduct its commodity trading through Muirpace, a Thompson offshoot.
And the Takeover Panel has waived the obligation for Hawknote to make a bid.
Hawknote undertakes to cut its holding below 30 per cent within 12 months.
If Hawknote holds more than 48 per cent then it will be able to buy more
shares without incurring further obligations to make a general offer to
shareholders.

FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day appointment this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMBER DAY, the retailer that has suffered a collapse of its share price from
126p to 38p in six months, is expected to announce the appointment of a new
finance director this week.
The move is seen by the company's advisers as a first step towards regaining
the support of investors who have lost confidence in Mr Philip Green, the
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Green's success in developing the 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap' formula
through the What Everyone Wants retail chain has been in marked contrast
with his inability to build a sound bridge to his institutional investors.
A flurry of stories about Mr Green's personal affairs and business relations
with a key shareholder - all of which he and his advisers, Samuel Montagu,
say carry no water - has undermined support for Mr Green and the stock.
Two weeks ago, Mr Green also had to announce that the company would not meet
analysts' pre-tax profits forecasts of about Pounds 14m-15m and that the
finance director, Mr Graham Coles, and the company's only non-executive
director, Mr Leslie Warman, were to resign.
The appointment of a new finance director is unlikely, on its own, to
staunch the growing tide of institutional disenchantment until Mr Green's
role is split and a new and forceful executive chairman is appointed.
Last week, as the share price continued to tumble, one analyst described
Amber Day as a 'friendless stock'. 'All those who believe in Mr Green
already hold the stock and those who don't won't touch it even at this
price.'
The persistent lack of support has also generated bid rumours, with
In-Shops, the Birmingham retailer, the latest candidate.
In-Shops, which reports its preliminary results today, has a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 31m - a fifth of Amber Day's value at its
peak last year. It made a pre-tax profit in the six months to September 1991
of Pounds 1.05m, down from Pounds 1.91m.
When Amber Day bought the What Everyone Wants retail chain in 1990, In-Shops
was also a potential purchaser.
Amber Day's new finance director, currently a senior finance man at a
well-known retailer, will replace Mr Coles who is moving to First Leisure.

BETT Brothers, the builder and property investment group, slid into the red
for the six months to February 29. Pre-tax losses for the period amounted to
Pounds 7.52m against profits of Pounds 513,000.
For the year ended August 31 1991 there was an Pounds 8.85m deficit.
Turnover fell to Pounds 9.49m (Pounds 17.8m). The pre-tax result was after
an exceptional Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 4.8m) from the continuing deterioration
in the commercial property market in the south of England, Mr Iain Bett, the

There were losses per share of 50.11p (2.26p earnings) and there is no
interim dividend (2.1p).

FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: NMW stake changes hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, has spent Pounds
2.1m to take a 25.4 per cent stake in NMW Computers which specialises in
services and software for the UK securities business. It paid 40p a share.
Last year ACT bought Quotient, a software house specialising in financial
software and which was a competitor of NMW's.
ACT says that its holding in NMW is purely an investment. Last year, it made
about Pounds 1m through buying and selling a stake in SD-Scicon, the
computing services company which was eventually sold to EDS of the US.
The Birmingham company has, however, a thriving financial services division,
one of five industry sectors on which the company is focused and which
contributed strongly to its pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 17m on sales
of Pounds 120m.
ACT acquired the stake from Specialist Computer Holdings, a privately-held
dealership and distributor.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Brussels plays the duopoly card: Nestle's takeover of
Perrier is reshaping EC competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's negotiations between Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle and
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, signal the start of a
tense poker game, in which much more is stake than the terms of the Swiss
food company's FF13bn (Pounds 1.32bn) takeover of Perrier, France's largest
mineral water supplier.
The case is also shaping up as a test of Brussels' efforts to broaden the
scope of its fledgling merger policy in a way which would greatly extend its
control over future deals in a wide range of European industries.
At the heart of the dispute is the contention by the commission's merger
task force that it has 'serious doubts' about the Perrier deal on the
grounds that it could give Nestle and BSN, France's largest food company, a
duopoly of the French mineral water market.
This is the first time Brussels has challenged a takeover on duopoly grounds
since the EC merger regulation came into force 21 months ago.
Nestle, which had believed the deal would be cleared, accuses Brussels of
moving the goalposts in the middle of the game. Mr Reto Domeniconi, Nestle
finance director, said the merger task force had already said it would not
object to the deal if the company agreed to find another buyer for Volvic,
one of Perrier's biggest brands, instead of selling it to BSN, as planned.
But Nestle has rejected the proposal on the grounds that the sale to BSN is
integral to the whole Perrier deal. 'We have made a clear agreement with Mr
Antoine Riboud (BSN's chairman), and we will stick to this as long as we are
not forbidden to do so by a ruling,' Mr Maucher said.
Nestle has also challenged the duopoly allegation but says it is ready to
discuss a compromise. 'We are not ruling out any negotiation,' Mr Domeniconi
said last week.'
The outcome of tomorrow's talks is expected to hinge on whether Nestle or
BSN is prepared to dispose of enough mineral water brands to reduce their
shares of the French market to a level which Sir Leon and his advisers
consider acceptable.
Though duopoly theory is part of competition policies in Britain and
Germany, it does not feature in the text of the EC merger regulation. Legal
experts are sharply divided over whether Brussels is - or should be -
allowed to apply the theory when judging mergers.
Professor Barry Hawk of the Brussels office of Skadden Arps, a leading US
law firm, says that if the Perrier case established the duopoly principle in
EC law, it would be 'a landmark'. He thinks the commission would then seek
to expand its powers further by challenging looser oligopolies - markets
with several big players.
Mr Domeniconi argues that the result would be to frustrate industrial
restructuring by discouraging takeover bids, particularly hostile ones. As
an active acquirer, which regularly uses takeovers to increase its share of
markets which it does not already dominate, Nestle could be a prime target.
With so much at risk, the company is fighting the commission every inch of
the way. While Nestle's lawyers battle with the merger task force, its top
executives are mobilising support in an effort to influence the 17
commissioners who will eventually decide the case.
'Because this ruling will be very decisive for many future rulings, this has
become very political,' says Mr Maucher. 'I would say that at least all the
commissioners will be involved, if not some of the ministers.'
Thanks to help from BSN and other French allies, Nestle is confident that Mr
Jacques Delors, the commission president, and Mrs Christiane Scrivener,
France's other commissioner, will not oppose the deal. Mr Martin Bangemann,
the German industry commissioner, is also counted on for support.
If these attempts to outflank Sir Leon failed, and a majority of his
colleagues voted to block the Perrier deal, Nestle says it would appeal to
the European Court of Justice.
How far Sir Leon will be swayed by these tactics remains to be seen. A
defeat at the hands of his fellow commissioners would deal a humiliating
blow to his personal standing and the authority of EC merger policy. But Sir
Leon also knows that Nestle risks losing a lot if it refuses to give ground.
At worst, the commission could order Nestle to unstitch the entire deal and
put Perrier up for sale. Although Nestle has said that if the commission
ruled against the deal, it would immediately appeal to the European Court of
Justice, the case could take years to reach a conclusion.
Nestle's voting rights over Perrier shares have been suspended since the EC
merger investigation opened, preventing the Swiss company from controlling
the management of the mineral water group, who in any case opposed the
takeover bid.
A lengthy court battle could leave Perrier rudderless, impeding its ability
to compete and eroding the value of its brands. Even if Nestle won an
appeal, it could end up owning a company worth far less than it paid for it.
On other other hand, Nestle fears that if it agreed to dispose of some
Perrier assets to appease the commission, they might fetch a poor price
because bidders would know they were dealing with a forced seller.
Furthermore, to sell Perrier's Volvic brand to a buyer other than BSN would
be legally complex and seriously strain relations between Mr Maucher and Mr
Riboud, who has powerful political and business connections in France.
Mr Maucher is playing his cards close to his chest, insisting he does not
know how the affair will end. But Nestle's willing-ness to negotiate
suggests it is prepared to do a deal of some kind.
Whether it will be enough to satisfy Brussels may become clear after
tomorrow's meeting. But whatever the outcome of the Perrier case, Brussels
lawyers do not expect Sir Leon and his advisers to be deflected easily from
their campaign to establish duopoly as principle of EC competition policy.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Economic Notebook: Investment crisis put in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A glance at events over the past seven days might almost suggest that the UK
is facing an investment crisis.
Among last week's gross domestic product figures was the news that
manufacturing investment fell by a real 6 per cent in the first quarter
compared with the final three months of last year, and was respectively 13
per cent and 28 per cent down on the first quarters of 1991 and 1990.
The new half-yearly outlook for the industrial world's economy from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris put the UK
at the bottom of the Group of Seven countries' business investment league.
Not only does the OECD expect gross private non-residential fixed capital
formation in Britain to register a decline this year for the third year
running, it also forecasts that Britain will experience the slowest business
investment growth of the G7 countries in 1993.
In the committee stage of the finance bill, Labour MPs tried to retain the
Business Expansion Scheme for manufacturing industry on the grounds that
small companies would otherwise be starved of capital to finance investment.
The MPs' concern was increased by last week's gloomy official reports which
were based on quantitative data. But are such figures the best way to judge
investment trends?
Mr Martin Ricketts, economic director of the National Economic Development
Office, suggests that poor investment figures do not tell the whole story.
Value for money should also be considered when looking at investment
statistics. In a paper destined for a National Economic Development Council
meeting, but which, since the government decision to kill off Neddy, Mr
Ricketts has completed in a personal capacity, he argues that any government
that set out in pursuit of quantitative investment targets would be making a
big mistake.
The collapse of communism bears out this idea. As Mr Ricketts observes: 'No
society was more driven by the demands of investment than that of the Soviet
Union and few can have used investment to so little effect.'
Nearer home, the fact that Britain is well represented among the world's
most profitable companies suggests that some managements are value added
from the investments they make than some of their rivals.
The relative success of some UK businesses indicates that factors other than
the volume of capital investment create competitive advantage. These,
according to Mr Ricketts, are assets which potential rivals find hard to
copy and include:
Technical innovation. While Britain's spending on research and development
as a share of GDP is lower than that of the US, Germany, Japan and France,
some companies such as Glaxo have proved to be successful in turning product
innovation into high profits.
Teamwork. This entails the creation of a co-operative, alert and adaptable
workforce.
Reputation. This important form of intangible capital can only be
established by continuous attention to the customer.
Such assets take time to create. They cannot simply be bought off the shelf
or created through government schemes.
On the other hand, few people would dispute that Britain, with unemployment
heading towards 3m, needs more investment. Much of the good achieved in the
1980s, when UK business investment grew more than 40 per cent and at a rate
second only to that of Japan among the G7, has been undone by the recession.
In these circumstances, what should the government's policy be? Mr Ricketts
suggests that policy objectives should focus on facilitating the creation of
competitive advantage and on removing impediments to investment rather than
offering investment incentives that might be of dubious value.
The government is already doing some of the right things, according to Mr
Walter Eltis, Nedo's director-general. He singles out the encouragement
given to foreign companies to set up shop in Britain as an important part of
an investment-friendly industrial policy.
Foreign-owned companies employed 14.6 per cent of the workers in
manufacturing industry in 1989. But they paid 17.6 per cent of the wages and
salaries and produced 23.5 per cent of manufacturing output. They were also
big investors, responsible for 26.7 per cent of net capital expenditure.
This worked out at net investment of Pounds 5,354 per employee for foreign
companies compared with Pounds 2,512 for domestically-owned companies.
This foreign involvement in the UK did more than simply create jobs. The
investment by the Japanese car companies, for example, was of high quality
as well as quantity. It incorporated the assets highlighted by Mr Ricketts
such as technical innovation, teamwork and reputation of end product. In
some cases, such as the television set industry, such foreign investment has
resulted in the complete replacement of a domestically-owned industry by
foreign-owned plants. In other cases, notably the car industry, the superior
overall performance of foreign-owned companies has forced UK rivals to
imitate, invest and innovate.
The UK has created a climate conducive to investment in other ways. The
corporation tax rate, at 33 per cent, is the lowest in Europe and below US
levels. Personal taxes are low by most EC standards. Industrial relations
have been transformed since the mid-1980s, so that the number of days lost
to strikes last year was the lowest for a century.
Other things need to be done. Mr Ricketts says the government must reduce
inflation further. Low inflation makes it easier for companies to plan ahead
and should help pave the way for lower interest rates. Britain's poor
infrastructure is another barrier to investment and growth as are the
weaknesses of its education and training systems.
These are points that need to be hammered home constantly to both industry
and government. However, the government's decision to close Nedo means there
will be one less forum for the discussion of such issues.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Record amounts raised in US issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US COMPANIES raised a record Dollars 420bn (Pounds 222bn) in new equity and
debt issues during the first half of this year, according to preliminary
figures released by Securities Data, the US financial information
specialist. In the first half of 1991, Dollars 280bn was raised in new
issues.
Two factors were behind the record financings: historically low US interest
rates and buoyant stock markets. The lowest interest rates in almost 30
years fuelled a boom in the corporate bonds market where companies raised
Dollars 146bn in 929 issues of new debt, 43 per cent more than in the first
half of 1991.
Even the much-derided junk bond market enjoyed a banner first half.
Offerings reached a record Dollars 18.8bn, beating the Dollars 16.7bn raised
in the second half of 1986 when the junk market was at its height.
In the equity markets, the continued strength in stock prices resulted in a
record 603 issues worth Dollars 41.3bn being sold to investors, topping the
previous year's first-half record of Dollars 27bn (with Dollars 56bn raised
in 1991 as a whole).
Initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock, the US version of flotations, also
set a record at Dollars 19.6bn. However, there were fewer IPOs in the
April-June period than in the opening quarter. The boom in new equity and
debt issues led to huge revenues for Wall Street. Underwriting fees totalled
Dollars 3.5bn in the first half.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Wellcome fall seen as no threat to offer: Optimism contrasts
with retribution from advisers to forthcoming and cancelled share issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS to Wellcome Trust, the charity planning to sell a large tranche of
its stake in the drugs group Wellcome, yesterday denied there was any threat
to the Pounds 3bn issue.
Mr Philip Bradley, a director of Robert Fleming, the London merchant bank
co-ordinating the global offer, said there was nothing unusual about the
sharp fall in Wellcome's share price since the offer was announced last
March.
Last week's drop in the Wellcome share price to 887p is 21 per cent below
the level prevailing when Wellcome Trust announced the sale of part of its
73.5 per cent holding.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, leaves for Tokyo tomorrow to market the issue
worldwide.
Mr Bradley said Wellcome's share price was being driven down by
institutional investors. It was in the interests of institutional
shareholders to see a lower price in the run-up to the offer, he said.
He denied some reports that the Trust was considering pulling the issue.
'It would require the most extraordinary circumstance or indeed an act of
God for us to consider pulling an issue before the three-week book building
process commencing on July 6 has even begun,' he said.
'The Trust is not required to raise any particular level of funds,' Mr
Bradley insisted. 'When we announced the provisional size of the offer last
Thursday we could afford to use a considerable degree of conser-vatism.'
The company's shares are likely to remain volatile before the offer closes
on July 24. The stock is regarded as unusually illiquid, with about 70 per
cent of the traded shares being held by only 30 institutions.
Additional volatility is added by Wellcome's second best-selling drug,
Retrovir, the anti-HIV medicine. Although it represents only 11 per cent of
the group's turnover, any story about a new HIV treatment has a
disproportionate effect on the share price.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Goldman defends its role in attempted GPA float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN Sachs, the US investment house, yesterday said GPA failed to get a
public listing because of institutional uncertainty over the nature of its
business. It was not because of general problems in the airline industry.
For the first time since GPA, the Shannon-based aircraft leasing group, was
forced to abandon its Pounds 800m flotation on June 18, Goldman Sachs
publicly defended its role as US lead manager.
Mr Eric Dobkin, Goldman's partner in charge of equity capital markets, said:
'US institutions will invest in good businesses where they believe
management is doing a good job.'
He said that last week Goldman raised Dollars 1.15bn (Pounds 608m) for Delta
Airlines, through a convertible preference share issue, and Dollars 495m for
Lasmo when it floated Ultramar, its North American oil refining business.
He said that the decision of US institutions to invest in an airline and an
energy company less than two weeks after GPA aborted its flotation showed
that the latter was a one-off case.
Mr Dobkin added: 'When it came to GPA they were just too uncertain about the
outlook for the business. In addition the current state of the global equity
markets made it a bit more difficult.' Goldman Sachs has been criticised by
some of GPA's other advisers for failing to persuade US institutional
investors to buy shares.
GPA has also said it was deeply disappointed with its advisers' failure to
ensure US institutional support. It added that it was forced to abandon its
flotation at the last minute because support from US institutional investors
suddenly collapsed.
Mr Tony Ryan, GPA chairman, has said that he is still committed to seeking a
public listing for GPA. One of the options available to the group is trying
for a public listing in either New York or London.
Mr Dobkin said he had been surprised at the lack of support from
institutions in the UK, which was supposed to have been the home market for
GPA. 'The US institutions were looking to the UK for support and did not
find it.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Above all, the vogue for higher profits and better working conditions is in
line with a basic shift in Japanese society, whereby the inhabitants of an
economic superpower are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their living
standards and working conditions. In corporate terms, this means Japanese
industry moving gradually towards a more mature Western model. For its
competitors in the West, this will be a profoundly welcome development. What
it means for the investment community is another matter.
It can be argued that the ultimate value of an equity always lies in its
income potential: that when investors buy a share on a high p/e and tiny
yield, they do so on the expectation that it will throw off cash when the
business finally reaches maturity. If the share was correctly priced in the
first place, there is no reason why the price should fall as the process
unwinds.
Applied to the Japanese equity market as a whole, this view calls for a
degree of heroism. Even now, the market yield is a mere 1.1 per cent,
compared to a world average of 2.9 per cent and around 5.5 per cent on
Japanese government bonds. This is at least within shouting distance of
conventional valuations, and, again taking the long view, might even
represent fair value. In the shorter term, there are enough uncertainties -
both transitory and fundamental - to make it hard to call the turn.

FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Basic problems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is not to deny that the big Japanese manufacturers are under heavy
pressure. But on a long view, those problems which can be attributed to the
asset bubble seem largely transitory. Much has been made of the vast sums
raised on the basis of equity warrants which must now be repaid because the
warrants are worthless. But companies will issue new bonds to pay off the
old, and the old bondholders will doubtless reinvest accordingly. The fact
that the rate of interest will shoot up from perhaps 0.5 per cent to 6 per
cent is a problem for the profit and loss account, but not for the balance
sheet or the financial system in general.
Again, much of the cheap money went on a huge surge in capital investment.
Perhaps a third of that went on new capacity, which will be taken up as
demand eventually recovers. Much of the rest went on what might be termed
over-differentiation: video recorders with too many buttons, cars with too
many flashing lights on the dashboard. That kind of thing was popular with
Japanese consumers in the bubble years and is now out of fashion. If the
fashion returns with the cycle, the manufacturers are tooled up to supply
it.
But there are more fundamental problems which the bursting of the bubble has
merely brought forward. A remarkable number of Japan's big manufacturing
sectors seem beleaguered one way or another. The auto industry is
experiencing an unprecedented drop in domestic demand. In the old days, it
might have offset this by increasing sales overseas. Now it not only faces
trade friction: it also manufactures abroad on a huge scale already. The
consumer electronics industry faces market saturation and a dearth of new
products. Much is pinned on high definition television and associated
gadgets: sceptics are doubtful. The construction industry has been promised
huge infrastructure spending, but the long-term pressure on government
spending points the other way.

FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The dividend case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How much of the recent fall is mere bottom-of-the-cycle pessimism is open to
question. Certainly, there is pressure for change from disgruntled
institutional shareholders. Historically, the rationale for buying Japanese
equities has been capital appreciation. Growth opportunities being what they
were, it made excellent sense for companies and shareholders to plough
everything back into the business. But if the growth is not there any more,
say the institutions, neither is the capital appreciation. It is up to the
companies to make good the difference by shelling out.
There are several flaws in this approach. First, the competitive behaviour
of Japanese corporations is a function of the markets in which they operate.
It would be nice to respond to tougher market conditions by easing
competition and raising margins. It is less clear how this is to be
achieved. Second, the stock market bubble was the fault, not of companies,
but of investors. Certainly, some Japanese corporations wallowed in greed
and chicanery with the best of them. They also took advantage of high stock
prices to raise huge quantities of cheap capital, much of which they then
squandered. But it seems odd to suggest that they should transform their
operational strategies simply because their shareholders made fools of
themselves.

FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Japan after the bubble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a certain aptness about the fact that last week's plunge in the
Tokyo equity market came just as most Japanese companies were holding their
annual general meetings. When the Japanese asset bubble burst a couple of
years ago, the immediate threat seemed to be to the Japanese financial
system and the economy at large. But so far at least, the real sufferers
have turned out to be neither Japanese banks nor consumers, but the big
Japanese corporations.
The damage is not so much to their balance sheets and profitability - though
that is real enough - as to their self-regard. Previous crises, such as the
oil shock of 1973 or the sharp rise in the yen in the mid-1980s, were
external in origin and could be addressed accordingly. But the follies of
the bubble years - the excess borrowing and investment, the scandals and
corruption - were purely self-inflicted. As a result, corporate Japan is
going through an unprecedented bout of self-examination.
Companies have taken to asking themselves whether they have been misusing
their resources, both human and financial. Perhaps they should pay less
attention to market share and more to return on equity. Perhaps more of that
return should be handed back to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Perhaps the staff should work shorter hours and be paid by merit rather than
seniority. Perhaps how the cake is divided between consumers, shareholders
and employees needs fundamental review.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: High-tech rackets are ruination of tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D B HARLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As I watched on German television some of the men's singles matches at
Wimbledon, that of Boris Becker versus Martin Damm was typical of what one
now is used to in grass and hard courts championships.
By my reckoning, each point consisted on average of just three strokes -
service, return, and volley. Thus, in each hour, the ball was actually in
play for about three-and-a-half to four minutes maximum. The German
television commentator ironically, and in my view aptly, referred to both
players as 'Aufschlagsmachinen' - hitting machines.
The introduction of the 'high-tech' racket in the 1970s has massively
contributed to the ruination of mens' championship tennis, transforming it
largely into a spectacle of power and speed, dominated perforce by men well
over six feet in height, who, by the very nature of their technique, lack
the artistry, touch and grace of their predecessors.
What I really fail to understand is the attitude of the Wimbledon spectators
who are prepared to pay for, and sit through such boredom, 'enjoying', if
that is the word, watching the ball in play for so short a time - probably
less than 7 per cent of total match time.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Post-Maastricht risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Our central view is that the process of Maastricht ratification will be
back on course by December. However, we assign a 40 per cent chance to
Maastricht ratification stumbling and failing.'
This is the view of the British branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland. It
is not, however, just picked up from the pavements of Zurich. It is derived
from a financial markets interpretation of the chances of a substantial
Italian devaluation. This is now put at 40 per cent, having been 25 per cent
earlier in the year, and about 15 per cent in mid-1991.
The underlying assumption is that Italy is a sort of bell-wether. The idea
is that on pure economic criteria Italy is a devaluation suspect. But if
European economic and monetary union (Emu) goes ahead by 1997 or 1999,
according to timetable, the process of convergence - and no doubt a helping
hand from Germany - would avoid the need for a parity adjustment.
In one sense the drive to Emu and the Maastricht Treaty have been a blow to
monetary union, spelled in small letters. For until about the beginning of
1990, European interest rate differentials were falling and the realignment
risks dwindling as a result of the natural developments of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism. Realignments were becoming fewer - the last one involving France
and Germany had been in January 1987; and the process of policy convergence
had been taken quite far at least among the core members of Germany, France
and Benelux.
Indeed a new study points out that, judged by many of the normal criteria
for deciding whether countries form a natural monetary area or not, some of
the non-EC countries, such as Austria and Sweden, are much more likely
candidates than the outlying Mediterranean members of the EC.* The UK as
usual lies awkwardly in between, neither quite in either category.
In the past couple of years the political process has given an extra
momentum to monetary convergence. But what the political process can do, it
can also undo. So, while the ERM two and a half years ago appeared to be
doing quite well, a sudden snap back to the state of affairs then would come
as a shock to expectations.
The June issue of the London Business School Economic Outlook discusses the
implications of the greater Maastricht risks for British monetary policy.
The problem is that doubts on Emu now throw some doubts on the ERM itself
and reduce Britain's 'hard won investment' in the credibility of the DM 2.95
parity. This in turn may delay a further fall in British interest rates and
in the worst case force an increase.
There is thus a danger of a vicious circle in which the reduced credibility
of the ERM link keeps up interest rates and delays economic recovery, which
in turn stirs up further hostile debate, which further pushes up the
required UK interest rate in a self-reinforcing process.
The most constructive LBS suggestion is that the weakening of
counterinflationary credibility following the Danish referendum should be
offset both by a move to narrow the present 6 per cent ERM margins - which
most people seem to expect before the Edinburgh summit in December - plus a
move to an independent Bank of England.
In other words, if a belt risks coming apart, it would be helpful to wear
braces as well. The independent Bank would itself reduce market fears of a
government in a corner dropping the ERM parity. Second, it offers some
insurance against the possibility of the German counterinflationary anchor
proving weak after all and would allow the UK to take the lead in Europe in
such circumstances. Third, it is some insurance against a worst case
scenario in which the ERM breaks up or a government takes Britain outside
the system.
The LBS goes into more detail about how an independent Bank might work than
others have done. The Bank should be free to determine interest rate policy
in the light of a low and stable medium term inflation rate objective. It
should report annually to Parliament and perhaps more frequently on its open
market operations. As a safeguard against political pressure, appointments
should be made for extended terms, like the eight years specified for the
proposed European Central Bank, with only limited possibility for dismissal.
Indeed the more that proposals for an independent Bank of England are spelt
out the more that Bank begins to look like a smaller version of a European
Central Bank and less like the financial headmistress we know and love - or
don't love. In the last resort the question is not whether we want a
political federation but whether we want independent institutions to
maintain sound currencies.

unification?, T. Bayoumi and B. Eichengreen, CEPR, 25-28, Old Burlington

FT  29 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The lessons of Mr Horton's exit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SO FAR as the board of British Petroleum is concerned, the Bob Horton affair
is over. The blazing hulk of the company's former chairman and chief
executive has slipped beneath the icy waters of corporate consensus so that
hardly a ripple remains.
It is not satisfactory for the BP board to say only that its decision to
force out Mr Horton arose from an assessment of his personal style and the
fact that too much power was concentrated in one man's hands. BP's strategy,
the board insists, will be unaffected by this latest change at the top.
At the very least, the board might have added a note of contrition at the
double error this dramatic departure reveals: the decision not much more
than two years earlier to combine the role of chairman and chief executive
and the view that Mr Horton was the right man for the job. Mr Horton's
personality and style, on vivid display inside BP for over three decades,
was hardly an unknown quantity.
The overwhelming lesson of this sorry affair is that for big companies to
combine the role of chairman and chief executive in one individual is almost
always a mistake. When the chief executive is a person of strong
temperament, the sounding board and guiding hand of an independent chairman
is more or less indispensable. At the age of 50, taking over the leadership
of a large and stumbling oil company, the impetuous Mr Horton should never
have been given sole custody. With the backing of the right chairman, there
is every reason to believe that his considerable talents could have been
channeled to successful effect and that this latest act of self-mutilation
by an important British company could have been avoided. The BP board has
implicitly recognised the force of this argument by naming Mr David Simon, a
career BP man, as chief executive, and Lord Ashburton, an investment banker,
as chairman.
Palace coup
On the brighter side, BP's palace coup also underscores another important
corporate governance issue: that the boards of big companies should contain
a majority of non-executive directors capable of effective and independent
action. At least in its actions last week, the BP board demonstrated that,
as with the murder of Scottish kings, so with the ousting of corporate
chiefs, 'if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done
quickly.'
None of these observations, however, will be of much comfort to Mr Horton as
he re-assembles his shattered career. It would be surprising if his
ambitions did not now leap to the other side of the Atlantic, where during
the late 1980s he enjoyed considerable success, both in public esteem and
the financial performance of BP's then US subsidiary, Standard Oil of Ohio.
Swift decisions
Mr Horton's experience in the US reinforced his natural penchant for a high
profile leadership style, the virtues of which include more openness and
plain-speaking than is the norm in British business. This style was combined
with a commitment to 'delayer' BP, sweeping away tiers of committees and
executive control in favour of managers 'empowered' to take swift decisions
and accept responsibility for their outcome. Although encumbered with a
disagreeable surfeit of business school jargon, this approach to
revitalising old and complex multinational corporations has commended itself
to several important companies, including General Electric and IBM.
It may well be that Mr Horton lacked the subtlety and patience to apply this
philosophy to BP. That, presumably, is the judgment of the board. The danger
is that the board has reacted in panic to the cries of pain which inevitably
arise when entrenched interests are made to face new realities. In
appointing Mr Horton in 1990, the then BP board judged that only a
hard-nosed, self-confident revolutionary would be able to transform the
culture of an organisation still suffering from post-imperial illusions
about its natural place in the global order.
For the sake of the British oil industry and BP shareholders, it is to be
hoped that the ousting of Mr Horton does not indicate a lack of corporate
stomach for confronting the consequences of change. In 1992, the quiet life
is even less an option for BP than it was in 1990.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Weir and Britten in St Louis - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judith Weir's The Vanishing Bride groom had its American premiere in St
Louis this month. Scott Bergeson conducted. There was a pretty good young
cast. Francesca Zambello produced, and Alison Chitty designed; they stressed
the narrative plainness of the tales rather than the strangeness of the
actions related (a bridegroom lured into fairyland, a maiden wooed by the
devil). 'The magic,' Weir wrote of the Scottish folktale collection that was
her main source, 'lies in the tension between extraordinary stories and the
ordinary people who tell them.' There was little magic in the staging, but
much in the music.
This is an uncommonly skilful score - lucid, economical, cleverly designed,
imaginative in sound. Stravinsky inspires it; Messiaen and Britten lend
touches. What I missed at a first hearing was much emotional engagement;
perhaps that will emerge when the sheer dexterity of planning and writing no
longer dazzles.
The next day, Colin Graham's new pro duction of Britten's Midsummer Night's
Dream was electric. This opera's structure, too, is very carefully planned,
almost schematic in its motivic assignments of sonorities, harmonies, and
types of melodic motion. Yet it is not only the most beautiful of Britten's
scores but also - in such production as this - one of the most powerfully
affecting. Derek McClane's decor showed a world reversed: an upside-down
city skyline in the distance, trees descending from the flies. Glow-worms
glittered the stage. The lovely, enchanted wood could have been near Athens,
near London, or in New York, where Central Park has lately been the scene of
passionate murder and brutal rape.
Cruder modern stagings of the play, building crassly on Peter Brook's
vigorous and famous production, abjure prettiness, stress the
donkey-mounts-lady sexuality and the cruelty. Some productions of the opera,
on the other hand, have been merely decorative. Graham's holds the romantic
and the dark aspects in balance; after pangs as keen as those in Figaro, a
reconciliation equally moving is reached.
Robert Spano conducted a fine-grained instrumental performance. Derek Lee
Ragin was an exact and exquisite Oberon. There was an able young cast;
Thomas Barrett, as Bottom, was the outstanding singer. The Dream is less
often heard in this country than Albert Herring, The Turn of the Screw and
Death in Venice (while Peter Grimes and Billy Budd are the big-company
modern staples). This production should bring it forward in favour.
Graham, the artistic director of the company, has - in reaction against the
over-decoration of our day - commissioned a new, permanent back-wall for the
St Louis theatre. Before it, the actors are required to carry the burden of
the drama. 'Shakespeare had no scenery,' he writes, and 'many productions
that seem wonderfully exciting in the rehearsal room are compromised, even
wrecked, by the addition of scenery onstage.' Shakespeare, one might retort,
was not writing opera - that multi-media form of dramatic communication in
which decor has often been a essential element, one on which composers
counted.
The wall, designed by McClane, is a handsome, architecturally interesting
structure, built apparently of solid brick (though in fact of glass fibre).
It closed McClane's own Dream settings effectively. Miss Chitty veiled it
from view in the Bridegroom. It served Butterfly and Il Turco in Italia less
well, and I can imagine future designers finding it as intractable as the
Teatro Olimpico's handsome fixed set (built in 1585 for Oedipus) is for most
19th and 20th-century pieces.
*****
Butterfly was this year's standard opera, played nine times (against five
Bridegrooms and five Dreams). The Brescia score was used. Graham's
production was careful, but the principals, Guiping Deng and Rick Moon, did
not have pleasing voices, and Stephen Lord's conducting was summary. For
once, there was no Mozart; Rossini's 'Mozartian' Turco was given: the Turco
libretto, set by Seydelmann, played in Vienna in 1789 and evidently
influenced that of Cos fan tutte; Cos, in turn, played at La Scala in 1814
while Rossini was composing his version (with the Fiordiligi and Guglielmo
as his Fiorilla and Selim).
Little was Mozartian - or Rossinian - about the St Louis performance,
however. Since it was done in my English translation, I'll not review it.
Enough, perhaps, to report that the opera was presented as 'Prosdocimo's
Dream,' and that the rival ladies donned boxing gloves in the first-act
finale while the chorus erected a ring around them.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: The death of an original mind - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden death of the British architect Sir James Stirling last week is
both a real shock and a serious loss to late 20-century architecture. He was
unquestionably the most interestingly individual architect in Britain and
his talent had been recognised by a knighthood just twelve days before his
death. In the obituary notice last Friday in the Financial Times, the day
after his death, the facts of his career and some of the reasons for his
international importance were spelt out. It seems appropriate in this column
today to pay a personal tribute to his talent as an architect.
There is no doubt that Stirling was by far the most original and influential
architect of his generation and it was this very originality that made his
work controversial. He took enormous risks, sometimes risks that endangered
the very buildings he was creating. I recall the way he worked in his old
office in Gloucester Place, London. There was never any doubt that he was
the fount of original ideas and needed a good staff to understand, interpret
and build them. He had brilliant partners. James Gowan at the beginning, in
the 1950's, enabled him to combine engineering and architecture in a unique
way. Later Leon Krier had a great influence enhancing his new-classical
thinking. Michael Wilford has persistently supported him and will now carry
the burden of the practice. But the originality was Stirling's and that
cannot be replaced.
James Stirling thought about architecture as an artist and he was one of
those rare people who think in three dimensions. At the Royal Academy
exhibition devoted to the work of Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Stirling
in 1986 the public had the opportunity to see his remarkable axonometric
drawings, which both explained how the buildings were conceived and how they
would look. I remember introducing Stirling at his Royal Institute of
British Architects lecture, when he explained his enthusiasm for the marine
engineering drawings produced by his father. There was definitely a fusion
between his understanding of engineering and his love of form that brought
an unusual plasticity to his architecture. He also saw, as sculptors like
Anthony Caro saw, that the materials of engineering have in themselves a
sense of art.
Stirling was an artist. He saw the world as an artist and possessed that
vital ability to refuse to compromise, which can mark genius. As an
artist/architect he fed his sensibilities widely. His house in Hampstead
demonstrated how much he was a man of taste and sensibility - and how well
he was supported in this by his wife, Mary, a furniture designer and
daughter of the writer P. Morton-Shand.
There are very few contemporary architects with the originality to collect
from the past and not just to acquire fashionable works of art from their
friends. The Stirlings gave substantial dinners on a dining table laden with
neo-classical plate and silver. He would show you with pride a chair he had
acquired by Pugin or Thomas Hope - his taste, like his later architecture,
was inclusive and catholic; in private he was surprisingly undogmatic.
His architecture is strong meat. The Leicester University Engineering
Building (1959-63) that he designed with James Gowan is an essay in geometry
and engineering that appears to test both structural and visual credibility.
In its red brick and steel it is aggressive and powerful. But it is as
nothing to the later buildings of this genre which Stirling designed alone -
the History Faculty Library for the University of Cambridge and the later
Florey Building for The Queen's College Oxford. There have been strong
reactions to these buildings because they seem to have a capacity to
auto-destruct. Indeed the Cambridge building, which has one of the most
exhilarating interiors in that city, has been technically so unsatisfactory
that the University has considered demolishing it.
Stirling moved on from engineering architecture to the more sober
combination of a new sort of neo-classicism combined with references to the
immediate past of the Modern Movement. Much influenced by the teachings of
his mentor Colin Rowe (of Liverpool and Cornell universities), Stirling was
the only contemporary architect to understand the idea of 'architectural
collage'. Rowe is an important critic of modern architecture and Stirling
was very much in sympathy with his idea that modernism itself is a part of
history. A glance at the State Art Gallery in Stuttgart - which in my view
is one of the most interesting post war buildings in Europe - shows a
completely original architectural mind at work.
It is no secret that Stirling wanted very badly to win the competition to
design the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery, the Getty Museum in
California and the new Glyndebourne Opera House in Sussex. In all these
important international competitions Stirling came a close second. His
schemes are all powerful, and in the case of the National Gallery he seems
to have demonstrated the gift of carving space out of unpromising solids. He
did succeed where others had failed in winning a planning permission for the
development of No. 1 Poultry in the heart of a conservation area in the City
of London. His scheme has still not been built its future is probably now
uncertain.
The loss of 'Big Jim' long before his time is extremely sad. He was a good
friend and a fierce opponent - rightly fighting for architectural integrity.
He was really one of the only architects in the world prepared to chance
everything on a design. Not all his designs came off, but all were full of
ideas. He nourished the profession world wide - and it is hard to believe
that the big heart under the blue shirt is now suddenly stilled for ever.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded a contract, worth
Pounds 16.6m, to construct an interceptor tunnel at Southport for North West
Water.
The project involves the construction of a deep interceptor sewer, of 2.8
metres diameter, along the sea frontage to divert water from the existing
sea outfalls. The interceptor is designed to store storm water and transfer
it to treatment works, rather than allowing it to discharge into the sea.
The sewer will be constructed by soft ground tunnelling techniques in
water-bearing sand and glacial till. The overall length of the tunnel will
be five kilometres, requiring the construction of 10 acess shafts. The
contract period is about two and half years.
The tunnelling will be carried out using a Lovat full face tunnel boring
machine, in conjunction with compressed air in the tunnel to balance the
external ground pressure.
The tunnel will be lined with precast concrete segments designed and
manufactured by Costain Building Products.
The tunnel lining is 200mm thick to provide sufficient depth of concrete
over the steel reinforcement to resist anticipated corrosion for at least
100 years.
The circular shafts, which will vary in size between 6 metres and 7.62
metres in diameter, will be constructed with precast concrete segments, also
supplied by Costain Building Products.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMEC DESIGN AND MANAGE MENT has commenced work on the design, management and
construction of three projects valued at Pounds 35m for the Boots Company at
Beeston, Nottingham.
The projects are for a new corporate headquarters, a partially automated
warehouse building and the refurbishment of part of a Grade I listed
building for offices and quality control laboratories.
The new corporate headquarters is a single-storey building providing 3,260
sq metres of air-conditioned office accommodation for a staff of 100. This
project is due for completion in May 1993.
The warehouse extension, due for completion in mid-1993, is 5,780 sq metres
in area and is 12.5 metres high to the eaves. Within the building will be a
'mini-load' materials handling system holding nearly 50,000 storage
containers of toiletries and cosmetics which are accessed by computer
controlled automated cranes and conveyors.
From a stock range of almost 14,000 lines, products are picked manually from
pallet racking and shelving and sent on a transportation conveyor to an
automated sortation system which is being upgraded and is located in an
adjoining warehouse. The new and existing warehouses will together enable
Boots to sort over 4,000 order cases per hour.
The refurbishment of part of the listed D10 production building, which was
originally designed by Sir Owen Williams and opened in 1933, will provide
quality control laboratories, additional office accommodation and will
involve replacement of the fenestration and roof covering. Completion of the
project is scheduled for March 1994.

FT  29 JUN 92 / People: An architectural mission to the public
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rory Coonan, head of the newly-created architectural unit of the Arts
Council, claims his mission is to look after the general public's interest
in architecture. 'Architecture is not just for architects,' intones Coonan,
who, appropriately enough, is not trained in the profession himself.
With Pounds 600,000 to dispense in grants over the initial three-year period
coming from the new National Heritage Department, the former visual arts
officer at the Arts Council will be trying to match that penny for penny
with private funding - Japanese and Scandinavian developers and construction
firms with an interest in the UK are apparently a more realistic target than
recession-bound British firms.
Coonan, 38, who is running a very tight ship - with just one assistant  -
explains how he wishes 'to get away from the sterile debate between heritage
and modernism and concentrate on broader questions and not just buildings'
appearance'.
Coonan seems very struck on the French idea of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal in
Paris which shows displays of current developments and encourages input from
the general public. 'Canary Wharf might have benefited from a much more open
debate with lay people instead of these ex cathedra views (trying to create)
Manhattan in the East End,' he ventures.
His new unit has a national conference on planning and architectural centres
on the agenda for next February. Other plans include studies on public
sector procurement - with the civil service agencies' Next Steps programme
targeted to see what sorts of criteria (other than price) are used in
finding buildings.
While his show is 'aided and abetted' by Lord Palumbo, Arts Council chairman
and aggressive proponent of modern buildings, 'our interests in architecture
are not coterminous with his. We are not wedded to a particular style'. But
with avowed modernist and British Library architect Colin St John Wilson
chairing the advisory panel, it will be very much a case of the proof of the
pudding . . .

After the odd false start, DOWTY has finally got a new finance director.
This August, Christopher Bunker was to have joined from Westland, but he
backed off in a hurry the day the offer from TI went final. Reg Moore, the
previous incumbent who had wanted to retire by March this year, is now going
from Dowty, but is not putting his feet up entirely. He is to help smooth
the ownership transition and will be taking up a 'consulting role to the TI
Group'.
The new man for Dowty is 43-year-old David Harding, deputy finance director
of TI since August 1991, who assumes the job in addition to his TI
responsibilities. While shareholders did not get to know him during the bid,
the City did, as he performed a lot of the detailed analysis of Dowty. He
has been at TI since 1980, and was director of corporate development before
moving to the finance side.

Duncan Ross, chairman and chief executive of Southern Electric, is to retire

privatised two years ago, Southern will now split the role of chairman and

of Delta, the electrical engineering company. Wilson, a chartered
accountant, is also a non-executive director of companies including Blue
Circle Industries and Johnson Matthey.
Henry Casley, 54, managing director of Southern Electric since 1990 and
formerly deputy chairman, will become the new chief executive. Anthony
Stoughton-Harris, an existing non-executive director, is to deputy chairman

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Teare, who has transformed the fortunes of English China Clays since
he took over two years ago, has made the first change to his top management
team. He has hired one of his merchant bank advisers, Schroders' Patrick
Drayton, to be ECC's new finance director.
The appointment is unusual on a couple of counts. The 38-year-old Drayton is
not an accountant and is one of a relatively rare breed of corporate
financiers who have switched in mid-career to become finance directors of
FT-SE 100 companies. Glaxo's John Hignett, a former head of corporate
finance at Lazards, is another but he was in his mid-50s when he made the
change.
Teare is not worried by Drayton's lack of formal accountancy qualifications;
he has worked for Schroders for 15 years and has advised ECC for the past
five years, so he knows the company well. Noting that most big companies
already have well structured accounting and cost control systems, Teare says
that he puts a lot of weight on a finance director's ability to 'make the
right qualitative judgments'.
In recruiting Drayton, Teare believes he has found a finance director who
will also be good at 'more fundamental things' such as thinking about how
best to finance the business and crafting long-term strategy.
Drayton, who joins the company on September 7, is taking over from Robert
Carlton-Porter, 47, who has been finance director since 1983, and is leaving
to pursue other business interests. Teare says he has no plans to make any
other changes to his executive team.

<TEXT>
'BENCHMARKING' a company against its competitors is becoming a popular way
of identifying management weaknesses, setting realistic targets and
improving performance.
However, one of the biggest obstacles to a benchmarking exercise is the
difficulty of obtaining accurate information about competitors, particularly
foreign ones. Ernst &amp; Young, the international management consultancy group,
has launched a new service which aims to overcome this problem.
The service has been built around the results of the International Quality
Study which was commissioned by the American Quality Foundation last year.
The study was based on a questionnaire sent to 550 companies in Canada,
Germany, Japan and the US, in the motor, computers, banking and healthcare
sectors. It generated a database containing 1.5m pieces of information.
The questionnaire addressed more than 100 areas of management practices in
business organisation, product and service development, delivery process and
customer satisfaction, quality and strategic positioning, and corporate
culture. As a result, Ernst &amp; Young claims it can now offer a benchmarking
service, including a detailed report, which will allow companies to compare
themselves with some of the best managed organisations in the world.
The service is just one example of a recent proliferation of reports, books
and conferences about benchmarking. Among the most practical reports are
two* by Mohamed Zairi from the University of Bradford Management Centre in
the UK.
Competitive Benchmarking explains the concept, provides implementation
guidelines and highlights the benefits while TQM-Based Performance
Measurement discusses the shortcomings of existing measurement systems and
gives examples of quality based measurements.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Management: Oil and troubled waters - The departure of
Robert Horton raises questions about whether the cultural revolution he
sparked at BP will be sustained. Christopher Lorenz argues that the changes
are here to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a smart hotel in rural England, some two dozen besuited senior BP
managers take their places around a conference table almost as long as a
cricket pitch.
They glance nervously around, or chat tensely to neighbours whom they
scarcely know - the company has had precious few such get-togethers in
previous years, and a surprising number of senior managers hardly ever meet
each other.
For the next 24 hours, in an intense atmosphere which veers between
scepticism and enthusiasm depending on the speaker, they debate their
incoming chairman's radical proposals for changing how the company operates
and for transforming the way that people - including themselves - behave
within it.
Over the ensuing 18 months a series of such meetings takes place, sometimes
over several days. Each time the atmosphere becomes less formal, more
positive and much more cohesive. The suits give way to casual dress. People
get to know and trust each other, and express their real opinions more
openly.
The quotient of jokes rises, as do incidents of the chairman being teased,
or making cracks against himself about his supposed infallibility, or his
'running for Pope'. Managers trade stories of how the reform campaign is
being turned eagerly into action by employees at various levels in their own
parts of the company.
Then, as BP's financial performance turns from satisfactory to dull, and
finally dire, a stripped-down version with just the dozen top managers,
lasting less than a day, is held in a head office room with no windows. The
heads of several of the company's constituent businesses agree that rampant
fear about job security throughout BP now risks interfering with further
progress of the reform campaign. The mood is sober and decidedly worried.
But the communal drive for further reform is still evident.
This was how, over a two-year period between December 1989 and last
Christmas, the atmosphere shifted as Robert Horton's top lieutenants at
British Petroleum got together repeatedly with him to discuss the progress
of his ambitious corporate 'culture change programme', and to agree
successive next steps. There have been two further such meetings since then.
Last Thursday Horton resigned, ousted by his non-executive directors with at
least the tacit compliance of his senior executives. The immediate causes of
his departure were his dividend policy and his forceful, if not abrasive,
management style. The latter went down so well in his previous job -
streamlining BP America in the late 1980s - that it helped catapult him into
the chairmanship of the group. But in the last few months it caused growing
unease in the City of London, as well as among BP's non-executive directors.
But there have also been suggestions that an internal backlash against his
culture change programme could have played a part in his downfall. In its
early stages, the programme was rather American-style. Did some of his
senior British managers, having prospered in BP's traditional
'command-and-control' culture, tolerate the changes at first but finally
find them too hard to stomach? If so, does this suggest that dramatic
changes in culture may be less feasible in a British environment than they
are in the US?
The core objectives of Horton's programme were, to use consultancy jargon,
both 'hard' and 'soft'. The 'hard' side was the replacement of BP's
traditionally hierarchical, committee-ridden structure with a flatter,
'delayered' organisation. Hence the successive rounds of staffing cuts since
March 1990 at BP's various head offices: corporate, regional, and
divisional. With the added impetus of the recession, these are still
continuing - with a vengeance.
To make this flatter structure work effectively - as well as to cut costs,
speed decision-making, and improve management morale - Horton also
determined to re-engineer the 'soft' side of BP. To do this, he set out to
demolish its old culture of bureaucracy, stuffiness, lack of delegation,
rampant mistrust, and constant second-guessing - both by bosses of their
subordinates and of each other.
In its place would be bred a culture of 'openness, care, teamwork,
empowerment and trust'. Many of the culture change workshops which were run
in the year after Horton's assumption of the chairmanship in March 1990
helped managers understand what was meant in practical terms by this, and by
'essential new behaviours' such as 'networking' - sharing information
informally.
By March 1991, what had begun as Horton's culture change programme had
become 'owned' (to use jargon again) by almost all his top managers - a
group by then shorn through retirement of several of the older and more
recalcitrant barons. What had been 'his' had become theirs.
Rather than espousing all sorts of reformist behaviour in which they did not
really believe, some of the top managers who had prospered most in the old
'command and control' regime had really embraced it. The most important was
David Simon, who had been Horton's rival for the chairmanship.
Simon had been expected to be a conservative brake on the culture change
process, but in both words and action he emphasised repeatedly his
commitment to the values which underpin it. He did so again on Friday, after
he had taken over as chief executive.
Back in 1990, a memorable early internal expression of his support and
commitment was a statement that people might expect him to be the rock on
which the culture change would founder, but he would actually be one of the
rocks on which it was built. This was an oblique reference to Simon Peter,
one of Jesus' best-known followers; the word Peter means 'rock'.
In February 1991, Simon also put his strong support on public record, at a
conference on the management of change. 'I stand four-square with Bob Horton
on triggering this change throughout BP,' he said. 'We senior managers at BP
want a nimble, new culture for our company. New cultures - new behaviours
and new motivations - are taking over the business world fast these days.'
Another surprising convert was Russell Seal, head of BP Oil, the largest
employer in the BP group. Seal always used to be seen by insiders as a
classic commander-controller, yet he has made a radical change in the way he
manages people. He has also supported an intensive culture change and
development programme for the managers and other employees beneath him. It
has already had all sorts of pay-offs, in terms of greater staff
involvement, productivity and performance.
One example is of an American refinery where much greater employee
involvement in decision-making has improved its operating reliability from
barely 80 to almost 100 per cent, with the result that it was impressively
profitable last year after a decade of almost constant losses.
With hard men such as Simon and Seal having become true converts to the new
culture - even if they dislike some of its attendant jargon - it is hard to
sustain the argument that part of Horton's undoing was his application of a
rather American-style change programme to a company which, despite its
considerable US presence, is still heavily British.
Nor, even if it were true, should one apply such a conclusion to other
British companies. In slightly different ways during the 1980s, the cultures
of both British Airways and ICL were transformed out of all recognition by
programmes somewhat similar to BP's.
Both these companies had the immeasurable advantage over BP of launching
their programmes at a time of considerable external crisis brought on by
intense competition; crisis is one of the most powerful factors in
successful corporate culture change.
In pushing through the change programme which he (rightly) felt was vital to
BP's long-term survival, Horton would have had an easier task if the company
had been facing the sort of strategic crisis which it now confronts.
Instead, he had to play up the importance of an - albeit woeful - lack of
morale in BP's managerial ranks.
With help from an adept set of consultants - including several Americans -
the corporate programme and its sister efforts within BP's various
businesses have had a surprisingly quick impact. But, as at BA and ICL, they
will have to run for several more years if they are to anchor the new
behaviours fully in the company's collective subconscious. After showing
initial impatience, Horton was fully aware of this - as is Simon.
So it is not Horton's culture change process which proved too American for
BP and its board to swallow. Rather, it was his own management style.
Abrasive leaders with an all-powerful air may be admired in America, but in
most parts of Europe they still tend to be distrusted.
Perfect evidence of this culture gap was contained in the now infamous
interview which Horton gave to Forbes, an American business magazine, and
which was published in February just as the full magnitude of BP's financial
problems began to be outwardly apparent. It has been quoted widely for
Horton's extraordinary comment that he sometimes had to wait impatiently for
subordinates to deal with some of BP's problems. 'Because I am blessed by my
good brain,' he said, 'I tend to get to the right answer rather quicker and
more often than most people' - by clear inference, his colleagues.
Whereas most British readers gasped at this statement, the Forbes
interviewer praised him for showing 'precisely the mix of self-confidence
and personal discipline' required to run an organisation as sprawling and
complex as BP.
In some respects, there is indeed a yawning gulf in transatlantic management
attitudes.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Prescott will argue case for BR leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, will argue in a speech
tomorrow that freeing British Rail to enter unhindered into lease agreements
with private companies would cut the real cost of buying new rolling stock.
Mr Prescott, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, will refine his
calls for the rules governing BR's access to private finance to be made less
restrictive and condemn the government's 'ideologically prejudiced' attitude
to the funding of public bodies.
Speaking in Llandudno, north Wales, within weeks of BR's expected
announcement of an annual loss of Pounds 150m, he will urge the government
to accept that the organisation is in financial crisis.
Focusing on the planned Pounds 860m upgrading of the west coast main line
from Euston to Glasgow, Mr Prescott will explain that a leasing deal would
cut costs if the lender could be persuaded to pass on a portion of the tax
benefits accruing from the transaction.
He will advocate that the estimated Pounds 530m cost of new trains for the
line and a new West Midlands maintenance depot be financed by leasing. The
Pounds 330m cost of infrastructure improvements should be generated by
permitting BR to raise an index-linked bond.
Present accounting conventions remove the advantages of such techniques as
leasing for public bodies such as BR.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Commercial whaling ban faces renewed challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIX-YEAR moratorium on commercial whaling will come under renewed
challenge this week as 37 nations gather in Glasgow for the annual meeting
of the International Whaling Commission.
Japan, Norway and Iceland, which still have whaling industries, are pressing
for a resumption of the hunting of minke whales. They say stocks have
recovered sufficiently to permit resumed whaling in the Antarctic and in the
north-east Atlantic.
Mr John Gummer, the secretary of state for agriculture and fisheries, who is
to open the week-long meeting tomorrow, is expected to say that there can be
no resumption of commercial whaling while there is no humane way of killing
whales.
The resumption of commercial whaling will be resisted by nations led by
France, which is proposing the creation of a whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic. France is backed by Britain and other European countries.
The International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial
whaling in 1986. The moratorium has not been complete, however, partly
because Japan, Norway and Iceland carry out scientific whaling, which they
say is conducted for research.
The three want whaling to be resumed under the revised management procedure
(RMP), a programme of allowing commercial whaling under supervision. If the
commission agreed the RMP could come into operation within a year.
Yesterday 3,000 people at an anti-whaling rally in Glasgow were urged by Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North-West, to boycott products made by the
three whaling countries.
He said Norway and Iceland should be denied membership of the EC if they did
not pledge to give up whaling, and economic sanctions should be imposed on
Japan if it insisted on scientific whaling.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Call for standard post-16 training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOCATIONAL education and training for people aged 16 to 18 should be
tailored to a uniform standard, the National Commission on Education urges
today.
The commission, a privately funded body, said that a unified system would
improve the quality of the workforce. In a discussion paper, it calls for a
common core curriculum of mathematics, science, technology, English and
another European language, whether in full-time education, on Youth Training
or in traineeships run by employers.
Establishing a high-quality, broadly based education at all ages and levels
is essential if the UK is to develop a flexible and committed workforce, the
paper argues.
The government, employers, unions and educational institutions should all be
brought together, the paper says.
But it warns that it will be vital to determine which of those
'stakeholders' would carry primary responsibility.
Local enterprise companies, the organisations created by the government to
improve Scotland's training and environment, are suffering because they have
too little discretion and are struggling to adapt existing working practices
of staff, according to a report.
Academics from the London School of Economics argue that many of the
difficulties arise from Treasury and Department of Employment funding
constraints south of the border.
The report questions whether staff seconded from the Civil Service 'possess
the required expertise and competence' for the job.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Economists call for devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN should consider devaluing sterling within the European exchange rate
mechanism among other measures to stimulate the economy and cut government
borrowing, according to economists at London Business School.
In the school's latest Economic Viewpoint, Professor David Currie and Mr
Geoffrey Dicks say the Bank of England rather than the Treasury should be
given responsibility for setting interest rates and reducing inflation.
They say the combination of those moves would keep confidence in sterling on
financial markets relatively high, while the effects of devaluing sterling
would help Britain's international competitiveness.
According to the economists, Britain 'remains in severe recession' with
economic growth of just 0.1 per cent likely this year.
Unemployment is likely to rise to 3m by mid 1993, with the public-sector
borrowing requirement increasing from Pounds 30bn in the present financial
year to Pounds 34bn in 1993-94.
In such gloomy circumstances, a devaluation might help Britain to bring
borrowing under control. It could be a prelude to tough measures by the
Treasury to constrain increases in public spending for the coming financial
year.
Unless action is taken, the increases in prospect for the PSBR might
undermine confidence in sterling.
The LBS says that reducing the pound's central DM2.95 rate in the ERM should
be considered only in the context of the other measures proposed.
To reduce the value of the pound in the ERM by itself 'would be a very
serious mistake', the report says, as it might lead to investors' selling
sterling and to an upsurge in inflation.
Letting the Bank set UK interest rates would assure markets that decisions
over monetary policy were free from political influences. It would thus aid
confidence in sterling.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Ex-Reagan adviser steps in over BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM CLARK, a former national security adviser to President Ronald
Reagan, has been retained by the UK committee of creditors of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) to try to persuade the Abu Dhabi
government to improve terms of the Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) settlement
payment agreed with BCCI's liquidators. In an affidavit filed recently in
the High Court in London, Mr Clark said he was hired on May 23, 1992, and
met senior Abu Dhabi officials on May 26 and 27 to discuss the settlement.
Abu Dhabi was the majority shareholder of BCCI. The Clark mission included a
meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayyan, a son of Sheikh Zayed,
the Abu Dhabi ruler, who had been asked by his father to deal with the BCCI
affair.
Mr Clark said in his affidavit that, prior to meeting Sheikh Mohammed, he
conferred with Mr Richard Walker, US ambassador to the United Arab Emirates,
and Mr Graham Burton, the British envoy. It has also been learned that Mr
Clark consulted senior officials of the Bush administration before
undertaking his trip to Abu Dhabi.
The hiring of Mr Clark, one of former President Reagan's closest associates,
appears to be an attempt by the UK creditors to bring an authoritative
figure into their struggle for a better pay-out than is on offer. The UK
creditors have argued the BCCI settlement is inadequate.
The High Court in London has approved the BCCI settlement and a Luxembourg
court may issue its ruling tomorrow, but it is understood Mr Clark plans to
pursue his effort whether or not Luxembourg agrees the BCCI creditors'
accord. Included in Mr Clark's efforts may be a visit to Saudi Arabia and
other countries in the Middle East for consultations.
Isle of Man depositors with BCCI are pressing their government to improve
the amount and terms of compensation. The matter will be raised in the House
of Keys today. Under the present plan, any money received from Abu Dhabi
would be set against payments from the island's scheme.

FT  29 JUN 92 / FBI finds body of kidnapped Exxon man
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE body of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's international division, was
found at the weekend, ending the highest profile kidnapping case in the US
in nearly 20 years.
The FBI yesterday confirmed that officers had positively identified the
corpse of Mr Reso, 57, who was abducted two months ago. The law enforcement
agency said Mr Reso's body was found on Saturday in a wooded section of
Southern New Jersey.
The discovery of Mr Reso's corpse, which confirmed the worst fears of law
enforcement officials, came eight days after the FBI arrested a former Exxon
security guard and his wife. They were indicted last week on kidnapping and
extortion charges.
The FBI declined to say whether the two, who had initially refused to
co-operate with investigators after being captured, supplied the information
that led police to find Mr Reso's body.
They are alleged to have participated in the abduction of Mr Reso on April
29, when the Exxon executive's empty car was found at the foot of the
driveway to his New Jersey home.
Mr Michael Murphy, a New Jersey county prosecutor, yesterday said that state
murder charges would be filed against one or both either today or tomorrow.
The detailed circumstances of Mr Reso's death are not yet known, but the FBI
said an autopsy was being performed last night.
The FBI, which at the height of the search for Mr Reso had deployed 250
agents, said it had conducted the most exhaustive kidnapping investigation
since the 1974 abduction of Patty Hearst, a member of the Hearst publishing
family.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon, yesterday said he was deeply distressed
to learn of 'the tragic and senseless death' of Mr Reso, who had worked for
Exxon for 35 years.
The former security guard and his wife, both 45 years old, were arrested in
the early hours of June 19 after allegedly sending a series of messages to
Exxon, demanding Dollars 18.5m (Pounds 10m) of ransom money for Mr Reso.

dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bullet-ridden buildings and bloody streets of Bendery in the separatist
Trans Dnestr region of Moldova testify to the violence that claimed 300
lives there last weekend. But terrified locals amid the fertile fields and
whitewashed cottages north west of the strategic border town speak of a
quiet war of terror which is exacting a less visible toll.
On the eve of a United Nations fact-finding mission to Trans Dnestr, local
people have recounted tales of Trans Dnestr forces killing political
opponents or intimidating them into silence or exile.
Victims say the violence is orchestrated by the leadership of the Trans
Dnestr region with the co-operation of hardline forces in Moscow. Moldova
wants to unite with Romania; Trans Dnestr is dominated by ethnic Russians
and Ukrainians who are fighting this move and are backed by hardliners in
Moscow.
Members of the Trans Dnestr military forces have admitted that they have
acted to 'silence' and 'isolate' local dissenters. The Trans Dnestr
government acknowledges the existence of rogue elements in the breakaway
region's many military groups but has denied complicity in an orchestrated
campaign of intimidation.
'We isolated those who spoke openly against us,' said Mr Misha Russkiy, an
ethnic Russian tractor driver, who now serves in the newly-formed militia of
the Grigoriopol region, an enclave of ethnic Moldovans in Trans Dnestr.
'As long as they do not speak out openly no one touches them,' Mr Russkiy
said, surrounded by a group of comrades casually clutching their
Kalashnikovs.
An ethnic Moldovan community leader from the area, who last year spoke out
for a united Moldova, described how that silence has been secured. Last
January he began to receive nocturnal visits from members of the Trans
Dnestr Republican Guard, who demanded at gunpoint that he should leave the
region.
One morning in the middle of March a dozen Republican Guards stormed his
office and took him to a basement cell, where his kidneys were beaten with
the butt of a Kalashnikov, and his jaw, which is still swollen, was struck
by a 2lb machine-gun magazine.
He believes he survived only because his loyal employees took to the town's
central square demanding his release. With their support he has managed to
stay on in the terrorised region.
By contrast Mr Anatoly Danilov, a slim, blue-eyed, ethnic-Russian newspaper
editor from the town of Grigoriopol, was forced to flee because he supported
a united Moldova. After months of menacing telephone calls and an evening
visit and beating administered by seven Republican Guards, Mr Danilov said
that on March 13 he was warned by telephone that he was on a list of people
to be 'neutralised' and must leave immediately.
He did, and from the safety of Kishinev he spoke of 15-20 other locals who
have disappeared, including one, Mr Anatoly Dikusar, whose body, when
discovered in a field on April 20, 'looked like it had been through a meat
grinder'.

FT  29 JUN 92 / The European Market: Insurers still face problems in pursuit
of a real single market - Big concessions by Germany and France have helped
companies, but are of little use to consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN June 1990, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for
financial services, addressed the German Insurance Association in Cologne.
Even by Sir Leon's own exacting standards, it was a detailed and closely
argued speech, in which he sought to explain the Commission's insurance
policy, down to the last line of small print.
The speech - to some of Europe's most meticulous, most powerful and most
conservative insurers - was an illustration of how difficult Sir Leon then
thought the battle to open the European insurance market would be.
As one of Sir Leon's advisers puts it: 'When we arrived (in Brussels) in
1988, we thought that German opposition would be irreducible.'
But just over two years after Sir Leon Brittan's Cologne speech, EC finance
ministers should today formally sign up to the Third Life Assurance
Directive, which will complete the single insurance market. The Third
Non-Life Insurance Directive was formally adopted 10 days ago. The Insurance
Accounts Directive was adopted at the end of last year.
The raft of directives will be implemented from 1994 onwards. The main
effect will be to scrap the tight regulation of policy wordings and prices
favoured by many member states and allow insurers to trade throughout the
community on the basis of a single passport, a licence obtained from
regulators in their home state.
Advocates of greater deregulation argue that the single licence should
benefit insurers from countries with more liberal rules and lead to the
evolution of a more liberal framework Europe-wide.
Mr Neil Hamilton, UK corporate affairs minister, said recently that controls
such as prior approval and minimum pricing common in Germany, Italy and
Belgium 'acted as a real barrier to trade in insurance.'
Germany has made a number of major concessions. For example, starting with
their 1995 accounts German insurers will have to reveal the current value of
their substantial assets for the first time.
All this represents a substantial advance on the more modest reforms
envisaged in the second life and non-life directives introduced in 1990,
which extended deregulation mainly in the commercial lines area.
Indeed the extent of liberalisation is more comprehensive than many would
have been believed possible in 1985, when the single market programme was
laid out.
Liberals led by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible, and
initially backed by the British, the Netherlands and Ireland, have won round
first France and then Germany to a programme of far-reaching change.
The first breakthrough came in December 1986 when the European Court of
Justice ruled that German, French, Irish and Danish attempts to restrict the
sale of 'foreign' insurance policies on their territory were illegal,
backing the line taken by the Commission, Britain and the Netherlands.
According to officials in Brussels the key breakthrough appears to have come
in the second half of 1990 when France - a protectionist on insurance, as
the court case demonstrated - started changing its legislation to allow its
ambitious part-state-owned insurers to compete head-to-head with their
European competitors.
It was at that point, according to Commission officials, that Germany
decided it could no longer be obstructive.
Yet there are some snags ahead. Mr John Young, partner with London
solicitors Lovell White Durrant in London, predicts that the lack of a
single contract law system will hinder a genuine single market.
In addition differences in the tax regimes between member states will also
affect the extent to which genuine competition can take place.
And despite the new freedoms, penetration of some markets - especially those
where retail networks are dominated by extensive networks of tied agents,
which sell the products of just one company, rather than independent brokers
 -will be tough.
Consumer groups are concerned that although the new legislation will help
the mobility of large insurance companies, it will be of little use to the
consumer.
The Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc) - the main European
consumers' organisation - cites linguistic difficulties, lack of information
and inconsistent consumer protection rules as the main obstacles to a real
single market.
Ms Monique Goyens, Beuc's legal adviser, believes a fourth generation of
insurance legislation may be necessary to lay down harmonised contract
safeguards.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC will open accession negotiations with applicant countries from the
European Free Trade Association (Efta) immediately after its own Maastricht
union treaty is ratified.
This was the upshot of the Lisbon summit's deliberations on enlargement, the
first top-level discussion by EC leaders since the Community's plans for a
single market and currency started to attract a queue of would-be members.
The UK had hoped to separate the opening of enlargement talks from the
complications arising from Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
This would have meant that preliminary negotiations with the four Efta
applicants - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland - could have started
under Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this year.
But Britain's partners prevailed in their view that Maastricht must be
ratified, at least by all EC states bar Denmark, before 'official' talks
with Efta can begin. However, the Commission and the UK-led Council of
Ministers are 'invited to speed up preparatory work needed to ensure rapid
progress,' before the next summit in Edinburgh.
EC leaders chose diplomatic language to ease any disappointment on the part
of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta. These three poorer, southern countries have
been told they must stay in the EC's waiting room, even though they all
applied to join the EC before any of the Efta states.
The Lisbon communique underlined that the Community sees Turkey's role 'in
the present European political situation as of the greatest importance'.
With no apparent dissent from Greece's prime minister, Mr Constantine
Mitzotakis, the summit called for intensified economic co-operation with
Ankara 'including a political dialogue at the highest level'.

FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: EC contest over cash ends in draw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE contest at the Lisbon summit over fiscal transfers from richer to poorer
EC states ended in a draw between the north and the south of the Community.
The north managed to keep any figures on budgetary commitments out of the
summit conclusions, but the south defeated an attempt to extend the
prospective increases over a longer period.
The main protagonists were Spain, as standard-bearer of the 'cohesion'
countries which include Ireland, Portugal and Greece, and the UK, which led
resistance to the doubling of the EC's regional and cohesion spending called
for by the European Commission.
The UK, which takes over the EC presidency this week, will now have to craft
a compromise on future financing for December's Edinburgh summit.
Its obduracy in Lisbon caused Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to
remove his own compromise from the table. Britain, with one hand tied behind
its back by a presidential role which demands conciliation, will thus have
to start again from the full 'Delors II' package.
That package calls for an increase of nearly a third in EC revenue, from
Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.75bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997 at today's prices. Half
the increase is for the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund set up at
Maastricht for the four poorest states. Combined funding for the two
instruments would rise from Ecu18.6bn to Ecu29.3bn in 1997.
In response to hostility from the north, Mr Delors had suggested the EC
revenue ceiling be held at its current level (of 1.2 per cent of combined
gross national product) for two more years, and then moved to his original
target of 1.37 of GNP in the five years to 1999. This would provide 'a rate
of growth in Community assistance of the same order of magnitude as that
established in . . . 1988 to 1992', said the draft compromise.
The Structural Funds were doubled during that period, so this would commit
the EC to a new doubling. But the UK, with Germany and the Netherlands,
managed to excise this commitment and replace it with an undefined 'increase
appropriate to reflect the Maastricht commitments.'
'Unsatisfactory', said Spain's prime minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, making
seven syllables of the word in case colleagues were hard of hearing.
He got vigorous support from his cohesion allies, sympathy from France, and,
Spanish and German officials suggest, some undisclosed advice from
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
With Maastricht itself now at stake, many EC officials are looking for
further movement in Bonn and Madrid to clear the financial impasse.
The UK's position will be further complicated by its need to defend the
special annual budget rebate it won in 1984, which has to be reviewed in the
new package.

FT  29 JUN 92 / Thatcher attacks defiant Major on European union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher issued a direct challenge to the authority of her
successor with a scathing condemnation yesterday of Mr John Major's support
for European union.
Her onslaught came as the prime minister raised the stakes in the
Conservative in-fighting over Europe by indicating at the Lisbon EC summit
that he regards successful ratification of the Maastricht treaty as an issue
of personal honour.
Speaking in a television interview with Mr David Frost, Mrs Thatcher said:
'Maastricht is a treaty too far. This is a treaty we didn't need and we
didn't want. I most earnestly hope that it will not be ratified.' She
congratulated the Danes for rejecting the treaty, called for a referendum in
Britain, and said she would vote against ratification.
Mr Major, whose government takes over the presidency of the Community on
Wednesday, plans to re-introduce the bill to ratify the agreement when the
House of Commons returns from its summer recess in October.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, signalled yesterday that the
government was drawing up a strategy to circumvent plans by rebel
Conservative MPs to prolong indefinitely the debate on the legislation.
Cabinet colleagues rejected suggestions that Mr Major would threaten in
advance to resign if the Commons did not pass the legislation. But he would
be prepared to turn Maastricht into a 'confidence issue' for the government.
The implication was that if Euro-sceptics on the Conservative backbenches
joined with the opposition parties to wreck the legislation, they would be
threatening another general election.
Mr Major will remind Tory MPs later today that they pledged their support
for Maastricht during the April election campaign. Reporting on the outcome
of the Lisbon summit, he will claim that the debate over the future of the
Community has now moved decisively against federalism towards the wider,
looser structure favoured by Britain.
Mrs Thatcher, who will take her seat in the House of Lords tomorrow,
combined a blistering attack on the prime minister's approach to Europe,
with a sharp rebuke to the government for not lowering borrowing costs. She
said there was no prospect of economic recovery unless he was prepared to
risk a devaluation of sterling in the Exchange Rate Mechanism by cutting
interest rates.
But she reserved her most scathing remarks for Maastricht. Mrs Thatcher
described the agreement on political and economic union as a blueprint for a
'central state' which would destroy British democracy. She said she would be
prepared to campaign for a referendum, and derided as 'gobbledegook' the
principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the treaty. Urging Conservative MPs
to join her in voting against the bill, she suggested that they should put
their obligations to 'the people' ahead of loyalty to the prime minister.
She plans to develop the same themes in her maiden speech to the House of
Lords on Thursday, but Mr Major is said to be determined to avoid a personal
slanging match with his predecessor.

A Nigerian magistrates' court will decide today whether to proceed with the
treason trial of five detained political activists. The case, which has
become Nigeria's most burning political issue, has pushed to the sidelines
this week's parliamentary elections.
A decision to continue the prosecution of the five men, despite a
restraining injunction issued by a Lagos High Court last week, is likely to
fuel the confrontation between Gen Ibrahim Babangida's military regime and
human rights activists.
The case has come to the forefront as the government enters the last
critical six months of its precarious transition to civilian rule.
Nationwide elections for Nigeria's Senate and House of Representatives are
due to take place on Saturday, the first parliamentary elections after nine
years of military rule.
The five men were all arrested in a clampdown last month following violent
riots over fuel shortages and the inflationary impact of a big devaluation.
The detainees include Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for
Democracy and president of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights,
Chief Gani Fawehinmi, an activist-lawyer, and Mr Segun Maiyegun, president
of the banned National Association of Nigerian Students.
Shortly before Dr Ransome-Kuti's arrest the Campaign for Democracy issued a
statement accusing the military government of 'gross mismanagement of the
economy, incompetence and widespread corruption'.
Two weeks ago the five were arraigned in a magistrates' court in Gwagwalada,
65km from Abuja, the new federal capital. They were charged with conspiracy
to treasonable felony by attempting illegally to compel the government to
its programme for transition to civilian rule.
The activists have argued that the transition programme is thoroughly
flawed, is not democratic and is being dictated and manipulated by the
military to ensure that the army will return to power.
They have called for a national conference to decide Nigeria's political
future. Last week the EC added its voice to criticism about the detentions.

economy, incompetence and widespread corruption'

FT  29 JUN 92 / OECD dusts off image of housework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEWORKERS' unrecorded labours are adding up to 44 per cent to world
output, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development.
Unpaid domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and changing nappies
normally do not count as economically important, on the grounds that no
money changes hands. OECD economists say this approach ignores the intrinsic
value of domestic activities.
They say governments should do more to add up the value of housework. One
way of ascribing value to unpaid domestic duties is to calculate the
earnings of a typical 'houseworker' if he or she had a job in the orthodox
economy.
What is Households' Non Market Production Worth? printed in OECD Economic
Studies number 18, spring 1992, FFr120, from OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, 75775

General Dmitri Volkogonov, head of a joint Russian-US commission searching
for missing US prisoners of war in the former Soviet Union, said that four
Americans were held at a Soviet psychiatric hospital in 1953. At least one
American prisoner of war was buried near the central Russian city of Tambov,
south-east of Moscow. The report appeared to be the first tangible result of
recent intensified efforts to trace 2,500 missing POWs.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Sport: Age-old appeal of Wimbledon - The crowd has found two
unlikely heroes this week. John Barrett explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGE HAS its compensations. Ask Ivan Lendl, the 32-year-old near veteran who
has played at Wimbledon every year since 1979. For five of those years this
likeable Czech was the world No 1, invincible on every surface but grass.
Yet, in spite of two appearances in the Wimbledon final and four in the
semi-finals, this consummate professional had never looked like winning the
title. Nor had he ever been the favourite of the crowd. In 1986 the boy
Becker beat him to retain his title, at 18 still younger than any previous
winner. The next year Ivan was unlucky enough to face an inspired Pat Cash,
the Australian who had grown up on grass courts in Sydney.
Yesterday on Court No 1, the scene of several unhappy memories over the
years, Lendl (seeded 10) was cheered to the echo by a delirious crowd when
he came back to inflict a 6-3 1-6 2-6 6-3 7-5 beating on Son of Fred -
otherwise Sandon Stolle whose dad has the doubtful distinction of having
been a losing finalist at Wimbledon three years in a row in the 1960s. It
was poetic justice really, because as a gesture to Fred, Ivan has taken
Sandon under his wing, practising with him and passing on his vast knowledge
to help the young man establish himself on the circuit.
The other heavyweights in the lower half survived - Stefan Edberg (2),
Michael Stich (3), Pete Sampras (5) and Goran Ivanisevic (8) lost no sets
and only 28 games between them.
There were two surprises. Richard Krajicek the 11th seed from the
Netherlands who I had seen as a serious outside threat, went down to the
unseeded Frenchman, Arnaud Boetsch, ranked 44 in the world.
Perhaps young Krajicek was a victim of his own indiscretion. The day before,
on Dutch Radio he had said that 80 per cent of the top 100 women players
were fat pigs. Yesterday he admitted he had exaggerated. All he was trying
to say, he explained, is that some of the women were over weight and none of
them deserved equal prize money with the men. The reverberations are still
echoing around the world.
Then a qualifier, Henrik Holm of Sweden, unseeded and ranked a lowly 131,
put out the left-handed Russian Alexander Volkov, seeded 15, in four sets.
Last year Volkov had been within two points of beating the eventual champion
Stich. What a difference a year makes.
The two remaining higher women seeds in the top half sailed serenely through
yesterday - Monica Seles (1) a 6-4 6-1 winner against Laura Gildemeister and
Martina Navratilova (4) successful 7-5 6-1 against a strong German
challenger, Barbara Rittner, the junior champion here last year.
As with the men, there were two big surprises. Mary Joe Fernandez (7)
injured her leg in a fall and was beaten 6-3 6-3 by the American Amy
Frazier, while the young German hope Anke Huber (10) went down surprisingly
6-2 6-3 to Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia.
Today the top half of the men's draw and the lower half of the women's draw
will be completed before what is certain to be an enthusiastic audience. In
an effort to recapture some of the atmosphere of last year's magical Middle
Sunday (remember the Mexican Wave and Jimmy Connors' farewell appearance?)
the first 2,000 members of the overnight queue will be admitted to seats in
the Centre Court at reduced prices. Other seats in Nos 1 and 2 Courts will
be sold as usual.
Jim Courier (1) has yet to lose a set and will not lose one easily to the
former Soviet player Andrei Olhovskiy, while Boris Becker (4), after his
escape on Thursday against Martin Damm, should get past Bryan Shelton
without fuss. The two matches that will capture the attention are McEnroe v
last year's semi-finalist David Wheaton (16) and the all-French clash
between Guy Forget (9) and Henri Leconte.
Britain's hero, Jeremy Bates, who has reached the third round with victories
over Michael Chang, the No 7 seed who was out of sorts and Javier Sanchez, a
clay-court specialist, faces his toughest test against Thierry Champion of
France.
Among the women, the holder Steffi Graf (2), the beaten finalist Gabriela
Sabatini (3) and the 1991 semi-finalist Jennifer Capriati (6) who last year
so dramatically beat Navratilova, are all in action. I cannot see Mariaan de
Swardt, Rika Hiraki and Patricia Hy respectively causing any upsets, but I
have been wrong before.
On Thursday we had one of those special Wimbledon occasions that will live
on in the mind. Two former champions, both unseeded, battled for four
absorbing hours on the Centre Court. The American left-hander John McEnroe,
the champion in 1981, 1983 and 1984 and already discussing a possible
retirement, played the 1987 champion Pat Cash.
The Australian is a part-time player these days. He has competed in only
three tournaments this year and is into rock music as a guitarist. His
guests for the day were Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and Jimmy White.
Like the defeated snooker finalist, Cash should have won . . . could have
won, anyway, in four sets. But McEnroe, encouraged by coach Larry Stefanki
since January to take the ball early and trust his own reflexes to find
those impossible angles on service return, was inspired. His instant
reactions on the volley against Cash's fierce drives were miraculous.
Lacking match play, Cash could not convert his chances. To a standing
ovation the pair left the court with McEnroe the victor 6-7 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-2.
Late last night McEnroe earned another standing ovation - on the Centre
Court this time - when his doubles with Stich against the holders John
Fitzgerald and Anders Jarryd was halted for bad light by the referee Alan
Mills at 8.15pm just as McEnroe and Stich had taken a two sets to love lead
6-3 7-6. Twice in two days the bad boy of world tennis had become the
people's hero.
Like Lendl and good wine, McEnroe is maturing with age. It makes you wonder
just what else he might have achieved if he had been brought up on Dale
Carnegie instead of Robert Ludlum]

Last week's Capital Gains Tax indexation table omitted the figures for the
first four months of this year. Multiply the original cost of an asset by
the following figures: 1.027 for an asset bought in January, 1.022 for
February, 1.019 for March and 1.004 for April. If you subtract the result
from the proceeds of a sale made in May, the difference will be your taxable

Building societies pledged Pounds 3.21bn in new mortgage lending last month,
16 per cent up on April. However, the Building Societies Association said
that the figure was still below the Pounds 4.07bn lent in May last year. It
warned that the increase in loan agreements did not show that a revival in
the housing market was necessarily on the way. Mark Boleat, director-general
of the association, said: 'The rise in net new commitments is encouraging.
However, it is a small rise and the figures do not yet suggest a significant
upturn in activity.' Last month was also poor for savings, with net receipts
at Pounds 179m, down from Pounds 212m in April.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Cookery: Soft and sybaritic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRUIT IS one of the great pleasures of summer eating. A scarlet trio
(cherries on the stalk, unhulled strawberries and frosted redcurrants)
provide an easy and lovely finale to lunch or dinner with bowls of fromage
frais, whipped cream or yoghurt for dipping.
I am also very fond of a scarlet compote of fruits in season: raw
redcurrants, stoned cherries, thickly sliced strawberries and whole
raspberries barely moistened with freshly squeezed orange and lemon juice
(two parts orange to one part lemon) and a sifting of sugar.
Toss everything together gently and leave in a cool place to macerate for
about an hour, and toss again just before serving. The fruits will gleam
like garnets and some of their juices will have mingled with the citrus and
sugar to make a deliciously light syrup.
A compote like this is just right for partnering coeur a la creme or snowy
mounds of soft fresh cheeses. For a fatless alternative, serve the compote
with a slice of angel cake or spooned over rosy slices of water melon.
As for puddings proper, the best known and best loved for this time of year
is, appropriately, summer pudding. Blackcurrant and gooseberry fool are
probably joint second favourite, but others deserve an occasional airing.
CHERRY BAKEWELL (serves 6-8)
Generally I prefer cherries raw rather than cooked - and stoning them is a
tedious little chore - but this way of cooking them is very good indeed.
Unusually, this is a flan that is almost better a day or even two days after
baking. Other fruits can be used in place of cherries. Raspberries are
especially good.
Shortcrust pastry made with 6-8 oz flour and aromatized with the finely
grated zest of an orange;  3/4 lb ripe dessert cherries;  1/4 lb butter;
1/4 lb caster sugar;  1/4 lb freshly ground almonds; 1 teaspoon kirsch; 2
large eggs.
Use the pastry to line a shallow 9in-10 inch fluted flan tin with a
removeable base. Blind bake it and let it become cold.
Stone the cherries and refrigerate them until needed.
Dice the butter and barely melt it in a small pan over low heat.
Away from the heat, stir in the sugar, then the ground almonds, kirsch and
lightly beaten eggs, in that order.
Tip the chilled cherries into the flan, spreading them evenly, and pour on
the almond mixture.
Bake this pudding for 35-40 minutes at 400`F (200`C) gas mark 6 until the
fruit is hot and the topping is puffed up and golden.
Serve it cold, with or without softly whipped kirsch flavoured cream.
RASPBERRY AND REDCURRANT PUDDING (serves 6-8)
This quick and easy variation of mine on the classic summer pudding made its
first appearance on these pages a few years ago. In view of many requests,
here it is again.
5 or 6 x  3/4 inch thick slices of good stale bread; 2 lb or more mixed
raspberries and redcurrants; sugar; a little orange and lemon juice
(optional).
If, like me, you fail to bake or shop sufficiently far ahead for your loaf
to go stale of its own accord, speed up the process by cutting fresh bread
into cubes and spreading them out on a baking tray or cooling rack. Leave in
a sunny spot, in a warm kitchen or in the airing cupboard for an hour or
two, just turning the cubes occasionally, until the bread is somewhat
dessicated.
Put about half the redcurrants into a shallow pan with a tablespoon or two
of cold water. Sprinkle a little sugar between layers. Cover with just under
half the raspberries, adding sugar as before. Put on the lid and cook over a
low flame until the fruit is warm and tender and the scarlet juices are
flowing freely. Shake the pan gently, rather than stir, to encourage even
cooking and minimise crushing the fruit.
Slide the contents of the pan into a sieve placed over a bowl to separate
fruit and juices. Taste the juices and add extra sugar or maybe a squeeze of
orange or lemon. Drop the well staled cubes of bread into the liquid and
toss to stain and flavour them.
Sugar and warm the remaining redcurrants and raspberries as before, but this
time barely warm them so they retain their shape really well.
Pile the fruit-stained bread into a pyramid on a serving dish, scattering
the fruits between layers (the slightly squashed berries and the better
looking ones mixed together but save a good portion of the best fruits till
the end for a decorative finish).
Serve cold or while slightly warm and fragrant, with softly whipped cream,
creme fraiche, yoghurt or fromage frais.
RASPBERRY CHARLOTTE (serve 8-10)
This looks pretty tied with a ribbon in the Russian manner. Stick candles on
top and you have a birthday cake with a difference. Tayberries or
loganberries can be used instead of raspberries, or blackberries or
mulberrries in autumn.
1 lb raspberries; 6 oz unsalted butter, at room temperature;  1/4 lb vanilla
or caster sugar;  1/4 lb freshly ground almonds; the finely grated zest and
juice of 2 large oranges; the juice of half a lemon; 1/2 pt double cream;
6-7 oz sponge finger biscuits.
Beat the butter until pale and creamy. Add the sugar and beat again until
fluffy and light. Mix the orange and lemon juices together and pour 3 fl oz
onto the butter cream. Add the finely grated orange zest and the ground
almonds and blend well. Whip the cream and fold the mixture into it.
Choose a 2-2 1/2 pt charlotte mould (or a souffle dish or any other straight
sided container of the same capacity that is 3 1/2 -4 inches deep). Line the
base with a circle of greaseproof paper.
Spread one-third of the orange and almond butter cream over it. Cover with
half the fruit, pressing it lightly into the cream. Repeat the cream and
raspberry layers and finish with the remaining cream.
Cover with greaseproof paper, put a small plate on top, add 2 lb weights and
refrigerate for at least eight hours until firmly set.
Loosen the pudding with a wet, round-bladed knife and unmould it onto a
chilled plate. Dip the unsugared backs of the sponge fingers, one by one,
into the remaining citrus juice. Shake off excess and stick them, upright,
round the sides of the pudding to make a castellated wall.
Decorate with extra berries and return the pudding to the fridge until
almost ready to serve. (If left at room temperature for long the filling
will soften and the castle may collapse as you cut it.) Serve the charlotte
alone or with a puree of sieved raspberries to sauce it.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Summer Drink: Life beyond Chardonnay - Jancis Robinson finds
some good value wines which also have something else to offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIEVE IT or not, people other than advertising salespersons recognise
'summer wine' as a concept. As soon as Wimbledon and school sports days are
in prospect, wine drinkers like me suddenly become passionate about things
like rose and fino sherry that we ignore in midwinter.
Recent in-depth immersion in the bottles on offer from Britain's wine
merchants and wine-minded branches of the supermarkets left me Chardonnayed
out, and I am most enthusiastic about a clutch of characterful roses, and
the exhilaratingly light, tastebud-tingling SOCIETY'S FINO (Pounds 4.75 from
The Wine Society of Stevenage); much more of a dry white than a sherry.
It is ludicrously cheap for a high-strength (16 per cent), high-tradition
wine. But perhaps the Spanish government has decided to subsidise the whole
of the sherry business as well as everything else this year. In for an
Olympic peseta . . .
As for the roses, most captivating of all for drinking with food was MAS
JULLIEN ROSE, COTEAUX DU LANGUEDOC 1991 (Pounds 5.95 La Vigneronne of London
SW7), a heady, herby, savoury wine made from Cinsaut, Syrah (the two most
successful grape varieties for rose) plus Mourvedre and Carignan. This is
hand-made wine which would grace any dinner table - none of your Tizer.
Skalli's FORTANT ROSE DE SYRAH 1991 (Pounds 3.49 Victoria Wine) is a bit
more Tizerlike (as the grape-embossed bottle suggests) and another Languedoc
specimen, but it is very lively, crisp and aromatic, and is saved by its
good acid from tasting cloyingly sweet - a common inconvenience in pink, and
especially, 'blush' wines. Equally good value is a wine made from the
Bordeaux grape in Chile, SANTA RITA CABERNET SAUVIGNON ROSE 1991 (Pounds
3.99 Oddbins) which starts fruity but finishes dry. It would make a good,
easy aperitif.
Prize for the most delightfully bizarre wine available at more than 150
shops must go to the BRACHETTO D'ACQUI (Pounds 6.99 Oddbins) made by the
late Giacomo Bologna in Piedmont, famous for taking Barbera seriously. I
tasted it just after sampling a range of supermarket wines too often
characterised by the need to buy to a price, most notably in a bevy of
artificially fruit-flavoured fizzes specially concocted to fall below the
5.5 per cent alcohol low-strength duty limit. Part of what attracted me to
this weird, dark rose-coloured, musky, sweet-but-balanced, frothy remnant of
Piedmontese tradition was, I must admit, its 'so what?' alcohol level of 6
per cent. But it also tastes defiantly of real grapes rather than the stinks
lab.
Too many Chardonnays today (to my probably rather precious palate) taste
man-made rather than map-made. And there are signs that supplies of
everyone's favourite wine, 'South East' Australian Chardonnay, may just be
finite. An increasing proportion of Oz whites on sale in Britain are blends
of Chenin/Colombard/Semillon/Chardonnay, in order to keep the bottles below
those blessed price points.
This may have something to do with the Australians' admirable drive for
truth in labelling, but to find a seriously good Australian Chardonnay
nowadays you will probably have to pay more than you would, say, for Marks &amp;
Spencer's exceptionally ripe current vintage of one of their most successful
wines, the Chablisienne co-op's CHABLIS 1990 (Pounds 6.99 or Pounds 3.99 a
half, M&amp;S). Much to the amazement of everyone, including M&amp;S, it won a gold
medal in this year's WINE magazine taste-athon.
A better bet in Australian whites is probably an unblended, defiantly
unfashionable, but noble varietal: one of several full-bodied MARSANNEs on
offer, for example, or MOONDAH BROOK VERDELHO (Pounds 4.99 Tesco and
Majestic), made into a rich yet dry, tangy table wine from one of the great
grapes of Madeira. Maritime history in a bottle worth ageing.
Read those Australian back labels carefully. Unless oak barrels or casks are
actually specified, the wine probably derives its user-friendly oakiness
from a few drops of oak essence, of which we British are major suppliers to
Australia.
In today's rather desperate marketplace, price seems to bear less relation
than ever to quality. Some producers eager to establish a foothold in the
international marketplace are surely giving their wine away at prices below
Pounds 3. The real double-take bottle is the stylishly labelled FAR ENOUGH
PINOT NOIR 1991 (Pounds 2.99 Waitrose and, under the TABLE MOUNTAIN label,
Budgen). Pinot Noir is supposed to be Burgundy's impossibly finicky red
grape that produces nothing but sludge under Pounds 6 a bottle. Yet here is
a lively, fruity, unmistakeably Pinot, light red for under Pounds 3. The
catch? It is South African and has not, thank goodness, been in expensive
oak casks - nor even suffered a touch of ersatz flavouring.
Even cheaper, and at least as good, is LEZIRIA, another fruitily carefree
(ie tannin-free) young red, said to contain 15 per cent of Pinot Noir plus
85 per cent of the juicy Periquita. It comes from a first-rate co-operative
in the Ribatejo that is, agriculturally, Portugal's answer to Kent. Until
last Saturday Gateway were asking only Pounds 1.99 for it, but it is worth
far more than its non-introductory selling price of Pounds 2.39 a bottle
from both Gateway and Victoria Wine. Both of these reds could be served at
any temperature from icebox to picnic-hot. Indeed, you could set off on an
expedition with them, well-chilled, and let them give you a range of taste
experiences.
Iberia in general has been looking increasingly interesting for all hues of
wine. The huge Thresher Wine Shop/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up conglomerate has made
particularly heroic efforts to reflect change in Spain. Excellent value dry
whites include its aristocratically scented, lively, dry Galician white
CASAL DA BARCA (Pounds 3.49), the latest vintage of the even more exciting
ALBARINO, LAGAR DE CERVERA 1991 (Pounds 8.19 from Thresher or Pounds 7.33
from Laymont &amp; Shaw of Truro) and Oddbins' zesty dry white from Navarra
CASTILLO DE OLITE (Pounds 2.99).
More unexpected still is the new wave of well-made, dry, fruity,
transPyreneen wines made in France from cheap Spanish grapes grown in La
Mancha. SAINSBURY'S BLANC DE PARAISO is Pounds 2.25 until the end of the
month, and then Pounds 2.59, while CUVEE DUBOEUF BLANC is Pounds 2.99 at M &amp;
S and comes complete with the flowery label that is the signature of the
'king of Beaujolais.' The curious thing is that the first wine, made at the
Plaimont co-op, tastes just like its Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne,
while the second bears a remarkable resemblance to poor man's St Veran.
Makes you think.
Spain tends to bottle its own red wine however and two current good buys are
SAINSBURY'S LA MANCHA CASTILLO DE ALHAMBRA 1991 (Pounds 2.99) which is
Rioja's smart Tempranillo grape made like Beaujolais and, in quite a
different style, THRESHER'S RIOJA CRIANZA 1989 (Pounds 3.99), designed to
show off its ration of quarter-French (as opposed to all-American) oak.
Oak - now that is a wine that sells. No wonder the oak essence is so
popular. The real, coopered thing tends to add well over Pounds 1.50 to a
bottle of wine, as London SW10 merchant Lea and Sandeman can demonstrate
with its two superior cuvees of the sprightly estate-bottled dry white
DOMAINE DE JOY, COTES DE GASCOGNE (1991 Pounds 3.50 and 1990 Pounds 5.95
respectively). I cannot abide oak for the sake of it, but the second
oak-aged version really is a joy; the oak endows structure rather than
sweetness or astringency to a most convincing blend dominated by the
gorgeously tangy Gros Manseng grape of south west France. (Nor has a touch
of oak suppressed the peachy scent of the Ardeche co-op's VIOGNIER 1991 -
far better value than most Condrieu at Pounds 4.49 from Safeway.)
The owner of Domaine de Joy is advised, very sensibly, by Denis Dubourdieu,
Bordeaux's white wine witchdoctor. Most dry white bordeaux leaves me as cold
as it tastes, but Dubourdieu's own CH REYNON VIEILLES VIGNES 1990 (Pounds
6.99 Oddbins) is pure delight (and hasn't seen so much as a matchstick of
wood). Dubourdieu insists on such ripeness in the grapes from these
actually-not-so-old vines that he often has to send the pickers through the
vineyard twice, and manages to avoid any of the aggressive herbaceousness so
often associated with the Sauvignon Blanc grape. This wine is so gently
perfumed and ripe that I could easily take it for a fine Alsace.
The aromatic Sauvignon with its searing acid is certainly at its most
appealing in midsummer; even hay fever sufferers can smell it a tennis court
away. New Zealand is a prime source of it, and while the 1991 vintage of the
widely distributed MONTANA SAU3VIGNON (price point: Pounds 4.99) is one of
the best yet, there is more dazzling CLOUDY BAY-type fruit to be had from
PALLISER ESTATE 1991 (Pounds 8 from Thresher and Bute Wines of Scotland).
Even better value is the TROIS MOULINE SAUVIGNON 1991 (Pounds 3.69 Oddbins,
Pounds 3.75 Waitrose) which is now made in the Languedoc and bears a quite
remarkable resemblance to the flirtatious OZIDOC (Pounds 4.20 Adnams of
Southwold).
But perhaps better value still, even if too grassy for my taste, is the
Hungarian GYONGYOS ESTATE SAUVIGNON BLANC 1991 (widely available at about
Pounds 3) made by young Australian-trained, Bordeaux-based Hugh Ryman.
Eastern Europe is another hot spot for the value-conscious wine drinker:
Safeway's SPECIAL RESERVE ROMANIAN CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1985 is a steal, if in
a somewhat predictable style, at Pounds 2.99.
Some of the best-value sparkling wines are Moet's new elegant Australian, an
oxymoron of ever there was one, GREEN POINT (Pounds 9.99 Victoria Wine,
Augustus Barnett); New Zealand DEUTZ MARLBOROUGH CUVEE (Pounds 9.99 Thresher
and Oddbins); Californian pink and white MUMM CUVEE NAPA (around Pounds 8.50
Tesco, Safeway and Oddbins, which offers a taste of it today); and Oregonian
ARGYLE PINOT NOIR 1988 (Pounds 9.99 Oddbins) and Australian CROSER 1988
(Pounds 10.49 Oddbins), both made by Brian Croser of Petaluma in which
Bollinger have an interest. (And, newest of all and so far available only
Down Under, PELORUS, from the Cloudy Bay winery of NZ that is now part of
Veuve Clicquot.)
But there are other well-made, well-priced alternatives to champagne which
have been made quite independently of it. Spanish Cava does not have to look
naff and taste too obtrusively of the Xarello grape, as evinced by
Freixenet's CUVEE D S 1985, and LOXAREL 1986 (Pounds 9.99 and Pounds 6.49
respectively, Thresher). Perhaps Loxarel stands for Lo-Xarello?
Please note that many of these wines are available only at selected
branches, especially within the Thresher empire.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Average family faces Pounds 10 per
month rise in premiums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the Lloyd's market will have an impact on the cost of motor
and household insurance. But those buying insurance will be more affected by
the heavy losses of the conventional insurance companies - such as Sun
Alliance and Royal Insurance - highlighted this week by new figures from the
Association of British Insurers.
The ABI, which represents insurers on the company market, warned this week
that the 'average' UK family would pay an extra Pounds 10 a month for their
home and motor insurance as a result of recent premium rises.
The ABI's figures showed that insurance woes are not confined to Lloyd's.
After suffering their worst results for generations in 1990, UK insurance
companies reported record trading losses of Pounds 3.3bn last year last
year, with motor insurers hit by underwriting losses of Pounds 1.2bn.
However, the companies' main problems stemmed from mortgage indemnity
policies, which insure building societies against losses they suffer on the
sale of repossessed properties. With the number of repossessions rising and
house prices falling, claims multiplied last year and losses of Pounds 1.2bn
dwarfed premiums. Losses from subsidence damage to domestic properties rose
to Pounds 540m.
Ian Rushton, chairman of the ABI, warned that the Pounds 10 a month figure
is very much an average. 'Where the industry is making and foresees
exceptional losses, the increases may be significantly greater. Some rates
have almost doubled already and these reflect the dramatic losses.'
Ian Rushton said: 'In the UK, for every Pounds 1 of premium collected,
insurance companies paid Pounds 1.30 in claims and expenses.'
By contrast, most of the recent losses at Lloyd's have affected syndicates
specialising in commercial insurances such as marine and liability policies
for large companies, and catastrophe reinsurance.
Lloyd's is the leading insurer of private motorists, with a market share of
14 per cent. But its results in this sector have been good. The 28
syndicates insuring private cars recorded a profit in 1989.
Syndicates have been affected by the upsurge in claims in 1990 and 1991 and
George Johnston, chairman of the Lloyd's Motor Underwriters Association, is
expecting a small loss in 1990. Johnston cites the big rise in crime and
recession-related claims as the main reason.
Rates at Lloyd's have increased. Ralph Sharp, managing director of Castle
Holdings, which manages one of the Lloyd's market's biggest motor insurers,
says premium rates have risen by 50 per cent over the last 18 months,
although this takes into account an increase for July. Paul Scott, partner
of Lloyd's brokers Roger Lark and Sedgwick, believes that the increases
charged by Lloyd's syndicates lag behind those pushed through by the
companies.
Meanwhile, the ABI said some of the increase in claims was due to bogus and
inflated claims, which cost it an estimated Pounds 400m last year. The
Association is launching an advertising campaign next month in a bid to
deter fraudsters. Mike Jones, chief executive, said: 'We aim to identify,
spotlight and prosecute the fraudsters. They must not be allowed to get away
with dodgy claims.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cash calls: how to cope with the
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE coming weeks several thousand Names who have been hit hard by the
market's record losses of 1989 and cash calls for 1990 will face the
prospect of finding very large sums of money.
Advisers say those in this situation should not panic, but should seek
expert advice.
The first thing any Name should do is to look closely at his or her finances
and draw up a cash-flow chart to see how much is needed and the most
tax-efficient way of raising that sum, says Robert Saunders, of Smith and
Williamson, private bank and chartered accountants.
Names should be especially cautious about using the resources of family
members to meet losses because of the tax implications of doing this.
Saunders says that the Inland Revenue's treatment of loans taken out to meet
Lloyd's losses has become more generous. Citing a hypothetical case of a
Name facing a Pounds 100,000 loss who has a mortgage of Pounds 130,000 and
Pounds 100,000 of savings in the bank, he says: 'The worst thing the Name
could do would be to use the savings to pay off the losses.'
Saunders suggests that the savings should be used to reduce the mortgage and
more money should be borrowed to pay the losses. Interest on the new Pounds
100,000 loan can be offset against the Name's marginal tax rate.
Max Lehrain, of Grimston Scott, also says that it is better to borrow rather
than to sell assets, and warns that Names who panic and sell their shares
are likely to face a large capital gains tax bill. Grimston Scott has
organised lines of credit with building societies with interest rates in the
region of 9.5 per cent to 10 per cent.
However, some Names are so badly affected that restructuring their finances
will not be enough. Lehrain says that for those who are doing their best to
meet their commitments, it is possible to arbitrate informally with the
agents in order to delay paying off all the losses at once. Failing that,
Names can seek hardship relief from Lloyd's, or apply for bankruptcy.
Those who opt for hardship relief agree to restructure their debts to
Lloyd's, with their unpaid loss converted into a loan at a commercial rate
of interest. Terms are confidential and negotiated on a case by case basis,
but generally Names are allowed to retain a home of around Pounds 125,000 in
value and an annual income of about Pounds 14,000.
Lloyd's is negotiating extra funding of some Pounds 50m from agents and
brokers which could lead to easier terms, but so far hardship has not proved
to be a popular option. Only 39 Names who have approached the Hardship Fund
committee, chaired by Dr Mary Archer, have accepted the arrangements
proposed.
'Some Names may not have realised that the Hardship Fund means just that,'
says Michael Voller, Lloyd's specialist at BDO Binder Hamlyn, chartered
accountants. He says that bankruptcy - despite the social stigma attached -
is a preferable option for some Names. 'At least it wipes the slate clean.'
However, all the advisers believe that those Names who are tempted to resign
from Lloyd's should think again, because by doing so they will cut
themselves off from potential future profits.

Voller.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Mandela warns of 'disaster' in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA is on the 'brink of disaster', Mr Nelson Mandela, the African
National Congress leader, warned President FW de Klerk last night. He issued
his warning as further allegations surfaced of government complicity in
township violence.
The deadlock in constitutional negotiations and the government's alleged
role in political violence have created an 'untenable and explosive
situation', Mr Mandela said in a memorandum to the president setting out the
ANC's reasons for withdrawing from constitutional negotiations.
The ANC leader's warning came after the Goldstone judicial commission,
investigating township violence, heard evidence yesterday from a mine
security guard linking a police unit to the massacre in which 42 people died
at the Boipatong township near Johannesburg last Wednesday.
The witness claimed that a member of the unit told him it had taken part in
the killings. Earlier this week the commission had revealed the existence of
the 40-strong unit, consisting of ex-members of a counter-insurgency force
known as Koevoet and based in the grounds of a mine east of Johannesburg.
The Koevoet, now disbanded, won a reputation for brutality and dirty tricks
during operations in Namibia's war for independence. When the commission
visited the base this week, they found trunks containing rifles and
ammunition. Two white officers were in the force, described by police as an
anti-livestock theft unit.
The member concerned, who also gave evidence, denied the conversation had
taken place and police said its own investigation of the massacre revealed
'no evidence whatsoever' of the unit's involvement. But the very existence
of the unit has shocked South Africans, and reinforced speculation about
government involvement in political unrest.
In his memorandum, Mr Mandela said while the government insisted in the
constitutional negotiations 'on a minority veto in whatever form . . . the
deadlock will be unresolved'. He added that demands presented to the
government, including an international inquiry into Boipatong, were 'the
minimum' required for talks to resume. President de Klerk went part of the
way towards meeting this condition by offering to include international
jurists on the inquiry.
Last night it was announced that India's former chief justice, Mr Justice
Bhagwati, and a UK academic, Dr PA Waddington, are to join the commission.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Life groups fined Pounds 50,000 each: Investment in Levitt
Group 'violated principle of Financial Services Act'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Britain's largest life assurance companies, General Accident and
Commercial Union, were each fined Pounds 50,000 yesterday for investing in
the now-defunct Levitt Group financial services company.
Mr Roger Levitt, the group's chairman, has been charged with 62 offences
involving Pounds 20m. The charges include conspiracy to defraud, theft,
false accounting and obtaining property and services by deception.
Regulators said the two life assurance companies had invested in Levitt
partly in the hope of encouraging its independent sales agents to sell more
of their products.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, levied
fines against the two companies for investing Pounds 7.35m each in 1990
giving them a 4.9 per cent stake in Levitt Group. Levitt was once one of the
largest privately held financial services companies in the UK.
The investments were said to have violated a key principle of the Financial
Services Act intended to ensure that those who offered 'independent'
financial advice did so solely on each product's own merits.
Before the Financial Services Act was introduced in 1988, insurance
companies regularly invested in independent intermediaries in the hope of
encouraging the sale of more of their own products.
Legal and General Assurance, another leading UK life insurer, also had a 4.9
per cent stake in Levitt Group but was not part of the disciplinary hearing.
Legal and General said its sales arrangement was with a division of Levitt
which sold its products exclusively and did not claim to offer independent
advice. Lautro rules only restrict investment in independent agents claiming
to sell the best products of a group of companies.
In explaining the fines, Lautro said its rules on commission allowed
investments in independent sales agencies only when the investment was
unconnected with the marketing of the life insurance company's products.
'In both cases the (life insurance company) members accepted that there was
a connection between their investment and the increased marketing
opportunities for their products, albeit with the disciplines of best
advice.'
Lautro said there was no suggestion that the payments involved any dishonest
or improper motives and said that both companies had co-operated fully in
the investigation.
Mr Bill Jack, director and general manager of General Accident, said the
payment to Levitt Group had been made as an investment, but the company also
wanted access to Levitt's product advice panels which had not been
suggesting GA products to clients.
Mr Jack said the company believed Levitt Group could have recommended its
products in accordance with the 'best advice' rules of the Financial
Services Act. He said the investment led to no increase in sales of GA
products, nor was there any sign that clients had not been given best
advice.

FT  27 JUN 92 / SFO to question Kevin Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL and Mr Robert Bunn, former finance director of the Maxwell
private companies, have been summoned to interviews by the Serious Fraud
Office, the High Court was told yesterday.
Both have been served with notices under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal
Justice Act, the court heard. The section gives the SFO power to compel 'the
person under investigation' or 'any other person' believed to have 'relevant
information' to attend for questioning and to produce documents.
The SFO would not confirm or deny that the notices had been issued. Peters &amp;
Peters, Mr Kevin Maxwell's solicitors, refused to say if he had received a
notice.
Mr Bunn's solicitor, Mr Jeffrey Bayes, of Burton Copeland, confirmed that a
section 2 notice had been served on his client on Wednesday. 'It was done in
an extremely civilised manner,' Mr Bayes said.
He declined to say when Mr Bunn was required to go to the SFO's offices to
be interviewed, other than that it would be 'in the coming week'.
Service of the notices was mentioned when Mr Ian Maxwell applied
unsuccessfully for postponement of a pending High Court case against him.
Immediate judgment is to be sought against him and Mr Kevin Maxwell on
damages claims made against them over missing Maxwell pension funds by the
provisional liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, from which
more than half the Pounds 886m pension money may have disappeared.
The liquidators, Robson Rhodes, will ask the court for summary judgment
against the brothers on the ground that they have no defence to the claims.
The hearing against Mr Kevin Maxwell will be on July 20, and that against Mr
Ian Maxwell three days later.
The liquidators issued a writ against Mr Kevin Maxwell in December claiming
Pounds 450m damages. Their writ against Mr Ian Maxwell, claiming unspecified
damages, was issued on May 8.
The writs accuse the brothers of breaches of their fiduciary duties and
duties of care as directors of BIM. Yesterday Mr Johnny Veeder QC, for Mr
Ian Maxwell, asked the High Court to postpone his case until September. He
said Mr Maxwell was 'fighting on too many fronts' and would not have time to
prepare for a hearing on July 23.
Mr Veeder said Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Bunn had also been served with
section 2 notices and it was 'inevitable' that a similar notice would be
served on Mr Ian Maxwell.

Wall Street
US share prices remained stuck in a narrow range, reflecting investor
uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, corporate earnings and
domestic equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.60 lower at 3,282.41.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also a shade lower at the
close, down 0.29 at 403.41, while the Nasdaq composite index finished 0.33
lower at 547.87. Volume on the NYSE was light at 155.6m shares.
Although the Dow fell 10 points in the opening minutes, the market soon
settled into the pattern established this week: every time shares fall far,
buyers step in to bring them back to earlier levels, and every time shares
rise substantially, a wave of selling quickly erodes most of the gains.
The day's only economic news - a 0.3 per cent increase in personal income
and a 0.5 per cent rise in personal consumption during May - had little
impact. Recent indicators of economic weakness have boosted hopes for an
interest rate cut, but no-one is confident enough to buy stocks in
anticipation that the Federal Reserve will ease policy.
Total was the most heavily traded stock, rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22
3/8 in turnover of 4m shares after the international energy group launched a
secondary offering of 14.8m of its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at a
price of Dollars 22.23 each. The ADRs were sold by the French government.
Also in the oil and gas sector, Offshore Pipelines plunged Dollars 3 1/8 ,
or more than 20 per cent, to Dollars 10 3/4 on a warning from the company
that fourth-quarter revenues and earnings will be short of expectations, and
Oceaneering International firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 13 1/2 after the
broking house Robinson-Humphrey added the stock to its 'best buys' list,
citing strong earnings momentum.
British Petroleum ADRs were heavily traded, falling Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
48 3/8 as investors continued to react negatively to news of the ousting of
Mr Robert Horton, the group's chairman and chief executive.
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 66 3/4 in
turnover of 4.4m shares after two Wall Street broking houses downgraded
their ratings for the stock. Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its rating from
'buy' to 'neutral/hold' and Kidder Peabody reduced its grade in a similar
fashion. The analysts are worried about the effect of price competition in
the market for Windows software, and slowing demand for products in Europe
on Microsoft's earnings.
Sequoia Systems fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 in active trading after
the company said that it expected to record fourth-quarter and full-year
earnings 'significantly below' the high end of analysts' forecasts.
Canada
IN TORONTO share prices closed slightly higher in moderate trading. Based on
preliminary data, the composite index rose 12.78 points, or 0.38 per cent,
to 3,351.33. On the week, the composite index was almost unchanged, ending
up less than one point.
Advances today led declines by 298 to 225. Trading volume of 24.718m shares
was below Thursday's 36.495m shares, and trading value was CDollars 278.6m
against CDollars 387.1m.

more details of wealth

<TEXT>
A TORONTO judge has ordered the Reichmann family to disclose more details
about their private wealth in response to creditors' concern that the family
should contribute towards the costs of running and restructuring their
ailing company, Olympia &amp; York.
The order affects companies which the creditors believe may in some way be
related to the O&amp;Y group but which fall outside the scope of the court
protection order granted last month. The order, issued under Canada's
Companies Creditors Arrangements Act, affects 29 companies under the main
holding group, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
The Reichmanns are expected to contest the order in court on Monday. For the
first time since the bankruptcy filing last month, they will be represented,
not by O&amp;Y's law firm, Davies Ward Beck of Toronto, but by a personal
lawyer.
The creditors have succeeded in recent weeks in drawing considerably more
information out of the Reichmanns than was disclosed in the original CCAA
filing.
Mr Gary Goodman, a senior O&amp;Y official, disclosed under private
cross-examination last week that the family has bought assets worth several
hundred million dollars from O&amp;Y over the past 18 months. An O&amp;Y spokesman
said this was done to inject cash into the company as it became more pressed
for liquidity.
Earlier this week, O&amp;Y disclosed other unencumbered assets worth about
CDollars 70m (USDollars 58.3m), including a Gulfstream jet and several
parcels of land.
A lawyer for one of the creditors said yesterday: 'We want disclosure. If
they have a house, I'd like to know they have a house. Once we get the
information, we can make a decision on what to do.'
Creditors with loans secured by O&amp;Y projects want to reduce their
contribution to the company's administrative and restructuring expenses.

FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital may build stake of up to
10% in Olivetti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, the loss-making Italian computer and office equipment
manufacturer, yesterday signed an agreement with Digital Equipment which
could lead to the US minicomputer maker owning up to 10 per cent of Olivetti
within two years.
Digital has agreed with CIR, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company and
Olivetti's biggest shareholder, to pay L8,500 (Dollars 7.29) a share for
4.03 per cent of the equity, roughly three times the price at which
Olivetti's shares were suspended yesterday. Industry analysts believe the
premium indicates DEC's keenness to secure a European partner to help market
its latest technology.
The agreement marks a significant stage in the consolidation of the European
computer industry. The deal covers both equity participation and a
technology partnership.
Digital has agreed to buy immediately just over 4 per cent of Olivetti's
stock for L172bn; depending on the progress of the agreement, it will buy
another 4.03 per cent before the end of 1994. It will also buy a further
1.89 per cent on the open market by June next year.
If the plan goes smoothly, DEC will take two of the 19 places on Olivetti's
board.
Digital, with global revenues of Dollars 13bn, is the second largest
computer maker in Europe; last year it acquired the computer businesses of
Philips of the Netherlands and Kienzle of Germany. Its losses last year
topped Dollars 600m.
The deal gives Olivetti access to Digital's 'Alpha' microprocessor
technology, which many believe to be the most powerful available.
Alpha is Digital's version of a technology called 'Risc' which offers high
performance at moderate cost.
Digital will supply Olivetti with Alpha chips and systems to build into its
range of minicomputers and workstations.
European computer manufacturers have sought larger partners to share
development costs and open new markets. Fujitsu took an 80 per cent
shareholding in ICL of the UK two years ago, and earlier this year IBM spent
Dollars 100m on a stake in Groupe Bull of France.
Olivetti's choice of Digital as technology partner was not unexpected. The
two have alliances stretching back over 20 years and Olivetti makes the
personal computers that Digital markets in Europe.

FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Consortium launches DM1bn bid
for control of Adidas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENE Jaggi, chief executive of Adidas, is heading a consortium of European
investors in a DM1bn (Dollars 648m) bid to buy control of the German
sporting goods group from Bernard Tapie, the controversial French
businessman and politician.
In a brief statement Mr Jaggi, who recently announced his resignation from
Adidas if Mr Tapie stayed in charge, said the deal was being put together by
Botts, a small London-based investment bank. The offer, which is believed to
divide the DM1bn investment between the purchase price for Mr Tapie's 55 per
cent stake and a capital injection, has a deadline of next Tuesday.
Mr Jaggi, Adidas's chief executive for some four years, was not available
for comment yesterday. But Pentland Holdings, the UK consumer products
company which last year bought a 20 per cent stake in Adidas and has
pre-emptive rights over Mr Tapie's holding, said it doubted the validity of
Mr Jaggi's offer.
Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland's finance director, said Pentland, which has long
declared its interest in controlling Adidas, had not been informed about the
bid. Under the terms of last year's deal, Mr Tapie is not allowed to sell
his shares in Adidas unless the offer is extended - at the same price - to
Pentland and the financial institutions that hold the remaining shares.
Pentland is also entitled, according to Mr Farrant, to be given 'a
respectable period of time' to decide whether or not to exercise its
pre-emption rights. As a result, he said, if Mr Jaggi's offer expires on
Tuesday, it would 'not be valid'.
Mr Jaggi's announcement comes at a critical time for Mr Tapie, who has been
struggling to repay the debt incurred in his acquisition of Adidas two years
ago and who recently resigned from the French cabinet because of his
involvement in a fraud case.
Earlier this month Mr Tapie announced that Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his
holding company, would make a FFr730m payment due on August 6, by the end of
June. However, BTF, which had its shares suspended yesterday in Paris, has
since run into problems with a number of proposed disposals.
Adidas recently disclosed profits of DM44m for 1991, down from DM90m in
1990, on turnover of DM3.5bn.

FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: BSN takes control of Italian
food group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, the French food group, is taking control of Galbani, a leading player
in the Italian food industry, by buying an additional 10 per cent stake from
IFIL, a company controlled by the powerful Agnelli family, for FFr1.35bn
(Dollars 260m).
The deal comes only a few months after the bitter takeover battle for the
Perrier mineral water group in which BSN, a traditional ally of the
Agnellis, dramatically switched sides to support Nestle, the Swiss food
group which fought successfully against the Italian family for control of
Perrier.
Galbani, which has extensive interests in cheese and processed meats with
brands such as Bel Paese and Santa Lucia, is now owned jointly by BSN and
IFIL.
Under the terms of the new agreement, BSN will take control by raising its
stake to 60 per cent with an option to buy the remaining shares for not less
than the price paid for its extra 10 per cent stake.
The stake disposal represents a significant profit for IFIL, given that it
values Galbani, which made sales of L1,730bn last year, at L3,000bn, more
than twice as much as the L1,340bn that the Agnellis paid for it in 1989.
BSN invested in Galbani in summer 1989, initially taking 35 per cent.
Meanwhile BSN, together with its allies in the Perrier saga, is eagerly
awaiting the conclusion of the European Commission's inquiry into the Nestle
bid.
The inquiry, which should be completed over the next few weeks, will
determine whether Nestle can proceed with the bid and with its agreement to
sell Volvic mineral water to BSN.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Concentrating on back pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM GARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite some sensible advice Dr McGannon (Management: 'How back pain
can make you lose your marbles', June 17) seems to underestimate the
preventative benefits of correctly applied manipulation. Just as a badly
tuned motor-car will eventually stop running, no matter how carefully you
drive it, an incorrectly functioning spine develops areas of overwork which
can cause regular episodes of pain, commonly at the base of the spine or the
lower neck, radiating to the shoulders. This pain can lead to reduced
concentration and working efficiency - and thus more stresses - in order to
cope with the existing work load.
Correcting the variation in spinal joint movement means that the back is
more able to cope with the external stresses of working life applied to it.
Combining this approach with sensible, long-term advice will reduce the need
for time-consuming and costly bed rest, as well as improving individual
working efficiency.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Top-level coup in classic style: Bob Horton's departure from
BP supports the view that non-executives can keep executives in check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were anxious to be gentlemanly about it,' says a British Petroleum
official.
The boardroom coup which ousted Robert Horton from the joint position of
chairman and chief executive of BP on Thursday was indeed swift and
relatively painless. The messy part came in a confrontation earlier this
week. But once the news was broadcast to an astonished world, it was all
over and the parties to it maintained a dignified silence. This was broken
only by Lord Ashburton, the new chairman, who spoke of the board's 'great
sadness' at Mr Horton's departure.
Mr Horton spent yesterday at his Thamesside home in Oxfordshire. 'Life goes
on,' he told the local newsagent when he slipped across the road to buy the
newspapers with his name all over the front pages.
The coup was also a classic display of the way the business establishment
dispatches those who have outstayed their welcome. By showing that a board
can bring down even a man who holds all the reins of power, it marks
something of a triumph for corporate democracy. The intention, of course,
was to do BP some good. But while that seemed to be the general expectation
in the City yesterday, large questions about the future of the UK's leading,
but financially stressed, company have still to be answered - hence the
Pounds 1.8bn by which the market value of BP plummeted between breakfast and
lunchtime yesterday.
Mr Horton's downfall came as a total surprise, as much to senior people
within the company as to outsiders. He had only been in the job since March
1990, and even though he made more enemies than friends with his high-handed
manner and aggressive cost-cutting strategy, there were few signs of the
pressures that were building up in the boardroom.
It transpires that Lord Ashburton, better known as the City merchant banker
Sir John Baring, and his non-executive board colleagues, had been nursing
misgivings for some time. Not only was BP faring noticeably worse in the
recession than its main competitors - profits were down 85 per cent last
year - but Mr Horton's personal style was hitting morale and adding to the
problems.
The misgivings were strongest among the other business representatives on
the board, people like Sir Patrick Sheehy, the chairman of BAT Industries,
Dr Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen, and Charles Knight, chairman of the US
company Emerson Electric. After sharing their concerns last week, they
confronted Mr Horton at the beginning of this week. According to one account
of the meeting, Mr Horton quickly understood that he was being given little
choice, and offered to resign.
His resignation was accepted at a full board meeting on Thursday afternoon.
This was attended by the other seven executive directors - the heads of BP's
various divisions - who all supported the changes and the new appointments.
Although it was the non-executives who took the initiative on Horton's
ouster, they seem to have had little trouble in getting the executives on
side, a further indication of Horton's isolation.
Lord Ashburton himself appears to have played the key role. Scion of the
Baring family and former head of Barings merchant bank, he is a leading City
figure and former director of the Bank of England. He is also the
longest-serving BP non-executive director with 10 years on the board, which
gives him considerable influence. His style is languid. But a banking
colleague says: 'He has strong feelings about companies being run properly
and effectively. He would be the sort of man to act in a situation like
this. He has high standards.'
The boardroom drama, rare in a UK blue chip company, would rank as a
significant corporate event at the best of times. But it also comes at a
moment when corporate governance is a fashionable topic, after the recent
Cadbury Report on board accountability.
The BP coup showed two things. It reinforces the view that non-executive
directors can play a key role in keeping the executive directors in check.
BP is particularly strong on non-executives. They are in the majority on the
board by nine to eight, and only they sit on the board's auditing and
compensation committees which oversee the accounts and directors' pay.
It also bears out the Cadbury recommendation in favour of splitting the role
of chairman and chief executive. Even though the British corporate tradition
tends to separate them, the two positions have always been combined at BP.
But Mr Horton's dominating style highlighted the dangers of concentration of
power. In future BP is to have a non-executive chairman, Lord Ashburton, and
a full-time chief executive, Mr David Simon, until now the chief operating
officer.
'This creates a good balance,' said Mr Simon. 'My executives are fully in
agreement that the change is appropriate.'
But as well as providing for a more balanced distribution of power within
the group, the changes are also intended to bring about a shift in style.
Although people inside BP say that talk of Mr Horton's arrogant manner is
overdone - he has often shown acts of great personal kindness - his evident
enjoyment of power, his lack of tact and irritating name-dropping habit
alienated many of his colleagues. Whether this was due to a supreme
self-confidence or the exact opposite was a matter of debate within BP, but
it led to much anti-Horton sniping, culminating in a famous spoof of an FT
article, put together with evident relish on some internal BP desk-top
printer, depicting Horton as a power-crazed eccentric.
David Simon could hardly be more different. A quiet-spoken organisation man
who lost out to Horton in the 1990 leadership stakes and operated in his
shadow thereafter, he has never had a chance to show the full range of his
leadership qualities. But insiders say that while he will be more
user-friendly than Horton, he can be just as tough. The adjectives used to
describe him are wily, subtle, diplomatic, and knowledgeable about the
undercurrents of the British establishment, something for which Horton had
little time.
'Simon knows all about dynamic positioning,' said an official, referring to
the ultra-precise techniques used by floating oil rigs to adjust to ocean
currents and winds, and stay stable in a storm. 'He has an ability to stay
right over the hole. Horton had to be tethered down.'
On a broader level, Simon's appointment may be welcomed. The removal of
friction on the board should make it function more smoothly. He is widely
approved of by the staff. And the City likes a financial man. But goodwill
alone will not be enough to resolve BP's problems. These centre mainly on
the group's high level of debt - the result of expensive acquisitions and a
share buy-back in the 1980s - and a high cost structure. Ironically, the
earlier success of its oil exploration activities has also tilted it towards
oil production which makes it more vulnerable to changes in the oil price
than companies which have a better balance between their production and
retailing sides.
The crucial question is whether the change of faces at the top will lead to
changes in strategy - and the message from BP is no. The unpopular cost
squeeze instituted by Mr Horton will go on, and so too presumably will the
job cuts.
The biggest uncertainty is in the stock market where BP's share price fell
by 14 per cent yesterday on fears of a dividend cut and a possible Pounds
1bn-plus rights issue to ease the debt problem.
Industry observers tended to dismiss the rights issue danger. Mr Paul
Spedding at Kleinwort Benson Securities points out that for tax reasons, it
is cheaper for BP to borrow money in the US than to raise more equity
capital. 'It doesn't make sense,' he says.
But they are more divided over the dividend. Under Horton, BP steadfastly
refused to cut its pay-out even though it had to pay part of it out of
reserves after the latest fall in profits. By halving the dividend BP could
save itself several hundred million pounds a year, reduce its debt, and give
itself a fresh start. A cut announced at the interim results in a month
could also be blamed on this week's upheaval.
BP's new chiefs are insisting that no changes in dividend policy have been
decided. Simon himself is committed to not cutting the dividend. He told an
analysts' meeting last September: 'We will not, save force majeure, cut our
dividend. We have done it only once in our history and that was in the first
world war.'
What is more certain than dividend policy is another legacy of the Horton
era. Simon sent out an internal statement yesterday to senior managers
reaffirming the process of cultural change known as Project 1990, and laying
stress on greater teamwork and openness. Project 1990 aimed to replace BP's
bureaucratic 'command-&amp;-control' style of management with one based on a
'delayered' structure and a atmosphere of what Horton called 'openness,
care, teamwork, empowerment and trust'. It is also understood that Simon
stands by the proposed cuts in BP's corporate and business head offices,
which are seen as an integral part of the group's existing strategy.
Simon's fortunes will ultimately depend on the oil price. Horton told
investors at the beginning of this year that all BP's businesses had been
'tested against Dollars 18 a barrel oil and found to be robust'. Since then
a new spirit of co-operation within Opec has helped push the oil price up
over Dollars 21 a barrel, which helps. The institutional view in BP is that
the price should continue to rise in the long term, though not to dizzying
heights. This suggests that this week's drama was only a prelude to better
times at BP.
'We aim to be extremely competitive,' said Simon, 'but we're fighting a
difficult market.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Major to study report on top pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTROVERSIAL report on pay rises for senior civil servants, military
personnel and judges was received by Downing Street yesterday and will be
considered today by Mr John Major, the prime minister, on his return from
the European Council summit in Lisbon.
The recommendations by the Top Salaries Review Body follow the first
thorough reappraisal of the salaries of those groups of public servants for
seven years, and is said to recommend substantial increases.
Originally the aim had been to take the report at cabinet next Thursday, but
it has been agreed that the Treasury should have longer to prepare an
analysis of the implications, not least for the present round of
negotiations on public-sector pay.
The report is now expected to be discussed at cabinet the following week. It
cannot be delayed until the cabinet discusses public spending - as is
expected in mid July - because the government's decision must be announced
to MPs before parliament is dissolved for the summer.
Although by convention the decision is announced in a written statement,
there has to be a parliamentary debate to approve the consequential change
to the Lord Chancellor's salary, which is linked to that of the Lord Chief
Justice.
In 1985, the last time there was a thorough review, increases of up to 46
per cent were recommended, and in the debate that followed the government's
majority of more than 100 was slashed to just 17.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, has been
among the Conservative MPs who have already made clear their concern that
the pay rises should not be substantial when the economy has yet to come out
of recession.
Opposition MPs have tabled a Commons motion rejecting the idea of
comparability between senior posts in the public and private sectors because
of the job security enjoyed by public servants.
MPs have also made clear that they would resent any attempt to link the
handling of the report with the separate review body study which proposes an
increase in MPs' allowances for office costs.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Threat to timeshare credit licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading threatened yesterday to revoke the
consumer-credit licences of six companies associated with Club Riviera,
Britain's largest holiday timeshare group.
This is the first time the OFT has threatened such action against a
timeshare company. Its action follows complaints about advertising,
marketing and sales practices.
Loss of consumer-credit licences would deprive the companies of the right to
arrange financing for buyers of their properties.
Three of the companies, Club Riviera (UK), Club Tenerife Sales and Regency
Palms Sales, are subsidiaries of the Manchester-based Riviera group. The
group has management contracts with the three other companies, Ryefix,
Canary Islands Holiday Club and Marbella Beach Club, which are registered in
the Isle of Man.
The OFT has given the companies, which specialise in selling timeshare
properties in Spain and the Canary Islands, three weeks to argue against the
proposed revocation.
Mr Simon Clarke, Riviera group's sales and marketing director, said
yesterday that he did not know why the OFT was threatening action but would
seek further information. He said he would seek to retain the companies'
licences.
Last September, Club Riviera and Club Tenerife were convicted by
Staffordshire magistrates on charges of making false advertising statements.
In 1989 Club Riviera was fined by the Timeshare Developers' Association
after allegations that the company was selling flats on the Costa del Sol
that were being built without planning permission.
About 90 people complained to the association and the OFT that they paid
deposits for flats that were never completed.

THE IRA claimed responsibility yesterday for the latest bomb attack in
London's financial centre, Bethan Hutton writes.
The bomb - left under a car in Coleman Street, near the Guildhall, on
Thursday evening - caused minimal disruption to businesses in the City
yesterday. No one was injured in the blast, but the bomb left a crater in
the street, and glass was shattered in surrounding buildings.
At Slaughter and May, the solicitors whose offices were worst hit, work was
continuing as usual. The company - which had already taken precautions
against terrorist attack - said damage was restricted to glass in two
meeting rooms and five offices, and a clean-up would make them usable by
Monday.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Farewell for Scotland's men of steel: The closure of
Ravenscraig and the 800 people made redundant this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON

<TEXT>
ALLAN RODGERS looks angrily back at the Ravenscraig steel plant. 'It's
criminal to close it,' he says. 'It's the best steel plant in Europe. I
committed myself to British Steel when I left school and though people told
me I was crazy I thought I really had a secure job.'
Rodgers, 30, is one of the men who this week have walked out of Ravenscraig
for the last time. The final batch of steel slabs was poured on Wednesday.
The plant no longer casts a red glow in the night sky outside Glasgow. Today
800 of the plant's last 1,200 workers become redundant. The remaining men
will all have left by the end of the year after helping close down the
plant.
The closure ends the 35-year life of one of the best-known and most
controversial industrial plants in Britain. As the strong, fit men, mostly
in their 30s or early 40s, walk out, their first emotion is anger rather
than anxiety about their future.
'Tell Black Bob Scholey (British Steel's chairman) he's a bastard,' says one
of the plant's maintenance crew. A man from the drawing office says: 'This
is only happening because it's in Scotland.'
Many still seem baffled that British Steel should want to shut the enormous
complex which dominates Motherwell. They see a plant with skills and
equipment to make types of steel which, they claim, cannot be produced in
British Steel's other plants.
In the past few years the labour force has done everything asked of it and
repeatedly won company medals for breaking productivity records. One middle
manager says: 'They've done the dirty on us.'
The plant is closing because British Steel needs to make savings in a severe
downturn and is concentrating production at its three larger plants in south
Wales and Teesside.
'Get on with the future? Aye, but what future?' asks George Quinn, a senior
union convener at the plant. 'It's not as if there's some great employer out
there waiting to employ the men.'
That is true, but the Lanarkshire Development Agency, set up last year under
the umbrella of Scottish Enterprise, is now leading a big recovery
programme. Last year it spent Pounds 50m on environmental projects, training
and business development, most of it in the north Lanarkshire area worst hit
by the closure of Ravenscraig and the nearby Clydesdale tube mill. It will
spend the same this year.
The EC recently approved the creation of an enterprise zone on 500 acres of
land around Motherwell where incoming companies will receive tax allowances
and exemption from business rates. Archie Bethel, LDA chief executive, says:
'These are prime sites smack in the middle of Scotland.'
British Rail is locating its Scottish terminal for Channel tunnel freight at
Mossend, just north of Motherwell. It will employ 150 people and 2,000 more
jobs should be generated in the adjoining freight village - a complex of
warehouses and handling facilities.
Some 4,400 steel workers will have lost their jobs by the end of the year
and the knock-on effect of the shutdown is expected to cost a further 5,500
jobs. But as a newly paid-off electrician from Ravenscraig admits coyly
outside the Era Bar, just across from Ravenscraig: 'There's no one that
hasn't done very well out of British Steel. In fact I'm glad it's over: it's
been a bombshell hanging over us for years.'
The men are receiving redundancy pay averaging Pounds 20,000 with a few
getting more than Pounds 30,000. More than half of them have applied for
retraining in an EC-financed programme operated by the LDA, which offers
them full pay for a year.
They are being launched into a Scottish economy which, although hardly
flourishing, is doing better than many parts of England. Unemployment in
Lanarkshire was 13.9 per cent last month, lower than that of Glasgow but
well above the Scottish average of 9.3 per cent.
David Ivey, a 33-year-old electrician who worked at Ravenscraig for 17
years, has already taken a job with ScotRail in Glasgow. Another electrician
has found a job in a factory in Livingston. But Ivey points out that, being
tradesmen, they are easier to employ than the production workers, who need
to be retrained. 'As you reach 50 you can forget it; you're on the
scrapheap,' he says.
Sean Patton, a 32-year-old steelmaker, looks cheerful as he heads for a
course as a heavy goods vehicle driver. John Mackie, 43, and Ken Hanlin, 44,
both senior supervisors, are enrolling on courses in total quality
management at a college in Hamilton.
The unanswered question is what happens to the 1,000-acre Ravenscraig site.
British Steel and Scottish Enterprise are co-operating over a study of how
to reclaim the site and devise uses for the severely contaminated land. The
LDA believes reclamation may take 10 years and Pounds 200m. British Steel
has given no commitment to meeting all or part of the cost.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Stores still set to open this Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Lords judgment this week, which strengthened local councils'
powers to issue injunctions to prevent Sunday trading, is unlikely to result
in big changes this weekend.
Most of the 400 local authorities in England and Wales have not sought
injunctions to prevent retailers opening this Sunday.
Westminster City Council, which covers some of the country's busiest
shopping districts, said that it would take no action this weekend and it
would be at least the middle of next week before a decision was taken on
whether to pursue offenders.
It said: 'We haven't formally received the judgement yet. I think the
position of most councils is that they will take a while to creak into
action, unless they have a particular political bugbear about it.'
Reading District Council said it feared injunctions would lead to appeals
and would follow the same tortuous legal path as before.
Safeway, the supermarket chain owned by the Argyll Group, said the ruling
was a technical issue solely relating to cross-undertakings on compensation
to stores should an injunction be overturned.
'The judgment has not clarified the position regarding Sunday trading, which
remains confused and unclear,' it said.
This Sunday, Safeway, Tesco, Asda, and J. Sainsbury are also set to open the
same stores they regularly trade from on Sundays. Most DIY chains said it
would be 'business as usual'.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Chaos for Eurotunnel shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Double vision: Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, made use
of a video screen when briefing shareholders yesterday on the progress of
the Channel link project, Andrew Taylor writes.
Earlier there was chaos, angry scenes and standing room only as an army of
shareholders trekked to Folkestone, Kent. About 900 had registered to attend
the briefing before visiting the tunnel construction site. In the event,
1,500 people turned up, causing frayed tempers at London's Charing Cross
station, where trains had been booked to take shareholders to Folkestone.
Mr Derek Foster, a 52-year-old retired local-government officer from York,
said: 'If this is how they organised transporting shareholders to the tunnel
then God help us when it opens to the general public.'
Eurotunnel apologised for any inconvenience but said people had been asked
to register by telephone before attending. 'Many people either did not
notice or ignored this request.' The meeting, however, was good-humoured.
British shareholders in the main have been loyal and criticism of Eurotunnel
management was sparse in spite of the recent slide in the share price.
Mr Matthew Kemp, a systems programmer for Commercial Union from Surrey,
said: 'Obviously I would prefer the share prices to be higher but I am
pleased with the progress that construction is making and I am sure it will
be a success in the long term.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Bottomley defends 24-hour GP cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, delivered determined messages to
doctors and dentists yesterday.
She told the conference in Harrogate of the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts that she regretted a decision by family doctors this
week in favour of ending responsibility for 24-hour cover.
She was willing to explore with British Medical Association leaders ways of
improving the existing cover arrangements, but said she wanted to build on
rather than dismantle the tradition of round-the-clock commitment.
'Access to a family doctor 24 hours a day, in cases of urgent need, is one
of the hallmarks of British general practice,' she said. 'I do not want to
see it put at risk.'
Mrs Bottomley also spoke about the dispute over dentists' remuneration.
Dentists are balloting on action over a proposed 7 per cent reduction in
fees which the government says is necessary because earnings are exceeding
those recommended by the dentists' pay review body.
Mrs Bottomley said she was determined to safeguard the NHS dental service
against any action by dentists, which could include refusal to treat NHS
patients.
She had written to health service authorities reminding them of their powers
to employ salaried dentists directly if necessary. The authorities had a
frontline role to play in maintaining an NHS dental service and she expected
them to take 'whatever steps they must'.
This autumn's public spending round, the health secretary acknowledged, will
not be an easy one for ministers bidding for extra resources. She pledged,
though, that the proposed community care reforms due to come into effect
next April would go ahead on time and be 'fairly resourced'.

FT  27 JUN 92 / RiverBus fund angers tenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF tenants showed further signs of restiveness yesterday. There
was no sign, however, that any companies would follow Texaco in delaying
relocation to the London Docklands site that has been placed in
administration.
Anger is focused on payments for the RiverBus service on the Thames.
The administrators have refused to underwrite the service's losses after
Tuesday. A consortium of Docklands interests is planning measures to
maintain the service for another three months.
Several Canary Wharf tenants have joined the scheme while voicing strong
discontent.
One tenant said yesterday: 'If for any reason the funding for the RiverBus
fails, which relies on the administrators putting their share into the pot,
then on July 1 there are a number of people who will see the auditors as
being in breach of contract.
'Next week is the time when we will see action of some sort or other.'
Several tenants are said to be considering their position, but none appeared
yesterday to have decided to follow Texaco's move, which was interpreted as
an attempt to put pressure on the administrators.
Another comment was that the estate was not being maintained to the same
standard as it had been until the end of May.
However, the development's most committed tenants are all expected to stay
in place.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Cadbury report criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CADBURY report on corporate governance places too much emphasis on
non-executive directors and fails to stress the role of internal auditors,
speakers at the Institute of Chartered Accountants annual conference in
Eastbourne said yesterday.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's biggest life
assurance company, said Cadbury too readily assumed executive directors were
the enemies of corporate governance, which he found 'disturbing'.
While stressing the importance of corporate governance, he said
institutional investors should not intervene in the day-to-day running of
companies in which they invest, and confine themselves to protecting
shareholders' interests. Non-executive directors were important, but too few
had the independence and experience required to do their job well.
He spoke out against proposals to introduce compulsory rotation of audit
firms, determination of fees other than by the management of a company, and
audits for interim accounts.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, said Cadbury had
sidestepped the issue of requiring companies to report on internal controls.
He said internal auditors had an important role to play in financial
reporting, but required clear statements of responsibility and effective
reporting lines.
Mr Wilson also launched a strong attack on the notion of intangible assets
such as brands on the balance sheet. Brand valuations were clearly
subjective, and the more scope there was for differing accounting treatments
applied to the same facts, the less useful financial reports would become.
Mr Brandon Gough, senior partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said auditors should
consider radically expanding the scope of their work while fighting to
reduce the extent of their liability. He was 'stung' by allegations that
firms had surrendered professional integrity for commercial gain, and
concerned at the costs of litigation against auditors.
Mr Gough said there needed to be a balance between fair penalties and
encouragement to professionals to give an opinion in an independent and fair
way.
