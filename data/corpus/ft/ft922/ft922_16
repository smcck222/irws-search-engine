FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (3): A computer-driven future -
Information Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH characteristic determination and meticulous planning, Singapore has
seized on the computer as a driving force for its future economic
development.
The government believes that advanced information technology should be
applied in liberal doses to everything from education and domestic road
traffic control to international trade, both to improve efficiency within
Singapore and to enhance the island's role as a commercial and service hub
for south-east Asia.
A shortage of skilled workers has given an added impetus to the
computerisation strategy. While the Economic Development Board seeks to
attract high-technology hardware and research and development business to
the country, the National Computer Board (NCB) is charged with promoting the
use of computers, introducing labour-saving software and linking parts of
the public and private sectors into computer networks.
The success of the three-year-old, SDollars 20m TradeNet system for dealing
with trade documentation - one of those ideas which is blindingly obvious
once it comes into being - has encouraged the development of other networks
along similar lines.
Some countries would have been well satisfied with Singapore's previous
ability to process customs and trade documentation in a day or two, but
TradeNet went further. By linking the 20 relevant government departments
with 2,500 importers, shippers and other private-sector companies, the
system has cut approval times to as little as 15 minutes.
About 95 per cent of trade documentation is now processed in this paperless
network, saving the time and money once spent on messengers' journeys from
one government office to another. In some routine cases, no human
intervention is required as the various official approvals are collected by
computer and delivered to the applicant. DHL, meanwhile, has established a
time-saving link with Singapore customs - allowing customs officers to
access the company's electronic manifest and pre-select items for inspection
or payment of duty.
The next step is to link TradeNet internationally, and Singapore is already
discussing the issue with US customs. 'Imports and exports are extremely
information-intensive, and this is critical for us as an international
trading centre,' says Mr Ko Kheng Hwa, NCB general manager, recalling that
trade amounts to more than three times the country's gross national product.
'We can further improve our competitiveness if we make the trading system
more efficient.'
The NCB has also encouraged the use of 'expert systems' to manage ship
movements and cargo handling at Singapore's busy container terminals,
reducing turnaround times and freeing skilled workers for other tasks.
Another of the attractions of Singapore for multinational companies is the
efficiency of its domestic services and its infrastructure and here, too,
computerisation is making its mark.
Within five years, the government hopes to implement a flexible road-pricing
system whereby drivers would be charged for using busy roads by passing an
electronic toll gate - without stopping or slowing down. In the immediate
future, Singaporeans should be able to bid for car permits (vehicle imports
are restricted to prevent congestion) by using existing automated bank
telling machines in the street.
TradeNet has been followed by MediNet, allowing most Singaporeans to receive
approval for medical benefits within hours rather than days. LawNet,
allowing the rapid transfer of legal documents and information about the
courts, is due to follow.
The NCB manages civil service computer operations and says it has reduced
the required number of civil servants by more than 5,000 by pooling
information and improving efficiency. Data about land usage, for example, is
already centralised and the country's schools are linked through the
Education Ministry headquarters. An official audit showed that there were
returns of SDollars 2.71 for every dollar spent on information technology.
Ultimately, NCB officials aim to provide citizens with a 'one-stop, non-stop
government service' for routine documentary requirements.
Asked about the risks of losing the human touch - a common criticism of the
Singaporean vision of the future, not to say the present - NCB officials
acknowledge that the establishment of computer networks is easier in a
country where pervasive state intervention is already accepted as a way of
life. But they also point out that standing in a queue to obtain some dreary
official document is hardly a humanising experience.
The idea of computerisation, Mr Ko says, is not simply to gather or pump out
more information but to free people from routine tasks so they can do
something more useful.
Singapore's small size and excellent telecommunications systems have made it
the ideal testing ground for computerisation, and computers have allowed it
to transcend the island's physical limitations, which restrict more
traditional economic activities such as manufacturing or agriculture.
Singapore, for instance, is now the fifth-largest centre in the world for
foreign exchange trading and it is busy attracting new investments from data
handling businesses such as Reuters.
'Our objective is to create an intelligent island in Singapore,' says Mr Ko,
'where IT (information technology) is used in almost every facet of our
life.' To that end, the NCB co-ordinated a blueprint for the future known as
IT 2000, which aims to increase the number of graduate-level computer
professionals in Singapore to 35,000 by 1999 from the current 13,000.
'Singapore has played the role of a switching centre for goods, and lately
for services, even for people,' says Mr Ko. 'In the next stage we want to be
a switching centre for information and knowledge.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (1): Victim of its own success -
Singapore has become not only a regional economic power but also a country
poised to jump into the very top league of industrialised countries. But
behind the image of achievement and efficiency there are problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINGAPORE is short of labour. It is short of land. But it is not short of
statistics.
Officials quickly deluge the visitor with sets of figures to illustrate that
the island republic, only 573 sq km in area and with a population of less
than 3m, has become not only a regional economic power but also a country
poised to jump into the top league of industrialised countries.
GNP per capita is second only to Japan in Asia. The economy grew by 6.7 per
cent last year and is forecast to grow - even in the midst of a recession in
key western export markets - by between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year.
Singapore's trade is 3 1/2 times GDP. It has no foreign debts and official
foreign reserves of Dollars 35bn.
Singapore is the world's biggest container port and the third-biggest oil
refining centre. It is at the cutting edge of technology in the electronics,
medical equipment and pharmaceuticals industries. It produces more than half
the world's computer disc drives. It is a regional centre for the
shipbuilding industry. Each year more than 5m tourists arrive in Singapore.
More than 3,000 foreign companies have set up operations in Singapore. There
is full employment and more than 70 per cent of the population own their own
apartments or houses. The city state prides itself on its clean and green
image. Most of all it is proud of its efficiency.
All this in a city which in 1960 was described by a travel magazine writer
as being a cesspool of squalor and degradation. 'The Chinese, who constitute
the main current of the city, live in utter filth and poverty' the writer
noted. 'Their poverty is phenomenal. One must see with his own eyes to
believe it.'
There have been changes no less phenomenal over the years. But part the
carefully washed and ironed curtains of Singapore achievement and efficiency
and there are problems.
Mr Goh Chok Tong took over as prime minister from Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore's leader for more than 30 years, in late 1990. The baton change
has not been an entirely smooth one. Mr Goh has found it difficult to escape
from the shadow of Mr Lee. Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong, Mr Lee's son
who is crafted in his father's tough, no-nonsense image, exercises
considerable influence as first deputy prime minister.
The ruling People's Action Party (PAP), still headed by Mr Lee, performed
badly in a general election last August. There are indications that portions
of the Chinese working class, once solidly behind the PAP, feel they have
missed out on Singapore's economic miracle. There are now four opposition
members in the 81-seat parliament - a shocking state of affairs for a
government that has traditionally been loathe to listen to any opposing
voice.
Singapore remains one of the world's most regulated societies. Its politics,
the way its government exercises control over virtually every aspect of
life, is often likened to the now defunct communist regimes of eastern
Europe. The difference is that Singapore works, remains staunchly
anti-communist and has been able to give many of its citizens financial
rewards only dreamt about in eastern Europe.
But the country has become a victim of its own success. Singapore's new
leadership says it is now encouraging people to make their own decisions and
do more for themselves. 'We recognise the government has an overwhelming
presence in the economy and in fact in every sphere of a Singaporean's life'
says the prime minister.
'In recent years we have been trying to shrink the presence of the
government. . . you can see there is uncertainty in people's minds. They
want the government to be there as a safety net or a guiding hand or to do
things for them. . . we are at this stage of development.'
One of the preoccupations of Mr Lee during his last years in power was that
Singaporeans, spoiled by success and an excess of consumer goods, were going
'soft'. Some managers complain that it is difficult to find staff to take
responsibility: too much control has bred a generation who pass decisions
upwards rather than take responsibility themselves. Many of Singapore's
companies - capital rich and with little room to expand at home - have been
pampered by government support and still have to learn to compete
internationally.
Singapore aspires to becoming a regional communications hub - what its
futuristic planners describe as a 'global city'. But the island republic
remains a rather inward-looking society. Its leaders do not take kindly to
criticism from outside. The local media is exceptionally mild mannered while
foreign publications find it difficult to operate under various government
restrictions.
The government stresses that Singapore is an Asian or Oriental society. It
remains suspicious of what it considers to be western influences such as
pornography and divorce. Yet marital breakdown is an everyday reality and
divorce rates have doubled over the past 10 years. When film censorship was
recently relaxed people flocked to see a series of mildly pornographic films
 -not from the west but Chinese films made in Hong Kong.
In the broader regional sphere, Singapore emphasises the interdependence of
the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, (Asean). Says
the first deputy prime minister: 'Our interest is. . . in making Asean a
stronger raft to attach ourselves to.'
It seems Singapore feels that raft is still not entirely stable. It guards
itself against the effects of any regional conflicts by maintaining a highly
sophisticated and well-armed military machine. 'We should be like the poison
shrimp, with bright colours to warn others of the poison we carry,' says a
government policy handbook.
Singapore's economic planners have shown considerable dexterity over the
years in anticipating changes in the global market. Skills have constantly
been upgraded, industries have diversified. Ten years ago, financial
services accounted for only 7 per cent of GDP. According to the Monetary
Authority of Singapore that figure is now 17 per cent. Singapore's
centralised planning and the efficiency of its system has made Singapore top
of the league with many multinational investors.
But economic success has bred serious labour shortages. Singapore has had to
import upwards of a 250,000 foreign workers to work mostly in the lower-paid
sector.
'Job hopping' has become commonplace, particularly in the electronics
sector. Recently, the government disclosed that SDollars 1bn of taxes
remained uncollected - due to a chronic shortage of tax officers.
Home-based skills are not plentiful enough to fill demand. More automation
has been one response, but labour shortages could continue to be a
constraint on growth in the years ahead.
Another constraint is land: Singapore is literally running out of space. It
is therefore giving very energetic backing and financial aid to the
development of nearby Batam island in Indonesia.
Mr Richard Hu, Singapore's finance minister, feels the economy has now
entered a more mature phase of lower but more sustainable growth.
'We are comfortable with a pause,' says Mr Hu. 'We have been growing too
fast over the past three or four years.'
But rising wages at home and greater competition from other countries in the
region pose a problem.
'We are not only competing now against the likes of Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Korea but moving very fast up the ladder are Thailand and Malaysia,' says Mr
Hu.
'More worrying in the long term is the south China area - it is beginning to
nibble at the lower levels of our exports. We have to move upstream as
quickly as possible.'
Singapore's leaders pride themselves on their vision. They have identified
many of the problems that lay ahead.
Even the more pessimistic government forecasts plan on annual economic
growth of well over 5 per cent over the next three years, rising to more
than six per cent annually thereafter.
By an unspecified 'Year X' Singapore plans to increase its area by 17 per
cent through reclamation and landfill.
To cope with labour shortages and the effects of an ageing population,
bigger families are encouraged, particularly among the more educated.
Sceptics might question some of Singapore's aims. But its leaders are
determined. The prime minister says Mr Lee Kuan Yew taught him never to be
afraid to go against the conventional wisdom.
'People may laugh, they may snigger,' says Mr Goh 'But we must carry on. We
know our plans can be effective.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / The new politics of dependency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The notion that governments should seek to mould the behaviour of citizens
is somewhat chilling. It conjures up images of Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World, where the social and genetic conditioning was so absolute that even
the subhuman 'deltas' were perfectly content with their menial lot. Yet this
seems to be the direction in which US social policy is moving. Many poverty
experts argue that the obstacles to self-advancement in the inner city and
elsewhere are internal rather than external: psychological rather than
economic.
Modern society may be moving into a third phase. In the first pre-capitalist
phase, only an aristocratic elite enjoyed high living standards. The
industrial revolution ushered in a second 'progressive' phase during which
the mass of working people improved themselves, partly through the
opportunities created by free markets and partly by pressing successfully
for a host of social reforms, such as government pensions, healthcare and
jobless benefits. In this phase, reformers of all political stripes made a
critical assumption: the poor are no different from anybody else and will
respond readily to market incentives and government programmes.
Yet entrenched poverty in an economy as wealthy and open as the US perhaps
indicates the start of a third social phase. Here, the bulk of the
population lives comfortably because obstacles to personal advancement,
while real, are minor by historical standards. However, a significant
minority - most visible as a disaffected urban underclass - is dependent:
either unable or unwilling to grasp new opportunities. Poverty experts see
policies aimed explicitly at changing behaviour as the only way to energise
the passive, non-working poor and hence propel them into the social
mainstream.
Mr Lawrence Mead, an academic at New York University, is one of the most
articulate exponents of such theories, known as 'the new paternalism'. In a
recently published book*, he argues that conventional social policies fail
because they take for granted people's competence to respond positively to
incentives. By competence, he means all the qualities that allow a person to
get ahead economically - not only intelligence but foresight, energy,
discipline, and the ability to sacrifice for the future. He believes the
challenge is no longer to alter the economic or social structure of society,
but to change the personal psychology of dysfunctional adults.
Controversially, Mr Mead blames poverty squarely on lack of work effort, not
low wages. If the poor worked as hard as the middle classes they would not
be poor. On his figures, only 16 per cent of the heads of poor families work
full-time; less than half work at all. The top fifth of the income
distribution works seven times as many hours as the bottom fifth. He claims
that most barriers to work are largely imaginary: there are still plenty of
unskilled jobs; most women can arrange childcare quite cheaply; welfare
benefits are too low to provide a rational alternative to employment. The
problems lie mainly in people's heads.
It is not that the poor are social rebels. Surveys indicate that welfare
claimants share the same values as the rest of society: for example, they
affirm the importance of steady employment and law and order. On many social
issues, the poor are actually more conservative than the better off: 'They
value external controls on behaviour exactly because their internal controls
are less secure.' For Mr Mead, the core problem is that the poor have
difficulty organising their lives and responding constructively to the
opportunities that do exist. They are 'dutiful but defeated', unable to put
good intentions into practice.
The solution is not more incentives or opportunities but - horror of horrors
 -enforcement. Mr Mead strongly supports workfare, or policies that make
welfare benefits conditional on work or training. Mandatory requirements are
necessary to 'overcome the defeatism of the clients, to engage their own
energies in the quest for employment'. He claims that workfare is much less
resented by the poor than intellectuals suspect, mainly because the aim is
to enforce values that clients already possess. Indeed, some clients are
gratified to be chased up by officials because it indicates an interest in
their lives. The main purpose is not to force people unwillingly into jobs
but to ensure they organise themselves for regular activity outside the
home. 'Authority thus operates as the midwife, not the antithesis, of
freedom,' he claims.
New paternalism is still a sideshow. But as states implement the 1988 Family
Support Act, workfare requirements will become more common. It is likely to
mark the beginning of a new trend, in which government agencies demand
rather than merely encourage changes in behaviour.
The reliance on authority leaves a sour taste. But market liberals who put
freedom first should remember how much their philosophy takes for granted.
Those who flourish under capitalism have usually been subject to heavy
psychological moulding during childhood, both at school and in the home.
They have been trained to respond to the right incentives. The new
paternalists are no more authoritarian: they merely want to tackle
dependency by providing a little extra training for those who missed out in
childhood.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Exhibitor of good connections - Richard
Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the wall of Mr Richard Breeden's office in Washington DC, the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission has hung various photographs of
himself in the company of President George Bush: conferring intently over a
meal; at a black tie gathering; and so on.
Nothing unusual in that, you may think: offices the world over are hung with
vanity pictures of their occupants consorting with the rich, powerful or
famous.
Yes, but . . . this is just the beginning. Amid the blinking computer
terminals and clocks showing the time around the globe, a good part of the
wall space in the SEC chairman's office is devoted to images of Mr Bush,
with or without Mr Breeden. Here is the president playing a homely game of
horseshoes; there he is looking windswept and nautical; and here he is being
sworn in to office. Several photos are the size of oil paintings.
Mr Breeden's admiration for Mr Bush is hardly surprising: he was plucked to
head the SEC from within the Bush White House and served on Mr Bush's
vice-presidental staff in the early 1980s.
But the display also sends a forceful message, intentional or not, that Mr
Breeden has good connections in the most important domestic residence in the
land. And for an SEC chairman, that is a position unusually close to the
centre of power - bringing both advantages and disadvantages.
The connections were no doubt helpful back in 1989 when, at the age of 39
and with no direct experience of working inside a securities company, Mr
Breeden was named to head the SEC, the government agency that oversees Wall
Street.
In the two and a half years since then, he has stamped his own mark clearly
on the commission, through an energetic spate of regulatory initiatives.
These have been widely praised, but have also prompted accusations of
ruthless empire-building from other parts of the Washington bureaucracy.
The past week and a half have produced a particular flurry of activity: Mr
Breeden has unveiled proposals for the first significant shake-up of the
fast-growing US mutual fund industry in half a century - a package that
could, among other things, make it easier for foreign funds to offer their
products in America.
Wearing his hat as 'Wall Street's top cop', he has also announced swingeing
fines and restitution, totalling Dollars 290m, which Salomon Brothers will
have to pay because of its breach last year of Treasury bond auction rules.
The events highlight two of the most important features of the Breeden
regime. One is a series of moves to rid the securities industry of needless
regulation and encourage financial innovation.
Sipping from a coffee mug bearing an 'Office of the Vice-President' seal, Mr
Breeden says: 'I have sought to promote in as many ways as possible better
opportunities to raise capital at lower cost and to identify and remove
artificial barriers . . . to the use of security markets for primary capital
raising.'
He speaks in a rather formal, guarded manner, like an ambassador on parade,
and displays nothing of his reputation for abrasive and overbearing
behaviour.
Another feature of the Breeden SEC is its toughness in enforcing the
rulebook, following the wild financial excesses of the 1980s. The Salomon
settlement, for example, was higher than Wall Street had been expecting.
It was Mr Breeden who wrote an unusually blunt letter in 1990 to the judge
sentencing Mr Michael Milken, the former junk bond king, for securities
crimes, arguing that he deserved a 'substantial term of incarceration'. Mr
Breeden says he thinks any other SEC chairman would have done the same, but
adds: 'I have a very strong personal view that just because crime is
committed by someone who is dressed more nicely, it does not justify turning
your back on it.'
A securities lawyer by background, who dresses in the conservative,
pin-striped manner of his ilk, Mr Breeden made his name in Washington as
President Bush's top aide in the bail-out of the savings and loans industry.
In what was arguably the worst scandal of the 1980s, large parts of the
sector were made insolvent by crookery and crazy lending practices. The
federal government, which insures deposits placed with the S&amp;Ls, as it does
with US banks, had to pick up the tab.
Mr Breeden says the principal culprit of both the S&amp;L disaster and the
current weakness of the US banking system is this deposit insurance system:
'I do not believe in asking the taxpayers of the US to stand behind every
dumb decision made by a lending officer. That ought to be the bank's and the
shareholders' responsibility.'
He points out that there is no such safety net for the US securities
industry, which remains a world leader in both size and innovative
techniques. Market disciplines, he says, are stronger and more omnipresent
than any number of rule-setting bureaucrats and bank examiners. 'Markets
don't go to sleep.'
The US securities markets have, however, been displaying a tendency to
fragment, with the once dominant New York Stock Exchange giving up more and
more of the pie to electronic dealer-driven markets or computerised,
intermediary free networks. Despite the protestations of the New York
exchange, Mr Breeden's SEC has given a host of innovative high-tech trading
systems the regulatory green light.
He is involved in another public dispute with the New York exchange, which
wants the SEC to relax its strict financial disclosure requirements for
foreign companies in the hope this will encourage more of them to list in
the US.
Mr Breeden says he is anxious to make the US securities market more
accessible to foreign companies, and hints that there is a little room for
manoeuvre on disclosure requirements with the New York exchange. But he
rejects the argument that 'if a given regulatory system is good enough for
some country it ought to be good enough for the US. That's just a race to
the bottom. That's what we would call competition in laxity.'
Much of the argument centres on German companies, which have a radically
different accounting system from the US, and one, says Mr Breeden, which
'denies the basic proposition that public investors have a right to know how
the company is doing'.
US investors, he says, must be given an 'information bridge' which enables
them to compare the performance of US and foreign companies.
He finds it strange that Volvo of Sweden, Honda of Japan and Fiat of Italy,
all of which have American listings, can comply with the US standards 'yet
we're told we have to throw our whole system out of the window to
accommodate Mercedes-Benz. Well, that is not likely to happen.'
His achievements in putting more muscle into the SEC have led him into
clashes with other regulatory agencies - for example, with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (over who should regulate stock index futures)
and the Federal Reserve (over bank accounting methods). Such fights are only
natural in an era where financial markets are converging and, therefore, so
are the bureaucracies that police them.
More serious are accusations, including some from current and former SEC
commissioners, that Mr Breeden has recently been politicising the
institution - which has always been carefully aloof from the party fray - by
tilting policies towards the White House line. His critics paint a portrait
of a man consumed by political ambition, aiming for a seat in the cabinet.
Mr Breeden has repeatedly denied compromising the agency's independence,
while the 'politically ambitious' label infuriates him. He would prefer to
be seen as a lawyer from the private sector doing his bit of public service.
But it is easy to see how such ideas multiply when you have the president of
the United States as an office pin-up. And in any case, what is so bad about
ambition?

FT  01 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Testing times for
Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar is likely to come under further pressure this week after last
week's downward shift. Wide interest rate differentials with Europe, and
continued confusing signals about US economic recovery may hinder its
progress.
Consumer confidence shot up in May, but M2 growth fell short of the Federal
Reserve's target range. Attention this week will focus on non-farm payroll
data for May and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index.
Economists are forecasting that around 103,000 new jobs were created in May,
less than in April but greater than the average number of jobs created per
month since the second quarter of last year.
After the Bank of Japan's aggressive buying of the Yen last week, traders
said they would be watching closely to see how firm the Japanese currency
goes over the next few weeks. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank
Corporation expects to see the Yen hit 124 against the dollar.
'The Bank of Japan appears to be sending a message loud and clear that it
would like to see a stronger yen,' he said.
According to Mr Gerard Lyons at DKB International, the Japanese Bank,
trading partners have been pressurising Japan to reduce the size of its
trade surplus. At the last G7 meeting in Washington the weakness of the yen
was singled out as a hindrance. The Japanese government's apparent desire to
strengthen the yen has probably been spurred by the prospect of the World
Economic Summit in Munich next month.
Tomorrow the Danes go to the polls in a referendum on whether Denmark should
ratify the Maastricht treaty on Emu. Traders said the result was enough in
doubt to keep the EMS currencies on edge.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Floating-rate sector stirs after
dormant two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL of the dollar floating-rate note market gathered momentum last
week, with two more banks - Instituto Bancario San Paulo di Torino and Banco
di Roma - raising funds in the international bond market.
Other financial institutions which issued in May included Banesto, SBAB,
Credit Lyonnais, Sumitomo Bank, Citicorp, and the World Bank.
Together with a handful of issues earlier in the year, the deals suggest
that the FRN market is spluttering into life after two years of dormancy.
The FRN market is a natural source of wholesale funding for banks and, in
the late 1980s, it provided a ready supply of cash.
Bank treasurers usually prefer to take floating-rate funding as a matter of
prudent balance sheet management: floating-rate liabilities linked to
interbank interest rates are a good match for assets, since most loans are
also Libor-linked.
However, during 1990 and 1991 the FRN market dried up. As most of the large
economies moved into recession, interest rates were cut.
In this environment, few institutional investors wanted to hold
floating-rate paper and take a diminishing return.
Banks themselves, keen buyers of FRNs in the 1980s to use additional lending
capacity, came under pressure to shrink balance sheets to meet strict
capital-to-assets ratios. Liquid floating-rate securities were easy to dump
into the market.
Moreover, recession and loan losses led to a deterioration in the credit
quality of most international banks. Investors demanded a higher return from
bank FRNs and wider margins over interbank rates.
There are signs that these conditions are now reversing. Although US
interest rates may be cut again to stimulate a sluggish economy, six-month
dollar Libor - the reference rate for most dollar FRNs - may not fall far
below the current 4.25 per cent before rising again.
In this environment, there are good arguments for fund managers buying
floating-rate instruments as a natural hedge against higher interest rates
in the future.
While banks remain under pressure to meet the capital adequacy ratios, the
pressure to shrink balance sheets has passed.
Meanwhile, demand for loan finance in most economies remains very subdued.
Buying FRNs is again seen as a way of using up any excess balance-sheet
capacity.
In this respect, the Basle Accord on capital adequacy actually legislates in
favour of bank FRNs: they carry only a 20 per cent risk weighting, against
100 per cent for loans to companies.
Hence a bank must set aside five times more capital against holdings of
fixed-rate corporate bonds than against FRNs issued by another bank.
Meanwhile, the credit quality of least, stabilised. Institutional investors
are more willing buyers of paper issued by banks, whether fixed- or
floating-rate.
Little surprise that the first US bank into the Eurodollar FRN market this
year was Bank of America - one of the few banks to have been upgraded by
credit rating agencies last year.
The bank's Dollars 200m issue launched in February was its first since 1987.
Even for an improving credit, the cost of funds has risen sharply since the
1980s. In 1985, BankAmerica raised Dollars 400m 12-year funding at 6.25
basis points over three-month Libor. This year it paid 37.5 basis points
over Libor for five-year funding.
When demand for FRNs was subdued, banks and other borrowers could achieve
better funding rates by issuing fixed-rate debt and arranging an interest
rate swap to achieve a floating-rate liability.
However, swap rates have deteriorated sharply over the past five years.
Issuing fixed-rate bonds to achieve a floating-rate liability has become
more and more costly.
Certainly, all the banks which issued FRNs last month found it cheaper to
pay the margin over Libor demanded by investors - even at new wider levels -
than issue fixed-rate bonds and then arrange a swap.
If swap rates continue to tighten, borrowers other than banks may find the
FRN market a cheaper source of floating-rate funds than the straight bond
market.

FT  01 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Success of future funding in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has every reason to feel satisfied with the way the
funding programme has proceeded so far in the 1992-93 financial year. Since
the Conservatives won the general election, the Bank has sold about Pounds
11bn of gilts, achieving more than a third of the government's estimated
funding requirement.
However, against this success, some market participants are starting to
wonder whether the Bank's luck will hold, or whether the job of issuing
substantial amounts of gilts will prove tough in future.
As one UK fund manager put it: 'The funding which has been accomplished so
far has been achieved against an unprecedented background - we've seen a
Conservative victory, a commitment to the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and
low inflation. It's been very easy for the Bank to sell gilts in that sort
of environment. The big question is to what extent the UK institutions want
to continue stocking up with UK government bonds.'
While few of the big UK fund managers are prepared to go on the record, many
of those questioned about their portfolios admit they have increased their
gilt allocations since the run-up to the election.
One manager at a US fund management group said his group's exposure to the
gilt market had trebled since just before the April election - from 4 per
cent to 12 per cent of total portfolio.
Another manager at one of the big UK fund management groups said his firm
was a heavy buyer of gilts in February and March, and it had raised the
proportion of its portfolio held in gilts from zero to 4 per cent.
'Our reasoning was that the gilts market had started to get very worked up
about the possible consequences of a Labour government, despite the fact
that Labour repeatedly stressed its commitment to the ERM. We found there
was good value to be had in gilts, but we've started to reduce our holdings
slightly now because everyone believes that inflation isn't a problem any
more.'
Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, says his group has
increased the proportion of its global bond portfolio held in gilts from 5
per cent to 10 per cent. However he adds that the balanced portfolios -
those invested in a mix of bonds and equities - have kept their gilt
holdings at a fairly constant level.
If one looks back to the 1970s, the average UK pension fund kept about
one-third of its funds invested in gilts. However, during the 1980s, fund
managers increased the proportion of their funds invested in equities in
order to achieve long-term capital growth: the proportion of portfolios
invested in fixed income instruments - gilts and foreign government bonds -
fell from 24 per cent in 1980 to 7 per cent in 1989, but increased slightly
to 9 per cent last year, with roughly half of that in gilts.
'The bond culture has definitely declined in the UK and it could take time
before fund managers really do increase their fixed-income holdings
further,' says Mr Henderson.
Few UK fund managers seem inclined to raise their gilt holdings much above
10 per cent, and some baulk at moving above 6 per cent. If demand from them
for gilts really has peaked, then the Bank may have to rely increasingly on
overseas investors to buy up its stocks.

FT  01 JUN 92 / European Bonds: Focus on Danish treaty referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTENTION in the European government bond markets will focus on this week's
Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
Although the referendum is tomorrow, the results will not been known until
Wednesday. As it is seen as one of the biggest potential obstacles to the
ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, a vote in favour would set an
important precedent for the other member countries, which must decide on
whether to ratify the treaty.
Opinion polls over the last few weeks have shown a slight majority for the
'no' votes; as a result the yields on Danish government bonds widened
against those on German paper.
However, an opinion poll on Tuesday showing a swing in favour of Maastricht
for the first time in nearly a month prompted a sharp rally in the Danish
bond market on Wednesday. The rally came in a week when various holidays
kept the other European government bond markets quiet. A Gallup poll on
Friday showed an even stronger swing.
If Denmark votes in favour of Maastricht on Tuesday it will pave the way for
Danish yield convergence, and Danish government bond yield spreads over
German bunds would start to narrow again.
S. G. Warburg points out that 10-year yield spreads could narrow by a
further 20 basis points. It says a 'yes' vote in Denmark would probably be
'a major signal to start building up exposure in Sweden and Finland', the
two Nordic neighbours which have applied to join the EC.
The Anglo-Saxon government bond markets showed the best returns in local
currency terms last month, according to Kemper Investment Management. Canada
was the top-performing market, reporting a 3.23 per cent increase, followed
by the US and the UK with gains of 2.27 per cent and 2.23 per cent
respectively.
For dollar-based investors, Japan showed the highest return, with a rise of
5.41 per cent last month.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Japanese Bonds: Concern mounts over trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT fluctuations in the Japanese government bond market have been
extensive, dominated by external factors such as movements in the dollar-yen
exchange rate and speculation over monetary easing in the US.
A month ago the yield on the 129 10-year benchmark bond stood at 5.68 per
cent; at the end of April it had risen to 5.75 per cent; on Friday it closed
at 5.47 per cent.
Concern is mounting over the ballooning current account and trade surplus.
For the fiscal year ended last March, the current account surplus surged 167
per cent to a record Dollars 90bn, while the trade surplus reached a record
Dollars 113bn.
To show their commitment to reducing the surpluses, Japanese authorities are
determined to keep the yen under Y130 against the dollar, ahead of this
month's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers. Japan is under
greater pressure from the US and Europe to stimulate slowing consumer demand
to decrease exports and increase imports. Investors reckon an easing of
credit in the US will give the Bank of Japan more room to lower interest
rates.
The short-term focus of the bond market will be next week's announcement of
the tankan, or the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment.
According to a survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
last month, 78 per cent of businesses perceived conditions as bad, while
only 2.9 per cent thought they were favourable.
First-quarter GNP figures, to be announced later this month, will also give
some indication of where the economy is heading. Mr Robert Feldman at
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo says weak business investment and construction
figures could depress economic growth to an annualised 1 per cent.
While expectations of weak growth and low business sentiment present the
central bank with good reason to lower rates, concerns of oversupply due to
large issues on the corporate bond market are likely to limit decline in
yields of long-term bonds.
With equity-linked financing at a halt due to the weakness of the equity
market, and a squeeze on banks' capital-adequacy ratios curbing lending,
more and more Japanese companies are dipping into the straight bond market
for funds.
Domestic and overseas corporate bond markets have become alternative
financing sources for Japanese companies, which face redemptions of
equity-linked bonds issued during the stock market boom, and those pressed
for capital investment funds.

INTEGRO, the European arm of a group of investors which controls Investec
Bank of South Africa, has acquired a small Dutch stockbroking firm, Th.
Wouters en Zoon. The deal marks its second acquisition in the Netherlands'
financial community since the late 1980s.
Wouters, which has a staff of five, is to be integrated next year with
Heerze, another small Amsterdam stockbroking firm acquired by Integro in
1989.
Terms of the latest deal were not disclosed.
Wouters' client list includes private as well as institutional investors.
Heerze, which has a staff of six, concentrates mainly on European
institutional investors.
The two stockbroking firms will retain their separate identities for the
rest of this year before being integrated during 1993.
Integro's next priority for European expansion is Frankfurt, where it is
particularly interested in the options and futures markets, according to Mr
Ian Kantor, Integro's chief executive director and single biggest
shareholder, with 25 per cent of the group's shares.
Integro already has offices in Geneva, Zurich and London, where its
activities include the trading of German bunds.
In South Africa, the group has a controlling interest in Investec Bank, an
investment bank, as well as in two other Johannesburg-listed companies,
Investec Holdings and Intrust.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: US faces up to the realities of
oversupply - O&amp;Y's woes have spoiled dreams of property sector recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until quite recently, the US commercial property market thought it had seen
the worst. Prices in some areas of the country had begun to stabilise and it
was even agreed that values had probably bottomed out in the long-suffering
north-east.
Then came Olympia &amp; York. The placing of the company's Canary Wharf
development into administration in the UK has sent a shiver through the US
market. Suddenly fund managers, investors, bankers, bondholders, lawyers and
property executives have had to contemplate a scenario in which the
Reichmanns decide to file for the bankruptcy protection of all or part of
their US property empire.
Some participants in the O&amp;Y restructuring think it inevitable that the
Reichmanns will eventually make a US filing. And several O&amp;Y creditors - and
not only banks - are already understood to be seeking ways in which they can
attach themselves to the company's US assets.
One adviser to a big O&amp;Y bank creditor says that over the next six months US
creditors may face a request from the company for fresh cash - needed to
make repairs and improvements on some of the 23m sq ft of New York office
space.
The possible sale - now being negotiated - of a 34-storey property on Park
Avenue may generate cash in the short term, but probably not enough. Other
New York disposals could follow.
What everyone agrees is that O&amp;Y filing or not, the US market has received a
psychological body blow.
David Shulmann, a commercial property specialist at Salomon Brothers in New
York, predicts that O&amp;Y's troubles will affect capital values and the
confidence of investors. 'If the Reichmanns, who are widely regarded as
geniuses in real estate, can't make money, then investors will shy away from
the market.'
However Mr Shulmann and others in New York argue that even if O&amp;Y did not
exist, the outlook for the US commercial property market would still be
fairly bleak.
In a study just published, the Salomon property team surimportant urban US
office markets and found 540m sq ft of 2.7bn sq ft vacant, making for a
national average vacancy rate of 19.8 per cent. Based on a forecast of
vacant space being absorbed at the rate of about 32m sq ft a year, Salomon
says the market currently faces a 12-year supply of space.
Most property insiders say values are now down by 30 to 50 per cent from
peak levels of five years ago. The recent purchase by Bertelsmann of Germany
of a Manhattan office block is seen as an indicator of current price levels
 -the German media and entertainment group paid a price equal to 50 per cent
of the building's 1990 construction cost.
Mr Arthur Mirante, chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the biggest commercial
property manager in the US, says he does not think a further drop in values
is likely. However he says he has never in his career seen a national
vacancy rate so high.
Other property executives agree the present slump is far worse than the last
big US property downturn in the mid-1970s, which was more a correction of a
long-running bull market by comparison.
Mr Mirante says the rate of jobs growth is a key measure of recovery
prospects; he complains that redundancies at many US companies are 'keeping
vacancy rates high and markets from improving'. He calls O&amp;Y's troubles
'another negative for real estate as an investment'.
Mr Alvin Dworman, a banker and property investor who manages a multi-billion
dollar US property portfolio, calls the oversupply of US office space
'gigantic'. He notes that markets in northern California and parts of the
Midwest are holding up reasonably well, and that regions such as Texas and
Colorado are already recovering from the worst.
But, he says, the north-east is still 'on a slight slide'. He terms downtown
Manhattan as 'really very bad'.
The recovering fortunes of several big US commercial banks, meanwhile,
remain intertwined with the commercial property market. Where it seemed, at
the start of 1992, that the banks had made enough bad debt provisions, the
latest forecasts from analysts such as Standard &amp; Poor's suggest many banks
have not set aside enough reserves.
Last week S&amp;P claimed the overhang of property loan losses 'will continue to
be a significant drain on industry earnings over the next few years'.
The consensus in the US is thus that O&amp;Y's troubles can only worsen an
already gloomy outlook.
The market, as Salomon Brothers puts it, 'is so deep in the hole of
oversupply that it will take many years to climb out'.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Weak demand hits steelmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S FIVE largest steelmakers reported lower pre-tax profits for fiscal
1991 because of weak demand and higher productions costs. They expect a
further decline in earnings this year.
Several companies have been trying to reduce dependence on steel by
diversifying into other areas. This strategy has so far not increased
profitability, but instead depressed earnings as interest costs climb due to
increased capital spending.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest producer, had a 37.7 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits, to Y100.2bn (Dollars 773.74m), due to decline in steel
sales. But a 21.7 per cent growth in its engineering business lifted total
sales 0.8 per cent to Y2,629bn.
Its net profit increased 24.9 per cent to Y83.7bn due to the sale of fixed
assets.
A cut in steel production will lift sales in fiscal 1992 to Y2,500bn, while
pre-tax profits will tumble to Y55bn.
Kawasaki Steel blamed rising operating costs and sluggish sales for its 46.5
per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y43.1bn. Earnings were also harmed by
heavier interest payments for capital spending connected with the overhaul
of steel facilities.
A domestic price increase had little impact on sales, which grew only 1.9
per cent to 1,208bn, because of weak demand for steel products.
NKK said lower domestic demand and a higher interest burden were responsible
for its 25.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y37.5bn. But net profit
climbed 53.8 per cent to Y35.8bn due to the sale of land.
Pre-tax earnings for fiscal 1992 are expected to fall to Y20bn, reflecting
stagnant demand and a rise in interest costs as NKK almost doubles
investment spending to Y218.4bn.
NKK is streamlining its steel and steel-building businesses, while
diversifying into new areas, such as electronics and chemicals.
Sumitomo Metal Industries said increased sales from non-steel activities
failed to prevent a 45 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y40.4bn.
A dip in steel revenues to Y990.7bn, combined with higher operating costs,
caused the profit decline.
Sumitomo expects the costs of its merger with Nippon Stainless Steel in
October to nearly halve pre-tax profits to Y20bn for fiscal 1992.
Kobe Steel said losses on securities holdings, as well as increasing
operating costs, meant a 15.5 per cent drop in pre-tax earnings, to Y47.7bn.
Net profit climbed 24.7 per cent to Y29.2bn due to the sale of land.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: SEC to ease rules for
asset-backed offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US companies may soon find it easier to issue asset-backed securities under
a rule change proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the
US securities industry watchdog.
The SEC plans to ease regulations for asset-backed securities offerings by
exempting issuers of the debt from provisions of the Investment Company Act,
which regulates mutual funds in the US.
The SEC's latest proposal is part of its more general review of the 1940
act, which covers investment management regulation in the US. The SEC has
been considering overhauling the rules governing the mutual fund industry
for about two years.
Although the number of asset-backed offerings has risen sharply recently,
the SEC believes the development of some types of asset-backed deals has
been constrained by a requirement that the offerings be registered as mutual
funds.
The latest proposal, which has been put out for public comment for 60 days,
would free asset-backed offerings that meet some criteria from the SEC's
mutual-fund rules. One of the requirements is that the securities receive
above investment-grade ratings by at least two rating agencies.
At present, the three largest types of asset-backed offerings - auto
loan-backed, mortgage-backed and some credit card receivables - are already
exempt from the mutual fund rules.

expenses climb

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company for Italy's second
biggest private-sector industrial group, suffered a sharp drop in net
attributable profits, to L115bn (Dollars 93.8m) for 1991, against L248bn the
previous year.
The decline, on the back of a 6.3 per cent rise in sales to L17,790bn, stems
from a mixture of heavy debt costs, ambitious investments, and the
non-recurrance of the extraordinary items which enhanced earnings in 1990.
Ferfin reaped substantial capital gains in 1990, principally from the sale
by its Montedison subsidiary of its 40 per cent stake in the public-private
Enimont chemicals joint venture. Asset sales in 1991 were more limited,
despite the group's goal of concentrating on core sectors such as chemicals,
agro-industrial and energy.
Gross operating profits rose 11.2 per cent to L1,962bn, despite lower
margins for polymers, owing to lower demand from big industrial users.
The group balance sheet weakened further, with a rise in net debt to
L8,198bn from L6,665bn in 1990 and a debt equity ratio down to 0.88 from
0.76. To broaden its funding sources, Montedison recently announced plans
for a domestic bond issue of up to L500bn.
Investment spending remained high at L1,156bn, although a small fall from
L1,397bn in 1990 reflected the gradual completion of a heavy spending phase,
the company said.
The dividend will remain unchanged at L45 for ordinary shares, and L75 for
savings stock, despite the declining trend in earnings, which have now
fallen for three years in a row.
Ferfin made a characteristically upbeat forecast for the current year. Sales
in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to L4,420bn, while the gross operating
margin climbed 7.5 per cent, thanks especially to a strong performance in
pharmaceuticals.
Among steps being taken to improve earnings is the merger of Montedison's
Eridania and Beghin Say sugar subsidiaries, formally approved last week. The
deal should push up profits by around L60bn a year.
However, plans for the possible flotation of the group's interests in the
financial services sector, put together in the SIFI subsidiary, appear to
have been put on hold because of the depressed state of the Italian equity
market.
The influential Parisian banker, Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, 69, has announced he
is to retire at the end of the year as chairman of Beghin-Say, the French
sugar group controlled by Ferruzzi, writes Will Dawkins from Paris.
Mr Vernes helped engineer the merger of two French sugar groups to form
Beghin-Say in 1972. He became chairman five years later and fostered
increasingly close links with the Italian group throughout the 1980s.

structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Greece Fund, a closed-end investment company listed on the
London Stock Exchange, is proposing to amend the fund's structure following
complaints that the shares were trading at a large discount to net asset
value and were illiquid, writes Sara Webb.
The board will seek shareholder approval for the Greece Fund - managed by
Schroder Investment Management - to be turned into an open-ended investment
company, and will allow investors to redeem their shares at the net asset
value.
The fund's board has agreed to allow limited redemption of the shares. 'In
view of the fact that trading on the Athens stock exchange is still
relatively illiquid by international standards, the board believes it
necessary at this stage for the redemption right to be restricted  .. to
once each quarter', it said in a statement.
Up to 25 per cent of the issued shares can be redeemed in the quarter after
the new proposals are implemented, and a further 5 per cent of the shares
may be redeemed in each subsequent quarter.
Schroder Investment Management said that it was unclear whether the fund
would be allowed to retain its London listing once it became an open-ended
fund. However, the fund is seeking an alternative listing on the Irish Stock
Exchange in case it is forced to give up its London listing.
The board said it would move the central management and control of the
Greece Fund from the UK to Jersey.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Arco's 17.5% Wytch Farm stake up
for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 17.5 per cent stake in the Wytch Farm oil field owned by Atlantic
Richfield (Arco), the US oil group, is to be offered for sale.
It could fetch between Pounds 180m and Pounds 200m, according to oil
analysts.
Dorset-based Wytch Farm is the UK's largest onshore oil field, producing
around 60,000 barrels of oil a day.
The sale of the Arco stake will be carried out by Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank.
Other stakes in Wytch Farm are held by BP (50 per cent), Premier
Consolidated (12.5 per cent), Clyde Petroleum (7.5 per cent) and Purbeck
Petroleum (7.5 per cent).
Purbeck Petroleum was set up by a syndicate of banks last year to manage
some of the assets of Kelt Energy, the oil group which ran into severe
problems in financing its debts.
Kelt is believed in trade circles to have turned down a bid of Pounds 80m
for its 7.5 per cent stake in Wytch Farm in 1991.
Arco inherited its 17.5 per cent stake in Wytch Farm following its takeover
of Tricentrol in 1988, during a period of intense takeover activity in the
UK oil industry.
Arco had originally targeted Britoil, but lost out in the battle for control
of the latter to BP.
There was speculation yesterday that British Gas may be interested in
acquiring Arco's Wytch Farm stake. British Gas discovered Wytch Farm in
partnership with BP, with each holding a 50 per cent stake in the oil field.
However, British Gas was forced by the Government to sell its holding in the
late 1980s.
Arco is also putting up for sale other of its European oil and gas assets,
including its interests in the Amethyst and 'V' fields in the North Sea.
The US group is embarking on a plan to reduce its capital spending by 20 per
cent over the next five years.

dispute

<TEXT>
AN ATTACK by British Petroleum on the accounts of one of Spain's biggest
banks, Banesto, failed to materialise at a shareholders meeting in Madrid on
Saturday, leading to speculation that a row between the two would soon be
resolved.
The differences between the two companies, leading to several sharp
exchanges, centre on a 2.6 per cent stake in Banesto held by BP which the UK
oil group claims Banesto should repurchase. BP has had the stock since it
bought Banesto's oil refiner, Petromed, last year. At the time Petromed held
the 2.6 per cent of its parent and BP thought it was understood Banesto
would buy this stake back.
But Banesto, due to falling profits at the Corporacion, has been loathe to
do so, especially as BP has been trying to ensure it paid something similar
to the price the stock was worth when the Petromed sale was completed. Since
then, Banesto stock has fallen about 30 per cent.
Mr Conde announced consolidated group net profits - including the
Corporacion - of Pta52.3bn for 1991 (Dollars 523m) , a 7.29 per cent fall on
1990. This was largely due to the Corporacion profits falling from Pta18.9bn
to just Pta3.8bn.
At Banesto bank, 1991 net profits rose 14.3 per cent to Pta45.6bn and its
financial group (Banesto and affiliated banks) where pre-tax profits
increased 25.7 per cent to Pta74.8bn.

mixed results

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S three long-term credit banks report that increases in profits from
lending operations in the year to end-March, were offset by declines in
profits from securities investments and by increased bad debt provisions.
Pre-tax parent company results were mixed. At the Industrial Bank of Japan,
unconsolidated pre-tax profits fell 2.9 per cent to Y129.1bn (Dollars 1bn).
Long Term Credit Bank reported a 7.9 per cent increase to Y101.3bn and
Nippon Credit Bank saw a 35.2 per cent rise to Y70.6bn.
Profits from lending operations were boosted by the declines in Japanese and
overseas interest rates which allowed the banks to widen lending margins.
They also tried to increase loans to high-margin borrowers and to companies
willing to pay fees for non-loan services.
At IBJ, net business profits, a measure of profits from lending operations,
rose 76 per cent to Y160.2bn.
LTCB reported a 39.7 per cent rise to Y78.0bn. NCB saw net business profits
soar 180 cent to Y54bn.
These increases are much larger than those recorded earlier this week by
Japanese commercial banks because long-term credit banks make long-term
loans and so benefit from falling interest rates since their fund-raising
costs fall faster than rates charged to borrowers. These large profit
increases offset declines in financial investment income caused by the
weakness in the Tokyo stock market.
All three banks suffered losses on the values of their stock portfolios. By
restraining growth in assets, the three banks managed to keep their ratios
of capital to assets above the 8 per cent minimum which the Bank for
International Settlements will bring into effect next March. IBJ posted a
ratio of 8.33 per cent, LTCB 8.27 per cent and NCB 8.32 per cent.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Mirror Group appoints Rowe &amp;
Pitman as lead broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers has appointed Rowe &amp; Pitman, part of the SG Warburg
group, as its lead broker in place of Smith New Court ahead of a planned
re-listing of the newspaper group on the London Stock Exchange later this
month.
The appointment, which was confirmed yesterday, weakens a link with the
newspaper empire of the late Robert Maxwell that went back to Smith's
involvement in MGN's Pounds 245m flotation in May 1991.
Sir Michael Richardson, the chairman of Smith New Court, whose close
personal contacts with Mr Maxwell brought the business to Smiths is also
vice-chairman of Rothschilds, the merchant bank advising the Maxwell family
in negotiations with its bankers.
Smith New Court was asked to remain as a joint broker but MGN wanted a fresh
start with new advisers.
MGN was suspended in December at 125p, leaving administrators to Mr
Maxwell's private interests with a controlling 51 per cent stake in the
newspaper group.
The stake is effectively owned by banks such as Midland and National
Westminster because they were pledged as collateral to cover Maxwell debt.
'Advisers are now looking at nursemaid crisis management for the next phase
of bringing MGN to re-listing,' a MGN source said.
Their first task will be to protect shareholders from a potential share
price collapse on re-listing, given that at least Pounds 150m stolen from
Mirror pension funds will have to be replaced and Pounds 100m is missing
from the company.
In the next three weeks MGN's preliminary accounts for 1991, an annual
report and re-listing particulars will be prepared.
Advisers will then begin the not insubstantial task of convincing existing
shareholders that MGN is strong enough to attempt to trade out of its
problems.
Mr John Talbot, the administrator of Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests,
said in January that there would be no early sale of the stake and that
consideration would be given to a sale 'when comprehensive information is
available from the board'.
Shortly thereafter three groups independently ruled out buying MGN. They
were Mercury Asset Management, the venture capital arm of SG Warburg,
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times and Mr Tiny Rowland's Lonrho
group, publisher of The Observer. See Lex

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hunter Saphir down 10% excluding
claim money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTER SAPHIR, the fresh produce, herbs and spice group, suffered a 48 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.5m last year due to the absence of
insurance payments for losses arising from a fire at the company's main
spice factory.
Excluding the exceptional Pounds 2.1m insurance benefit in 1991, pre-tax
profits for the year to February 29 fell by only Pounds 253,000. Profits
were buoyed by lower interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 4m), following
a Pounds 15m preference issue in March.
Turnover rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 181.5m.
The dividend is cut from 5.05p to 2.5p with a 1.5p (3.7p) final. This is an
attempt to bring the dividend back into line with the lower turnover since
the fire in 1989, and after its virtual exit from food manufacturing.
'It would be wrong to pay a distorted high dividend,' said Mr Nicholas
Saphir, chairman, 'because it will take another year to get (the UK spice
factory) back to the profitability that supported a 5p dividend.'
Taking into account the Pounds 1.7m in preference shares, the dividend was
also uncovered.
The British Pepper and Spice factory would continue to make losses in the
current year, although they were expected to be lower than the Pounds 2m
incurred - before insurance payments - in 1992.
Orders in the new, larger factory had increased by 20 per cent since
October, Mr Saphir said, although there was still about 50 per cent spare
capacity.
During the year, Hunter sold two businesses - Butterkist, the toffee popcorn
producer, and Matthew Walker, Christmas pudding manufacturer - for Pounds
11.4m. Emile Tissot, the frozen food business, would be sold 'when we are
offered the right price,' Mr Saphir said.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Dowty moves to shore up bid defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY Group, the aerospace and information technology group, could this week
bolster its defence against the hostile Pounds 494m bid from TI, the
specialist engineering company, with the help of payments on a cancelled
Ministry of Defence contract.
Dowty could take a Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m cancellation payment as an
exceptional item in the year to March, increasing the estimated profit by at
least 10 per cent to more than Pounds 32m. It surprised analysts 12 days ago
by estimating 1992 profits of at least Pounds 29m, some 25 per cent above
most City forecasts before the bid.
The MoD payment, if it were in the 1992 accounts, would further lift the
Cheltenham-based group's apparent recovery from the downturn in the
aerospace market and its involvement in the information technology industry.
Dowty is also likely to bring forward, from June 16, its audited preliminary
results to dispel scepticism among analysts and shareholders about the
quality of its Pounds 29m profits estimate. Publishing these results before
TI's bid closes on June 10 would allow shareholders to estimate 1993
profits, a decisive figure on which Dowty's independence turns.
A TI spokesman yesterday welcomed the opportunity to 'see Dowty's full
accounts and the answers to the many questions surrounding them'.
In a letter to Dowty's shareholders over the weekend, TI attacked the
profits estimate. It questioned restructuring and closure provisions and the
extent to which Dowty has capitalised the development costs of the
loss-making Cognito two-way paging company.
The MoD payment which Dowty is now likely to bring into its 1992 profits
relates to a naval contract cancelled last year but on which payment terms
have only 'recently' been agreed, according to a Dowty adviser. The costs of
the contract were incurred during the last financial year but very little of
the benefit was included in Dowty's profit estimate of 'not less than Pounds
29m', the adviser said.
As the bid enters its closing stages, advisers from both sides are stepping
up their presentations to institutional investors. Dowty says while it made
mistakes in the past, including the disastrous move into information
technology, it has now stripped out a lot of costs and refocused.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Smith Corona quits PC venture
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the US manufacturer of typewriters and word processors, is
pulling out of the fiercely competitive personal computer market little more
than a year after it entered the sector through a joint venture with Acer,
the large Taiwanese company.
Smith Corona, which is 48 per cent owned by Hanson, the UK conglomerate,
said the joint venture would be terminated at the end of next month.
Smith Corona, which has been building PCs under the joint venture agreement,
will continue to do so for a short period but manufacturing will eventually
be transferred to Acer's plants. Acer said it would also continue developing
products based on the joint venture's technology, with royalty payments to
Smith Corona.
Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, said the company had been breaking
even on the venture but intense price competition in the PC market meant
there was little profit opportunity.
When the joint venture launched its first products in March last year Mr
Thompson said he hoped that one third of Smith Corona's sales would come
from personal computers in three to five years. But he said yesterday that
'a third of revenues doesn't mean anything if you don't get about a third of
profits'.
Competition in the PC market was extremely fierce even when Smith Corona
entered the field and it has grown much more cut-throat over the past 12
months.
The company's core market of typing and word processing equipment for the
home and small business has also been depressed for the past two years, and
Smith Corona reported net income virtually halved, at Dollars 17.3m (Pounds
9.6m), in the first nine months of the financial year.
Mr Thompson said the financial effect of the joint venture termination on
Smith Corona was expected to be immaterial.
Analysts have often questioned whether Smith Corona's core market faces
erosion in the face of cut-price PCs aimed at the home.
However, Mr Thompson said yesterday that the company was getting more and
more confirmation that the typewriter and word processor market was quite
distinct from PCs.

FT  01 JUN 92 / A marketing prescription for Wellcome / John Robb talks
about prospects for the drugs group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME'S chief executive, Mr John Robb, prides himself on his
market-orientated approach to business. The 56-year-old Scot and former
consumer products executive at Beecham has proved determined to make the
group more market-driven since he was appointed by chairman Sir Alistair
Frame in July 1990.
But Mr Robb is now faced with the biggest marketing challenge of his life -
the sale of up to 50 per cent of the group in the largest-ever issue by a
privately-owned British company. The offer, scheduled for mid-July, could
raise as much as Pounds 4bn.
At first view his task should not be difficult. The company is the fastest
growing among the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies. On a
five-year average, Wellcome has enjoyed the highest earnings-per-share
growth rate of any pharmaceutical stock - some 30.3 per cent compared with
17.6 per cent for Glaxo and 15.7 per cent for SmithKline Beecham.
In addition, the company has a dominant position - about 80 per cent - in
the fast-growing anti-viral market. Sales of Zovirax, its herpes treatment,
are expected to grow by about 20 per cent during the next two years,
reaching Pounds 820m by 1994. Retrovir, the anti-Aids drug also known as
AZT, could reach annual sales of Pounds 340m in 1994, according to a recent
note by SG Warburg, the company's brokers.
But although Wellcome's short-term future looks bright, Mr Robb's task is
complicated by two doubts on its long-term growth.
First, the beneficial effects of the group's wide-ranging disposal programme
run out next year.
Since he took over the helm, operating margins have improved from 21.2 per
cent in 1990 to 24.6 per cent last year. During the first half of this year,
they rose 2.5 percentage points to 26.7 per cent. However, more than half of
that improvement came from a programme of disposals which is now coming to
an end.
The second threat is the end of patents for Zovirax. During the first half
of 1992, sales increased 26 per cent. Commentators believe as much as 40 per
cent of Wellcome's revenue growth could come from this product next year.
Its main patents expire in Germany next year, the UK in 1995 and the US and
Japan in 1997. Sales are still growing remarkably fast, given that it was
launched
Mr Robb says he recognises the threat to Zovirax and has developed a twin
strategy to deal with the problem. The first element consists of two new
compounds known as 256U and 882C which should eventually replace Zovirax.
The two drugs should be launched in 1995 and 1996, although both are still
in clinical trials. Timing will be crucial. SmithKline Beecham, which Mr
Robb acknowledges has an excellent marketing track-record is scheduled to
launch a competitor drug, Famciclovir, in 1995.
The other element of Mr Robb's defence strategy is to sell Zovirax without a
doctor's prescription in chemists. 'We don't have the marketing clout to
exploit Zovirax in the OTC (over-the counter) market on our own,' admits Mr
Robb. 'We are looking for a partner, particularly in Europe. Two or three
are left on the short-list.'
He plays down another possible threat - that to Retrovir, Wellcome's
anti-Aids drug. He argues analysts at one stage became fixated by Retrovir,
seeing the group merely in relation to Aids, although the drug represented
only 11 per cent of group turnover last year.
Competition to Retrovir from new drugs is unlikely to make much impact in
the medium term, reckons Mr Robb. 'Our view is that Aids will continue to be
treated with Retrovir in combination with other therapies at least for the
next five years. The market is growing and the competition is more noise
than anything else at the moment.'
Concern does exist about a challenge to Retrovir's US patent, however. The
patent's validity is being challenged by Barr Laboratories, a US group. The
outcome of the case is unclear, since it will be decided next year by a jury
in North Carolina. If Wellcome loses it plans to appeal, but Barr would
probably be able to market a generic version of the drug in the meanwhile.
In spite of the problems facing the group, Mr Robb is confident he can
deliver the targets he has promised. These include underlying sales growth
in excess of 10 per cent, an operating margin of 30 per cent by 1996 and
earning-per-share growth of more than 15 per cent a year.
The group's research and development has become much more focused, he says.
The company remains committed to outstanding research, but has adopted the
project management approach perfected by Glaxo in the 1980s, which involves
dropping compounds which fail to reach development targets on time. Since
September 1989, the number of compounds in development has fallen from 78 to
34.
Those drugs that are fully developed will be launched in all possible
markets to justify the money invested in them - it costs up to Dollars 230m
(Pounds 127m) to bring a drug to market.
'Marketing is terribly important. We have a great reputation in research and
development, but not a comparable reputation in marketing,' he says. 'We
used to think if we got the research and development right the products
would sell themselves.'
He plans to improve marketing by expanding Wellcome's sales force. He has
also hired new sales managers for the US and Japan. Elsewhere he will
continue his strategy of co-marketing with other companies.
'It's incredibly important to raise our marketing skills to the same level
as our research and development skills,' says Mr Robb. 'If we don't we'll be
in trouble.'
As he launches a world-wide marketing campaign on Thursday, his most
immediate challenge is to make sure the flotation itself does not run into
trouble. With as much as Pounds 4bn at stake, his much-vaunted marketing
skills will be in demand.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: Time to have a debate on Emu and the
Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the recent House of Commons debate on the Maastricht Treaties, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, rightly underlined that the issues of European
economic and monetary union had been more fully debated in Britain than in
any other EC member state.
But questions concerning the constitution and responsibilities of the Bank
of England as the EC moves towards EMU have so far been given no attention
at all.
This is a gap in the public debate about Britain's economic future that
deserves to be filled soon. Not only are complex issues involved, but
timetable factors are coming to the fore. In particular, the term of office
of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present Bank governor, expires at the end
of June next year. Whoever takes over from him for what can be expected to
be a five-year term will head the Bank through what may be its biggest
changes since nationalisation in the 1940s.
The Bank's status merits discussion for two reasons. One is a global trend
towards making central banks primarily responsible for combating inflation
and giving them independence from government to achieve price stability. If
the Bank of England retains its current status, it will increasingly be an
odd man out among the world's central banks.
The other is the Maastricht Treaty itself, which alongside a single currency
envisages the creation of a European System of Central Banks made up of an
independent European central bank and the central banks of the EC member
states.
The government's position - frequently articulated by Mr Lamont - is that
responsibility for economic policy, including the setting of interest rates,
should, as now, stay unambiguously in national hands during the preparatory
second stage of Emu which begins in 1994. As long as this state exists, the
chancellor has insisted that the Bank should not be given its independence,
otherwise there would be no way of making the conduct of monetary policy
accountable to parliament.
But it is inconceivable that the Bank can stay as it is if government and
parliament eventually decide to join the third and final stage of union in
1997, when a majority of EC members will be able to decide whether to go
ahead with a single European currency and European central bank, or in 1999
when as few as two states can create the union. If Britain decides to be a
full member of Emu, the Bank of England will also have to be independent.
The timetable agreed at Maastricht means the UK government and parliament
will have to debate whether to move to the third and final stage of Emu
before the end of 1996. This is likely to be during the life of the present
parliament. Even if the decision goes against joining the third stage of
Emu, 1996 would be an occasion for a debate, or even decisions, on the
constitution and responsibilities of the Bank of England.
A number of thorny issues that cannot wait until 1997 or 1999 are already
surfacing. Some are technical, such as the role that the Bank will play in
Europe-wide systems for settling payments between banks or supervising banks
throughout the EC. Other questions are more hypothetical but fundamental,
such as the objectives, governance and accountability of the Bank of England
if it becomes part of a European economic and monetary union.
One problem with Mr Lamont's present approach towards the Bank and Emu is
that it appears to assume that the Bank could move overnight from its
present non-independent status to one of independence within Emu. The change
would in fact have far-reaching implications.
The role of the Bank would have to be clearly defined if it became
independent. Would it concentrate on securing price stability, like the
Bundesbank? Or would it retain the responsibilities for the welfare of the
City and industry or bank supervision that the Bank has today?
What should be the decision-making body if the Bank assumes responsibility
for setting interest rates, either in the context of a European central
banking system or as an independent entity?
At present, interest rate decisions are taken by the chancellor after talks
between the Bank and the Treasury. But if the Bank became responsible for
monetary policy, even as part of a European system of central banks, it
would have to restructure its decision-making organs and their
accountability.
The Bank Court, which includes industrialists, City financiers and trade
unionists as well as Bank officials, clearly could not decide on interest
rates because several of its members would be exposed to a potential
conflict of interest.
If such decisions were to be taken by a new group comprising Bank officials,
operating most likely with a one-person, one-vote system, the individuals
concerned would have greatly increased power, raising questions as to whom
they should be accountable and how.
Also, who would they represent? Britain, as a unitary state, is peculiarly
ill-placed to inject regional interests and influences into its
bureaucracies. In contrast to the Bundesbank council or the US Federal Open
Market Committee, which give the representatives of the US and German
regions a say in monetary policy making, there would be no easy way of
reflecting the preoccupations of Scotland, Wales, the west Midlands or the
north of England in the decision-making centre of the Bank of England.
These are just some of the questions that have to be answered if the UK
finally decides to join Emu. The problem is that they are so wide-ranging
that they could not be tackled at the last minute.
Indeed, it may be that Britain will not become a full member of Emu. But the
implications of Emu for the Bank of England should be considered in depth
and in advance, lest the Bank be pitchforked into a new environment
completely unprepared and with a constitution that does not do justice to
the importance of monetary policy for the UK's economic welfare.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Germany delays final decision on European Fighter Aircraft
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of the Pounds 21bn European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project within
the German government have won a one-month delay in the final decision on
whether to pull out of the deal.
Postponement of a key parliamentary meeting this week will give Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, a chance to persuade Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the German leader, not to abandon Britain, Italy and Spain in the
joint production of the aircraft. The two meet for an informal summit in
Bonn on Friday.
It will also give the German aerospace industry, led by the Daimler-Benz
subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace, a last chance to lobby for the deal.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the new German defence minister, is known to be highly
sceptical about going ahead with such a sophisticated fly-by-wire fighter
when his budget is under severe pressure. He has called for drastic price
cuts if the aircraft is to be financed within the DM12bn (Pounds 4bn) set
aside in his long-term budget.
The chances of ensuring German participation still look exceedingly slim.
Most politicians in Bonn doubt the project can win majority support in the
German parliament because of the present climate of budget stringency to
finance unification.
A final meeting takes place today of the six-member working group of defence
experts drawn from the German coalition government, which includes the
Christian Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free
Democrats (FDP).
It will produce a report comparing all possible alternatives to EFA, such as
the US F-16 and F-18 fighters, the Swedish Gripen, and the Russian MiG-29,
but making no rigid recommendation.
The key meeting of CDU and CSU parliamentarians, scheduled for tomorrow, at
which Mr Ruhe was due to make his own recommendation, has been postponed
until June 16. The deadline for a final decision is now July 1, when the
1993 draft budget has to be presented to the German cabinet.
The delay was agreed last week at a meeting of leaders of the CDU and CSU
chaired by Mr Kohl, and involving Mr Ruhe, Mr Theo Waigel, the CSU leader
and finance minister, and Mr Mac Streibl, the Bavarian prime minister. The
Bavarian-based CSU is a strong champion of the EFA, which would be built
largely by the southern German aerospace industry.
According to reports of the meeting, Mr Ruhe was attacked sharply by the CSU
leaders for letting it be known that he wants to abandon the project. They
argued that such a decision would undermine Germany's international
credibility, and deal a devastating blow to the country's aerospace
industry.
Mr Kohl agreed to put off this week's meeting, giving himself a chance to
discuss the project with Mr Major, and by telephone with Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister.
The EFA project - whose principal contractors are British Aerospace, Alenia
of Italy, Spain's CASA, and Deutsche Aerospace - is supposed to move from
its present development phase to the pre-production phase next year. The
issue has been brought to a head early in Germany by the need to include
DM100m in next year's budget for the pre-production phase.

FT  01 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: EC takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The typical UK view of the European Commission's stalled efforts to
harmonise national takeover rules is that not much would change if laws are
eventually passed. An article in the Stock Exchange Quarterly suggests
plenty will change. In particular, UK companies could be even more
vulnerable to takeover within the EC.
Two main reasons are advanced. The first is the UK's relative absence of
structural barriers to hostile takeover, including, for example, such
historical variables as the level of state ownership. EC legislation would
do little to alter these factors, but would concentrate on more obvious
technical barriers. These are restrictions typically built into company
statutes on matters such as voting rights and dual classes of equity.
The second reason is that EC law would effectively overturn a proven UK
system of takeover regulation, without exposing many European companies to
the threat of hostile acquisition. UK companies would thus be exposed to
further risk, without any concomitant benefits. They might respond by
erecting technical barriers of their own, possibly via cross-shareholding
arrangements such as that between Guinness and LVMH. But such measures would
require shareholders' approval.
In the end, the argument hinges on different philosophical notions of whom
corporations are supposed to serve. It is debatable whether parts of Europe
are gradually becoming more comfortable with the Anglo-Saxon model of
corporate control. The example of Continental/Pirelli in Germany suggests
change is occurring, albeit painfully slowly. The Perrier affair in France
was something of a milestone. But by the same token, the Dutch and Italians
still have a long way to travel.

FT  01 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The great UK pensions debate is currently focused on the relative virtues of
money purchase over final salary schemes, and on the creation of effective
safeguards to prevent plundering by a future Robert Maxwell. Investors,
however, ought not to lose sight of other, related issues such as the
accounting and tax treatment of pension fund surpluses.
The way in which British industry unnecessarily poured billions of late
1970s and early 1980s is well documented. Even by their own conservative
standards actuaries had become extremely gloomy on a diet of high inflation,
rampant trade unionism and low real investment returns. In their defence, of
course, they were not to know that equity markets were about to roar and
that recession and high unemployment would also serve to fatten up their
funds.
The question of who owns a resulting surplus is contentious in the wake of
the Maxwell scandal. Employees justly claim a moral entitlement to at least
a part of it on grounds both that they put up some of the money through
their own contributions and that pensions are a form of deferred pay. The
vast majority of companies with well administered schemes would doubtless
argue that since they are providers of last resort - as underwriters of any
actuarial deficiency - they are also entitled to be the recipients of last
resort.
Certainly SSAP 24, the accounting standard introduced in 1988-89 to deal
with pensions, makes the assumption that a surplus belongs to the company.
The standard offers finance directors the choice of utilising the value via
a one-off balance sheet adjustment, or taking it through the profit and loss
account spread over the working life of employees. Because of the way this
so-called variation reduces the net pension cost charged to operating
profits - and creates a substantial above-the-line credit for a handful of
top companies - most have tended to choose the latter option. Such treatment
is intellectually defensible - today's enhanced profits are balanced by
understated profits in the past - but investors should surely demand that
companies provide more information about methods of amortisation.
Such transfers are non-cash items, which raises the question of whether
groups like the specialty materials group Courtaulds should not be able to
take back some of the money for immediate reinvestment in the business. Only
Lucas Industries has taken this route, but at the cost of a 40 per cent tax
charge seemingly imposed by the government to dissuade small business owners
from abusing a tax break. With UK industry undercapitalised at this stage of
the cycle it is perhaps a pity that most bona fide operators are caught by
this penalty.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though Danish voters will vote for ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty in tomorrow's referendum. Opinion polls, which had
suggested a narrow rejection, last week swung in the other direction. On the
assumption (rather dangerous since the UK election) that they are right,
European bond and currency markets will heave a sigh of relief.
The perceived wisdom is that rejection would have three main consequences
for the markets. Worries that the entire treaty might have to be
renegotiated would be a blow to the interest rate convergence theory. This
would affect not only the Ecu bond market, but also other high interest
markets in Europe, including probably those Nordic countries which have
proved vulnerable to devaluation fears in the past. Second, there would be a
flow of funds into the D-Mark which would strengthen in the ERM. Third,
pressure on the already vulnerable lira could become so intense that a
realignment would become inevitable.
The impact would be all the greater as markets are discounting a 'yes' vote.
If that is the result, reaction may be limited to a modest upward push to
bond prices in some of the peripheral, high interest markets. Beyond that,
however, it is worth questioning whether the referendum result actually
makes much difference to the prospects of an ERM realignment.
In spite of the pressures on European economies resulting from tight German
money, the idea of a realignment is currently taboo. Indeed there is a
certain machismo attached to holding the line. There is no reason why the
Danish vote should change that. The number of those who believe in a last
realignment before European monetary union is dwindling. If the likelihood
is really that remote, however, the differentials between German interest
rates and those elsewhere in Europe should be even narrower than they
already are.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Deregulation the culprit for parlous state of US
airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUG HENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reading Nikki Tait's piece on the financial wreck that is the US
airline industry ('Spectre of losses dogs US carriers', May 28) I was struck
again by the almost universal inability to draw what should be an obvious
conclusion: our 14-year experiment with deregulation has been a total
disaster.
American Airlines chairman, Bob Crandall, says his industry 'is going down
the tubes'. One-fifth of domestic airline passengers are now being carried
by bankrupt airlines. Venerable names have either disappeared (Pan Am,
Eastern) or are at risk of disappearing (TWA).
How can this be? Unions have been broken and real wages cut. Oil prices,
despite recent increases, have been well behaved for years and, in real
dollars, are well below what they were when the industry was deregulated. On
domestic routes, there's no such thing as foreign competition. The surviving
airlines, Crandall's prominent among them, are models of tight management.
The answer has to be deregulation; what else is there?
Partisans of deregulation point to lower fares as the strategy's triumph.
Yes, real fares per seat mile have declined since 1978 - but at pretty much
the same pace as they did in the prior 20 years. And here's a fact that
deregulators never confront: the air fare component of the consumer price
index has risen at twice the pace of general inflation since fare-setting
was turned over to the invisible hand. The culprits, of course, are the
hidden price increases of longer flights (thanks to the hub-and-spoke
system) and tighter purchase restrictions.
The volatility of the airline business is a function of several things,
among them high costs of entry and a huge overhang of empty seats. That
leads to contradictory pressures of oligopoly and price warfare. Regulation
aimed to stabilise these pressures; deregulation has exposed them in rich
detail.
Europeans should know this as they move to deregulate their own skies.
Unfortunately, these truths are rarely expressed in our own press, much less
yours.

Sir, Jurek Martin's comment ('Theeeeere's Johnny', May 23) about cricket
being played only in the old British Empire and Holland is surprising. May I
add that cricket is played in many 'overseas' countries, including the US,
South America (Argentina, Brazil) and Europe (Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece - Corfu, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal and Spain) as
well as in the Channel Islands, Gibraltar and Malta.
In fact, certain of these countries will be participating in a European
Cricketer Cup competition to be held in England in July this year.
In Portugal cricket has been played since the 1850s with the first match
between the British Clubs in Oporto and Lisbon being held in 1861, making
this annual event one of the oldest in cricket on the continent of Europe.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Reality of industry hidden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I echo every word of Leon di Marco's letter (May 20) about the
government's blindness to the perilous state of Britain's manufacturing
industry. But may I warn that we still face a flood of misleading government
propaganda in its endeavours to paint a sympathetic picture of manufacturing
leading Britain out of recession.
At MSF's conference in Bournemouth on May 16, a resolution was passed
reaffirming our membership's belief that Britain needs 'a thriving,
expanding and competitive manufacturing industry as the key sector of the
economy on whose success all else ultimately depends'. We know that a major
change is needed in government industrial strategy if this is to happen.
To put pressure on the government we need to open up the debate. That cannot
be done if the truth about the state of manufacturing is hidden from public
view. It is up to papers like the FT diligently to examine the reality of
what is happening.
On the same day Mr Di Marco's letter was published the current account
deficit went over Pounds 1bn again. Yet in the last few months we have had
regular statements from ministers (and, indeed, the CBI) telling us that the
figures showed encouraging trends in exports and imports.
MSF is determined that the near silence about the plight of Britain's
manufacturing industry is ended. Our members - in manufacturing and the
services - depend on a highly skilled, properly rewarded, scientifically
backed industry which can put Britain back into the lead again. Roger Lyons,

FT  01 JUN 92 / Letter: Changes to EC constitution not necessary for single
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BRIAN HINDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Sutherland's comments (Personal View, May 28) on the long-standing
federal characteristics of the EC and on the role of the Commission are
quite right. However, his arguments and examples refer to the single market,
the principle of which is widely supported - even among members of the
Bruges Group. As he says, that support implies a willingness to accept some
abrogation of national sovereignty in exchange for measures that are
demonstrably necessary for effective functioning of the single market.
But that concession, for that purpose, does not remove the possibility of
objecting to abrogations of sovereignty for other purposes. 'It is
unreasonable to argue against regulation from Brussels,' Mr Sutherland says,
'particularly when the effect of the regulation is to dismantle protection.'
What nonsense. Having accepted the principle of the single market, it is
unreasonable to argue against regulations that are necessary to put the
principle into practice. Any other regulation or act is fair game.
The changes in the EC constitution proposed at Maastricht are not necessary
for the single market. Nor are various current proposals of the Commission -
for example, the Euro soap opera planned by the directorate-general for
information and culture (DG-X). New justification is needed for such
measures. Proponents of a 'deeper' Community have failed to provide one, as
is suggested by Mr Sutherland's attempt to deduce general consent to EC
federalism from consent to the single market, and by his ritualistic
reference to the Second World War. Few want another war between France and
Germany. But what line of reasoning implies that a deeper Community is
necessary to avoid one?
The single market is not a central issue in current debate about the
structure of the EC. Those who advocate a deepened Community could move the
debate forward by providing a reasoned case for their views.

FT  01 JUN 92 / America's sale of the century: Privatisation is gaining
momentum in state and city government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a tide in world financial and business affairs which normally flows
from the western hemisphere to Europe, a little like the Gulf Stream:
Americans invent an idea, popularise it, and some time later it washes up in
plagiarised form on the shores of Britain, France and Germany.
In an unusual reversal of this phenomenon, the US is slowly warming to
privatisation - the sale of state owned businesses to the private sector. It
is doing so roughly a decade behind Britain and contemporaneous with the
former east European satellites of the Soviet Union and the Third World
regimes of Latin America.
To non-Americans, it may seem surprising that the US, the most capitalist
economy of all, has any significant assets in public ownership.
Certainly, very little is owned by the Federal Government, apart from the
post office, some regional electric power systems, the Amtrak railway and
America's air traffic control network.
However, state and city governments own and operate a huge range of
businesses in the utility and infrastructure sectors, including highways,
bridges, tunnels, seaports, airports, power stations and water plants.
A few of these local governments, citing the successful example of Margaret
Thatcher's privatisation drive in Britain, are now beginning to look at ways
of selling existing enterprises, mostly to private corporations, but
possibly in public share sales as well. They are also trying to get the
private sector to finance the construction of new facilities such as toll
roads.
This in turn is starting to create opportunities for bankers, financial
advisers and corporate investors, be they US companies or European ones with
privatisation experience.
The Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles-based think-tank which strongly
supports privatisation, reckons that the US has some Dollars 226bn of
existing state and municipal enterprises which could potentially be spun
off.
Privatisation on such a grand scale seems highly unlikely, due to a
combination of political, legal and financial hurdles. However, President
Bush gave the nascent movement a large nudge forward in April when he signed
an executive order which removes some of the biggest financial and
bureaucratic barriers to asset sales.
Why the sudden enthusiasm? The Republican White House, which has long paid
lip service to privatisation as ideologically desirable, now views it as
politically helpful too.
Mr Bush, weighed down with a Dollars 360bn federal budget deficit, has very
limited scope for fiscal stimuli which would help spur recovery from
recession in this presidential election year. The privatisation initiative
is part of his re-election campaign effort to streamline or remove
government regulations which hold back economic growth.
The small but vocal privatisation lobby argues that there are several
powerful, longer-term reasons for selling off assets.
First, this could help alleviate America's serious infrastructure problems.
Many of America's roads, bridges, and sewers are in serious decay - a fact
underlined by the quarter of a billion gallons of water which flooded
central Chicago in April when a tunnel collapsed. But the states and
municipal authorities responsible for maintaining them lack the funds to do
so.
The privatisation lobby argues that private investors would provide the
necessary capital if ownership were transferred to them.
The weakness of this argument is that canny investors will want to buy only
assets in good condition, leaving local governments nursing those most in
need of rehabilitation. Still, the money raised from the disposal of 'good'
assets could then be used by governments to rehabilitate 'bad' ones.
Some of the money raised by privatisation might also be used by local
governments to alleviate other serious problems, such as the plight of the
predominantly black underclass in the inner cities. This argument is being
pressed with particular vigour in the wake of last month's Los Angeles
riots.
'It is a crime that state and local governments fiddle with billions of
dollars in assets which could be used to rebuild cities - while the cities
burn,' says Mr John Giraudo, a privatisation expert with the legal firm of
Skadden Arps.
The sale of state-owned enterprises is also the logical corollary of a
fast-growing movement in the US to make government more efficient by
adopting business practices similar to those of the private sector.
Apostles of the movement include some of the most innovative state governors
in the country, both Democratic and Republican: Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential nominee and Arkansas Governor; Mr William Weld, the
Republican who is shaking up Massachusetts; Mr Lawton Chiles, the Democrat
who is reshaping Florida's civil service; and Mrs Ann Richards, the Democrat
running Texas.
Their bible is Reinventing Government, a book which has gone through seven
printings since publication in February and, improbably for such a dry
subject, spent eight weeks on the New York Times non-fiction best-seller
list.
Its authors, Mr David Osborne and Mr Ted Gaebler, are consultants on public
sector efficiency, who believe government in the US must be more
'entrepreneurial' or businesslike if it is to overcome decades of
accumulated bureaucratic inertia and financial waste.
Their solutions include privatisation; decentralising responsibility to
encourage innovation and flexibility among civil servants.
Much of this medicine will appear commonplace to anyone who lived through
Britain's privatisation revolution in the 1980s. But the American variant
adds in a hefty dose of popular US business theories which emphasise quality
standards and customer satisfaction.
Several powerful financial forces have been impelling local governments in
this direction: a revolt by taxpayers, tired of financing bureaucratic
inefficiency, manifested both in anti-tax referenda and votes against
high-tax administrations; President Reagan's cuts in federal aid to state
and local administrations during the 1980s; and recession, which has further
eroded local governments' revenue base.
State and municipal politicians, desperate to balance their budgets, have
been pursuing two main avenues of reform. First, they have been shaking up
their existing civil service structures and control systems to improve
performance.
Second, they have been contracting out services previously performed by the
government - such as running prisons and collecting garbage - to private
sector companies, a process which is also often termed 'privatisation'.
So far there is still far more talk of reform than action. Political inertia
or fear of opposition from public sector unions remains widespread, and
relatively few politicians have begun seriously considering the outright
sale of large assets.
But the cutting edge of the reform movement can be seen in Massachusetts,
where the Republican Mr Weld took over as governor at the start of last year
in a wave of revulsion by voters against the high tax regime of his
predecessor, Mr Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic presidential nominee.
Mr Weld's first budget slashed state spending, while his second proposes
modest cuts in taxes at a time when most states have been raising theirs to
cope with revenue shortfalls.
He has launched a war on bureaucratic red tape and begun contracting out
government services, including parts of the hospital system, prisoners'
healthcare, some roads' maintenance and parts of the vehicle registration
system.
Mr Weld has also floated the idea of privatising two of the state's largest
infrastructure assets - Boston's Logan airport, the ninth busiest in the US,
and the Massachusetts Turnpike, a 135-mile toll road. Studies have suggested
that both could be sold - the airport for nearly Dollars 800m and the road
for about Dollars 950m - but neither disposal is imminent, partly for local
political reasons and partly because of the complexity of such a move.
In Massachusetts, as elsewhere, one factor holding back privatisation is the
sheer fragmentation of the government machine and the large number of
interested parties involved in decision-making. 'In the US,' says Skadden
Arp's Mr Giraudo, 'privatisation requires achieving a much larger political
consensus than in other nations.'
For example, an attempt by Lockheed, the aerospace company, to take a
long-term lease on the regional airport at Albany, in New York state, became
bogged down last year in a lengthy debate with the Federal Aviation
Administration, the federal agency responsible for the industry.
Until now, another difficulty holding back privatisation has been a
requirement that any administration selling an asset pay back any grants the
enterprise has received from the federal government.
President Bush's recent order clears away some of the biggest of these
hurdles, for it allows a privatising administration to keep the bulk of such
grants and also orders federal agencies - such as the FAA - to co-operate
fully in privatisation efforts.
Even so, obstacles will remain. Take airports, for example. This sector is
closest to producing a big candidate for disposal, with Los Angeles
completing a study for the privatisation of its international airport and
Maryland looking at leasing out Baltimore/Washington.
America's airlines, concerned that this will mean much higher landing fees,
have begun lobbying against privatisation, and some analysts believe no sale
is likely until their fears are allayed, possibly by granting them a stake
in a privatised airport's profits.
The privatisation movement, however, extends beyond the sale of existing
assets to entirely new projects. For example, a highways act passed by
congress last November should encourage the building of new toll roads by
private investors. The federal government heavily subsidises road
construction, but until now it has not allowed most roads built by states
with federal aid to charge tolls. The new legislation retains this ban on
America's main interstate highways, but it allows states to use federal
money for non-interstate toll roads - and for the first time it specifically
allows them to use these funds to support private sector investment.
Even before the new legislation, plans were well advanced for the
construction of five unsubsidised private toll roads - four of them in
California and one in Virginia.
These new projects create opportunities beyond America's borders. European
commercial and investment banks have much more experience of financing such
ventures - be it providing loans or advising on debt and equity offerings.
SG Warburg, the British merchant bank which arranged public share offerings
in both the Channel tunnel and the new Disney theme park in France, has, for
example, been examining the possibilities of advising on US privatisations.
However, Warburg's Mr David Freud points out that the US project financing
market has substantial differences from Europe. He cites, for example,
'horrific' legal liability issues which could complicate US equity
offerings.
In this, as in so many other aspects of privatisation, it seems the US may
still have something to learn from Europe.

PEGASUS GROUP, the USM-listed accounting software specialist, has installed
Jonathan Hubbard-Ford as the new chief executive in succession to Derek
Moon.
Hubbard-Ford, 49, who comes from information technology consultants Butler
Cox, where he had been group finance director, says a high priority will be
to 'look very carefully at the product range and strategy'. One area he
highlights where Pegasus has struggled is in open systems products. He will
also hope to improve distribution channels.
Before returning to the UK in 1985, Hubbard-Ford had spent 11 years in Hong
Kong with Hutchison Whampoa, latterly as chief operating officer.
Meanwhile, the new boss claims to be philosophical about the bid speculation
that has periodically surrounded Pegasus. 'If you operate a public company
you are constantly aware you will be looked over' he says, adding that he is
'fully prepared' if anyone should display interest.
Moon, 62, is now non-executive chairman.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fairclough Civil Eng ineering specialist, FAIRCLOUGH MARINE, has been
awarded a design and construct contract worth almost Pounds 11m by
Associated British Ports for a roll-on/roll-off ferry terminal at Hull.
The 13-month contract will include the construction of a jetty, a
hydraulically operated shore ramp, berthing dolphins, protection dolphins, a
traffic underpass, roadworks, a container handling area and a large car
parking area of 12.3 acres.
Due to start on site in July, Fairclough Marine anticipates completion in
August 1993. Being constructed on behalf of North Sea Ferries, the roll-
on/roll-off facility is being designed for the new 23,000 tonne
'superfreighter' ferries which are to be introduced.
Fairclough Civil Engineering has also been selected to construct the A27
Westhampnett bypass near Chichester, West Sussex, for the Department of
Transport under a contract valued at almost Pounds 7m.
Scheduled for completion in the spring of 1993, Fairclough's contract
comprises a two mile dual two-lane carriageway bypassing the village of
Westhampnett. The project also includes alterations to local roads affected
by the bypass.
Fairclough Civil Engineering is part of AMEC, the international
construction, engineering and development group.

The John Lewis Partnership is to have a new chairman from February 1 1993,
only the fifth since the retailing company was established in 1864.
Deputy chairman Stuart Hampson, 45, will take over from Peter Lewis, who is
retiring then, at 63 years old.
Because of the particular nature of John Lewis's constitution, the chairman
potentially wields considerable power. There are three effective authorities
of the company: the chairman of the trust company (hence the title
'partnership'), created in 1929, which manages the share capital on behalf
of permanently employed staff, or partners; the central council,
representing all levels of the company; and the 12 central board directors.
By taking over as chairman, Hampson heads both the trust company and the
central board. He will inherit an absolute veto over policy decisions and
will appoint all senior management figures.
Hampson was educated at the Royal Masonic school in Bushey, Hertfordshire,
going on to, first, Wilbraham Academy in Massachusetts and thence to St
John's, Oxford to study modern languages. He joined the UK Board of Trade in
1969, and in 1978 was appointed principal private secretary to Roy
Hattersley, then secretary of state for prices and consumer protection.
Hampson continued in the civil service until 1982, when he joined John Lewis
as a senior trainee. He was made deputy chairman in May 1989.
He clearly feels the weight of history on his shoulders. 'Appointment as the
fifth head of a 128-year-old business is bound to instil a sense of history
and tradition, but the Partnership's system of democratic ownership, and its
distinctive trading policies, are as relevant to the competitive conditions
of the 1990's and the next century as they were in the 1930's' he says,
refusing to elaborate until he takes over.
Hampson is the second chairman drawn from outside the Lewis family. Sir
Bernard Miller was chairman between 1955-1972.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A major clean up programme is to be undertaken at the bay surrounding
Mont-Saint Michel because it has been severely polluted by untreated waste.
Roughly 1.5m visitors a year come to Mont-Saint Michel, a rocky isle topped
by a Benedictine abbey and connected to the mainland by a causeway. Despite
the multitude of visitors, hotels and restaurants on the isle have dumped
untreated waste water into the bay.
Mr Pierre-Frederic Teniere-Buchot, a regional water official, said the
cleanup plan would cost FFr20m (Pounds 2.03m) and would establish a waste
treatment system within two years. He also forecast that the cost of water
was likely to increase by 180 per cent.
The project will entail the temporary removal of the cobblestones paving the
isle's narrow main street. The bay, already a subject of environmental
concern, has been shrinking in size because of the encroachment of silt.

RESULTS DUE
BOOTS, the retail and pharma-ceutical company, is expected on Thursday to
announce a rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 345m to about Pounds
360m, excluding property disposals.
Attention will be focused on margins at Boots The Chemist, and on attempts
to turnround Halfords and Do-It-All. Earnings are likely to have risen from
about 23.45p to more than 25p.
Thames Water, largest of the privatised water companies, may announce an
increase in annual pre-tax profit of less than Pounds 20m, to Pounds 230m or
so, next Tuesday, while the dividend increase is expected to be 10 per cent.
As its area is one of the worst affected by drought, its views on metering
will be of interest. It will also be questioned on progress on its Pounds
4bn capital spending programme, including the London ring main, and on the
level of contribution from its water treatment division, including
acquisitions in the US and the former east Germany.
Siebe, the engineering and controls group, is likely to be questioned
closely on North American trading next Wednesday. Optimists are forecasting
a modest advance in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 159m to Pounds 162m,
with the more pessimistic pitching for a decline to Pounds 150m. On the top
side, earnings edge up from 46.1p to 48p. Both parties agree strong cash
generation is likely to have cut the high gearing.
Reed International, the publishing and information group, reports its annual
results on Wednesday, with some analysts expecting a small decline compared
with last time's pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 218.5m. However, Reed is
expected to show strong growth once the recession is clearly over.
De La Rue, the UK-based security printer and payment machine maker, is
expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m, up from Pounds
58.9m, when it announces annual results on Tuesday. The group which has been
successfully turned around by Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive and
formerly of Hanson, has successfully managed to cut more costs. These
profits would represent 32.1p of earnings and analysts expect the dividend
to increase from 13.7p to 15p.

FT  01 JUN 92 / The Week Ahead: Figures may confirm US recovery but cast
doubt on German growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of statistics from the US and Germany this week should point to
further recovery in the US economy but may cast some doubt over how strongly
Germany is growing.
The closely watched National Association of Purchasing Managers' index,
which is released later today, is expected to indicate further gains in US
business optimism last month while labour market statistics on Friday should

FT  01 JUN 92 / Mirror staff may leave NUJ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Union of Journalists (NUJ) was threatened with a split
yesterday after one of its largest office branches voted to leave the union.
Members of the 288-strong Daily Mirror chapel decided by 94 votes to 76 not
to stay in the NUJ. They will decide their next move on Wednesday.
One possibility is that they will join the British Association of
Journalists, which is being set up by Mr Steve Turner, a former Daily Mirror
journalist, who was dismissed as general secretary last year after clashes
with the union's executive.
Many Mirror journalists are angry about the way Mr Turner was treated, and
some believe a breakaway organisation would attract journalists at other
newspapers because of dissatisfaction with what are perceived as the NUJ's
leftwing policies.
Union breakaways usually struggle to win large memberships in the face of
difficulties in gaining affiliation to the Trades Union Congress and
resistance to change from members of the organisation.
Leaders of the Nupe public-service union yesterday won the backing of their
annual conference for plans to merge with the Nalgo and Cohse public-service
unions. The merger would create a 1.5m-strong union.
Assuming the annual conferences of Nalgo and Cohse also agree to the merger
plans later this month, members will be asked to vote on the issue later in
the year. The merger would go ahead in July next year.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Sexual harassment reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH women face sexual harassment in most workplaces and all sectors of
employment, according to IRS, a independent employment research group.
More than half the 132 employers in the survey published today in IRS
Employment Trends journal said complaints of sexual harassment had been made
at their workplaces, with 46 per cent saying cases had been reported during
the past year.
Almost nine out of 10 harassment complaints are upheld after internal
investigations. Proven harassers can face dismissal, according to almost
half of employers, while 57 per cent said they issued formal warnings or
took disciplinary action.
Only one employer said sexual harassment was not a disciplinary offence,
although one in 10 said that the position was 'not clear'.
Almost four employers in five said sexual harassment was a 'fairly important
problem' compared with 15 per cent who said it was a 'major problem'. Three
per cent said they did not see it as a problem.
The survey shows that awareness of the issue is growing in the private
sector, where one in five employers have policy statements. Half of
public-sector employers said they had policy statements on sexual
harassment.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Cunningham urges party overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWING demands of those seeking a 'fundamental overhaul' of the Labour
party and the pressures on candidates for the party leadership to defend its
historic traditions emerged vividly yesterday.
In an interview on TV-am, Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign
co-ordinator, reiterated his support for the abandonment of the Labour rule
book's Clause 4, which calls for public ownership, and warned that the way
the party conducts its affairs was putting off voters.
His comments appeared tacitly to back a sharply diminished union role as
part of a 'fundamental overhaul' of the party's image.
'For too many people, the Labour party still remains a closed organisation,
an organisation that is difficult to join, very difficult to participate
effectively in,' he said.
His views were echoed by Mr Gavin Laird, the engineers' and electricians'
leader, who used an article in the AEEU's newspaper to attack the
'antiquated' links between the party and the unions.
Yet within hours Mr Bryan Gould, the self-proclaimed radical candidate for
the leadership and deputy leadership, found himself forced on BBC television
to defend the controversial Clause 4 of the party's constitution and its
historic ties with the unions.
At the same time, in an interview on LWT's Walden programme, Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the favoured candidate of Mr John Smith in the deputy leadership
race, was also thrown on the defensive.
Stung by charges that she was merely the 'establishment candidate', the
shadow chief secretary found herself insisting that she was not a 'docile
individual' who simply did as Mr Smith told her. She denied that she was
slipping behind in the deputy leadership race and claimed she was getting a
good reaction from the grassroots of the party, especially women.
Both Mr Gould and Mrs Beckett have found themselves increasingly under
pressure to emphasise their leftwing and pro-union credentials after
widespread speculation that Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary
favoured by many union traditionalists, is gaining ground in the
deputy-leadership race.
After arguing for the unions to withdraw from future leadership contests in
favour of a one-member, one-vote system, Mr Gould has recently been
emphasising his support for a continuing union role in policy-making and on
the ruling national executive.

In spite of growing pressure from MPs, the terms of the review may not be
set out until next week to allow ministers time to prepare their response to
the highly critical inquiry into pensions legislation conducted by the

Many of the committee's recommendations for tighter controls on fund
management are expected to be taken up.
Steps to help the Maxwell pensioners are also expected shortly.

<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has called for squatting in commercial
buildings to be made a criminal offence.
It says squatting in shops, factories and offices is costing UK companies
thousands of pounds a year.
In Scotland, offenders can be fined or jailed for squatting in commercial or
residential property. In England and Wales, the only remedy is an expensive
and time-consuming civil action.
The CBI said that, apart from legal action, companies had to pay to repair
property damage, replace stolen or damaged stock and remove rubbish. Also
their insurance premiums went up.

CITYAIR Scandinavia, the Swedish carrier, is to begin services today from
London to Stockholm in what is claimed to be Europe's first jet link between
city centres.
Flights from London City airport to central Stockholm are due to begin after
the decision by the Swedish authorities to reopen Bromma airport, which was
closed 10 years ago because of aircraft noise.
Aviation officials in Stockholm approved the route because the airline is
using BAe 146 jets, which are quieter than most other passenger jets.
CityAir was set up with the specific aim of forging the new link.
Mr Malcolm Ginsberg, an official of London City airport, said: 'We believe
this is the first city-centre-to-city-centre route in Europe.'
Stockholm brings to six the number of destinations that can be reached from
London City airport. The others are Paris, Brussels, Rotterdam, Zurich and
Lugano.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Inquiry called for on Tory funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADER of the Labour opposition on Westminster City Council said
yesterday that he was seeking an Inland Revenue investigation into a
registered charity, the Foundation for Business Responsibilities, to
discover if it has breached laws concerning tax relief for charities.
The FBR has been criticised by the Charity Commission in a letter to
Westminster Labour leader Mr Andrew Dismore for making unauthorised payments
to a public-relations company, Marketforce Communications. The company was
employed by Westminster council's Conservatives to promote the party before
the May 1990 local elections.
The commission's rules bar charities from engaging in political activities.
The FBR was established in 1972 as an educational trust.
The 1990 elections saw the Tories increase their majority over Labour - the
Conservatives now hold 45 seats and Labour 15, out of the total 60 on
Westminster council.
Mr Dismore complained to the Charity Commission about FBR funding the Tory
election campaign, and the commission has now backed that complaint.
Its letter to Mr Dismore said the charity paid more than Pounds 98,000 to
Marketforce. The commission found that the payment infringed charity rules.
The money has been repaid to the charity by its trustees, although yesterday
it was still not clear where the refund came from.
Dame Shirley Porter, the Conservative leader of the council at the time, who
has just ended her term of office as Lord Mayor of London, has been sent a
letter from Mr Dismore, asking for clarification of her involvement with the
use of the charity's funds for politically motivated public relations work
for her party.
A representative of Dame Shirley yesterday denied that she had any
connection with the FBR.
Mr Michael Ivens, director of the FBR, who also runs the free-market
pressure group Aims of Industry, yesterday also declined to comment on the
matter.
Mr Dismore said that, after the commission's criticism of the FBR, the exact
relationship between it, Marketforce and the Conservative party at
Westminster council should be clarified. He added that Dame Shirley 'should
come clean and tell us what she was up to'.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Nissan UK faces Pounds 1.3m damages claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER senior executive of Nissan UK is claiming damages of Pounds 1.3m
for alleged breach of contract and wrongful dismissal three years ago.
The action embroils the company in further legal conflict in addition to the
current investigation of it in the UK by the Inland Revenue for alleged
corporation tax fraud, and its own claim for hundreds of millions of pounds
in damages from Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, in arbitration
proceedings in Tokyo.
The hearing of the alleged wrongful dismissal of Mr Stan Cholaj, former
assistant managing director of Nissan UK, is scheduled to begin tomorrow at
the High Court in London. It will examine the often controversial management
style of Mr Octav Botnar, the company's 78-year-old chairman and managing
director.
It is unclear, though, whether Mr Botnar will attend the hearing to give
evidence, as he has remained abroad since the end of January, when a warrant
for his arrest was issued by the Inland Revenue.
Mr Botnar was also named in Teesside magistrates court, Middlesbrough, in
January in charges brought against the manager of a Norwegian freight
transport company, alleging a corporation tax fraud in which pre-tax profits
of Nissan UK had been understated by Pounds 100m.
The company said at the time that Mr Botnar intended to 'return to the UK
shortly', but he has remained abroad.
The hearing of Mr Cholaj's action against Nissan UK was originally due to
start in late February. It was adjourned for reasons of Mr Botnar's ill
health and his incapacity to travel from his Swiss home to undergo possibly
stressful cross-examination in London.
A few weeks later, Mr Botnar travelled to Tokyo to take part in the
preliminary hearings of the arbitration of Nissan UK's claim for damages of
hundreds of millions of pounds against Nissan Motor.
Mr Cholaj, now managing director of the importer-distributor company for
Seat cars in the UK, is claiming that Mr Botnar's behaviour undermined his
position as an assistant managing director of Nissan UK. He alleges that Mr
Botnar belittled him in front of junior employees, instructed some employees
not to deal with him, refused to allow him to attend some meetings within
his area of responsibility, and in April-May 1989 took away many of his
responsibilities without prior consultation.
Mr Cholaj claims that his Pounds 125,000-a-year contract with Nissan UK had
a 10-year notice period. He is also claiming compensation for loss of annual
bonus of an additional two months salary a year, loss of the use of two
company cars by himself and by his wife, and loss of an interest-rate
subsidy on his Pounds 80,000 mortgage.
Nissan UK denies that there was any breach of contract. It claims that,
under the terms of its articles of association, Mr Botnar as managing
director exercised the powers of the board of directors. It claims that with
those powers Mr Botnar was empowered to assign and rearrange the precise
duties of his assistants.
Mr Botnar, who holds a German passport, had held the exclusive Nissan
franchise in the UK for 21 years. He built up two main companies, Nissan UK,
the Nissan vehicle importer-distributor, and Automotive and Financial Group,
one of the UK's biggest car retailing groups.
The two allied groups, of which Mr Botnar is chairman and managing director,
had a combined pre-tax profit in the 12 months to the end of July 1990 (the
last audited figures disclosed) of Pounds 142.6m on a turnover of Pounds
1.76bn.
Nissan Motor terminated Nissan UK's lucrative exclusive contract to market
and distribute Nissan vehicles in the UK with effect from the end of 1991,
plunging the Botnar-controlled companies into turmoil.
The Inland Revenue raided Nissan UK in June last year. Code-named Operation
Bluebird, it was the largest search ever undertaken by the Inland Revenue
and involved 135 of its officers and searches of 13 locations.
Two weeks ago Mr Michael Hunt, assistant managing director and deputy
chairman of Nissan UK, and Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director, were
committed for trial at the Old Bailey in London after their arrest at the
end of January on charges alleging corporation tax fraud.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S celebrations of the 25th anniversary of its capture of Arab east
Jerusalem turned into a discordant chorus of competing political claims
yesterday, as leaders of the ruling Likud party and opposition Labour sought
to turn the occasion to advantage in the campaign for the general election
on June 23.
Both Labour and Likud reiterated the popular pledge first made when Israeli
forces took east Jerusalem from Jordan on June 7, 1967. 'Our capital is one
Jerusalem, forever,' said Mr Yitzhak Shamir, prime minister. 'Never will it
be a capital for a foreign power,' he added, referring to the Arab claim
that the city be the capital of a Palestinian state.
But the two parties were at loggerheads over the celebrations. Mr Ariel
Sharon, housing minister, pledged on a visit to a new Jewish settlement in
the Moslem Quarter of the Old City to settle Jews in every Arab district,
most of which are virtual no-go areas for Israelis. The settlement policy
has been condemned as dangerously provocative by Labour and Mr Teddy Kollek,
mayor of Jerusalem.
Some 150,000 Arabs still live in the city, making up more than 25 per cent
of the population. Israel had barred Palestinians from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip from entering Jerusalem during the celebrations, which coincided
with the anniversary in the Hebrew calendar.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader and army chief of staff during the
Six-Day War of 1967, was kept off the list of speakers at a ceremony
attended by all parties for signing a 'Jerusalem covenant' to reiterate
Israel's claim to sovereignty over the city. Mr Kollek refused to speak and
signed the document under protest, objecting to its right-wing ideological
tone.
Labour hit back, even so, organising rallies at which Mr Rabin and other
former senior generals stressed that it was under their command that Israel
had achieved its greatest military triumph.
As though to blunt the message, Mr Shamir's government ordered a renewed
wave of air strikes on Hizbollah Moslem fundamentalist militia targets in
Lebanon yesterday, as a 10-day old onslaught there by Israeli forces
continued. One raid was inside territory controlled by Syrian forces.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party is this week planning to force
through the Diet controversial legislation which would allow Japanese troops
to serve on United Nations peace-keeping missions abroad.
After nearly 18 months of debate the LDP last week secured support for the
bills from two centrist parties.
Despite prolonged negotiations, the ruling party failed to reach a
compromise with the main socialist opposition party, the Social Democrats,
and is braced for some rowdy scenes in the Diet. The socialists have
threatened to disrupt proceedings.
The government is likely to triumph but it has had to dilute its original
proposals. In particular, the Diet will have a right of veto over each
proposed mission, including planned Japanese participation in United Nations
action in Cambodia.
The bills were conceived by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the height of
the Gulf crisis, in response to international criticism of Japan's failure
to send personnel to the US-led allied force.
The ministry's proposals sparked a wide-ranging debate about Japan's role in
the world, with the country dividing between those wanting the nation to
have more influence in international affairs and those claiming Japan's
pacifist constitution prohibited troops going overseas, even on UN missions.
With the Gulf crisis raging, public doubts about the risks of sending
Japanese servicemen into a war zone forced the government to abandon its
original plans. But once fighting ended, support grew for Japan to increase
its physical, and monetary, contribution to international affairs.
The dispatch of a squadron of minesweepers to the Gulf last summer prompted
little criticism, either domestically or from the governments of China and
other Asian countries which had been quick to condemn Japan in the past for
anything smacking of military action.
Drafting legislation involved tortuous inter-party discussions as the LDP
controls the lower house in the Diet but lacks a majority in the upper
house. LDP leaders also wanted to win support from as many parties as
possible - so that all could share the blame if the sensitive legislation
turned into a political millstone.
Last December the centrist Komei and Democratic Socialist parties agreed to
come on board. With their support the LDP forced legislation through the
lower house amid angry scenes.
The LDP's energies were then absorbed for some time in annual budgetary
talks and various financial scandals. Even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime
minister, pledged to support the bills he seemed too weak to secure the
necessary agreements. Some party leaders wanted action to be postponed - at
least until after elections to the Diet's upper house, to be held in July.
But a recent surge in pro-LDP sentiment in opinion polls appears to have
emboldened the party. The final draft of the legislation also contains many
concessions to the cautious. Not more than 2,000 Japanese troops will serve
in any peace-keeping force; they will be limited to support roles, such as
transport, and will not be permitted to serve in frontline units; and they
will be allowed to use arms only in self-defence. Furthermore, each time the
government decides to join a peace-keeping operation it must seek Diet
approval.

UK environmental groups heading for the Earth Summit, which opens in Rio de
Janeiro this week, launched at the weekend a series of attacks on free trade
and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the world's main
trade watchdog, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor.
Reports from the World Wide Fund for Nature, Friends of the Earth and the
Green party argue that free trade encourages unsustainable development and
serves the short-term business interests of multinational corporations,
potentially at the environment's expense.
They call for reform of the Gatt, with environmental protection being given
higher priority than free trade. Trade liberalisation should be conditional
on 'environmental impact assessments', and raw commodity prices should be
raised to take proper account of environmental costs.

FT  01 JUN 92 / ANC focuses ire on S African president: Deterioration in
relations stems directly from stalemate at Codesa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress's commitment to mass action on an
unprecedented scale in South Africa, made at its policy conference which
ended yesterday, has come at a time when relations between the government
and the organisation have plunged to a low point.
The deterioration in relations flows directly from the failure two weeks ago
to make substantial progress at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa), where a second round of constitutional talks took place. Since the
stalemate the ANC has stepped up its attacks on the government.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, launched yesterday a stinging attack on
President FW de Klerk. Mr Mandela again likened South Africa to Nazi
Germany, saying that in South Africa people were killed merely because they
were black, and talked about crimes that had been committed by the
president. Government ministers have given notice that they will respond in
kind.
A return to mass action and confrontation with the state would reflect an
attempt by the ANC to supplement its influence at the negotiation table with
popular support on the street. An ANC statement said: 'We have come to the
realisation that unless the majority of South Africans participate actively
in shaping the process, negotiations must fail.'
Although the organisation stresses that it remains committed to
negotiations, the return to 'struggle' politics is clearly a victory for
militants in the movement. This is typified by the return to prominence of
Mr Ronnie Kasrils, a marginal figure in the negotiation process, to head the
ANC's campaigns committee.
The chill in the political climate shifted attention from the ANC's four-day
policy conference, where there was a mood of realism. This was most
prominent in the economic field, with the ANC moving some distance from its
initial socialist-style pronouncements.
Although the stress is on policies which will help uplift the country's
poorest people, there is no dogmatism about the best way to achieve this.
Policy adopted by the ANC notes that the priority is 'not the legal form
that state involvement in economic activity might take at any point, but
whether such action will strengthen the ability of the economy to respond to
the massive inequalities in the country'.
The ANC says it will encourage foreign investors, adding: 'The most
important way to promote foreign investment is to establish a climate of
political stability, economic growth and transparent, consistent economic
policies.'
Mr de Klerk left yesterday on a week-long visit to Russia, Japan and
Singapore, where he will attempt to improve trade and investment links.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Bush denies rift in White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has denied rumours that he is considering turning to
Mr James Baker, secretary of state, to bring order to the White House and
direction to his re-election campaign.
While campaigning in California he denied a report that Mr Robert Mosbacher,
his campaign chairman, had urged him last week to fire Mr Samuel Skinner,
the White House chief of staff, and replace him with Mr Baker.
A State Department spokeswoman also said there had been no discussions
between Mr Bush and Mr Baker, who are old friends, about a job change. Mr
Baker ran Mr Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination in
1980 and in his position as White House chief of staff was a key figure in
the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984.
Mr Mosbacher was more equivocal. Mr Baker, he told the Washington Post
newspaper, 'can be part of the solution to any problem'. But he refused to
say whether he had urged the president to move him back to his old job.
Criticism in Washington of Mr Skinner's record has been growing since the
former secretary of transport was brought in to replace Mr John Sununu in
the White House late last year.
The president's lacklustre and frequently unfocused performance in recent
months has been ascribed to the lack of political direction he has been
receiving from his chief of staff.
On the political front, there have been complaints about lack of
co-operation between the White House and local Republican election efforts.
The White House has also seemed slow to react to the growing threat of the
independent candidacy of Mr Ross Perot, concentrating instead on traditional
attacks on the profligate tendencies of the Democratic party.
There has been uncertainty over how best to respond to the Los Angeles riots
and, most recently, confusion over the degree of support Mr Bush should lend
Vice-President Dan Quayle in his assault on the effects popular television
has on traditional family values. According to the polls, the president is
also not getting much credit for recovery in the economy.
Although Mr Mosbacher may have reflected these concerns, the former commerce
secretary is not an influential campaign chairman. His reputation was
damaged by his role as architect of the president's trip to Japan in
January, a disastrous excursion which is now seen as the beginning of the
steady decline in Mr Bush's popularity.

FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Britain severs trading links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING links between Britain and the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia were
severed at 11.30am yesterday as the UK government began to implement
sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council on Saturday.
Some 50-60 UK companies which have acquired export licences to supply goods
to Serbia and Montenegro, the target of sanctions, will be told today that
these have been revoked, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
A freeze on Yugoslav assets in the UK may not be formally implemented until
today at the earliest and may cause some complications as the banks attempt
to disentangle assets held by Serbia and Montenegro and the other former
Yugoslav states.
The government must obtain an order in council under the Emergency Powers
Act which would allow the Bank of England to issue notices to the commercial
banks freezing assets. Similar measures imposed at the time of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait were taken within 24 hours.
Yugoslavia has been reducing assets held in foreign countries in expectation
of sanctions; assets in the UK are now thought to be less than Dollars 500m
(Pounds 277.7m) against nearly Dollars 600m in June 1991. The freeze would
apply to assets held on behalf of government bodies, banks and commercial
organisations. But it was not clear if it also covered private individuals'
assets, the Bank said.
Trade sanctions cover exports to and imports from Serbia and Montenegro as
well as any activity calculated to promote trade with those countries. But
goods already shipped and imports already in transit to the UK will be
allowed to complete their journeys, the trade department said.
Airline flights to and from those destinations are also barred under the UN
sanctions.
British exports to Yugoslavia amounted to Pounds 194m in 1991 compared with
imports from that country of Pounds 148m. The top five export categories
comprised telecommunications equipment (Pounds 32m), miscellaneous
manufactured articles (Pounds 13m), medicines and pharmaceuticals (Pounds
12m), beverages (Pounds 12m) and professional and scientific equipment
(Pounds 11m).
Leading imports were electrical goods (Pounds 11m), rubber manufactured
goods (Pounds 9m), non-ferrous metals (Pounds 9m), textile yarns (Pounds
8m), and apparel (Pounds 8m).

FT  01 JUN 92 / Italy's bank chief calls for urgent action on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, called over the
weekend for the urgent introduction of an austerity package to tackle the
country's fast deteriorating public finances.
Ineffective economic policy in 1991 and in the current year had left Italy
little time to put in place the necessary measures to permit the economy to
reach the targets for convergence with the EC laid down by the Maastricht
summit, he said.
'The imbalances risk getting worse; they could preclude us from the path of
Maastricht and could well undermine the (country's) long-term productive
potential,' he said in his statement accompanying the presentation of the
bank's annual report.
He also warned: 'It could fall to us the grave responsibility of being the
ones who become an obstacle to the construction of Europe.' This was Mr
Ciampi's gloomiest annual statement since he took office more than a decade
ago.
Coming as politicians begin consultations on the formation of a new
government this week, his comments were seen as offering a technician's
economic agenda. Mr Ciampi himself is being canvassed by some in parliament
as the possible head of a new 'super ministry' of the economy, combining the
current three portfolios.
The next government, he said, had to act on four fronts - foreign exchange
and monetary policy; competition; incomes and prices; and public finances.
He was adamant on the need to maintain a strong lira within the narrow band
of the European exchange rate mechanism. Money supply had to be tightly
controlled, limiting the expansion of M2 to a band between 5 and 7 per cent.
Already money supply has edged above this upper limit.
On competition, he urged greater liberalisation of the services sector where
cartels and restrictive practices were a major contributor to inflation.
The third component of the measures, he said, should be a fairly agreed
incomes policy. However he warned that incomes could not rise above
inflation levels and, if anything, risked declining in real terms.
The main sacrifices and attention, however, had to be directed towards
Italy's public finances.
Already this year the budget is projected to have a deficit of L165,000bn
(Pounds 74.8bn) instead of L128,000bn. Measures had to be adopted to reduce
by the second half of this year the percentage of the public sector's
deficit weight on the GDP by two percentage points. A further reduction of
two percentage points was essential in 1993. Only in this way could the
present deficit, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of GDP, move towards the EC
target.
He concluded by saying: 'It is unacceptable when a society knows full well
the nature of its problems, which knows how they should be resolved . . . is
incapable of translating this into action.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Estonia to bring in own currency this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TALLINN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESTONIA plans to phase out the rouble and join the D-Mark zone when the
Baltic state later this month becomes the first part of the former Soviet
empire to introduce its own currency.
Detailing a move which brings full circle 52 years of tortuous history, Mr
Siim Kallas, president of the Bank of Estonia, said he intends to carry out
the long-awaited currency reform before the end of June.
'The desire to have our own currency is so big that the advantages outweigh
the possible disadvantages,' he told the Financial Times. The Estonian
currency, the kroon, suppressed in August 1940 in the Soviet takeover, will
be allowed to fluctuate 3 per cent either side of a central D-Mark rate.
The link has been closely discussed with the German Bundesbank. Although the
Bundesbank will be under no obligation to support the kroon, 'the Germans
have nothing against the link,' Mr Kallas said. The Bank of Estonia has been
given an independent statute closely modelled on the Bundesbank Law.
Estonian leaders stressed at the weekend that the kroon's reintroduction
marks an important step towards recovering the country's still-restricted
sovereignty.
The kroon will be backed primarily by 11.3 tonnes of gold in Estonia's newly
reconstituted monetary reserves. New kroon banknotes, to replace the
estimated 3bn roubles in circulation, are stored in strategic spots around
the country. They have been printed by the British banknote company, De La
Rue.
Total roubles, including deposits, to be replaced amount to Rbs13bn -
Rbs14bn.
Speaking of the coming currency switch, Mr Arnold Ruutel, the Estonian
president, said: 'We can no longer remain in the rouble zone. It has no
value. People have no incentive to work.'
He warned, however, that Estonia was 'aware of the problems' of suddenly
introducing a convertible currency. Unemployment in the 1.5m population
state was likely to rise to 100,000 by the end of the year.
The currency reform is being worked out in close collaboration with the
International Monetary Fund, which Estonia has just joined. An IMF team is
due in Tallinn at the end of this week. A delegation of trade ministers and
state bank chiefs from the Commonwealth of Independent States is also coming
on Friday to discuss the new arrangements.
Mr Kallas, just back from a trip to the IMF, said he hoped the reform would
psychologically boost Estonia's depressed economy. 'The whole economy is
waiting for the kroon.'
The IMF is predicting a 20 per cent fall in real gross domestic product this
year, but Mr Kallas said there were signs the worst of the collapse was
over.
Estonia would negotiate a standby credit from the IMF, and was discussing
mobilising its gold through 'swap' credits through the Bank for
International Settlements.
Total monetary reserves are about Dollars 120m, of which all but about
Dollars 10m represents gold. Mr Kallas hoped part of the Dollars 250m in
foreign currency deposits held abroad by Estonian individuals and
enterprises would return to the central bank after the reform.
The freshly printed kroons are ready to be handed out by 22,000 helpers in
700 exchange points around the country.
The exact date and conversion details had not been decided, but Mr Kallas
said the exchange rate to the D-Mark could be similar to that of the
Austrian schilling. The operation might take place on the weekend of June
20-21, the 44th anniversary of the introduction of the D-Mark in western
Germany on June 20, 1948.
Mr Kallas visited Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, in
Frankfurt a month ago to discuss the conversion. Mr Tietmeyer warned him
that the operation was not comparable to the dramatic entry of the D-Mark
into eastern Germany on July 1, 1990, which paved the way for reunification.
'Then we just took over,' Mr Kallas quoted Mr Tietmeyer as saying. On this
occasion - for the first time for half a century - the Estonians will be in
charge.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Yeltsin signals change in economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN has signalled a sharp change of course in Russian economic
policy in the face of rising public discontent.
The turnround was highlighted at the weekend when the Russian president said
he would resist pressure from the International Monetary Fund to raise
energy prices to world levels and fired his energy minister, who supported
price liberalisation.
He confessed his unease over the effects of radical economic reforms in
talks with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, on
Saturday. According to Mr Delors, Mr Yeltsin told him that 'the Russian
people still support me - but their patience has its limit'.
Mr Yeltsin met Mr Delors on his return to Moscow after a tour of Russian
provincial centres where he was the target of fierce criticism about the
effects of economic reform.
Mr Yeltsin's remarks follow serious difficulties in the Russian cabinet with
its reform programme. Last week, the Russian parliament refused to pass laws
on privatisation and bankruptcy, threatening the planned transfer of state
property into private hands - the core of the government's economic
strategy.
The Russian president told a weekend conference of managers of the country's
oil and gas enterprises that he would resist pressure from the IMF to raise
energy prices. Instead, an 'expert group' has been established to analyse
the effects of energy price rises.
Mr Yeltsin dismissed from office Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the energy minister,
and replaced him with Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, a former Soviet minister of
the gas industry. Mr Lopukhin had been a supporter of free energy prices. He
failed to stop the fall in oil production and in recent weeks has faced a
rising threat of strikes in the oil producing regions.
Mr Delors said at the weekend that Mr Yeltsin had complained to him that
none of the Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13bn) of foreign assistance put up by the
leading foreign industrial countries and the IMF had been paid.
The Russian president told Mr Delors he would press for a more efficient
mechanism of payment at his meeting with G7 leaders in Munich next month.
Mr Yegor Gaidar the first deputy prime minister, pressed Mr Delors for a
five-year moratorium of repayments of Russian debt to western countries -
estimated at about Dollars 62bn - and for a relaxation of the Cocom rules
which prohibit the export of advanced technology from the industrial
countries to Russia.
Mr Delors said he cautioned the Russian leaders against 'expecting too much
from Munich' and said the conference would set stiff conditions for Russia
and the other former Soviet states.
Mr Gaidar said yesterday that the Russian government planned a big increase
in the print run of rouble notes in the next two months - including the
introduction of a new Rbs5,000 note - to try to alleviate a cash shortage
caused by soaring prices, AP-DJ reports from Moscow.
Speaking on Commonwealth television, he said that, although likely to fuel
inflation, a boost in the money supply was the only way to soothe an
'explosive situation' in the economy and among workers whose payrolls had
not been met.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Compass poised to take lead in contract catering
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPASS GROUP is poised to become the UK's biggest provider of meals in
staff canteens through the Pounds 500m-plus purchase of its bigger rival
Gardner Merchant from Forte, the hotels and restaurants group.
Its partner in the deal, paying between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m, is ARA
Services, a private US company whose food services interests range from
provision of the traditional hot-dogs at US ballparks to official caterer
for the Barcelona Olympics.
It is expected to take Gardner's US business and enough of the UK corporate
catering contracts to fend off potential difficulties with the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Mr Francis Mackay, Compass's chief executive, estimated recently that about
half the UK's Pounds 1.5bn corporate catering market is contracted out.
Gardner is the leader and its client list has included Cadbury Schweppes,
Barclays Bank and Pilkington. It is also the biggest catering contractor in
UK hospitals and schools, a market estimated at Pounds 3.3bn but where only
5 per cent has so far been contracted out.
Compass's biggest corporate customer is BT, with a catering turnover of
about Pounds 50m a year.
Mr Mackay reckoned that Compass and Gardner together took about 50 per cent
of the outside catering contracts, involving thousands of companies. The
threshold for arousing Office of Fair Trading interest in a deal is 25 per
cent for one company, and this could lead to a referral to the MMC. It is
understood that Compass has had talks with the OFT.
Compass will pay roughly Pounds 450m for the bulk of Gardner Merchant, which
last year made Pounds 47m operating profit on sales of Pounds 1.13bn. About
Pounds 220m of this was overseas and Mr Mackay stressed the advantages of
taking Compass on to the continent.
A rights issue to raise nearly Pounds 200m to help fund the purchase is
expected; the rest would be funded by debt. With its shares suspended at 492
1/2 p yesterday, Compass's market value was nearly Pounds 330m. Its annual
turnover in the year to September was Pounds 321m, on which it made an
operating profit of Pounds 38.1m and Pounds 32m before tax.
Forte will use the money to expand its brands internationally, including
motorway catering and the Travelodge and Posthouse hotel chains. Mr Rocco
Forte, chief executive, said the immediate effect would be to cut Forte's
debt-equity gearing from 43 per cent to 23 per cent.
The business being acquired by Compass includes airline catering and outdoor
events. Its Town and County subsidiary covers the Wimbledon tennis
tournament.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Revised trial data led Britain to ban Halcion: 'Very high
frequency' of adverse side effects found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN banned Halcion, the controversial sleeping pill which is still on
sale in many other countries, after receiving details of a clinical trial in
which half of the patients taking the drug suffered 'psychiatric events'
including hallucinations and amnesia.
Revised data from the trial provided by Upjohn, the US company which makes
Halcion, demonstrated a 'very high frequency' of adverse side effects,
according to a report on the drug by the UK's Committee on Safety of
Medicines (CSM). The committee, which advises the Department of Health, said
there was a causal link between Halcion, the world's best-selling sleeping
pill, and psychiatric events.
The drug was banned in the UK last October after Upjohn refused to withdraw
it voluntarily.
Norway, Finland, Bermuda and Argentina also withdrew the drug, while
restrictions on dosing levels have been imposed in France and Spain. The
final result of an appeal in the UK by Upjohn is expected imminently.
The CSM report raises questions as to why an advisory panel of the US Food
and Drug Administration, which had access to the revised data, recommended
last week that there was no reason to withdraw Halcion. The document,
obtained by Scrip, an independent London-based industry newsletter, alleges
Upjohn failed to report 73 per cent of psychiatric events recorded during a
clinical trial in 1972.
The trial, known as Protocol 321, involved testing the drug on prisoners in
the US. Such testing has since been abandoned.
The original data submitted by Upjohn suggested there were 123 psychiatric
events among prisoners taking the drug. However, the company admitted in
revised data last year that 453 events were recorded. Upjohn said yesterday
the 73 per cent under-recording was due to a transcription error.
The new data were only provided by the company after defence lawyers in a US
murder trial argued that Halcion was to blame for a woman killing her
mother. The defendant, Mrs Ilo Grundberg, shot her mother eight times while
allegedly under the influence of Halcion. She was acquitted.
The FDA is still investigating alleged irregularities in procedures and
reporting practices in the original data. Upjohn said yesterday it was
co-operating with the review, but maintained it had not intentionally misled
the regulatory agency.
Upjohn said Protocol 321 had been discussed at the FDA advisory panel on May
18. The company said it stood by the evidence given at that time and by the
decision of the committee. Upjohn said Halcion was safe and effective when
used as recommended for short-term treatment.
Halcion's worldwide sales fell by 39 per cent during the first quarter of
this year. Last year Halcion accounted for Dollars 237m (Pounds 131m) of
Upjohn's Dollars 3.4bn sales.
Upjohn announced yesterday it was beginning a strategic review of all
operations. It plans to freeze wages and stop hiring until the study is
complete.

A STRONGER yen and higher bond prices pushed up futures, and equities rose
on arbitrage and short-term buying by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average advanced 416.50, or 2.3 per cent, to 18,347.75, up 0.7
per cent on the week. It opened at the day's low of 17,968.09 and reached a
high of 18,363.51 in the afternoon.
Volume rose slightly from 208m shares to 230m. Traders noted activity by
individuals and foreigners. Advances led declines by 758 to 201 with 157
unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks rose 20.01 to
1,376.32 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.52 to 1,089.97.
Wall Street's rise on Thursday also bolstered sentiment, and speculative
theme stocks once again led trading.
Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y912, and
JGC, the plant engineering company, advanced Y20 to Y2,120. Ricoh, the
office equipment maker, gained Y3 to Y529 on buying by dealers and
individuals; some investors regard low-priced blue chips with weak profits
as possible merger and acquisition targets.
Banks closed higher in spite of poor results. Combined pre-tax profits for
the 11 leading commercial banks fell by 14 per cent, but traders said that
the negative news had already been factored into stock prices. Foreign
brokers were seen buying 'baskets' of bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan
rose Y30 to Y1,850 and Fuji Bank advanced Y40 to Y1,500. Utilities gained on
hopes of lower interest rates, Tokyo Electric Power rose Y30 to Y2,790.
Some investors were concerned over reports that Yamaichi Securities, a
leading broker, was being sued by Showa Mining - a glassfibre material maker
listed on the second section of the exchange - for mishandling its
investments.
Although Yamaichi denied the reports, Showa said that it had posted
extensive losses because of Yamaichi's shuffling of investments. Analysts
fear further revelations and law suits will hurt confidence.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 277.36 to 20,877.88 in volume of 14.9m
shares.
Roundup
With the exception of Bangkok, still upset by political uncertainty, the
region was stronger yesterday.
HONG KONG regained nearly all of Thursday's losses, lifted by a continued
inflow of overseas money. The Hang Seng index closed 92.02, or 1.5 per cent
higher at 6080.15, 3.8 per cent higher on the week in turnover up from
HKDollars 5.35bn to HKDollars 5.7bn.
Cheung Kong topped the most active list, climbing HKDollars 1 to HKDollars
26.70. Its chairman, Mr Li Ka-shing, declined to comment on a British press
report that he was negotiating to buy Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf
development in London's Docklands.
BANGKOK extended its losses on the slow progress in finding a successor for
the former prime minister, Suchinda Kraprayoon. The SET Index ended 15.99
lower on the day and 4.1 per cent lower on the week at 688.84 in moderate
turnover of Bt4.05bn.
TAIWAN recouped less of Thursday's fall, closing 18.25 higher at 4,519.27,
2.3 per cent lower on the week in turnover down from TDollars 21.9bn to
TDollars 17.7bn.
NEW ZEALAND rose to a 12-month high with foreign buying of blue-chip issues
leading the advance. The NZSE-40 index closed up 16.19 at 1,574.87, up 1.5
per cent on the week. Turnover was NZDollars 41m.
Fletcher Challenge advanced 6 cents to NZDollars 3.74 while Telecom saw
strong US interest lift its shares 4 cents to NZDollars 2.10 in volume of
5.5m shares.
BOMBAY was subdued at the start of the new two-week account trading period
after carry-forward charges were sharply raised on fears that some brokers
might default.
The BSE Index fell 66.40, or 2.2 per cent to 3,006.08, 12.5 per cent lower
on the week.

The market has still to react to the mid-May preliminary index for the cost
of living in western Germany, up 0.3 per cent on the month and 4.5 per cent
higher than 12 months earlier. Turnover yesterday fell from DM5.7bn to
DM4.6bn.
Dealers said that there had been demand for selected stocks; in utilities,
modestly in favour recently, Veba rose DM3.20 to DM410.20 and RWE by DM4.80
to DM414.80; and among carmakers, Volkswagen led with a DM6 rise to DM410.
Lufthansa rose DM6.30 to DM135, up a lot on the day but sadly down in a
painful year for the shares. Continental, the tyremaker, ended down DM4 at
DM272.00 after a state court in Hanover ruled that the move in March 1991 to
scrap its voting rights restrictions was null and void.
PARIS was firmer by the close after a weak morning session when arbitrage
ahead of the expiry of May futures and options drove the index lower. The
CAC-40 index closed up 19.20 at 2,033.29, but was down 0.6 per cent on the
week. Turnover was estimated at FFr3bn.
Both Euro Disney and Eurotunnel were again in the spotlight. The market was
rife with rumours including unsubstantiated reports that the theme park had
been losing staff since it opened. Its shares closed down FFr2.50 or 2 per
cent at FFr121.0. Eurotunnel weakened during the session ahead of a meeting
with its bankers, closing 30 centimes lower at FFr36.25. At the close it was
announced that the banks had agreed to release further funds, enabling the
project to continue.
Elsewhere, Peugeot rose FFr18 to FFr798 and Societe Generale lifted FFr26 to
FFr545.
MILAN traded uncertainly ahead of today's Bank of Italy annual meeting and
further political developments next week, but the Comit index rose 1.98 to
496.60, 0.6 per cent higher on the week.
Shares in Pirelli SpA, the former suitor of Germany's Continental, dipped on
the German court news from Hanover and then recovered to close just L6.50
lower at 1,425.50. Owning 5 per cent of Conti, and with options on a further
34 per cent, Pirelli could have gained from a decision to scrap the voting
limit, one of the reasons for the failure of its bid for the German tyre
maker last year.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index closed 5.70 higher at 991.50, 1 per
cent lower on the week, on selective demand for Swedish blue chips. The
narrow SX-16 index, which tracks the 16 most active stocks, rose 1 per cent
on the day.
Shares were helped by a decline in Swedish money market rates and a surge in
Ericsson B, the session's most active stock - up SKr5 to SKr148 in turnover
of SKr40m - on speculation that the group is close to winning a SKr1bn US
mobile telephone order. Volvo also advanced with the B up SKr8 to SKr418.
AMSTERDAM closed with the CBS Tendency index 0.7 ahead at 131.0, a 0.5 per
cent increase on the week.
Ahold, which presents first quarter figures next week, was unchanged at Fl
86.80. Morgan Stanley has recently reiterated its hold recommendation on the
stock. Pirelli Tyre Holding advanced Fl 1.40 or 5 per cent to Fl 29.70 ahead
of next week's annual meeting.
MADRID saw strong month-end activity in the last minutes of trading push the
index ahead, closing up 2.02 at 261.06 for a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.
Turnover was estimated at Pta24bn.
COPENHAGEN climbed in active trading, the CSE index closing 5.74 higher at
347.48 after opinion polls showed a clear majority of Danes planning to vote
'Yes' in Tuesday's referendum on the EC Maastricht treaty.

FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Paris braces itself for flurry of
equity issues - But unless interest rates fall, the market may remain
inactive until the autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parisians poured out of the city on Wednesday night to fait le pont for a
long Ascension weekend, and their stock market settled down to slumber
through the long, hot summer months.
The CAC 40 index, which rose rapidly in early spring, has been distinctly
dull this month. This week, it fell further after Tuesday's announcement by
Mr Michel Sapin - who recently replaced Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's
finance minister when the latter was appointed prime minister - that
official interest rates were unlikely to fall until the Bundesbank took a
lead by reducing German rates.
The index ended the week at 2,033, still healthily higher than the
psychological benchmark of 2,000 but well below its 2,145 high.
Unfortunately for French investors, the omens for the summer months are
scarcely scintilating.
'It's difficult to be optimistic,' said Mr David Finch, a director of the
stockbroking subsidiary of Finacor in Paris. 'The Paris market has had a
very strong run over the past few months. A lot of fund managers are now
overweight in French stocks. Unless there is a sudden change of heart on
interest rates, the market is likely to stay within the 1,960 to 2,100 band
until the autumn.'
The pedestrian prospects for the Paris market certainly do not reflect any
concern about the underlying strength of the economy. France may have
experienced a slowdown in growth last year but it has been spared the
serious slowdowns - and recessions - that have beset so many of its trading
partners.
On Tuesday Mr Sapin also announced the first official growth figures for the
first quarter of 1992. These were slightly higher than expected at 1.1 per
cent compared with the same period last year, and came with an increase in
exports of 4.3 per cent. In an interview published in Thursday's edition of
Liberation, the finance minister suggested that France may surpass the
government's initial estimate of 2 per cent growth for the whole of 1992,
possibly achieving growth of around 2.5 per cent.
A report by Banque Indosuez in Paris concluded that 'activity can be
expected to continue to move positively, but without any great acceleration'
for the rest of the year, reflecting moderate growth in consumer spending
and a slow increase in industrial investment.
The flurry of first quarter sales figures published in the past two or three
weeks have echoed this stable, steady scenario. The only exceptions are the
cyclical stocks in sectors such as luxury goods, which may be affected by
the economic problems of Japan, one of the most important markets for French
fashion and fragrances, and construction, still exposed to the general
European economic slowdown.
LVMH, one of France's largest luxury goods group, saw its shares come under
pressure this week after Mr Bernard Arnault, its chairman, issued a cautious
statement and some analysts warned that they would have to downgrade their
1992 profit estimates.
Eurotunnel was hit by rumours that its failure to reach an agreement with
its construction contractors could scupper the whole scheme. This
speculation also affected the shares of Bouyges, France's biggest
construction company and one of the largest Eurotunnel contractors, after it
announced plans for a capital increase on Monday.
Meanwhile, the share price of Euro Disney was affected by unconfirmed
reports that attendance at the theme park, which opened last month at Marne
La Vallee outside Paris, had been lower than expected.
Mr Finch of Finacor suspects that such stocks will remain under pressure,
but that more mainstream stocks - particularly in consumer-related sectors
such as cars - will continue to outperform.
Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, has been
sufficiently cheered by the stream of first quarter sales figures to stick
to his forecast of a 15 to 20 per cent increase in earnings for the CAC 40
companies this year, compared with last year's fall of 7 per cent.
Although the outlook seems stable on the corporate front, the progress of
the market could be impeded by the stream of proposed new equity issues. The
government is the chief instigator, thanks to its partial privatisation
programme, which got underway in March with the FFr2.08bn sale of a 2.3 per
cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group.
France's other major oil group, Total, is next on the list for partial
privatisation.
Other state-controlled companies are keen to follow suit. Rhone Poulenc, the
chemicals group, has made no secret of its hopes of partial privatisation.
The three public sector insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP),
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Group des Assurances Nationales
(GAN) - are also awaiting the final plans for their share sales.
Meanwhile, a series of private sector companies have also announced plans to
tap the market for capital. Bouyges did so on Monday followed by Alcatel
Cable on Tuesday. Lafarge-Coppee, the construction materials company, is
rumoured to be considering an issue, as is Michelin.
There is no cause for concern about the ability of the market to absorb
these issues. Indeed, one of its main problems is a shortage of equity. But
the prospect of so many new shares being issued at a time when investors are
already overweight certainly sharpens the chances of a sleepy summer for the
bourse.

FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips back after hitting
record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES ended the day modestly lower yesterday after soaring to record
levels in the morning yesterday, bolstered by a strong first quarter GDP
advance, lower bond market yields and buoyant overseas markets, writes Karen
Zagor in New York.
The day started on a strong note, following Thursday's record close, and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the important 3,400 level within minutes
of opening and remained above that level until the last half hour of
trading. Contributing to the bullishness was a report that GDP had risen 2.4
per cent in the first quarter, its most substantial gain since the same
period of 1989.
The Dow's failure to hold above 3,400, however, caused some analysts to
speculate that the market is now set to turn lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,396.88, down 1.55 in moderately
heavy volume of more than 204m shares. Advancing issues led those declining
by 966 to 726. While the more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also moved
lower, sliding 1.39 to 415.35, the Nasdaq composite bucked the trend to rise
4.82 to 585.31. On Thursday, the Dow rose 27.99 to 3,398.43.
A second day of declining bond yields also bolstered the equity market
through most of the day. In late trading, the treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond was  1/4 higher at 101 27/32 , yielding 7.833 per cent.
Airline stocks recovered some of their previous day's losses. Shares in AMR,
parent of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Delta
Airlines was unchanged at Dollars 57; UAL, parent of United Airlines, added
Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 118 3/8 and USAir was Dollars 1/2 higher at Dollars
12 5/8 .
Pharmaceutical company stocks saw active trading, with Merck slipping
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 and Glaxo's ADR's up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
28 1/4 .
Trading was heavy in a number of blue-chip stocks including General Motors,
up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 39 7/8 and Citicorp, Dollars  1/8 higher at
Dollars 18 5/8 .
Shares in Centel, the Chicago-based local phone company which has agreed to
merge with Sprint at a price well under market valuations, edged Dollars
1/8 higher to Dollars 32 after plunging Dollars 10 1/2 a day earlier.
Sprint, which dropped Dollars 1 3/8 on Thursday, lost Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 23.
Among other cellular phone stocks which were battered on the Centel merger
news, GTE regained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 , McCaw Cellular eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 , and Lin Broadcasting slipped Dollars 1 to
Dollars 67.
Shares in Rockefeller Center, the real estate investment trust, tumbled
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 3/8 after Lehman Brothers downgraded its rating
on the stock amid concerns that Rockefeller might cut its dividend.
Canada
TORONTO posted a small advance in moderate trading. Based on preliminary
figures, the composite index was up 12.59 points, or 0.37 per cent, to
3,387.93, for a gain on the week of about 16 points. Advances led declines
by 317 to 264, volume fell to 20.404m shares from 25.594m shares on
Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 223.8m against CDollars 324.7m.
Royal Bank of Canada, up  3/4 to 23 1/4 , reported slightly lower
second-quarter earnings. It said it has classified CDollars 510m of its
CDollars 780m of loans to Olympia &amp; York as non-performing.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar faces difficult session
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A catastrophic overnight session, the dollar began to pick up in early
European trading.
Traders said the dollar's collapse in Asian operations had been sparked by a
combination of weak money supply data, heavy selling by a big US trader,
intervention by the Bank of Japan and a host of stop-loss sales.
The slide in the M2 measure of the money supply disappointed expectations of
a Dollars 3.7bn drop. Instead M2 fell Dollars 7.4bn to put annual growth at
2.3 per cent, below the Federal Reserve's target range of 2.5 to 6.5 per
cent.
There was slightly better news for the dollar around mid-day when revised
GDP data were released, showing that GDP growth in the first quarter was 2.4
per cent rather than 2 per cent.
That marks the best quarterly growth in three years and contrasts sharply
with 0.4 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 1991. However, the
revision was not as good as some had hoped and failed to persuade
dollar-bulls to hang on to the US currency.
In late trading, as more decided to cut their losses and sell, the dollar
tested support below DM1.6050. By the close it had sunk to DM1.6070 after a
DM1.6265 London close on Thursday and to Y127.70 from Y128.33.
In early US operations the dollar bounced off its lows, but was still down
half a pfennig on the D-mark and down half a yen on the Japanese currency.
Trading of European currencies was fairly quiet as many dealers extended
Thursday's Ascension day holiday into the weekend.
Often a beneficiary of dollar weakness, the D-mark was inert yesterday,
ending steady in the EMS grid.
The escudo stayed firmly at the top of the grid at 5.9 per cent above the
weakest currency, still the Danish crown.
The Swiss franc lost a little ground after its spectacular recovery during
the week, but still closed firmer than on Wednesday.
Traders reported solid, broad-based buying. This partly reflected recent
rises in Swiss market interest rates and partly the unwinding of a big
dollar/Swiss position by a big US operator.
The Swiss currency continued to benefit from comments made on Wednesday by
Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss national bank president. He said he would like
to see the currency strengthen.
The D-mark was quoted at 90.78 centimes, up from 90.54 at the opening but
below Wednesday's final 91.15 centimes.
Sterling was side lined in the three-way battle between the dollar, D-mark
and yen but remained static on the D-mark and firm on the dollar.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money market bustled yesterday after the Bank of England forecast the
biggest liquidity shortage of the year, but with sentiment unchanged, period
rates barely moved.
'The undertone is good in the market,' said one dealer. 'It still feels that
the next move in base rates will be down but that progress is going to be
slow.'
Cash rates for one-month and three-month money eased slightly. The
three-month interbank rate closed at 10 1/16 per cent, after Thursday's
close of 10 1/8 per cent.
Six-month money was unchanged at 10 per cent as was one-year money which
closed at 9 15/16 per cent.
The Bank of England's initial forecast of the day's liquidity shortage was
Pounds 2.6bn - already twice the size of Thursday's shortage.
This was then revised to Pounds 2.9bn - the biggest shortage of the year,
although not quite an all-time record. According to the Bank of England,
there were shortages of Pounds 3bn on a number of occasions last year.
Traders said explanations for the size of the shortages were mainly
technical. Shortages, generated by the Bank's gilts funding programme, had
accumulated, pressured further by the loss of Monday's operations because of
the bank holiday.
In the early round the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 953m followed
later with a purchase of Pounds 494m of bills. This still left a rump of
Pounds 1.65bn to be removed and the overnight rate firmed to 10 1/4 per cent
from an earlier 9 5/8 per cent.
In the afternoon the Bank bought bills worth Pounds 798m across the bands.
Late assistance of Pounds 590m took total interventions of the day to Pounds
2.8bn, all but taking out the shortage.
Overnight rates fluctuated between a low of 9 1/2 per cent and a high of 15
per cent.
Trading was thin on the sterling futures market. The September contract
traded in a four-tick range closing unchanged on the day at 90.36. The June
contract drifted down to 90.02, also unchanged from the previous close.
German call money rates firmed to just below the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent
Lombard rate due mainly to end of the month technical factors.
Traders quoted call money at 9.65 per cent, up from 9.55 per cent on
Wednesday.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel gets more breathing space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and WILL DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL earned a temporary reprieve from its bankers yesterday when the
syndicate providing Pounds 6.8bn of credit facilities said the company could
draw further funds.
The company now has a breathing space until August or September - the
lenders have said Eurotunnel must try to settle its disputes with the
tunnel's building contractors regarding cost overruns before it spends
another Pounds 500m. Eurotunnel is likely to have used this money within
three months.
Eurotunnel had broken its loan covenants and so had to persuade 65 per cent
of its lenders to waive a covenant and allow it to go on drawing loans. This
level of support from the banks was reached by a clear margin.
The deadline for the agreement was yesterday.
The waiver was especially welcome to Eurotunnel after a week of uncertainty
in which Bouygues, a French contractor in the Transmanche Link builders'
consortium, called Eurotunnel's creditworthiness into question.
A remark by Mr Martin Bouygues, group chairman, that 'one cannot completely
exclude the hypothesis that Eurotunnel will go bankrupt' caused a sharp drop
in the share price. Eurotunnel said Mr Bouygues' claims were unfounded.
Eurotunnel shares closed 11p higher at 370p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits before tax of Dakota Group, the USM-quoted packaging products,
technical manuals, brochures and promotional literature group, fell from
IPounds 820,000 to IPounds 144,000 (Pounds 131,000) for the half year to
end-March.
Turnover fell to IPounds 13.63m (IPounds 15.14m) and fully diluted earnings
to 0.2p (2.2P). The interim dividend is being omitted - 0.5p was paid
previously.
The group is reducing its 55 per cent stake in Formprint to 18 per cent via
the sale of a 37 per cent interest to the company's management for IPounds
75,000. The sale will result in an IPounds 1.25m extraordinary write-down in
its full-year results.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Castle Mill tumbles into Pounds 6.51m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Mill International, the clothing and gifts group, reported a
significant loss for 1991.
As warned at the end of March, the second half was hit by a difficult
trading climate. This, coupled with disposals in 1990, contributed to a fall
in sales from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 9.82m. Last year's pre-tax profit of
Pounds 313,861 swung into losses of Pounds 6.51m. At the interim stage
losses were Pounds 913,000.
During the year the loss-making businesses of Faril Children's Character
Clothing and Force Sportive Women's Leisurewear were sold.
In addition a substantial provision was made in Hayjax and Giftmate with a
view to reshaping them.
To strengthen the balance sheet the company's bankers have agreed to place
Pounds 3.1m of borrowings on to term loans of two and three years at lower
interest rates.
Losses per share were 50.4p (0.8p earnings) and again there is no dividend.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Minstergate lower as interest received
falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest received as a result of 'significant falls in interest rates'
meant that pre-tax profits at Minstergate fell from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds
951,000 for the six months to February 29.
The group, which is involved in property management and development with one
manufacturing subsidiary, improved turnover to Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 1.39m)
and there was a reduced trading loss of Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 172,000).
Performance within each division had been above expectations, the company
said.
However, interest received dropped from Pounds 1.42m to Pounds 958,000.
Earnings per share worked through at 25.43p (36.43p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Southnews, the USM-quoted London regional newspaper publisher,
rose 10p to 104p yesterday on news of a swing from losses of Pounds 987,000
to profits of Pounds 899,000 pre-tax for the year to March 28.
The 1990 losses were struck after taking account of exceptional
reorganisation costs of Pounds 916,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14.1m. The directors said the
'recruitment' category of the advertising business accounted for 70 per cent
of the decline.
Earnings emerged at 3.93p (losses 5.24p). A final dividend of 1p makes a
1.5p (0.8p) total.
Year-end gearing was cut from 71 per cent to 17 per cent and the balance
sheet was further strengthened via the sale earlier this month of newspaper
interests in Bognor Regis and Chichester.

FT  30 MAY 92 / And not a drop to spray: The water crisis in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers unimpressed by British Rail's excuse that trains were running late
last year because of the 'wrong type of snow' might not take kindly to
explanations of the UK's water crisis. It was caused, experts say, by the
wrong type of rain.
Some 20m customers have faced hosepipe bans at some time in the past three
years, and many remain in force. Scarcely any newspaper or news broadcast
this week has not carried water shortage reports. And yet, consumers might
ask: what drought? Where are the parched yellow lawns, the crazy paving of
dried-out reservoir beds that made the last drought, in 1976, so visible?
Even the Meteorological Office admits that overall rainfall in the UK has
been 20 per cent above normal in the past three months. The problem since
1988 is that rain has been falling at the wrong time - in summer and autumn,
instead of in winter - and in the wrong places. Scotland and northern
England have been wet, while eastern and southern England have suffered
their longest dry spell since 1745.
In the English lowlands, concludes the Institute of Hydrology, which
monitors water on behalf of the Department of the Environment, 'the current
exceptionally protracted dry episode is without modern parallel'.
There is widespread agreement on the severity of the problem, and the
pressing need to do something about it. Prince Charles voiced his concern
this week, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, launched a
wide-ranging review of water resources. The water companies are under
pressure to offer some constructive ideas as they report their annual
results. But there is less agreement on what should be done.
What makes the problem so serious - and different from 1976 - is that this
time groundwater has been most severely affected. Not only is groundwater
the principal source of supply in much of southern England, it feeds natural
springs which are largely responsible for the summer and autumn flow of many
of the nation's rivers. It is not easily replaced.
Exacerbating such problems of nature is a man-made problem - an increasingly
affluent population. As dishwashers and daily baths have become commonplace,
demand for water has soared by 70 per cent over the past 30 years to 38bn
gallons a day. More than half of this is used by domestic customers, with a
family of four likely to consume some 125 gallons a day.
But consumption is not the only factor brought into focus by the drought.
The structure of the water industry itself is being scrutinised.
Privatisation has left the UK with twin contradictions at the heart of its
water system. Water suppliers have a duty to their shareholders as well as
their customers; and while the government is committed to water
conservation, the water companies have a commercial obligation to supply as
much water as possible.
Given the inability of many companies to meet demand, the forecast increase
in profits due to be reported by the water industry in England and Wales may
not be welcome news for consumers. Telephone callers to the Redhill offices
of East Surrey water company were greeted this week by a recorded message.
'If your call relates to our current restrictions, hosepipes and sprinklers
cannot be used until further notice.' On Wednesday East Surrey announced a
42 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 5.54m and a 19.5 per cent rise in
the dividend.
Profit rises at the larger companies will be more modest, probably averaging
9 per cent. On Thursday, North West Water, the first big company to report,
unveiled a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 230.1m in the
year to March 31. Next week, Thames Water is likely to report profits
increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 230m while Anglian will follow with a 12
per cent increase to Pounds 170m. Dividends are likely to average 10 per
cent growth.
After last year's 14 per cent average increase in profits, water companies
are facing criticism for raising prices, profits and dividends while
customers see few benefits.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the industry regulator, has already
fired off a couple of directives, calling on companies to lower their
dividend growth rates to release more funds for investment, and warning
against companies using water-related profits to support non-water, and
therefore non-regulated, businesses such as laboratory testing and
environmental services.
Mr Byatt's views on dividends are dismissed by the industry, which claims
investors will shun its issues if they are not adequately rewarded. Such
share offerings could be vital, because the industry urgently needs
sustained investment to improve water quality, sewerage and the underground
mains. The total cost of improvements required before the end of the decade
is estimated at Pounds 30bn. Where that money will come from is not yet
clear.
The most immediate problem is to refurbish old and often crumbling pipeline
systems, from which leakage sometimes accounts for a quarter of all water
pumped. Some companies have started remedial action. Thames has reduced its
leakage rate from 23 per cent to 17 per cent in the past three years and has
an eventual target of 10 per cent. Some smaller companies, such as East
Surrey, now devote more than half their spending to reducing leakage.
Despite these efforts to stem water loss, critics say spending is too
little, too late. The companies counter that given other requirements on
water quality, including a 1995 deadline to meet stringent new rules on
pesticide contents, there is just not enough cash to meet all their
requirements.
Longer-term remedies will also be needed to boost supplies. The National
Rivers Authority earlier this year published a paper examining the options.
Some of the more fanciful suggestions, including towing icebergs from the
North Pole, and offshore desalination plants, were immediately dismissed as
unsuitable and too costly.
The idea of a national water grid, to pump water from plentiful areas to
those of need, is more attractive. But once again, the NRA says, the
infrastructure cost would be 'several billion pounds'. A more feasible
solution might be to use the existing canal system.
On the demand side, only a certain amount can be achieved through hosepipe
bans and calls for prudence. The Department of the Environment, the NRA and
Ofwat agree that what is needed is a sea change in public attitudes, so that
water is treated as a valuable commodity, not a limitless resource.
Instilling such an attitude may entail water metering, a reality in every
European country except the UK and Norway.
A pilot scheme in the Isle of Wight has led to savings of at least 10 per
cent in water consumption. But fitting and monitoring meters would cost
about Pounds 160 per household - or Pounds 4bn nationwide.
Businesses, offices and public buildings could save water without such high
spending. Flowsave, a Kent-based company that makes water-saving devices,
estimates that most business users could reduce their wastage of
non-essential water - used in washrooms, for example - by 75 per cent.
Water-saving equipment has already been fitted at British Aerospace, Rover,
several banks and building societies, and at the Royal Courts of Justice.
There is less scope to cut down water consumption where it is central to an
industrial process. Industrial usage other than the power generators
accounts for less than 10 per cent of all consumption.
Electricity generators are by far the biggest users, responsible for about a
third of total consumption. But as PowerGen, the privatised generator,
points out, water used for cooling is a fundamental part of the generating
process. 'All the savings that could be made have probably already been
made.'
If action on both supply and demand is not taken, and rain fails for the
next three or four years, the water system would face an unprecedented
crisis. Both farmers and food prices could suffer, as crops will be lost.
Mr Howard's review will be keenly awaited. After four years of the wrong
type of rain, the last thing Britain needs is the wrong type of solutions.

FT  30 MAY 92 / A fight at the opera: A crisis looms at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tonight on the stage of Covent Garden Maria Ewing will sing the title role
in Peter Hall's acclaimed production of Salome. Sing - and dance, too,
provocatively dropping every one of the seven veils.
A feeling of exposure is one that she shares with Jeremy Isaacs, the
rumbustious Scot whose three and a half years as general director of the
Royal Opera House have been accompanied by almost non-stop sniping.
His current position is typically precarious. The recession has cut both
Covent Garden's audiences - from the targeted 85 per cent of capacity to a
current 78 per cent, and income from private sources - to Pounds 750,000
below the forecast of Pounds 5.3m. As a result, Mr Isaacs' pledge to cut the
Royal Opera House's accumulated deficit of Pounds 3.3m this year appears
doomed.
Its building, especially the back stage area, is hopelessly antiquated. It
is losing prestige to the English National Opera, a quarter of a mile away
at the Coliseum. Moreover, David Mellor, the new Secretary of State for the
National Heritage, and ultimate paymaster for Covent Garden, is a sceptic of
the work of the Opera House.
Events seem to be approaching a crisis and there are many who think that, as
in Salome, the finale may demand the head of a sacrificial victim - Jeremy
Isaacs.
For a man cast for a tragic ending Isaacs remains remarkably resilient, keen
to sketch out an entirely different scenario. His position is secure until
his contract runs out next year, and he would like a renewal until 1997.
Covent Garden will then definitely close for at least two years to enable a
projected Pounds 250m worth of renovations to take place. An appeal to raise
Pounds 90m was announced this week, with the balance coming from a project
of shops and offices.
The renewal of Mr Isaacs' contract depends upon his board of trustees,
headed by Sir Angus Stirling, director of the National Trust. They may well
be supportive. The attitude of Mr Mellor is less certain. He could offer
additional subsidies for Covent Garden if it brought in a director capable
of delivering his ambition to make the venue more accessible and populist.
It is unlikely that the trustees would bow to such pressure.
Much hangs on a meeting between Sir Angus and Mr Mellor which is scheduled
to take place within the next few weeks. Mr Mellor probably has enough on
his hands - the reform of the BBC; the fate of the Arts Council; and the
Lotteries Bill - without picking a quarrel over Covent Garden. He could
accept the Royal Opera House's argument for more aid.
More likely he will await the findings of two investigations into the
workings of Covent Garden: one, headed by Lady Warnock and part of the Arts
Council's reviews of its clients; the other, by accountants Price
Waterhouse, at the behest of the Covent Garden Board. Both will report in
the autumn; both are likely to recommend more money if the Opera House
commits itself to cost savings.
The case for the Opera House is persuasive. Compared with state and city
subsidy for equivalent institutions in Paris, Milan, and other European
cities, Covent Garden is grossly under-funded. In the past six years it has
lifted its self-generated revenue from box office and sponsorship from 47
per cent of revenue to 60 per cent. Its annual subsidy of Pounds 18.9m
actually funds three companies - the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, and the
Birmingham Royal Ballet. The opera company gets Pounds 7.75m, less than the
Pounds 10.4m. received by the ENO. Its attendances are well above the West
End average and in recent months its new productions have received good
reviews.
But Mellor may be unconvinced. The problem is that Covent Garden has never
succeeded in shaking off the air of precariousness which comes from endemic
under-funding. Take the Royal Ballet. Straitened financial circumstances
have forced it to operate with too few dancers. It cannot afford important
new commissions and its audiences have declined - down 7 per cent in the
last year. In the desperate search for savings Mr Isaacs has reduced the
number of dance performances in favour of opera. One splashy night with a
singer like Placido Domingo who commands premium seat prices, grosses Covent
Garden Pounds 130,000.  So the morale and reputation of the Royal Ballet
slumps.
Similar problems dog the Royal Opera. New productions are likely to be joint
ventures with other opera houses or modestly costed, which prevents Covent
Garden developing a house style.
The 1992-93 season is popular, with few risks, and is enlivened with galas
which are wonderful for the box office. But they add to Covent Garden's
reputation as an elitist institution with seat prices beyond the purse of
the genuine opera lover. Mr Isaacs has accepted that he forced prices up too
far, too fast and for next season they are frozen. This will gain friends
but ensure yet another increase in the deficit.
Covent Garden is not asking for a fixed sum of extra cash. It is offering Mr
Mellor a list of options - a freeze on seat prices will cost X; increasing
the strength of the Royal Ballet will add Y; an increase in regional touring
by Birmingham Royal Ballet will amount to Z. But all told he is really
looking for an extra Pounds 3m this year.
Mr Isaacs feels Covent Garden deserves it partly to compensate for the years
of economies but mainly because the Royal Opera House reckons it is last in
the queue for aid among the national arts companies. By closing down its
London base at the Barbican in 1990 the Royal Shakespeare Company forced the
Arts Council and the City to give it millions in additional subsidies, while
the National Theatre has regularly received higher grant increases than
Covent Garden.
Now could be the time to sort out Covent Garden once and for all. The Royal
Opera House is clearing the decks in readiness. The appeal for Pounds 90m,
to be headed by Mrs Vivien Duffield, one of the richest women in the
country, will be launched at the most appropriate time to tempt a major
contribution from the government - probably in about 1994 when the revenues
from the planned state lottery are expected to start flowing in.
Mr Isaacs hopes he will be around then to start the changes: but David
Mellor is the piper playing that particular tune.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary off its perch: Michael Dennis spoke yesterday to
Robert Peston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canary Wharf seems impregnable as seen from Olympia &amp; York's executive suite
on the 30th floor of the tower which dominates the east London development.
However, Mr Michael Dennis, the O&amp;Y director who has supervised Europe's
biggest office development with obsessive care since its inception in 1987,
is acutely aware that O&amp;Y may be liquidated, following the decision by the
project's bankers on Wednesday that they would not finance its completion.
Though appalled that the O&amp;Y subsidiaries which own Canary Wharf have been
placed into administration under UK insolvency procedures, Mr Dennis remains
hopeful that the project can rise from the dead, if only the UK government
can be persuaded to move 2,000 civil servants to Canary Wharf and if an
investor can be persuaded to make an injection of new equity.
However, he admits that the deadline to achieve a rescue is short - probably
not much later than mid-June. Though it is premature to write Canary Wharf's
obituary, he is keen to highlight the project's successes.
On July 2 1987, Mr Dennis, a former law professor who in the late 1970s
became Toronto's commissioner for housing before joining O&amp;Y in 1980,
arrived with one of O&amp;Y's lawyers at a barren site in the middle of east
London's Isle of Dogs. He faced another inordinately tight timetable.
At the time, the rights to develop Canary Wharf were held by two investment
banks, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, and a US developer,
Ware Travelstead. The government had said that unless an agreement was
reached to build an office complex on the site by July 17, it would not
provide the new road and upgraded rail facilities essential to the project's
success.
Within days, O&amp;Y had taken over the 50-acre site. The contract with the UK
government placed obligations on both sides. O&amp;Y would build 5.4m sq ft of
new offices within five years and the government would build the Limehouse
Link road and expand the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) within the same
period.
Though the new buildings were technically superior to anything built in the
UK and though it was the biggest office scheme ever undertaken in the
country, the project was still completed ahead of schedule at the end of
1991 and within the Pounds 700m budget. However, the Limehouse Link will not
be finished till next year while improvements to DLR will not be completed
till later this year - in both cases later than planned. Indeed, Mr Dennis
says that if O&amp;Y had not become so closely involved in the development
phases of both the Link and the DLR, they could still be years from
completion.
Not surprisingly O&amp;Y has been bemused by the government's inflexibility in
respect of a separate - and unsigned - contract, under which O&amp;Y agreed to
pay Pounds 400m towards the costs of extending the Jubilee Line to the
Docklands. O&amp;Y has been unable to deliver on the contract because of its
financial difficulties, which in Mr Dennis's view stem from one cause more
than any other.
He is convinced potential tenants were put off because of their doubts about
the transport links to Canary Wharf. 'If we had not lost two years on the
DLR and Limehouse Link, we would be 90 per cent let today'  - and the Canary
would not be impersonating Monty Python's parrot.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Docklands: the year 2000 - Michael Cassell finds himself in
Canary Wharf to greet the new millennium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's spectacular, millennium street party around the dancing fountains of
Cabot Square, in the shadow of Canary Wharf's monumental tower, is to be
linked live via laserline to the four-nation astronaut team on its way to
Mars.
For some of those closer to home, like members of SPLASH, the London
Docklands tenants' action group, the celebrations will double as an act of
exquisite retribution.
The festivities take place eight years after Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
developer which flew too close to the sun, was forced to hand over Europe's
largest property development to the administrators. Sir Paul Beresford, the
environment secretary, whose offices are a short walk away, will not be
there because of 'a longstanding parliamentary commitment'.
Canary Wharf's owners - a US-Japanese consortium which is denying renewed
rumours it wants to sell - are allowing the party to go ahead in the hope it
will attract the sort of crowds which have been all too rare in recent
years.
Though the Docklands revellers lost their struggle in the 1980s to prevent
big business invading the Isle of Dogs, they have derived some bitter-sweet
consolation in the 1990s from watching their warnings of disaster
materialise.
Despite misgivings over the residents' plans to march behind well-preserved
banners emblazoned with slogans like 'Don't Destroy our Lives' and
'Capitalists Go Home', many traders on the Wharf have agreed to support an
event which should help the tills ring. Following the departure of the
Brazilian beauty product boutiques and Belgian chocolate shops, which 10
years ago helped establish the ritzy, upmarket tone for Canary Wharf, most
central area shops at least have found new tenants.
The photocopying services and supermarkets in particular report lively trade
and the Cat and Canary pub on Fisherman's Walk says business is good. It
recently stopped selling the more exotic, imported beers office workers
first demanded when it opened in 1992.
The picture is less rosy on the 50 floors of office space which rise above
the Thames in One Canada Square, the Cesar Pelli-designed tower whose
flashing beacons have for years been mocked as a warning to entrepreneurs -
rather than aircraft - to keep clear.
With 30m sq ft of empty office space and every imaginable incentive luring
them back to more central locations throughout the mid-1990s, many
pioneering tenants returned west long ago.
Of those American companies which fulfilled their pledge to move in, few
remain; some advertising people and accountants linger on but most
investment banks are back in the Square Mile.
The tower itself, offering top-quality accommodation at rents firmly stuck
at about Pounds 20 a sq ft - less than half the going rate in the City - is
comfortably full. Mr Francis Maude's Department of Trade and Industry is
still acquiring space in the adjoining Cabot Place while the Audit
Commission and the Inland Revenue are across the street.
The area is now said to house as much corporate computer power as the City,
with companies just as happy to put their back offices in Poplar as in
Purley.
But many Canary Wharf office buildings still echo only to the footsteps of
security men. Beyond the core, little has changed in a decade, with the best
part of 1,000 acres of surrounding development land sealed off behind
curtains of corrugated iron. Despite projections by the Henley Centre for
Forecasting that Canary Wharf would create 57,000 permanent jobs by 1996,
the numbers have only recently reached 20,000, largely thanks to
Conservative governments.
Quiet streets temporarily liven up at lunchtime as workers make their way to
sit in the sun alongside huge, sculpted bowls of geraniums, now maintained
by the Docklands Urban Council, the somewhat neutered body which replaced
the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1996.
DUC, which now lives in reasonable harmony alongside the three local
authorities, has this week made its own contribution to the millennium
celebrations by extending free parking for motorists to seven days a week.
Southwark, Newham and Tower Hamlets, enjoying a bigger say in Docklands than
at any time since the LDDC was set up nearly 20 years ago, have been
concentrating on providing homes for locals in the 21st century. The calls
for more low-cost housing are finally being heeded, given that luxury
penthouse apartments are still selling for less than half the Pounds 600,000
being asked at the end of the 1980s. Most of the private moorings attached
to each home on Clippers Quay are empty.
The release in 1995 of capital receipts from council house sales enabled
Docklands authorities to undertake a modest building programme for low-cost
homes. Their action was boosted by the provision of extra resources won
through hard lobbying by London City Council, the capital's fledgling
strategic body which itself has just taken more space overlooking West India
Quay.
But if the towering ambitions for Docklands, first proclaimed by Baroness
Thatcher and Sir Michael Heseltine, have failed, the prospect of ultimate
success has not yet been extinguished. Critics fond of quoting La Defense in
Paris as a prime example of urban redevelopment are being reminded that a
project one-tenth the size of Docklands took 35 years to reach fruition.
Even so, images of granite and stainless steel temples shimmering on the
waterside in testimony to the 1990s have certainly sunk. A less heroic
future beckons.
With the opening in March this year of the Pounds 3bn Jubilee Underground
extension between Canary Wharf and the City - part-funded by Mr Major's
second government - the key to Docklands may finally have been unlocked. The
biggest single concentration of transport investment in the UK has also seen
the completion of the Limehouse Link Road to the Isle of Dogs, further
improvements to the light railway system and more upgrading of the Blackwall
tunnel. One notable transport success has been to the east, at Docklands
Airport, now busier than ever.
Looking beyond the capital's immediate millennium celebrations, the LCC and
DUC are together stepping up work on proposals to bring the 2008 Olympics to
Docklands. But the local councils are wary and the residents are
antagonistic. It looks as though Docklands is bracing itself for another
battle.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A three-city conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEEK has belonged to Nemesis, a goddess who could have taught scorned
wives a thing or two about come-uppance. Britain's trade figures revive the
nightmare of growth constrained by balance of payments worries. The
once-great Alan Bond is in prison. And with Mountleigh in receivership and
Canary Wharf in administration, the banks face new write-offs of up to
Pounds 1bn - a sum which will be substantially enlarged by the steady flow
of smaller and largely unremarked corporate failures. Yet the London market
fell only fractionally on Thursday, after the Canary Wharf news, and more
than recovered its losses yesterday; while in New York and Tokyo, where the
banks are exposed to almost any major failure in the world, stocks rose.
This apparently paradoxical behaviour is at least consistent, and is easy to
explain: there is no surprise in the last acts of dramas which have been
playing in public view for months and even years. Markets move only in
response to the unexpected, and they like to have uncertainties resolved. In
any case, failures in the property field are in one sense good news;
receivers and administrators will respond more readily than developers to
market conditions, and cut prices far enough to bring important new
developments into productive use. Moreover, if Canary Wharf moves
down-market, it may ease competitive pressures in more favoured parts of
London by reducing the gross oversupply at the top end of the office market,
and so offer some hope to other troubled developers.
Property bubble
A longer view, however, suggests a paradox which is not so easy to explain.
The property bubble was an international one, inflated by excessive credit
from Japan and from all the English-speaking banking systems; yet since it
burst, the Tokyo market has fallen by well over 50 per cent, the London
market has moved to new nominal highs (though it is still below 1987 levels
in real terms) while Wall Street has risen to ever more hopeful multiples,
and extended the performance yesterday. Since investors are often told that
they must spread their risks through what has become a single world capital
market, these extreme divergencies are not only puzzling, but worrying.
On the face of it, the capital markets are telling us that the Japanese
miracle is finally over, that Britain is still stuck in much the same
groove, but that in the US the worst is over, and the world's biggest
economy may become its leader again. That message is true only in a
comparative sense. Japanese self-confidence has indeed suffered a major
blow, with little immediate hope of recovery, while the London market has
long been resigned to a long, hard slog out of debt and excessive costs
within the ERM. It is only New York's performance, against a background of
slow growth, trade squabbles and start-ling political disillusion, which is
now arousing fears of a new bubble, which could burst as it did in 1987. To
get any further than these generalisations, which probably represent the
consensus view, one must look in a little more detail at what drives the
three markets.
Bearish glosses
The savings of the personal sector provide the basic drive, monetary policy
the most important constraint; and here the three markets differ widely. In
Japan savings flows remain vast, but there has been a monetary squeeze which
in terms of national experience has been as fierce as Mr Paul Volcker's
deflation of the US economy in 1979-82. Policy is now easing, but not fast
enough to satisfy the Ministry of Finance, which issues bearish glosses even
on favourable figures (a practice which may damp investors' confidence, but
no more than the British official habit of looking relentlessly for a
supposed bright side). Above all, Japanese savers, including the insurance
companies and others who invest on their behalf, have been frightened by
repeated financial scandals, and have been diverting funds abroad. The
Japanese collapse has therefore supported rather than undermined other
markets. (A revival in Tokyo might be a different story.)
In Britain, personal savings are high and rising, and have been fed directly
into the market through high unit trust sales. Cynics may read this as a
sell signal, on the view that the little man is always too late; but yields
remain high by international standards, and the economic news is not nearly
as bad as it may look. The trade balance, especially, reflects heavy inward
investment, which is a sign of promise, not of trouble.
It is in the US, again, that the pattern of support could be worrying: it
comes not from savings flows, which remain depressed, but from switching out
of savings deposits and money funds, as interest rates have been cut again
and again. This switch reduces the money supply, as companies seize the
opportunity to fund debt, but the fall provokes calls for still further
easing of policy. The US corporate balance sheet looks much healthier as a
result, but the policy trend is not sustainable. In a market which has
become so obsessed with interest rates that it treats bad news of the
economy as a bull signal, a tightening could cause an ugly awakening.

<TEXT>
MR LI KA-SHING, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest men and one of its leading
property developers, has no immediate plans to buy into Olympia &amp; York's
Canary Wharf development in the UK or any of its other property assets.
After the annual meeting on Thursday of Cheung Kong, his flagship property
development and investment company, Mr Li admitted to a personal interest in
acquiring some of O&amp;Y's assets, if they were suitable.
However, sources close to Mr Li said yesterday that he had not yet been
offered any of O&amp;Y's properties and had not focused on any particular
property asset.
'We can't say absolutely 'no',' one said. 'We might be offered something so
cheaply that it would be foolish to turn it down.'
Cheung Kong would not comment about reports of Mr Li's interest in Canary
Wharf. In the past, Mr Li has taken pains to point out that his joint
venture with O&amp;Y in a New York office block was un-affected by O&amp;Y's wider
financial difficulties.
Analysts in Hong Kong expect Mr Li to figure in any break-up of O&amp;Y. He has
the financial capability to acquire assets from O&amp;Y and can afford to wait
until the bankers come to him.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Treasury set to reclaim Pounds 1.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISASTER it may be for Docklands, but some may be licking their lips at
the possibility that the planned extension of the Jubilee Line may be
abandoned.
The Treasury will insist that the Pounds 1.6bn of government funds allocated
to the project must be handed back if it is not used. London Underground and
British Rail will nevertheless be keen to apply the cash to other projects.
The 10-mile Jubilee Line from central London to Docklands and Stratford is
the biggest single infrastructure project in the Department of Transport's
budget. The prospect now arises that the Pounds 1.6bn could be made
available to undertake one of the many other badly needed transport projects
awaiting funds.
One contender would certainly be British Rail. Desperately strapped for cash
because of the effects of recession on its fare income and property profits,
it has recently had to freeze all investment other than in projects already
under way.
A windfall of Pounds 1.6bn would easily cover the cost of buying a new fleet
of trains for Network SouthEast's Kent Coast services (Pounds 700m),
rebuilding the entire London-Glasgow line and replacing all its trains
(Pounds 750m), or carrying through the massive redevelopment planned for
King's Cross (Pounds 1bn).
It might even form a contribution to the Pounds 4bn needed to build the
long-delayed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel.
Perhaps a stronger contender, since the Jubilee Line is a London Underground
project, would be London Underground itself. It has several projects
awaiting funds.
The top priority is the upgrading of the existing network, followed by the
construction of two new lines to relieve congestion in central London. They
are the east-west CrossRail and the north-south Chelsea-Hackney line.
Given any choice in the matter, London Underground would have given all of
those higher priority than the Jubilee Line extension.
That choice was taken away when the private sector agreed to help pay for
the Jubilee Line provided the project was brought forward in the queue. The
question now is whether, with the private-sector contribution absent, the
'natural' order of priorities will be restored.
A deferral of the Jubilee Line project is quite possible, but the result is
unlikely to be a bonanza for other public-transport users for at least two
reasons.
One is the Treasury's parsimony. Negotiations over the annual public
spending round are always tough, but will be even tougher this year, as the
Pounds 1.6bn was ring-fenced from other Underground expenditure in being
specifically allocated to the Jubilee Line.
Even if it were not, it would be unlikely to find its way straight into
another transport project. Transport infrastructure is notoriously slow to
plan and build. Ten years is the typical span from conception to completion.
Much as London Underground and British Rail would like to spend Pounds 1.6bn
in the next three years, they could not do so because they would be unable
to bring sufficient projects forward at such short notice. The clock, as
well as the Treasury, is against them.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Collapse may depress Docklands rents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACING in admini-stration of Canary Wharf may lead to rents in London's
Docklands being slashed from an already low level. The task of rival
developers in finding tenants will become even more daunting if Canary
Wharf, which offers some of the best-quality offices in the UK, is placed on
the market at rock-bottom prices.
The downward spiral of office rents has particularly dismayed developers who
sold buildings to investors with a guaranteed rental income. The deals
allowed developers to exploit the Enterprise Zone's 100 per cent capital
allowances, but it has left them with heavy liabilities. Rents of about
Pounds 20 a sq ft which seemed realistic two years ago are now more than
double the going rate.
Merely cutting rents is unlikely to generate demand. Few places in the UK
offer new, high-quality air-conditioned buildings at such cheap rents -
although some fringe City buildings are heading the same way. Developers
have been leapfrogging each other in an attempt to set the lowest prices.
A shock wave went through the Docklands market last year when Wyn-Ro
Investments set the rent at South Quay Plaza, a big building opposite Canary
Wharf, at just Pounds 10 a sq ft.
Even that has since been undercut: a building at Thames Quay on the Isle of
Dogs is being offered for a two-year trial period for no rent.
Docklands' reputation as a developers' graveyard should be safe for several
years. Pressure is intensifying on the owners of empty property, which
accounts for half the 10m sq ft of offices in Docklands. Their costs rose
steeply a month ago when the Enterprise Zone's tax breaks ended, forcing
developers to pay 'empty rates' of about Pounds 3.50 a sq ft as well as
maintenance costs on their empty buildings. Such developers have little hope
of finding buyers because unlet property has little value in such an
oversupplied market. The receivers to the Euro Trade Centre, a project close
to Canary Wharf that failed two weeks ago, said they were considering
mothballing the building for up to 10 years.
It might take decades to fill the empty property if lettings continue at
their present rate. Last year, which was admittedly the lowest point of the
recession, 350,000 sq ft of offices were let, according to Savills, the
chartered surveyors. Outside Canary Wharf, only 100,000 sq ft was let.
Developers cannot take such strain indefinitely. Last month Charter Group
had to defer its quarterly payment to investors in PET 8, a trust based on
Exchange Tower in the Isle of Dogs, which is less than half let.
Desperation has led developers to ever more creative ways to market their
projects. For example, the Euro Trade Centre attempted to arrange an office
swap with the Estonian government. Meanwhile, the inducements demanded by
tenants, such as rent-free periods, have become increasingly onerous for all
but the strongest developers.
The developers with the most serious difficulties are those which built
grandiose buildings in the last few years of the Docklands property boom.
The difficulty in persuading large tenants to move to the area will become
even more daunting if the Jubilee Line extension is not built. If that
happens, the market will have to rely on the small businesses that are
providing what little demand there is.
The troubles in the office sector are shared by other parts of the property
market. The recession and poor infrastructure undermined the prospects of
the London Arena, the conference, sporting and concert venue, and of Tobacco
Dock, a stylish but isolated shopping centre in Wapping.
Poor transport and an over-emphasis on expensive property have also
afflicted the housing market, which has seen a 30 per cent fall in prices
since its peak in 1987. The depressed state of the market prompted one
developer to fill its empty flats by housing the local authority's teaching
staff. The housing market, too, has claimed corporate casualties. The most
striking example is Sir Terence Conran's Butlers Wharf scheme, which
eventually failed as a result of high interest rates and the evaporation of
demand after the stock market crash of 1987.
The bleakness of Docklands' prospects are offset by the occasional chink of
light. Even if the Jubilee Line extension does not go ahead, Docklands will
benefit from big transport improvements over the coming year. Lower interest
rates and economic recovery should increase demand from tenants.
For all that, Canary Wharf was the engine of much of the area's development
and its failure has cast a long shadow over the market as a whole. The
developers who pioneered the area over the past 10 years are bogged down in
the most treacherous property market this century.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Tube deal 'is not binding'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO PROSPECTIVE developer or the administrators of Canary Wharf can be bound
to the commitment undertaken by Olympia &amp; York to provide Pounds 400m
towards the extension of the London Underground Jubilee Line, the Department
of Transport said yesterday.
No formal agreement that would be legally binding had been signed, the
department said, although it had received a letter of intent from O&amp;Y
setting out the terms of its contribution.
In the absence of a formal agreement, it was clear that no one could be
bound to honour O&amp;Y's commitment, the department said, but that did not
change the government's position. Unless the future owners of Canary Wharf
were prepared to make the same contribution, the government's commitment of
Pounds 1.5bn to the Underground project would not be forthcoming.
Lawyers close to the insolvency said yesterday that even if O&amp;Y had signed a
formal agreement it would not have been binding on the administrators. A
partner in a City law firm said the function of an administrator was to
preserve the assets of a business and he could not be forced to honour
contracts that involved him in spending money.
The administrators were therefore free to sell and let the properties
regardless of O&amp;Y's commitment to the Jubilee extension, he added.
Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the three joint administrators, has said he will
look at the option of finding finance for the extension, but that Canary
Wharf could survive without it.
The future of the extension now depends either on a change of heart by the
government or a decision to contribute by new owners of Canary Wharf.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: O&amp;Y keen to sell New York building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK is neg-otiating the sale of all or part of the 34-storey
former world headquarters building in New York of ITT, the US financial,
industrial and travel conglomerate.
According to an executive close to the talks, a deal for the sale of at
least part of the Manhattan office block might be completed within the next
fortnight. 'Nothing is written in stone, but there is an 80 per cent chance
of it going ahead,' the executive said.
If the transaction goes ahead, it may help to reassure those bank creditors
who believe that in the wake of the Canary Wharf project in the UK being
placed in administration, the Canadian property group should consider filing
for bankruptcy in the US. Speculation is mounting in New York that O&amp;Y may
eventually need to seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
bankruptcy rules.
The Manhattan building, which consists of 664,000 sq ft, has been vacant for
the past 15 months. O&amp;Y last year put off plans to spend Dollars 150m
removing asbestos and making a number of repairs as part of a complete
renovation.
Property analysts in New York say the present market value of the building,
provided a tenant moves in, could be about Dollars 150 a sq ft. That would
suggest that the building's current value may be about Dollars 100m.
It is believed, however, that O&amp;Y still owes at least Dollars 100m in
mortgage loans related to the property. The Canadian developer deferred
plans earlier this year to refinance the loan, understood to be owed to a
syndicate led by First Chicago Bank.
The identity of the potential buyer for the building is not known, but one
mechanism being explored is the sale of what is known as a 'condominium
interest' in the building. That would allow O&amp;Y to continue owning part of
the property. However, it might also result in an extremely complicated
deal, since the buyer might have to assume part of the outstanding debt or
agree to finance some of the repairs needed.
The Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, acquired the Park Avenue building in
1977 when it bought several prime Manhattan buildings.

FT  30 MAY 92 / BT faces flood of payoff applicants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, THE telecommunications group, which is spending nearly Pounds 1bn to
persuade 20,000 employees to leave the company, may be left in the
embarrassing position of attracting too many applicants.
According to initial calculations, about half the 200,000 workforce is
interested in taking a closer look at how the generous redundancy terms of
BT's Release 92 would work for them. Mr David Scott, BT industrial relations
manager, agreed that the figure was a sign of poor morale.
The company has been facing a slowdown in business and increased competition
in recent years. It has speeded up its redundancy programme in the hope of
reaching productivity levels comparable with those of US telephone
companies.
Payments for people volunteering to leave may be as high as Pounds 100,000
plus pension entitlement, although the average payoff is likely to be closer
to Pounds 30,000.
The BT workforce remained static for six years after privatisation in 1984.
Since 1990, 30,000 jobs have gone - mainly in clerical, telephone operator
and managerial posts. The target for 1992-93 is a total reduction of 24,000.
BT insists it is firmly committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGREGOR angered the 'green' lobby yesterday by using his first
keynote speech as transport secretary to extol the virtues of the Department
of Transport's roadbuilding programme.
Environmentalists and the public transport lobby had hoped that Mr MacGregor
would build upon the switch of emphasis in favour of railways initiated by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his predecessor.
Mr MacGregor told a meeting of business people in Plymouth, Devon, that road
improvements could be 'good news' for the environment and it was time that
was more widely recognised.
He said suggestions that the expansion of the road network would devastate
the environment were wrong.
The UK had an environmentally-conscious approach to its road programme. For
example, the department's heavy emphasis on bypasses greatly improved
conditions in towns and villages with such roads.
In addition, every road project had to pass an environmental assessment.
Ms Judith Hannah, of the pressure group Transport 2000, said on BBC Radio
that Mr MacGregor's speech looked as if it had been written by the road
lobby, who were 'trying to apply greenwash' to the cause of Britain's
transport woes.

A RUSH on stocks of scarlet and ermine robes looks certain next week as the
prime minister gives final approval to a dissolution honours list, Ivo
Dawnay writes. It will be heavy with the familiar names of departed cabinet
ministers.
Top billing on the list, due to be published on Friday, will be for Mrs
Margaret Thatcher. As a former prime minister she is entitled to an earldom,
but is said to have opted to go to the upper house with a simple life
peerage, possibly as Baroness Thatcher of Finchley.
To the surprise of some, Dr David Owen, the former SDP leader, is expected
to be named a life peer on the recommendation of the prime minister.
Other former cabinet ministers in line for the Lords include many big names
of the Thatcher years - Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr Nigel Lawson, Mr Cecil
Parkinson, Mr Nicholas Ridley, Mr Norman Tebbit, and Mr Peter Walker.
But the glut of ex-cabinet ministers - by convention all are entitled to a
life peerage on leaving the Commons - means some may be postponed.
It is thought that Mr George Younger, who is due to inherit the title
Viscount Younger of Leckie on the death of his father, may have offered to
waive his claim for the time being to help the prime minister slim his list.
For Labour, Mr Neil Kinnock will have prepared a list with guidance from
Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, the party's leader in the Lords, who is known to
favour promoting only those who will act as working peers.
None the less, a peerage is thought certain for Mr Denis Healey, a former
cabinet minister and the party's deputy leader from 1980 to 1983.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Miners' buy-outs may get aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may provide cash support for efforts by managers and miners
to buy all or part of British Coal when it is privatised, Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, said yesterday.
'The government will in the right circumstances provide financial help to a
management and employee buy-out team,' he said at the annual conference of
the British Association of Colliery Managers (Bacom) in Blackpool.
The money would be designed to help British Coal employees assemble a bid
for part or all of the corporation and to pay for any financial advice they
might need.
The statement was welcomed by Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers. 'I take this as a very positive sign', he said.
Mr Lynk said he believed that Mr Eggar and Mr Michael Heseltine, who as
trade and industry secretary is ultimately responsible for energy, were more
sympathetic to the coal industry than Mr John Wakeham, the former energy
secretary. 'This a manifestation of the new breath flowing through the
department,' he said.
Mr Eggar, who emphasised his confidence in the future of the UK coal
industry, said employee buy-outs could be a very successful way of
privatising companies.
Mr Lynk said that clearly indicated that Mr Eggar considered the UDM's own
plans to bid for all or part of British Coal were 'very acceptable'.
The plans are already well advanced. The UDM has formed a consortium with
Lloyds Merchant Bank, which is now approaching potential investors in an
employee-led buy-out of British Coal if the opportunity arises.
Mr Lynk said he expected Bacom, which is also interested in bidding, to join
the UDM consortium.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Grade appeals to OFT over football contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, yesterday appealed to the
Office of Fair Trading to review the issue of media concentration after the
Premier League football deal with British Sky Broadcasting.
He told the British Society of Magazine Editors that a new investigation
would be in the interests of 'the poor viewer' whose sovereignty the 1990
Broadcasting Act was supposed to protect.
'On the evidence of the football deal and similar deals to come, Margaret
Thatcher's Broadcasting Act is short-changing the customers,' Mr Grade said.
He said News International told last year's Sadler inquiry into cross-media
promotion that it had not used the editorial contents of its newspapers
'unduly to promote Sky'. Mr Grade said the assurances given to the Sadler
committee were worthless.
News International is the biggest shareholder in BSkyB, in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Labour urged to seize Rio agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR must seize the environment and development agenda of the Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro this week as central themes for the 1990s, Mr John Smith,
the favourite to win the party leadership, said last night.
In a campaign meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne, the shadow chancellor fleshed
out his vision of an international 'green' alliance between less-developed
and industrialised countries to devise solutions to Third World needs.
Mr Bryan Gould, his rival for the leadership, speaking in his Dagenham
constituency, defended the importance of the public sector. He insisted that
standards must be maintained and jobs, wage rates and working conditions
defended under compulsory competitive tendering or privatisation.
Mr Smith's speech is intended to underline his personal commitment to
development as the principal priority in foreign policy.
Expressing fears that disarray among the industrialised countries meant the
Rio summit would fail to make any real advances, he said environmental and
development issues were inextricably linked.
Similarly, it was essential for the wealthy north to promote development in
the southern hemisphere, both on ethical grounds and in its own interests.
The developing world's issues, such as foreign debt burdens, access to
capital and technology and trade barriers, had to be allied to other
questions such as education, women's rights and improved resource
management.
'These are not simply what some people would condescendingly describe as
Third World issues. Rather, they are global concerns which matter to
everyone . . . ultimately as important to our own community as they are
beginning to be to the community of nations,' he said.
Mr Gould attempted to reinforce his backing among public-sector employees by
emphasising his record as shadow environment secretary in pointing up the
defects in policy on compulsory tendering.
Acknowledging that tendering and privatisation would continue under the
Conservatives, he said Labour's task was to ensure that private-sector
employers matched the standards of the public sector.
'Privatisation and CCT should not be allowed to operate as pretexts for
doing a bad job with inadequate, badly trained and badly paid staff,' he
said.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Bank backs taping of dealers' phone calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday backed the practice of tape-recording
telephone calls made by dealers in some of the City's biggest financial
markets, but rejected a call from MPs to make it compulsory.
The Bank said yesterday it 'strongly recommends' taping, and it will require
banks and brokers that do not tape dealers' telephone calls to explain why.
Compulsory taping was urged by the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee last year after its investigation into how up to 35 local
authorities came to have about Pounds 88m deposited with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International at the time it was shut down last July.
The councils had deposited the money through money brokers, who act as
intermediaries in the wholesale financial markets. Some councils complained
that the brokers should have warned them about the risks of leaving their
cash with BCCI.
While investigating those claims, the MPs called for compulsory taping to
help prevent disputes about the terms on which deals are done. Taping is
common in fast-moving markets such as foreign exchange and derivatives, but
less common in the equity market and the wholesale money markets - through
which institutions such as banks and local authorities invest surplus cash.
The Bank said compulsory taping would go against the philosophy of its code
of conduct for the foreign exchange and wholesale deposit markets, which was
based on best practice rather than obligation. The cost might also be
prohibitive for some institutions, it said.
Under the Bank's code of conduct for brokers and others in the wholesale
financial markets, it is up to local authorities and others to satisfy
themselves about the credit-worthiness of institutions they deal with. The
MPs said that was not made clear enough, and urged that the code be
'rewritten more precisely so the current opportunities for misunderstanding
are removed'.
A revised code of conduct issued yesterday makes clear that local
authorities and other principals in the market are entirely responsible for
their own actions and cannot rely on brokers' views. The bank also said it
would distribute the code more widely, including to international users of
the London markets, as MPs had asked.
In a further change to its code, the Bank has warned brokers and banks to be
wary of companies using the foreign exchange markets to hide losses that
they would otherwise have to report to their shareholders. It was prompted
by concerns expressed by regulators in Japan, the US and Germany.
The abuse involves companies that have arranged a forward currency deal
extending the expiry date, so that any losses on deals are delayed until
after their balance-sheet date. Such 'window-dressing' allows them to hide
losses. Banks that are asked to extend expiry dates on deals - a practice
which is becoming increasingly common - should satisfy themselves about the
purpose, the Bank says.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Deal offered on lease for pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday agreed provisionally to lease the mothballed
Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, a consortium
of miners which will be granted a 10-year licence to operate the pit.
If, as seems likely, the agreement is completed, Monktonhall will become the
first full-scale deep mine in the UK to be operated by a private-sector
company since coal was nationalised in 1947. At present private-sector
operators run only small or open-cast mines.
Monktonhall Mineworkers has been negotiating with British Coal to take over
the mine since last December, when the consortium was declared the preferred
bidder.
Earlier this month British Coal said it was reopening negotiations with
Caledonian Mining, a privately owned company based at Newark in
Nottinghamshire, after the mineworkers' consortium appeared unable to
provide the necessary finance.
In the past few weeks, however, at least 100 members of the consortium have
each agreed to invest Pounds 10,000 in the company, compared with the
original stake of Pounds 2,000. The Life Association of Scotland, a life
assurance company, has offered individual members of the consortium loans to
help them pay for their shares.
Last night Caledonian Mining said it was 'surprised' that British Coal had
decided to negotiate an agreement with Monktonhall Mineworkers. It said it
would still be available to take on the pit if the deal with the consortium
ers fell through.
Monktonhall Mineworkers has faced considerable opposition from
Labour-controlled local authorities, which have questioned the consortium's
ability to operate the mine and cast doubt on its sources of finance.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Willis is hopeful on talks with Shephard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF the Trades Union Congress will meet the Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, in 10 days amid signs that a friendlier and more
constructive dialogue between unions and the government can be established.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, and his deputy Mr John Monks will
meet Mrs Shephard on June 9. They are keen to establish more common ground
than existed with Mr Michael Howard, her more hard-line predecessor.
TUC officials say that they have lately been receiving encouraging signs
from senior Department of Employment officials suggesting that Mrs Shephard
is interested in more than a token meeting.
They believe she would not have produced a white paper like Mr Howard's,
which was hostile to collective bargaining and even moderate trade unionism.
Re-establishing a better dialogue with the government is especially
important to the TUC at present as its future is increasingly being
questioned by the larger unions.
In view of its lack of success as a government lobbyist in recent years,
some unions want the TUC to stop thinking of itself as a trade-union civil
service and concentrate on two or three functions, such as lobbying in the
European Community. The TUC has no direct representative in Brussels.
Whatever Mrs Shephard's real feelings, she will be unable to back away from
any of the Conservative manifesto commitments drawn from the white paper -
especially reform of the 'automatic check-off' of union dues and the
abolition of the Bridlington agreement regulating inter-union disputes.
Mrs Shephard might concede something to the TUC in the detail of those
proposals. On check-off, it has not yet been decided whether members have to
be consulted only every three years or also every time dues are increased.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Industrialists quit business school in row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPUTE at one of Britain's top business schools has led 14 captains of
industry and commerce to resign from its council and call on Mr John Patten,
education secretary, to set up an inquiry into the school's affairs.
The 14 have resigned as private-sector, lay representatives on the council
of Manchester Business School, claiming that the school is poorly run and
fails to maintain a partnership with the business community.
They are led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society, and include Mr David Sieff, a director of Marks and
Spencer; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd and former
permanent secretary to the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Noble, chairman of
Specialeyes and former managing director of Debenhams.
In a letter to Mr Patten, the 14 highlight 'a mutual lack of confidence and
trust' between them and the school's parent institution, Manchester
University, and 'a complete breakdown of the concept of partnership on which
MBS was founded and which has helped it to develop to the very successful
institution it is today'.
The Department for Education said yesterday that Mr Patten was 'highly
unlikely' to intervene in Manchester University's 'internal affairs'.
The status of MBS as an integral part of the university is the main source
of the dispute. Unlike the London Business School, the other 1960s creation
of the Franks report into British management education, MBS has not gained
autonomy from its parent.
The MBS board has been seeking to achieve that autonomy but the university
authorities, initially sympathetic, have come down firmly against. They want
instead to promote greater co-operation between MBS and the larger
management school at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology.
Accordingly, the Court of Manchester University voted a fortnight ago to
assume direct responsibility for the school's management and to abolish its
separate council in due course. The lay representatives decided to resign
the next day.
The dispute has forced Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, to take
'diplomatic' study leave. It is understood that he intends to resign on
Monday.
The University of London is a federation, while Manchester has the faculty
and departmental shape of most of the redbrick universities of its era.
Recognising that, Sir Dennis and his colleagues say in their letter to Mr
Patten: 'It is apparent that the constitution of our universities, granted
by charter many years ago, may be due for revision. The powers granted for
the dispensation of public funds are hardly suited for present-day
conditions.'

ISRAEL yesterday extended the order barring Palestinians living in the Gaza
Strip from entering Israel, their main source of work, and is said to be
considering permanently banning men under 30 years old from leaving the
strip.
It also prepared to stop Palestinians from the West Bank entering Jerusalem
tomorrow during celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of Israel's
capture of the Arab half of the city in 1967.
Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, admitted during the week that cutting
off access to work in Israel, which accounts for around half of all Gazan
employment, was likely to increase frustration in the impoverished area and
lead to further acts of violence.
The government orders were prompted by fears of further clashes between
Israelis and Arabs following intensified violence during the week.
The murder of a 15 year-old Israeli girl in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam
on Sunday led to five successive nights of rioting by angry residents, many
chanting 'death to Arabs'.
The atmosphere worsened when a Jewish settler was stabbed in Gaza on
Wednesday.
With the general election on June 23 less than four weeks away, the hardline
Likud party government led by Mr Yitzhak Shamir is anxious to respond to
public pressure for a tough security clampdown.
Israeli forces were also in action again in Lebanon yesterday.
They advanced from the 'security zone' they maintain in southern Lebanon to
blow up seven houses in two villages suspected of harbouring Palestinian and
Lebanese guerrillas.
Reports from the area said they planted roadside bombs, wounding three
people in passing cars, before withdrawing.
It was the first time since February that Israeli infantry had advanced
beyond the limit of the security zone.
Israeli forces have attacked guerrilla targets, mainly of the Hizbollah
Moslem fundamentalist militia, every day for more than a week in one of the
severest bouts of fighting in the area for months.
Some 30 Lebanese and one Israeli soldier have been killed in the Lebanon
fighting since May 19.
Six Palestinians and three Israelis have died in the West Bank, Gaza and
Israel over the past week, including two Arab collaborators mistakenly
killed by Israeli under-cover soldiers.

The US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the first quarter,

Commerce Department indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in
Washington.
This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth and the best performance
for the US economy since the beginning of 1989. Many analysts, however, had
expected a bigger upward revision. The faster growth mainly reflected upward
revisions to corporate inventories and fixed investment, partially offset by
weaker net exports. The figures showed a sharp improvement in corporate
profitability in the first quarter.

THE US criticised India yesterday for test firing a medium-range

regions with chronic tensions, it argued.
India successfully test-fired the Agni missile, with a range of 1,500 miles,
from a military firing range in Chandipur into the Bay of Bengal. The launch
was a further display of India's high-technology ambitions and its
determination to go ahead with a missile programme despite US pressure.
India launched a satellite last week shortly after Washington imposed
limited sanctions against the Russian and Indian space organisations. The US
objected to Russia's proposed sale of rocket technology which India says is
for its space programme.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush authorised military and economic assistance for Mr
Saddam Hussein 10 months before Iraq invaded Kuwait, according to newly
declassified documents made public in Congress yesterday.
The documents, made public as part of the continuing investigation by the
House Banking Committee of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans
scandal, include National Security Directive 26. This was an order directing
US aid to Iraq as a way to moderate Mr Saddam Hussein. It was signed by Mr
Bush on October 2 1989.
The politically charged hearing yesterday also disclosed documents showing
that Commerce Department officials last year altered 68 US export licences
to Iraq to remove references to military uses.
The political fall-out for President Bush of yesterday's hearings remains
uncertain. But the disclosures come just days before the House judiciary
committee is to begin hearings on whether to seek the appointment of a
special prosecutor to investigate the administration's alleged involvement
in the BNL affair and the arming of Iraq.
Congressional Democrats led by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House
banking committee, appear to believe their investigation is gaining
momentum. The tone was set yesterday when Mr Sam Gejdenson, chairman of a
House foreign affairs subcommittee, termed Mr Bush's 1989 directive 'a
foreign policy blunder of the first order'.
The directive said: 'as a means of developing access to and influence with
the Iraqi defence establishment, the US should consider sales of non-lethal
forms of military assistance, eg training courses and medical exchanges, on
a case-by-case basis'.
The president did include a caveat in his executive order which stated that
the Iraqi leadership should be made to understand that any illegal use of
chemical or biological weapons would lead to economic and political
sanctions.
The altering of US export licences to Iraq was made as the data was prepared
for submission to a congressional inquiry, according to a memo to Mr Robert
Mosbacher, former commerce secretary. The memo, dated June 4, 1991, was from
Mr Frank DeGeorge, inspector general of the commerce department. The memo to
Mr Mosbacher claimed, however, that with the exception of changes to five
licences for 'vehicles designed for military use', the changes were
'inconsequential'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS have offered the EC a big concession in negotiations over farm
trade which would allow the Community 7-10 years to reduce the volume of
subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent, according to an authoritative report
in Washington.
Officials who met Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner,
last week offered a longer time for the subsidy cuts instead of accepting a
lower level of cuts, as previously proposed by Mr Jacques Delors, the EC
president.
The offer, part of a US endeavour to break a 16-month deadlock over
agriculture trade, is not expected to be enough alone to resolve the Gatt
talks. The stalemate is blocking completion of the Uruguay Round at a cost
of billions of dollars a year in lost trade.
Officials in Brussels said yesterday they saw little hope of a Gatt
breakthrough because new US proposals for the Community to take more land
out of production would require unpicking the EC farm reform package
carefully stitched together last week.
EC farm ministers last week agreed radical reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy. The agreement included provisions that European farmers should be
compensated for price support cuts, provided they took at least 15 per cent
of their land out of cereal production, beginning in 1993-94. The degree of
this required 'set-aside' would be reviewed each year thereafter.
But the US told Mr Andriessen it wanted the EC to commit itself to set aside
more than 15 per cent for the full planned five-year life of a Gatt accord.
'It will be very difficult to re-negotiate any part of last week's CAP
reform deal,' said one official yesterday.
The US concession on grain subsidies is not likely to find much support
among American farm groups. Their main, long-standing concern - and that of
their counterparts in Canada, Australia and other farm exporting nations -
has been to rid the world grain market of trade-distorting export subsidies.

Engineering workers throughout Italy yesterday staged two stoppages in
protest over employers' refusal to pay index-linked wages, writes Robert
Graham in Rome.
The protest was also backed by CGIL, the largest of the three main trade
union confederations, with members striking in local administration and some
schools.
The strikes were a foretaste of tough negotiations on wages and labour costs
between the unions, employers and the government due to begin on Monday.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations High Commission for Refugees yesterday made an
impassioned plea for international financial assistance, food and medicine,
saying the scale of the refugee and humanitarian crisis in
Bosnia-Hercegovina was beyond all expectations.
'In the name of all the victims and displaced persons, we appeal to all
sides in the conflict to let us renew our operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina,'
said Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, head of the UNHCR mission overseeing
humanitarian aid to the republics of the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Mendiluce said 500,000 people were now displaced in Bosnia, while over 1m
were cut off from any supplies.
'There is fighting all over the towns and villages in Bosnia. Paramilitary
groups are forcing people to leave their homes. Others are fleeing before
the fighting starts in their villages,' he said.
'The economy in Bosnia is collapsing. The people in the cities are without
any supplies.'
The UNHCR requires Dollars 141.9m (Pounds 78.8m) to cope with its relief
programme from November 1991 to April 1993 in the former Yugoslavia. So far,
however, it has obtained only Dollars 25m.
Over 1m Moslem, Serbs, and Croats have already fled the republic since the
fighting began last month following the international recognition of
Bosnia's independence.
'If the war does not stop, and if relief supplies are not allowed through,
then Croatia and Serbia must be prepared to accept hundreds of thousands of
refugees,' Mr Mendiluce said in Belgrade, the Serbian capital.
The UNHCR and the International Red Cross were recently forced to pull out
of Bosnia-Hercegovina after Serb paramilitary groups repeatedly fired on
relief convoys, while the Yugoslav federal army and Serb militias have
blocked off Sarajevo airport.
'We were forced to stop all operations because of these blockades,' said Mr
Mendiluce. 'Our staff, our vans, and our supplies have been repeatedly
attacked. There is no respect for the symbols (of the UNHCR and the Red
Cross).' A Swiss relief worker was killed by a Serbian mortar attack last
week in the Bosnian capital.
Despite these setbacks, Mr Mendiluce said UNHCR was continuing to negotiate
safe passage for its convoys. But he acknowledged that he was not hopeful
after previous pledges of safe conduct had been repeatedly broken.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Hungary accused on van tariff
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN vehicle companies yesterday accused Hungary of violating
international trade agreements by giving customs preferences to Ford as a
reward for making investments in Hungary.
The protest followed a government decree which set an 18 per cent tariff on
imported vans - with exemption for vehicles with specifications which, in
practice, are met only by Ford Transit models.
The timing of the new tariffs, just as the US carmaker opened an Dollars 83m
(Pounds 46m) components plant in western Hungary and announced a further
Dollars 18m investment, heightened suspicions that the tariff rules have
been re-written to make the investment more attractive.
The Hungarian Association of Vehicle Importers, representing Fiat, Renault
and other foreign companies, issued a furious statement that the customs
preferences broke Hungary's international commitments by discriminating
against specific products.
Neither Ford nor the Hungarian government denied the claims but government
officials argued that as Budapest had not explicitly named any particular
company in the customs decree it had not broken any international rules.
The new burst of protectionism follows the tightening of car import quotas
this year in response to appeals by Suzuki of Japan and General Motors of
the US, which have both built car plants in Hungary.
Ironically, western multinationals have become eastern Europe's most
effective lobby for protection and their efforts to link investment
commitments to guaranteed markets have become all the more intense as local
demand has fallen below expectations.
The latest dispute echoes a recent case in Poland where Warsaw divided a
50,000-car import quota among just three western companies which were
investing in the country. That row prompted appeals to the European
Commission in Brussels by other importers which had been excluded from the
deal.
This week's accusations of illegal trading practices come at an awkward time
for Hungary, which is waiting for ratification of its EC association
agreement by EC parliaments and cannot afford to alienate important west
European lobbies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE ministers from the US, Canada and Mexico are seeking a series of
bilateral deals on the most sensitive regional trade issues in an attempt to
prevent a breakdown in the talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The bilateral talks will include farm trade and textiles and may be extended
to the motor trade.
A Canadian official indicated yesterday that, while progress had been made
on some fronts in recent weeks, several key issues were likely to be
resolved only through bilateral agreements among the three countries, or by
one participant exempting itself from sections of the trilateral pact.
Negotiators are drawing up three separate agreements on agriculture. In
addition, Canada is resisting pressure from the US and Mexico for tighter
rules of origin on clothing and textile imports, and may end up sticking
with the rules in the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA).
The three countries' chief negotiators meet in Washington next week to
identify the issues which require political decisions. The forthcoming
ministerial meeting is expected to take place in Mexico.
Sensitive issues which remain unresolved include rules of origin for
computers and the threshold for duty-free status for automotive imports,
currently at 50 per cent between the US and Canada.
US and Canadian concerns about curbs on foreign investment in Mexico's
energy industry are being at least partly addressed by Mexican moves to
narrow the definition of petrochemical sectors covered by the prohibition on
investment.
The Nafta pact is expected to break new ground in the area of competition
policy. Although it will not contain any rules, the agreement will commit
participants to some form of co-operation in promoting competitive markets.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS by the Russian government to push through vital measures on
privatisation, the centrepiece of its economic reform, have been foiled by
the Russian parliament.
Ministers last night angrily accused pro-communist and nationalist forces of
seeking to derail the reforms.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has in his trip round the country
in the past few days threatened to go over the heads of parliamentary
deputies by calling a referendum on a new constitution and on private
ownership of land.
Parliament yesterday refused to pass a new law and a state programme on
privatisation, leaving the government without the tools to introduce
vouchers for the population.
At the same time it demanded that workers in enterprises get at least 51 per
cent of the stock of privatised companies.
On Thursday, parliament turned down a draft law on bankruptcy, regarded by
ministers as necessary to force inefficient enterprises to the wall as an
example to others.
Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a pro-reform deputy who heads the privatisation
subcommittee in parliament, said: 'I get the impression the pro-Communist
and nationalist deputies, in their failure to pass the bankruptcy law and
the privatisation documents, want to force the president to hold a
referendum at a time of rising public discontent. They see this as a means
of regaining power'.
Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, meanwhile, told the
Komsomolskaya Pravda daily he saw 'the most terrible economic and political
consequences' from the Russian government's 'increasingly authoritarian
policies'. Estonia, smallest of the three Baltic republics, said it would
soon introduce its own currency, the kroon, to run parallel with the rouble,
now in short supply. Ukraine said it would introduce rouble coupons from
July 1 in all domestic transactions.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Mitterrand backs defence freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand has approved plans to freeze defence
spending for at least the next three years and to delay several important
programmes.
The freeze at today's prices, which will amount to a decline in real terms,
is contained in the six-year defence framework programme from 1992 to 1997.
The programme, which lays out firm budget proposals for the first three
years only, will be presented to parliament for final approval in mid-June.
The defence budget is already rising below the rate of inflation, to
FFr195bn (Pounds 19.73bn) this year. Yet French defence cuts do not run
nearly as deep as those made by the UK, US or Germany in response to the
break-up of the Soviet Union.
Among the main points are a more than 20 per cent reduction in army numbers,
which has already been announced and starts next year, and a 60 per cent
reduction in heavy armoured vehicles, Mr Jean-Michel Boucheron, president of
the defence commission, told Liberation newspaper. It marked 'a turning
point in a new geostrategic situation.' The aim was to restructure, not to
disarm too fast, he said.
The main delays are for Dassault aircraft group's Rafale fighter jet, now to
start deliveries two years late, in 1998, and the NH-90 helicopter, being
developed with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, for delivery three years
late, in 2002. Orders for the Leclerc tank, developed by Giat, the
state-owned armaments group, are to be reduced and delayed and a new
generation of nuclear submarines is to be shelved.
Nearly 40,000 jobs were lost in France in April, when unemployment rose by
1.4 per cent from March to 2.9m people, or 10 per cent of the workforce,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Joblessness is one of the main problems facing Mr Pierre Beregovoy's
socialist government. The rate has risen from 9.9 per cent in March and 9.4
per cent a year ago.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Belling calls in receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLING and Company, the UK electric cooker manufacturer whose table-top
Baby Belling has been a mainstay of British bed-sitters for generations, has
gone into receivership.
Mr Paul Jeffery, one of the receivers appointed yesterday from KPMG Peat
Marwick, said: 'The company has been suffering from the effect of a
depressed market.'
The receivers were called in after negotiations with potential buyers fell
through.
The company appears to be another victim of the recession, which last year
forced one of its main competitors, Electrolux, to close a factory in
Birmingham with the loss of 550 jobs.
Belling has been incurring losses for more than three years, and its
indebtedness now stands at about Pounds 25m.
The future of 950 staff at the main site in Enfield, north London, and 300
in Burnley, Lancashire, was unclear last night. 'It is early days, and there
have been no redundancies to date,' Mr Jeffery said.
'We are reviewing the position. My immediate priority is to sell the
business. It is a very well-known brand name and we are anticipating keen
interest in the company. We are seeking buyers for it both in this country
and internationally,' he said.
Belling has made cookers for more than 60 years, and became a household name
with the Baby Belling, a table-top oven with two electric rings. It now
makes a range of cookers, and is one of three UK market leaders in
free-standing appliances.
In 1990 Belling undertook a big redesign and marketing programme, just
before being hit by the recession and a drop in sales of white goods.
Domestic demand for new cookers has dropped by about 30 per cent over the
past three years.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf has one-month deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF has only a month to bring in new investors and to persuade the
government to move civil servants to the office development if it is to
avoid a liquidation which could make it a ghost town.
This was the bleak message yesterday from Mr Michael Dennis, the Olympia &amp;
York director who masterminded Europe's biggest office development, and from
Mr Michael Pickard, chairman of the London Dockland Development Corporation.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, also made clear yesterday that the
government planned to tell Canary Wharf's administrators, who took control
of the project on Thursday, that the Pounds 400m contribution agreed by O&amp;Y
towards the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line was
'non-negotiable'.
Meanwhile the administrators, who are three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, have
been deciding which of Canary Wharf's running costs need to be cut
immediately.
There are fears that an early victim will be the Riverbus Partnership, which
provides the only commercial passenger service on the River Thames.
O&amp;Y has only a minority holding in Riverbus, but it has been covering the
losses generated by the service.
Mr Pickard, the main policy maker outside central government for Docklands,
said rapid decisions had to be taken by government and potential investors
in Canary Wharf if it was not to be damaged irreparably.
A number of companies, including American Express and Texaco, are understood
to be reviewing whether they should move to Canary Wharf as they had
planned.
Both Mr Pickard and Mr Dennis said a government commitment to move 2,000
civil servants to Canary Wharf needed to be made quickly, to reassure these
companies and prevent the occupancy rate falling to level where liquidation
would be inevitable.
Mr Pickard pointed out that the Canary Wharf buildings were technologically
more sophisticated than most UK buildings. Unless they were maintained,
which might not take place if the project was liquidated, the buildings
could deteriorate badly.
He said the regeneration of Docklands could be set back by three or four
years if Canary Wharf was not kept as a going concern. He said the costs of
such a delay far outweighed the 'small sums' needed from government and
investors to keep Canary Wharf afloat.
Mr Dennis disclosed that O&amp;Y had drawn up a list of 20 investors with
sufficient resources to rescue Canary Wharf. It began its search for such
investors three months ago, at the suggestion of Citicorp, the US bank with
a substantial exposure to O&amp;Y's worldwide operations.
The potential investors include the investment offices of most of the
oil-rich Gulf states, the Singapore government's investment office and a
handful of international insurance companies. Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong
investor, is also on the list but yesterday that Lord Sterling, chairman of
P&amp;O, may become involved in helping to raise outside finance. P&amp;O has been
closely involved in Canary Wharf's development as owner of Bovis, the
building contractor.
Mr Major yesterday underlined that the government was not prepared to
increase its contribution to the Jubilee project. It had already contributed
well over Pounds 1bn to Docklands. His policy remained that the line would
go ahead only when the owners of Canary Wharf provided the amount agreed.
Mr Dennis pointed out that the contribution which Canary Wharf said it would
make to the Jubilee line was not Pounds 400m in today's money, since the
payments are staggered over 25 years. The value in today's money of the
contribution is between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m.
Senior officials close to the prime minister said any flexibility in the
government's negotiating position would be restricted to the timing of
payments.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Fierce artillery attack on Dubrovnik

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations is expected to vote for stiff sanctions against Serbia
today in the wake of fierce attacks yesterday on the historic Croatian port
of Dubrovnik and the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
Defying growing international anger, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav federal
army launched a ferocious artillery assault on Dubrovnik. Sarajevo meanwhile
suffered its worst bombardment in nearly three months as Serb irregulars,
backed by the army, tightened their grip on the city.
Witnesses said sirens wailed as the attack on Dubrovnik began and residents
ran to basement shelters for cover.
Smoke rose over the old city and from the Hotel Argentina, outside the walls
of the medieval centre. One rocket hit St John's Tower, part of the city's
walls.
'There is one hell of a battle going on, apparently to get our airport,'
said Ms Ruth Ewins, a British woman living in Dubrovnik.
Other witnesses said mortars struck the centre of the medieval walled city,
damaging part of the 14th-century Dominican monastery and the baroque
cathedral.
The attack came two days after army units withdrew from the surrounding
hills and as Croatian forces were within a few miles of regaining control
over the Adriatic coastline.
The motive for the attack was unclear, but one European diplomat said the
assault was made by army units 'out of spite' for being forced to withdraw
from Dubrovnik's hinterland.
In Sarajevo, Serb militia continued to exchange fire with Moslem and Croat
forces after the army pounded the city with multiple-rocket launchers in the
early hours.
Mr Boro Kontic, a Bosnian journalist contacted by telephone, said shelling
'was the worst kind ever', adding that the army and Serb irregulars were
still preventing food, water and medicine reaching the besieged city. Ms
Nada Mladena, a Serb paediatrician, told an independent Belgrade radio
station that Serb extremists had attacked a children's clinic and a Serbian
orthodox church in Tuzla, north-east of Sarajevo.
In New York, diplomats said private consultations would continue this
morning and were expected to be followed by a vote on sweeping sanctions,
including an oil embargo, on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro.
Diplomats thought that China and Zimbabwe might abstain on the vote in the
15-member Security Council. But Russia and India might go along with the
sanctions, being pressed hard by the US.
The proposed sanctions are nearly as comprehensive as those imposed on Iraq
after it invaded Kuwait, such as a ban on all trade, except for food and
medicine, as well as the cutting of air links and sports exchanges. The
resolution also calls for a freeze on Serbian and Montenegrin financial
assets abroad.
However, diplomats said that the US would drop a proposal to expel Serbia
and Montenegro from the UN.
Serb leaders were defiant and Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnian Serbs,
said in Belgrade that any sanctions against Serbia would be 'dishonourable,
unjust and counter-productive'.
The European Football Union gave Yugoslavia the go-ahead to play in next
month's European soccer championship finals in Sweden. But it will review
its decision if the UN imposes a sporting boycott on Serbia.

SODOM and Gomorrah, also known as Washington, DC, and the plusher suburbs of
Maryland and Virginia, were still standing yesterday, but it was a close run
thing.
For Ross Perot had ridden into town for a quick check on the new ranch he
intends to buy next year and declared he just plumb didn't like some of the
'thangs' going on around town, apart, of course, from the sidewalk mob of
wide-eyed believers outside his down-home new office jus' a couple of blocks
from the big white building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The man who lives there
now, George Bush, was out west in cactus land grubbing for votes, as was the
man who thinks he ought to move in, Bill Clinton.
The big wheel up on Capitol Hill, Danny 'the taxman' Rostenkowski, was going
justifiably nuclear about charges that he had fiddled the House of
Representatives' post office.
There was a clear field and there would have to be changes, Ross Perot told
his new television celebrity friends, Barbara Walters and Jesse Jackson; no
gays and adulterers sullying his cabinet, and he didn't think much of
homosexuals in the military either; no more third-rate justices like
Clarence Thomas messing up the Supreme Court; no more taxes either, unless
earmarked for education.
Actually, a lot of Washington was doing what it normally does in moments of
supreme crisis - watching its local football quarterback on the professional
golf tour in a Maryland suburb and the Indigo Girls' open-air concert in
Virginia.
It was left to the wife of a decent amateur golfer to take on the invader.
What Ross Perot is up to, proclaimed Marilyn Quayle, whose husband's job is
under threat from the little man from Texas, 'is really not the American
way'. You just cannot buy the presidency and then rule, she said at dawn
yesterday.
Not that Ross Perot was sticking around much, leaving for Orlando to talk by
satellite to supporters in five far-flung states before moving on by
terrestrial transport to a barbecue he has paid for in Arkansas. That is
where Bill Clinton usually lives and where chicken farming is very big.
In any case, he does not need to come to Washington to find out what is
wrong with it, as a surprising number of the city's movers and shakers have
taken to going to Dallas to tell him. Of course some of them would rather
fancy a job in a Perot administration. They include Pat Choate, whose recent
book charges that Japan has bought Washington lock, stock and sake barrel;
Jude Wanniski, supply-side polemicist; Lloyd Cutler, Democratic
lawyer-fixer; John Steinbruner, from the Brookings Institution, the foreign
policy think tank; William Seidman, Republican banking expert; Felix
Rohatyn, the financier; and Jesse Jackson, who is everywhere.
And, of course, there is Vicki Bagley, local socialite and property
whiz-turned-publisher, who came north many years ago with Jimmy Carter.
'I'll do anything for him, scrub floors, bring chick-en, make posters,' she
told the Washington Post. Well, at least Ross Perot won't starve if he ever
takes up residence in Sin City.

<TEXT>
there will be no problem in knowing when the recession is really over. The
signs will be there, as significant as the Star in the East. 'Shopkeepers
will abandon their strange new mantras 'Can I help you' and 'Would you like
to order one?' and revert to the familiar 'Sorry, we're just closing' and
'If you don't see it we haven't got it.'
If that be a good litmus test - and I cannot think of a better one - the
recession still has a little way to go but some early warning signs are
beginning to emerge. It is getting harder to catch the assistants eye in
some shops, a waiter in one smart London watering-hole is beginning to adopt
a snooty 'what do you mean what is blackened carpaccio?' tone and a friend
complains that having spent Pounds 180 on trousers at a chic London shop she
could not get them altered in under two weeks . . . three swallows, not yet
a full-blown summer but I sense that something somewhere is beginning to
stir. On the fashion front there is a flurry of new happenings and openings,
all of which speak at least of optimism if not yet concrete results.
At Harvey Nichols in London's Knightsbridge they seem to have been
especially busy - over from the US they are bringing the oh-so-chic
collection of Kleinberg Sherill handbags, belts and other must-have
accessories.
To those unfamiliar with the Kleinberg Sherill line, it is a newish (started
in 1983) company which kicked off with a little collection of five alligator
belts (all alligators authorised, of course) and great sterling silver
buckles. Not cheap, at anything from Pounds 250 to Pounds 895 a time, they
took off from the start, being snatched off the counters at Neiman Marcus,
I. Magnin and Bergdorf Goodman as fast as they arrived.
Belts are still a big seller, one of the special features being that the
buckles are removable so that they can be used with any other Kleinberg
Sherill belt. Many of the original motifs developed as buckles, like the
'love knot' and 'rope stitch' appear time and time again. They turn up,
paired, as earrings, are worked into the embroidery of a silk evening clutch
bag, are sculpted as a buckle, are worked into belts and incorporated into
clasps in the handbag range.
The handbags for summer come quilted in jewel-bright colours - fuschia,
scarlet, butter yellow, aquamarine blue and for evening the same brilliant
colours come in silk. These are all gutsy, extrovert accessories - designed
to set off a silk dress, a flamboyant suit, to bring a flash of colour to a
plain black dress. But they are quality-made and prices are high. Little
roped quilted bags start at Pounds 300, the belts at Pounds 250.
Down in the basement there is a whole raft of new collections in the
contemporary menswear department - Byblos, Dolce e Gabbano, Kenzo, Adolfo
Dominguiz, all worth checking up on for the chap who likes to dress in an
utterly contemporary yet classy way. These are the creme de la creme of
modern menswear, so once again do not expect bargain basement prices - what
designers like these provide is excitement coupled with quality.
The collection of so many of the best and brightest together in one
department offers a marvellous opportunity for the chap to compare and
contrast them. Anybody wondering just what it is that one of these new-wave
designers could possibly do for him that Savile Row cannot has a marvellous
chance to find out.
Great excitement in London's Old Bond Street where a splendiferous new
five-floor flag-ship Versace emporium has opened at no 34 - 35. Anybody who
knows the Versace style - and those addicted to that new opiate of the
nation, Hello] magazine, will not have been able to avoid full exposure to
his lines - will not be expecting anything quiet, restrained or understated.
Here the full panopoly of the Versace style has room to runs its untramelled
course - whether it be a richly coloured silk scarf, a glittering
gilt-embossed handbag, some ribboned shoes or gilt-studded jeans - here is
the place to find them. Ascot, I predict, will never be the same again.

cleft stick - Globetrotting journalists do not need collapsible canoes -
they travel light, says Nicholas Woodsworth, who has been scouring London's
specialist shops for clothing and other items that a writer might need in
his rucksack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BEFORE William Boot, newly-appointed foreign correspondent of the Daily
Beast, set off on assignment to a distant corner of Africa, he made his way
to a London outfitter and ordered what he believed to be tools vital to his
trade - a dozen cleft sticks with which native runners could carry his
despatches to the outside world. But that was not all. Put into the hands of
the efficient shop assistant Miss Barton, he ended up with the essentials
that no modern traveller could be without.
'By the time she had finished with him, William had acquired a well-,
perhaps rather over-, furnished tent, three months rations, a collapsible
canoe, a jointed flag staff and Union Jack, a hand pump and sterilising
plant, an astrolabe, six suits of tropical linen and a sou'wester, a camp
operating table and set of surgical instruments, a portable humidor,
guaranteed to preserve cigars in condition in the Red Sea, and a Christmas
hamper complete with Santa Claus costume and tripod mistletoe stand, and a
cane for whacking snakes.'
Evelyn Waugh's description of travel haberdashery in his satiric novel Scoop
is tongue-in-cheek, but not altogether unrealistic. Just 50 years ago, when
the British empire still stained maps red from Guyana to Rangoon, travel was
far removed from the casual, light-weight affair it is today.
Administrators, soldiers, and civil servants went out to the colonies by the
thousands. They travelled by sea, and although the wealthier ones went posh
 -port out, starboard home - to avoid the worst of the tropical sun, weight
allowances were such that no one had any excuse not to bring out with them
all the formal accoutrements of their age and social class. Dinner jackets
might not make as much sense as sarongs in the dank jungle heat of the
Malayan night, but shed so much as a cummerbund and Reggie, Biffy, Pongo and
the others might never ask you to play a chukka with them again.
Times have changed. For most of us, steamer trunks, collar studs and
personal valets have long disappeared, and what we can take abroad to wear
is limited by a 20-kilo air allowance. Nor are the fashion dictates of the
age quite as rigorous as they used to be - we travel mostly now for leisure
and relaxation, and in most situations it is perfectly acceptable to dress
with that in mind. Britain, in fact, is one of the last strong-holds of a
more formal style of casual attire; on seaside promenades, in hotel lounges,
on informal evenings out, Britons on holiday at home will wear jackets and
ties where Frenchmen or Americans would not dream of it.
But even if you want to join the jeans and rucksack set - and most people do
not, for this would be almost as limiting as travelling with formal evening
wear only - selecting just what to bring along remains something of an art.
A compromise between what you would like to have with you and what is
practical to take, it can make the difference between a wholly successful
and a wholly miserable trip.
Some of the things people take are neither practical nor attractive. Any
time I pack a bag and feel the slightest hesitation over any article, I cast
my mind far back to a disastrous trip home from Sri Lanka after a theft from
a bus roof had left me with no baggage at all. Preferring to spend most of
the funds I had left on a cheap Aeroflot ticket, I put the money saved into
the hands of a Colombo tailor, who, it turned out, was far better at talking
than sewing. I ended up spending two days in Moscow in February in a bright
and baggy salmon-pink tropical suit, borrowed red woollen socks, and
sandals.
It was an outfit so horrible that Muscovites simply refused to acknowledge
my existence. Bemedalled officers on icy streets stared straight through me.
The lady at the Bolshoi box office declined to sell me a ticket. Waitresses
refused to notice me. The memory is enough to make me put any article not
entirely appropriate back where it came from at once.
Most questions of travel clothing and accessories, of course, are solved
with common sense. We know if we are going to be in a hot country or a cold
one, in a sophisticated city, at an elegant country resort, or on a rough,
deserted trail far from civilisation, and we dress accordingly. A few
reminders, though, might be useful.
Never take more than you can comfortably carry. You may not be planning a
dash across the roof of the world, but the length of a Roma Termini railway
platform can seem just as daunting if you are loaded down and in a desperate
hurry. While wheeled suitcases do help and are fine for screaming across
slick floors at Heathrow, not even Nigel Mansell could get the same luggage
to roll an inch at airstrips in Borneo, Katanga, or the Sierra Madre. The
old rule of thumb still applies: pack your bags with as much as you think
you need, then remove half of it.
Most things you can buy at your destination. If Malaysians live perfectly
happy lives in sarongs, it is because such wear is eminently suited to their
surroundings. No one suggests you go native, but wherever you travel there
are lots of locally made items of clothing that are cheaper, better adapted
to the immediate environment, and more easily available than those at home.
And if you insist on having western consumer goods, there are very few
places in the world where you cannot now purchase them.
Never buy third world footwear. This is the one great caveat to local
shopping. If there is an item that precisely indicates a nation's level of
development more surely than any World Bank study, it is shoes.
Under-developed countries produce under-developed footwear, and nothing can
ruin an exotic place more quickly than seeing it at a painful limp. Here is
one area where good old American know-how is invaluable. I never travel
anywhere without my Rockports, the lightest and most comfortable shoe I
know.
Subscribe to fashion that is current and local. If you are going to St
Tropez, Gstaad, or some other fashionable watering hole, and want to be as
'in' as you can get, do not buy your clothes in London before setting out.
You may pay a little more buying a summer outfit at Naf-Naf on the Vieux
Port, but you can be sure it is up to the minute.
Avoid ostentation. In many parts of the world, both developed and
under-developed, travelling about with expensive clothing, video cameras,
costly watches and jewellery conspicuously displayed can not only set you
apart from the people you are trying to get to know; it can also set you up
for a mugging around the next corner.
Simplicity and restraint, then, would seem to be the key to successful
travel. But there is more to it than that, as I discovered when wandering
around several London shops specialising in travel-wear and accessories. By
using high-tech fabrics, light-weight materials and a bit of ingenuity, you
will find that even a small suitcase can hold everything you need to
withstand trials from desert sand storms to ambassador's garden parties.
Begin, for example, with the case itself. There are myriad bags for every
purpose, but at The Survival Shop - the closest you will come these days to
the colonial emporium of old - you can get a very presentable and practical
suitcase and rucksack in one. Unzip the side panel of several models of Lowe
or Wolfskin cases and suddenly you have a rucksack with comfortable interior
tubular frame and padded shoulder straps. Prices range from Pounds 65 to
Pounds 140.
Natural fibre or polyester? For years the debate has raged, proponents of
cotton and wool saying that wearing synthetics in the tropics is like
wearing a sweaty plastic bag, supporters of polyester claiming there is
nothing like it.
In Piccadilly's Airey and Wheeler - a shop specialising in a wide range of
men's tropical suits - I was shown a Pounds 185 businessman's pinstripe
suit, of polyester and wool, which can be machine washed. Their best selling
single item, though, is the Pinfeather suit, a polyester-cotton mix which,
they claim, is uncrushable, machine-washable, does not require ironing, and
can even be bunged into a tumble dryer. Very popular with hard-travelling,
hard-nosed journalists, this indestructible outfit is the sort of thing
Superman would wear when his own gear is at the dry cleaners.
I, too, own a Pinfeather, but in weaker, more sensitive moments tend towards
natural fibres. They may not survive a suitcase as well, but they are light,
they breath and above all, they look and feel comfortable. For those with
both fashion and comfort in mind, I would recommend Travelling Light, a
specialist company which deals in smart casuals in light cottons, twills,
linens, silks and woollens for both men and women.
The debate, however, may soon be irrelevant - science is evolving a wide
range of man-made materials that are tough, light-weight, wind and
water-proof, easily washable and still have the advantages of natural fibre.
For example, Gore-Tex, the bonded membrane that allows body-generated vapour
out but not water in, can be applied to much softer, more fashionable
material. Polyester 'fleeces', worn under porous waterproof shells, now
provide greater warmth than wool with a fraction of the weight. Cotton
ventile, used by RAF pilots, is warm and windproof, but can breathe.
Waterproof hydrophilic-coated jackets weighing only half a pound can be
fitted into you pocket. Pertex, by allowing perspiration to evaporate by
capillary action, permits the wearer great exertion and warmth without
discomfort.
For those intending climbing, walking and camping holidays, the Survival
Shop and the Youth Hostel Association's Adventure Shops are good places to
become familiar with such high-tech products.
My greatest surprise in wandering around London's travel and leisure shops,
however, came not from the ultra modern but from a rather old-fashioned
establishment, Farlows of Pall Mall. It is the sort of place where country
aristocracy bump about looking for beagle-motif ties to match their tweed
shooting jacket and breeks. There, in a rack of walking canes in a corner,
stands a cleft stick. I did not enquire into its function, so delighted was
I to find it. Do not despair, William Boots of the world, there is hope yet.
This weekend I am off to find a collapsible canoe.

FT  30 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Musts for the wardrobe / A look at the
second Boden catalogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN JOHNNIE Boden, a former investment banker, bored with city ways and
city life, launched his first Boden catalogue a few months back readers
immediately took to his strictly edited range of carefully-chosen basics -
no complicated choices, no vast ranges to peruse at great length, just
great, simple clothes.
Naturally, when things become successful they tend to grow so that after
what Johnnie Boden calls The First Great Clothes Hunt we now have . . . yes,
The Second Great Clothes Hunt. Many of the additions to the new catalogue
have come about because customers have asked for them.
For instance, the 100 per cent Irish Linen trousers emerge early on in the
book because, according to Johnnie: 'I asked you which clothes you wanted to
see next time round. Linen trousers came top. Not that I needed much
persuasion.'
He adds: 'All right, they're not cheap (Pounds 60). Linen creases
annoyingly. But somehow you know this. You expect it. If you saw linen
trousers that were cheap and didn't crease, well, they wouldn't be linen.
100 per cent pure Irish linen, the fabric that has served man and, above
all, that hybrid, ex-patriate man, for centuries.
'When you wear linen trousers, you are saying, I don't care. So what if they
crease. At times, you just have to wear the coolest fabric ever woven. Linen
can absorb about a fifth of its own weight in moisture, releasing it quickly
(now you know why it is used for drying-up cloths). The next time you feel
The Mad Dog stir within you, find some midday sun, put these on and revel in
it, ' says Boden.
This gives you not only the specific details on the linen trousers but,
possibly more importantly, conveys the authentic flavour of the catalogue.
Every item chosen is discussed or justified if you like in Johnnie Boden's
own inimitable style. The 100 per cent cotton China Blue Shirt at Pounds 37
a time has been chosen because: 'Occasionally, I wake up and don't care.
It's a sunny day, the window box is in bloom, all's right with the world. On
days like this, though a certain smartness may be required, the perfection
of a poplin shirt seems out of step with the general abandonment. I need
something, if not frivolous, then definitely lighthearted.'
The new additions to the catalogue have all been chosen for similarly
personal and idiosyncratic reasons, working on the principle he first
propounded. that if it appealed to him, then it probably would appeal to
others, too.
There are linen shirts and panama hats, velvet slippers and check shirts,
there are heavy duty cotton canvas linesman bags, 'I admit it, these bags
are basic. The materials are straightforward, the construction is simple and
strong. They have a fundamental, wholesome quality.' . Then there are pure
wool picnic rugs (Pounds 45 a time), lots of cufflinks (plain and jokey,
from Pounds 16 to Pounds 36), and a rather curious range of ties (flowered,
checked,starred, spotted).
One of the innovations is that the range of unisex clothing has been
increased - items such as cotton-checked shirts come in sizes that women
could happily don, panama hats and cotton sweaters, and the expanded range
of bags and luggage are all designed to appeal as much to women as to men.
He has, however, stuck to his original tenets - nothing high fashion,
nothing quirky (well, if you do not count the distinctly quirky Thai
baseball hat), nothing that even hints of a total life-style. And yet he
manages to make sure that nothing in the catalogue is boring or fills one
with that sense of having seen it all before - it is a clever mix of the
classic 'must-haves' and the basics that are hard to track down.
He aims to deliver orders within ten workings days of receiving them and
will, if it is more convenient, deliver to a work address.
Where he goes from here, it will be interesting to see. For the moment much
of the charm of the operation lies in its smallness and its quirkiness - The
Second Great Clothes Hunt has survived expansion with the original concept
intact. The range is still sufficiently small for one not to feel
overwhelmed when searching through it or for the basic principles to be
compromised. Whether it could survive much more growth, I am not so sure.
Anyone thinking that the Boden way of dressing is likely to be theirs should
write for a copy of a free catalogue to: Boden, 9 Forge Court, Reading Road,
Yately, Cambridge. Tel: 0252-861112.
FOR CHAPS who believe that when it comes to the delicate matter of
after-shave to indulge in it is better to err on the side of the discreet,
rather than the insistent, Penhaligon's is one of the safe, sure names.
Others may have higher profiles, others may laud their wares more flagrantly
but Penhaligon's has an enviable reputation of tradition and know-how.
Although the recent company is not all that old (Sheila Pickles revived it
in the late 1970s) its reputation for quality,tradition and classicism has
been built on the fact that it has revived centuries-old formulae such as
Hammam Bouquet and Blenheim Bouquet to please its male customers. It has
developed six new gentlemens' colognes and, again, in the Penhaligons'
tradition, they have been recreated from century-old formulae.
Eau de cologne (most classic of them all, mainly based on citrus oils),
Extract of Limes, Esprit de Lavande, Eau San Pareil, Esprit du Roi and Eau
de Verveine all come simply but beautifully bottled and boxed. They cost
Pounds 16 for 50 ml, Pounds 35 for 200 ml and Pounds 50 for 500 ml and are
available from all Penhaligon's shops, including the one at 41 Wellington
Street, Covent Garden, London WC2, or by mail on 081-880-2050.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Not a bad day, quite the reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD a dream this week in which the outcome of next Wednesday's Epsom Derby
was revealed to me backwards. Time ran backwards, which meant that
everything happened in reverse: the Derby, my conversations with the Queen,
my journey to the racetrack. What prompted the dream, I'm sure, was Time's
Arrow, the Martin Amis novel, which I read last weekend. It tells the story
of a man's life backwards. (The man is a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz; with time
running backwards, he grows younger by the day, until he arrives at
childhood's innocence. We were all innocent, once).
My Derby dream was vivid. It started at the moment that a horse named Alnasr
Alwasheek, travelling backwards, left the finishing line last, which meant
he was first - two lengths behind Dr Devious, the horse I had backed. (The
Lester Piggott-ridden favourite, Rodrigo De Triano, was closer to last than
first, having been one of the first to cross the line).
'Tip-top]' said the Queen. 'Let's have some strawberries, then we'll meet
the owner. I'll send someone to fetch him.'
'An excellent race,' I agreed.
'Astonishing]' cried the Queen, raising her binoculars. 'Just as you
predicted] Is there clairvoyancy in your family? What a super race]'
As I watched, the runners moved backwards to Tattenham Corner, where there
was a certain amount of scrimmaging, then on up the hill and into the
starting stalls.
'They're off]' cried the Queen excitedly, lowering her binoculars.
Just before the Off], I raced downstairs, past the security guards and
across to the bookmakers. I handed a bookie a betting stub and he gave me
Pounds 500.
'Thankyou, sir.'
'Thankyou.'
'Certainly, sir. Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 500, Dr Devious.'
'Pounds 500 on Dr Devious, please.'
The Queen said: 'You've got about four minutes.'
I explained that I had not yet placed my bet.
'You certainly don't lack confidence. What a glorious afternoon] Have you
met the Queen Mother?'
'Dr Devious,' I said, 'though I am worried by Alnasr Alwasheek. Whatever the
outcome, there will be two lengths between them.'
'Such a shame,' agreed the Queen, 'but we can't have everything we want, can
we? What is your tip?'
'The Derby is easily my favourite race,' I told her. 'It is a pity that the
royal studs are without a runner this year.'
As most people know, the Queen is an expert on racing and breeding. She owns
many racehorses, though some are very slow. Despite her fabulous wealth, she
has had only scant success since unwisely selling one of her best horses,
Height of Fashion, to the Maktoum family of Dubai for a sum reckoned to have
been about Pounds 1.6m.
Last year (or was it next?) the Queen finished 69th on the UK owners' list,
with prizemoney of Pounds 62,168, immediately below a company called
Skeltools, which won Pounds 62,423. Her winnings were a drab pittance when
set against those of the leading owner, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, who won
Pounds 1.84m. According to her apologists, the Queen's bloodstock operation
has to be seen to be self-financing and is extremely tightly budgeted, to
ward off political criticism.
The Queen said: 'So glad you could make it. I know that you like
horse-racing. As I said to my racing manager, so few of my relatives are now
suitable to be seen in public with me that I want to meet new people at
Epsom on Derby day. Young people. Bright people. New people.'
'Good afternoon, Ma'am.'
'Good afternoon, Mr Thompson-Noel,' said the Queen, her blue eyes
glittering. She was wearing a yellow dress and a strand of ancestral pearls.
She is grey and small now, but still vivacious and droll.
After leaving the track, I headed for the rail station. At the end of my
journey I went to the ticket office; I handed in my ticket and received
Pounds 12. Then I hailed a taxi. I gave the driver some change and he gave
me Pounds 8.
My long day was ending. I read the newspapers and poached myself an egg. I
bathed and shaved and gargled. Then I rolled into bed. What a splendid day,
I thought. Because I had backed a loser, I was Pounds 500 ahead, plus Pounds
42.80 for expenses.
Once you start going backwards, you can't afford to stop.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Why the Gideons are facing a fight in hotel bedrooms /
Discovering a new 'bible' guaranteed to help you gravitate from mud bath to
solarium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ONE OF the gambling heroes of Damon Runyan's short stories
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
I think it was 'Sky' Masterson - had an unlikely talent. He knew much of the
Bible by heart, and could use this to impress young ladies of a devout
disposition.
What they did not realise was that Sky read only the Bible because he lived
in hotels, and the sort of hotels where the only adornments to the rooms
were Bibles left by the tireless Gideons.
Nowadays, although the Gideons have not given up the good fight - there is
another volume which seems to have been placed in thousands of hotel rooms
by a mysterious evangelical organisation.
It is called 'The Leading Hotels of the World' and it is published by a
company called The Leading Hotels of the World Inc. Rather than preach of
the riches and pleasures of the life to come, LHW Inc contents itself with
promises of what can be attained in the worldly life.
It worships Mammon and is no less fascinating for that. But, like the Bible,
or at least the King James' version, it preaches to us in a language which
we never hear spoken. Typically, any of the 300 or so listed hotels will
combine 'modern amenities with the charm and tradition of a bygone era.'
Strangely, none of the hotels ever offers modern tradition with the
amenities of a bygone era.
I was brought up to think that a hotel was somewhere in which one relaxed
and used as a base from which to explore the neighbourhood. That is
old-fashioned, not part of the existence promised by the Leading Hotels of
the World.
They all offer dreadful sports - 'gymnasium, clay tennis-court, 18-hole
mini-golf, and horseback-riding.' Note, it is never 'riding' but always
'horseback-riding.' And one absolutely does not leave the hotels. These are
city-states, determined that their citizens should never spend their dollars
in the outside world.
At first, you might feel a bit restless. But, after you have been massaged
into submission by the 'additional features' - naturally, all the hotels
offer additional features - your brain will have been too thoroughly washed
to conceive of another lifestyle. You will gravitate, an assiduous mummy,
from sauna to hydro-massage to mud bath to solarium to revitalising centre.
You do not worry about children in the Leading Hotels of the World. Most of
them offer 'children's programs,' and this does not mean Blue Peter in the
language of your choice. No, 'children's programs' mean that your children
are programmed to be happy, happy, happy without you in their mini-saunas,
mini-solaria, and mini-revitalising centres.
These are delights never mentioned in the Gideon Bible. But, as in the
Bible, certain passages in 'The Leading Hotels of the World' are not meant
to be taken literally, or, if so, only as prophecy. Are we really to
believe, as gospel, that the Dubin restaurant in the Hotel Esplanade,
Zagreb, offers 'intimate luxury and exquisite international cuisine'?
I imagine that of late it has become a little more intimate and a little
less exquisite. And is Las Hadas hotel in Manzanillo, Mexico, 'so perfect
that it is a natural setting for the movie, 10'? And is the angular
tower-block of the White Swan hotel, Guangzhou, really 'a vibrant, yet
peaceful symbol of today's China'? Or the almost new Hotel Shilla in Seoul
really the 'Heritage Home of Ancient Korean Charm and Hospitality' with
'Traditional Royal Dynastic Luxury and Elegance'?
To ask these questions is like saying of the Book of Genesis that God did
not really create the world in seven days. It is a good point, but churlish
and lacking the imagination which fired the writer.
And I have found in The Leading Hotels of the World the perfect place for
'Sky' Masterson: the Soaltee Hotel in Katmandu: 'Additional features: casino
Nepal, Nepal's only casino.' Who needs the Himalayas?

FT  30 MAY 92 / Private View: The diplomat who turned green
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE versatility is admired. Too much arouses suspicion. But a person
who is versatile intellectually is feared: which is why, no doubt, Sir
Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, has been described by a
Tory MP as an 'eco-terrorist'.
Sir Crispin has been, among other things, Britain's ambassador to the United
Nations and to Mexico, permanent secretary to the UK's overseas aid ministry
and chef de cabinet to a European Commission president. He is an amateur
climatologist and palaeohistorian. He is better known as a green
propagandist who advises the British Prime Minister.
The name of Sir Crispin's college is accidentally ecological. It comes from
the benefactors, Cecil and Ida Green, founders of Texas Instruments.
The heatwave was still in progress when I went to Green College in search of
illumination about the UN Conference on Environment and Development, the
Earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro next week.
I asked Sir Crispin if he was (as MP Teresa Gorman had said) an
eco-terrorist.
His pale blue eyes narrowed. 'She's an absurd woman.'
It is not only her, I said. You are often described in the Press as a
doom-monger.
'Yes. Because I think it's easier to sell papers if you call someone a
doomster. In fact I very carefully always put the other point of view. The
truth is people like to hear prophecies of doom but suggestions as to what
might be done are much less popular.'
But you are a pessimist?
'It's very hard to be precise. I'm a pessimist about the ability of human
beings to do very much about these problems in the short term. I'm an
optimist in the sense that the needs are so great that people will do
something before too long.
You have said it takes a catastrophe before people act.
'Therefore one's best hope is that it's a very small catastrophe - the
little earthquake in Chile, if you see what I mean.' He meant that accidents
such as the 1988 drought in the US mid-West, which might or might not have
anything to do with global warming, at least made governments sit up.
What about the dreadful weather we have been having?
Sir Crispin ignored this attempt at irony and explained that heatwaves and
droughts could be ascribed to natural climatic variability. 'The truth is we
don't fully understand how the climatic system works. We know in general
terms. Little variations in it don't necessarily signify.'
So people like yourself could be overstating the case.
'I would think so if I were only looking at climate. In fact I don't think
the climate is the biggest environmental hazard. I think human
multiplication is. So if I'm a doomster - I don't like that word, obviously
 -it relates much more to the complex of environmental issues of which
climate change is only one.'
Crispin Tickell had the orthodox education of the British mandarin:
scholarships to Westminster School and Oxford and a First in modern history.
Like many of his public school generation, he was taught no science
whatever.
In his thirties he started to read physics and biology textbooks at bedtime.
His interest in what he now calls 'the downside of the Industrial
Revolution' really began with a year at Harvard in 1975.
Instead of picking a subject he was familiar with he plumped for
climatology.
You wanted a hot potato?
'Yes. I chose in fact what looked like a cold political potato but turned
out to be relatively hot.'
I asked him why he started reading physics textbooks.
'I just found it so interesting.' He laughed. 'I think it's ridiculous. We
live in a society in which we are wholly dependent on science and yet there
are people who actually enjoy defying what in some respects is the most
critical thing that's going on around us. Understanding is the least you can
do, even if you aren't going to contribute.'
While Tickell was at the UN, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait forcing Tickell
to postpone a trip to Montana in search of fossilised dinosaur eggs. I
supposed his interest in the past gave him a longer perspective than most.
Do you think about the end of the human race, for example?
'One of my less agreeable daydream-cum-nightmares is what would happen to
the world if human beings were extinguished by some virus. I wonder how long
it would take before the world would produce something comparable to
ourselves - if it ever did.
Sir Crispin was alive to the dangers of the Cuba missile crisis of 1963 but
said he did not really believe in the nuclear holocaust. He seems more
impressed by the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth; in the 1960s
he urged arms negotiators to ensure that an impact like the one in Siberia
in 1908 would not be read as a nuclear attack.
Are our leaders were competent to deal with climatic and population
problems?
'I fear that the human mind is geared to the short term. Because I am
experienced in the ways of the world I know how slow people are to take
action. But when a new model of the world becomes imprinted in their minds,
their action often accelerates.'
Sir Crispin is alarmed by the lack of communication between scientists and
politicians. He is creating a consultancy at his college to help turn the
predictions of the former into action by the latter.
Are scientists to blame for failing to explain that they can offer only
probabilities, not certainties?
'That's quite true. They are reluctant to draw general conclusions from
their ideas because they don't wish to be wrong. They are also bad at
communicating their ideas in language everyone can understand.'
Do you agree that politicians are not capable of making policy judgments
because they are scientifically illiterate?
'I do. Politicians don't often understand the workings of science and think
things are much more concrete than they are. They often don't have the
fundamental intellectual training which enables them to make judgments. But
they are not the short-term people they are often presented as being. They
can recognise the importance of a long-term problem as well as anyone.'
You think former ambassadors are better at it?
'I think former ambassadors can have a go because they often, like lawyers,
have to reduce briefs to their bones.'
Even if their own scientific training is . . . ?
' . . . is zero. Yes I think so. I wish that people were a bit more brave,
and perhaps foolhardy, in venturing into subjects where they don't
necessarily have all the professional qualifications.'
You must be seen as the effortless mandarin, I said, the generalist with the
first-class mind who's dabbling in areas where he shouldn't be going.
'That's what the experts would like to say, because experts defend their
fields as trade unions defend the closed shop. But in fact I think we all
agree it's very good to try and create a sort of bridge between these
different disciplines. Of course it's dangerous for anyone who's outside the
field to venture into it but I feel l can, having thought about climatology
for 15 years. I think I know what the problems are.
'It's not that I claim to understand things better than others. It is that
I'm sure the sort of thinking that goes on in science and technology should
be part of everyone's heritage. So, far from being the sort of generalist
you're talking about, I go back to a much earlier generalism, the kind that
was favoured in the very beginning of the Renaissance when it was natural
for Leonardo or Michelangelo to want to be interested in engineeering. It
seems to me you can't be a whole person unless you're capable of being
interested in a great many things.'
What would constitute success at Rio, and what failure?
'What I think would constitute a success would be the building of
foundations on which environmental action can later be taken.'
That's rather vague, isn't it?
'Not as vague as you might think. A failure at Rio would be a failure to
agree upon anything, a failure to recognise the gravity of the problem and a
failure to recognise that something needs to be done.'
'If you turn what I have said into practical language it means this: if we
can draw up a convention which consecrates a consensus and suggests what
might be done in the future as the consensus takes more practical form, then
I think that's success.
'I actually never believed that the Rio summit would emerge with a lot of
specific agreements. But it has served a number of excellent purposes: to
focus the minds of politicians and bureaucrats and their civil servants. It
brings people up against the problems in rather a painful way. It will, I
believe, put a consensus together.'
Some might say you are a sort of socialist in disguise, that you're just
anti-growth.
Sir Crispin smiled. 'There are those who would call me an eco-terrorist and
those who would accuse me of having sold out to the Establishment becaues I
don't want instant changes that will turn our society upside down.
'When you say socialism, capitalism and all that, let me make myself
perfectly clear. These terms have long ceased to have precise meaning. Every
government sets the ground rules for the operation of the free market. I'm a
believer in the role of the market in judging scarcities and in generating
wealth. All I am really saying is: let the market operate, but change the
ground rules.
'Then you mentioned growth. Growth and development are often confused.
Growth to my mind means the accretion of existing resources whereas
development means using the potentiality to increase wealth in much more
diverse ways. Growth can be a good thing, but it can also be a very bad
thing.'
It sounds like we're going to have to make do with less.
'I prefer to say 'differently'. It's much more a question of changing living
standards. It's also changing aspirations. If all the world was to live as
Americans and Europeans do now, then we really are hellbent on disaster.'
So it's a question of asking what wealth creation is all for?
'Yes it is. What's it for? And then you find a living standard which is
sustainable for every generation.'

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Magritte: master of the surreal - William Packer
considers the life of the playful Belgian artist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the movements of modernism, Surrealism is the most accessible, which
is both its great virtue and essential limitation. With Surrealism, the
image is everything, that is to say the idea proposed in all its
incongruity, the story told to its false end, the joke ever chasing its own
tail. Visual it may be in its expression, but Surrealism remains at heart a
literary form.
It may be the hallucinatory reverie of a Dali, the ambiguous invention of an
Ernst, the abstracted firmament of a Miro: whatever the case, we can always
see, if not what it means exactly, at least a meaning to guess at or
imagine. Given so much to hold the eye and engage the mind, to turn then to
the consideration of such work in more formal terms, in its qualities of
line and surface, paint on canvas, may seem to many if not actually
perverse, at the very least, irrelevant.
With the work of the Belgian painter, Rene Magritte, the archetypal
bourgeois in the bowler hat, faceless, impassive and elusive, we face the
problem as an extreme case.
Where, with Ernst for example, there would always be at least some overt
painterly engagement with surface and material to bring us back to the work
as work, or, with Dali, an insistent self-promotion to persuade us of an
immaculate, entirely bogus technical mastery, with Magritte there are only
the images, left to play their quiet conundrums, jokes and contradictions
upon themselves.
Those images are powerful enough in all conscience - the back of the head
repeated in the mirror; the face as naked female torso; the lamp alight in
the night-time that is midday; the unlaced feet; the painting of a landscape
that is a painting of a landscape that is a painting of a landscape. Both by
direct quotation and example in principle, these things have become long
since the commonplace of advertising and illustration.
Yet, with the artist himself conspicuous by his absence, with no actual
public presence, in the manner of a Dali or a Picasso, to invite further
interest and speculation to the work, the received opinion was ever that as
painting on canvas, these things were as dull as their author, mechanical
statements, touching, if anything, only in their obvious simplicity. Mutatis
mutandis, we think of Lowry in this respect, an isolated and reclusive
figure whose peculiar and long-familiar imagery still comes between the
artist and a true recognition of his actual quality as a painter qua
painter.
This large and splendid exhibition, beautifully selected for the organisers,
the South Bank Centre, by Sarah Whitfield and David Sylvester, confounds all
such comfortable prejudice. It covers the whole career, from around 1920 to
1967, the year of Magritte's death, just short of 69. Many of the more
familiar works are of course included, but the great virtue of the show, as
of Surrealism itself, is its quality of surprise.
As strong and surprising as anything are the earliest works, which give the
lie to any supposition that that the young Magritte was no more than a
natural. They show him, on the contrary, as alive as any of his fellows to
the currency of modernism, in particular to the decorative later phases of
synthetic Cubism.
No less pervasive at that time, but more powerful and lasting upon him, was
the influence of the young metaphysical painters, of the Italians most of
all, Carlo Carra and Giorgio de Chirico especially, but also such northern
equivalents as the German, George Grosz.
After his own fashion, Magritte was to remain in essence a metaphysical
throughout his career. No matter that he would take to himself many of the
devices of high Surrealism, the psychological reversals, contradictions and
bizarre conjunctions - the draped head of his drowned mother, the tubas, the
guns, the suitcases, the galaxies of floating bells, the strong man at the
circus.
No matter, on the other hand, looking to Dada, that he would play all the
formal, proto-conceptual games - the artist painting, quite literally, his
model and just coming to the arm; the nude wrestling with her
lover/violator, yet still but a single figure; the sky drawn forward
physically on to the foreground stage, like cut sheet-metal. Even more
particular to the conceptual are the plays on words as images  - the pipe
declared not to be a pipe; the clock labelled as the wind, the jug as a
bird; the grey blob that is the horizon, a wardrobe, a person bursting into
laughter.
Even so, whichever the particular preoccupation of the moment - and such
themes continue from his maturity to the end - there is constant in the
statement of the image a quiet intensity of realisation, at once febrile and
yet ironical and detached, that marks him for ever as the true metaphysical.
His is the poetry of an visual possibility, of a hermetic, pictorial, other
world - and it depends, as does all poetry, entirely on the quality of its
making. The marks, as the words, must be just right.
Magritte, au fond, is after all as subtle and delicate a painter as Chardin,
the mark effective, particular and to the point, the surface most
beautifully controlled. There are aberrations and diversions, of course, odd
excursions into Renoiresque pastiche and variations upon Matisse, but always
he is back soon to his true self, and to that strange stone surface laid,
immaculate, over all, the lapidary flash of lightning at once epic and
monumental.
Magritte: Hayward Gallery, until August 2, then to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art, New York; the Menil Collection, Houston;and the Art Institute of
Chicago.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: The Ghost Sonata
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is one of Strindberg's last and maddest pieces, the fourth of the five
'chamber plays' he wrote for his own Intimate Theatre between 1907 and 1909.
It is brave of the Sturdy Beggars company to take a shot at it.
As with virtually every Strindberg opus from A Dream Play (1901) onward, it
sets its players a fearful challenge: to sustain all the near-hysterical
intensity of his earlier plays, but without their dramatic springboards in
intimately cruel relationships.
Where the principals in earlier Strindberg are so deeply embattled that we
can't help but respond and blench, the characters in the late plays are like
lonely asteroids. They are scarred, and by each other, but from long past;
now they revolve in their private griefs, and their interactions are only
formal and backward-looking - much as in late Ibsen. Strindberg imagined
them as finding their own paths toward disillusioned, body-hating 'mystical'
wisdom, much as in Schopenhauer.
Except for the innocent (and under-written) young lovers, everybody in The
Ghost Sonata is soon unmasked as ferally driven and monstrous, but their
dramatic exchanges amount to little more than Gilbert and Sullivan-style
revelations: who actually fathered whom, who is guilty of which fraudulent
pretensions.
I doubt The Ghost Sonata can be played at full value now to audiences inured
to 'black comedy'. We ought to be continually jolted as the decorous
disguises are torn away and the tortured grotesques expose themselves.
Instead we snigger knowingly, and don't recognise anything like spiritual
anguish among these venomous cartoon-creatures.
In Jonas Finlay's production, a gratuitous prologue displays the entire
company mopping, mowing and gibbering in slow motion. Creepily effective;
but by revealing that these people are obsessive loonies, it devalues
anything that they may come to feel later.
It pre-empts Strindberg's intended development from a chance encounter,
slightly odd but ordinary, to psychic vampirism and convulsive guilt.
Within the chosen terms, everyone in this lively company has something weird
to contribute. Yet a twitching Charles Addams Family is no substitute for an
agonised Strindberg crew; and besides, the play affords too little room for
their sour antics to be funny in their own right, whilst crying out vainly
for its own note of real desperation.
Joe Orton and The Rocky Horror Show are all too comfortingly near, when we
should not be thinking of them at all.
New End Theatre, London NW3, to 21 June

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: 18th century opera - Record Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andre Campra, Idomenee, William Christie and the Arts Florissants, French
Harmonia Mundi, HMC 901396/7/8, 3 CDs
Andre Campra used for his Idomenee a text by Antoine Danchet on which, 60
years later, Varesco based his libretto for Mozart's Idomeneo.
Campra's opera, as may be imagined, does not have the musical richness or
dramatic sweep of Mozart's masterpiece. Yet, as this recording shows it can
stand on its own feet, a fine example of the tragedie lyrique, the formerly
scorned art-form, now re-examined and restored to grace.
Campra, the Provencal who had a long and successful career in Paris as
composer of church music and operas, was a leading figure of the period
between Lully and Rameau.
There are interesting differences. Mozart's ending, if not exactly happy, is
peaceful. Campra's Idomeneus persuades himself that Neptune will absolve him
of his vow if he gives up the throne, but Nemesis warns that the sea-god is
implacable. Idomeneus loses his reason, slays his son, tries to kill himself
but is prevented. His punishment is to remain alive.
One crucial scene is rather better managed in the earlier opera - the moment
when Idomeneus realises the stranger he must kill is his son Idamante.
Mozart shortened the scene because the Munich singers were poor actors.
Danchet and Campra, in the later (1731) version given here, lengthened
theirs because the Paris singer-actors were so good.
Electra emerges as the most rounded character. She has nothing so
sensational to sing as her Mozartian counterpart, but her slow, sad,
siciliana-like solo 'Aimable esperance', at the point where Mozart placed
his barcarolle chorus, is a beautiful, surprising piece, admirably sung by
Sandrine Piau. Her sympathetic voice makes the efficient Ilione (Ilia) of
Monique Zanetti sound shrill by comparison.
The bass Bernard Deletre and the high tenor Jean-Paul Fouchecourt are well
contrasted as the wretched king and his son.
Jerome Correas takes four roles: his vituperative Jealousy is enjoyable. So
is Mary Saint-Palais in the showy ariette in the last act. Some of the
soloists begin so nervously (they recover) that retakes would have been
justified.
Campra was a thorough professional. All the facets of the style are brightly
polished. He had a pleasing gift for melody and was a dab hand at dance
music, of which there is plenty. Christie and his orchestra and chorus
perform with their usual high definition and rhythmic salt. Idomenee is much
more than an archaeological exercise.
Jean-Phillipe Rameau, Pygmalion and Nelee et Myrthis , William Christie and
the Arts Florissants, HMC 901381,1 CD
Changing to Rameau for Christie and the Arts Florissants' other recordings,
the two 'actes de ballet', Pygmalion and Nelee et Myrthis, reveal a higher
plane of stimulation and invention.
Rameau wrote a number of these one-acters - they are the equivalent more or
less of one 'entree' of a big opera-ballet. Pygmalion has been recorded
before, by Leonhardt, and was in the repertory of Kent Opera.
The music crackles with surprises, from the overture with the tapping of the
sculptor's chisel to the mini-divertissement during which the statue which
Pygmalion loves, and which Amor has helped bring to life, is taught to
dance.
The expert high tenor Howard Crook is the sculptor, Sandrine Piau is Amor,
Donatienne Michel-Dansac the statue.
Nelee et Myrthis, is a brief anecdote about a victorious athlete, Nelee who
puts Myrthis' love for him to the test. It contains expressive short airs,
dialogue admirably set in recitative and, like Pygmalion, it broadens out
towards the ends.
Jerome Correas is the (unusually) low-voiced hero; Agnes Mellon, in good
form, is Myrthis; Francoise Semellaz sings Corinne, who pretends to steal
Nelee.
These carefully fashioned 'actes de ballet' are no more minor works than,
say, Bach's church cantatas, of which they form a kind of profane
counterpart.
Jean-Joseph Cassanea de Mondonville, Titon et l'Aurora, Marc Minkowski and
the Musicians du Louvre, Ertao Musifrance 2292-45715-2, 2 CDs
De Mondonville was a mid-18th century musician of wide activity. He wrote
stage works, motets and chamber music and held the post of intendant to the
Chapel Royal. His 'heroic pastoral' Titon et l'Aurora was produced in 1753
at the Opera in Paris with Marie Fel and the tenor Jelyotte.
Titon is a shepherd in love with the goddess Aurora. There is another couple
anxious to destroy their happiness and briefly and unsuccessfully joining
forces to do so - the wood-nymph Pales and the wind-god Aeolus (classless
society]). The work runs most pleasantly on the lines laid down so securely
by Lully many years before. There is a feeling that baroque is yielding to
rococo.
The performance was recorded live in the Rheims Theatre by Marc Minkowski
and the Musicians du Louvre, stimulating as usual. The Ensemble vocal
Francoise Herr provides the chorus.
Jean-Paul Fouchecourt's Titon is distinguished. As Aurora, Catherine Napoli
is agile and a little thin-toned (all these records leave a suspicion behind
that light French sopranos are reverting to old ways). As Aeolus, Philippe
Huttenlocher adopts a comic voice which does not disguise unsteadiness.
Jennifer Smith's Pales brings a note of genuine comedy and her tone is not
thin.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Baby unit at Holloway - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B. A. YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JENNI Murray presented part of Woman's Hour on Tuesday from the prison
chapel of Holloway Prison. It marked the opening of the mother-and-baby
unit, one of Judge Tumim's proposals, that will provide a kind of normal
life for the young mothers.
Inmates can give birth in prison (in former days women so far into pregnancy
were usually acquitted]) and breast-feed their babies. The rule is, however,
that babies must be given up after nine months. Esther Rantzen, in the
visiting party, proposed that, if this limit is enforced, there should be a
nearby toddlers' unit.
There were some 200 prisoners and prison officers at the opening, and they
had their chance to put questions and make suggestions. There was a feeling
of friendly cooperation both between prisoners and officers. Much emphasis
was given to letter-writing, evidently an important concern to the
prisoners.
The Bill Naughton celebration moved to Radio 4, where on Sunday and Monday
they gave his last play, Derby Day, a two-part job set in working-class
Bolton in 1921. It had exchanges like 'She's having a stand-up bath.' -
'What, on a Wednesday?'. A seven-shilling win on a shilling bet was a
fortune.
World War One songs and recollections abounded, a harvest of nostalgia for
those who cared. But the tales were only of magazine-story quality, even if
we did have a live close-up of Polly giving birth to a son in her front
kitchen. Very nicely done under Jane Morgan's direction.
The Monday evening play, for such as had survived all that Naughton, was
Heretics by Alison Leonard. Its principals all wanted to become priests.
They were gay Gavin, in love with rough Bernard; Keith, married to Maggie,
but in love with Julie (who wants to be a nun); and Maggie herself, of whom
I mainly learned that she could not pray to a feminine God.
Radio 3's prime offer was a 15-minute German piece, Der Findling, a Prix
Futura winner in 1991, which I heard last year and was entranced to hear
again. It is a setting of part of Heiner Muller's poem about a young East
Berliner, adopted by his hard-Left father from a Nazi camp, later shopped by
him for his radical opinions. When the Berlin wall comes down, the new
Germany proves not what he was after, not all that Coca-Cola: we struggled
so hard, now all will be forgotten. The repeated vergessen und vergessen und
vergessen is dreadful.
My German is poor, but I heard my tape two or three times when it was done
last and have heard it three times so far this week - not only for the fine
rhythmic speaking of the verse, but for the wonderfully imaginative
background assembled by the director, Heiner Goebbels.
The play was given as part of a double bill, the other half an adaptation of
Susan Sontag's The Way We Live Now, a symphony of voices discussing the
illness (presumably Aids, though not specified) of a friend. This was
re-translated from Valerie Stiegeler's adaptation in German, and is played
by a star British company under Michael Fox.
On Tuesday, Radio 4 gave us the first of two pieces on the Mission Aviation
Fellowship, which provides free air transport in 36 countries with 300 light
aircraft. This week we heard about about a flight from Kampala to Karamoja
in northern Uganda: first, a hospital in Kotido where they run 'eye safaris'
to heal trachoma and so on, then on to Morota, near the Kenya border, where
a British blacksmith teaches the villagers to use old car-springs in simple
engineering.
Next week we go from Mwanza in Tanzania to Magwanza on the border with
Burundi, where a 100-bed hospital serves an area as big as Wales. I liked
the MAF even better than those talkative flying doctors in the Antipodes.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Rise and Fall of Mahagonny - A production at the Grand
Theatre in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE city of Calvin and the city of Mahagonny: Brecht and Weill would have
enjoyed such an attraction of opposites. Whereas, even in Germany Aufstieg
und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny had a struggle to be heard during its authors'
lifetime, it is now de rigueur in Europe's opera houses.
Weill's smoky, sinewy, schmaltzy tunes seem more catchy than ever,
especially when delivered with such lustful panache by this up-market Geneva
cast. As for Brecht's cheeky moralising about capitalist decadence, nothing
could be less dated: the message hangs coldly over our recession-hit
bankruptcy courts and red-light districts - 'you make your own bed and lie
on it', as Jim Mahoney in Mahagonny is all too fond of repeating before his
cruel downfall.
But what still is at issue is whether Mahagonny ranks as an opera, as
opposed to some sophisticated hybrid of the musical revue. Kurt Josef
Schildknecht's production at the Grand Theatre has rekindled all the old
doubts.
The narrator turned out to be Jeffrey Tate, swivelling round on the
conductor's chair, donning a black trilby in the glare of a spotlight and
declaiming the continuity lines (superbly) to a taped accompaniment of
typewriter clatter. The effect, unfortunately, was to interrupt the dramatic
flow of the stage action - set in a vast grey box, with the cast walking on
and off in silence like cabaret artists doing their sets.
Schildknecht's piecemeal treatment of each scene was no help, with a range
of images apparently designed to titillate or shock the audience rather than
project a coherent vision of the work. Jenny wore a Madonna-type corset, but
left the pouting and gyrating to her companions, who ended up as bunny
girls. The men selected their whores by television and queued for condoms
with their trousers down.
The visual aesthetic (decor by Werner Hutterli, costumes by Renate
Schmitzer) was one of cool, arrogant modernity, not unlike what you see
today in some German cities. Only when the cast dropped all dramatic
pretence and delivered their lines from the footlights, did some form of
communication take place. Elsewhere, there were too many barriers between
stage and audience - above all, the language barrier (despite French
surtitles) and the lack of intimate surroundings.
But the music itself has rarely sounded more captivating. Tate was in his
element, ever sensitive to balance and dynamics, unfurling the tunes with
the artless impulses of a born Weill interpreter, hammering home the
doom-laden chords of the final march.
The stage was dominated by Marie McLaughlin's Jenny, raunchy, magnetic and
full of teasing vocal nuance, a knock-out performance which had the audience
in the palm of her hand. Anne Howells' Begbick was a cool trouser-suited
businesswoman, sumptuous rather than Brechtian in delivery.
Ragnar Ulfung (Fatty) and Harry Peeters (Trinity Moses) were ruthless
side-kicks from the criminal profession. Warren Ellsworth's Jim carried an
air of gaunt, tragic heroism. Apart from the versatile Miss McLaughlin, who
on this evidence deserves a cabaret show of her own, everyone would have
benefited from a more conventionally operatic setting.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Brighton diary - A day at the Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
9.30 am Festival Exhibition Centre. Joint exhibitions of Sussex-based or
Sussex-connected figurative artists. Peter Strausfeld's posters for the
defunct Academy Cinema in Oxford Street - one for 1979 re-release of Les
Enfants du Paradis brings back much nostalgia. I make a point to look out
for further work by 28 year-old Christopher Stevens.
10.15 am Polytechnic Gallery. 'Addressing the Forbidden', a small
documentary exhibition about pornography and one of the most controversial
item in this year's festival, with the possible exception of Mother Teresa
of Calcutta (the Grand Farewell Tour) who gave of her/his all last night at
10.45 as part of the late-night comedy 'Laughing Gas' series.
The porn items include one Mapplethorpe black cock. No Jeff Koons, though.
The exhibition bombards you with statistics at the entrance, and accompanies
each exhibit with polysyllabic ruminations by each artist.
This so successfully prevents any sense of titillation that I wonder whether
I have lost all erotic sense.
But no. As we emerge, there's the Royal Pavilion (aka 'The Madness of George
IV'), and all those marvellous domes gleaming in the sunlight look like so
many breasts and nipples - like a surrealist vision of the sunbathers in
Brighton Beach, in fact.
11 am Brighton Museum. 'Rendezvous a Dieppe3. It is easy to see why 'Dieppe
in art' show has acclaimed; it's the best collection of treatments of one
place in one period that I've seen since the Hayward's 'I Impressionists in
London' 20 years ago. I have never seen so many Sickerts.
11.45 am In a small shop space on the New Road, Red Herring exhibits an
absurdist/surrealist array of tactile objects.
Down in the basement you can peer through a porthole to see an illuminated,
decorated and packed loo.
The best and most disconcerting item is in one corner - a real British Rail
chair (with that repulsive multi-striped upholstery) beside a window and
(behind it) a representation of a view.
12 noon. Brighton beach. 20 minutes swimming. 20 minutes sunbathing. 20
minutes for icecream, coke and hot dog.
1.15 pm Friends Centre. Piano recital by Graham Scott, whose facial
expressions are much discussed.
Scarlatti, Franck, Granados, Debussy and (encore) Mompou. Quite a range,
eloquently and intensely played. There is no doubt that aesthetic response
is improved by having recently swum and sunbathed, though not by sand
between the toes.
2.30 pm Cumbre Flamenca. This group, then unknown, made its British debut in
Brighton, two years before it took London by storm, where it has now
returned for three equally successful seasons. There have been
deteriorations.
Juana Amaya, who used to be exciting in a coarse way, still has the best
head-turns of all, but her Solea solo has now become just blousy.
Her footwork is the dullest in the company, and she no longer offers the
surprising big one-legged steps that used to be her forte.
For three years now, the singer Alfonso 'El Veneno' no longer produces the
prodigies of long phrasing and coloratura that were once so thrilling.
Even the brilliant veteran Cristobal Reyes has grown rather obviously
flamboyant in his Cantinas virtuosity.
But the newcomer, Juan Fernandez, is a marked improvement in the Farruca to
his predecessor (Antonio Canales); he conceives his solo in terms of its
musical architecture.
And in the Alegrias, Mariquilla confirms the welcome impression she made on
joining the company in its last London season - exuberant, stout, joyous and
infectious.
5 pm Quick bookshop-combing, then dinner.
7.30 pm Theatre Royal. Music Theatre London/Vienna, straight from their
success in Vienna (see Jackie Wullschlager's review in last Friday's paper),
in Cinderella, celebrating the Rossini bicentenary. This will reach London
later in the summer - another example of Brighton being the early bird.
Rossini's touching comedy of good versus bad manners adapts naturally to
this updating and free translation. The social-climbing oiks and sneering
green-welly brigade in this far-from-classless society are easy targets for
Nick Broadhurst's staging.
The result - by no means avant-garde - is a properly Rossinian mix of
uproarious fun and piercingly true lyric emotion.
I usually cry in this opera, but have never been so struck by the unnatural
cruelty of Cinders's family. I had somehow expected a more hacked-about
version of Rossini's score, but the only real changes are that the secco
recitatives are replaced by speech, and that (pantomime fashion) the prince
is a soprano (highest voice in the cast) and the two sisters are tenors: one
of whom, Clorinda, reinstates her oft-cut aria (she would, wouldn't she).
Not all the cast can sing well; Alidoro's aria is a trial. The vocal honours
go to Jan Hartley Morris as Cinderella (she was also excellent as Magnolia
in Show Boat at the Palladium last year); she is also very touching.
Comic honors go to William Relton and Simon Butteriss as the two sisters.
They are already the funniest pair since Ashton and Helpmann - and wholly
different, brassy and deeply selfish - and, with a tad less outrageousness
and more subtlety, become the wittiest.
10.30 pm Old Ship Hotel. Holsten Impro. This quintet keeps up the art of
comic improvisation for over two hours (including interval) to a packed
house.
Half the show is enactments of 'Meanwhille. . .' scenes suggested by the
audience. Meanwhile on holiday with Fergie; meanwhile down in the gutter;
meanwhile in the sex shop; meanwhile under the microscope.
As in Consequences, the more innocent the direction, the more ludicrously
suggestive the scene becomes.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Jazz Cafe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE liner-like Jazz Cafe in Camden Town is still without an owner, but is
not yet rudderless. In the final throes of its previous owners' programming,
the club continues to delight with such gems as a Joe Henderson quartet. Not
that there were no disappointments: the beer chilling equipment was bust and
cool bassist Charlie Haden failed to materialise.
Disappointment evaporated, however, with the sight and sound of Al Foster
seated at a strangely tall drum kit and Renee Rosnees at the grand,
alongside the slight frame of the voguish Californian tenorist. Henderson's
most recent recording, Lush Life (The Music of Billy Strayhorn) (Verve
511779-2) which features Wynton Marsalis on trumpet, currently holds the No.
1 slot in the US Billboard jazz chart. A selection of standards, The
Standard Joe (Red Records/Harmonia Mundi, 123248-2), with Al Foster, is out
soon.
Henderson is an insidious stylist whose technique detracts from that of his
post-Coltrane peers. Not so much a series of rumbustious licks, Henderson's
soloing consists of long, mellow and nagging passages, which both he and the
listener can take some time to warm up to. Indeed, for some of us hanging
over the rail on the top deck of an almost tropical Jazz Cafe, it seemed
that Henderson might be drifting away at times. Before the doldrums set in
however, the melody flows again pulling him back into view.
Where Henderson's passages were expansive and subtly persuasive, they were
in sharp contrast to Al Foster's jolly crash-bang-wallop accompaniment.
Foster is an ex-Miles Davis sideman and equally at home with bop,
abstraction or fusion. Alongside Henderson, he bided his time with gentle
fills ready to explode as the leader left the stand.
The quartet makes a splendidly dislocated ensemble, pianist Rosnees' spidery
technique and blue glissando adding another, more subdued, colour. She and
Foster, who did use a great deal of stick, enjoyed some samba interplay,
bumped along ably by Larry Grenadier, who had the unenviable job of
replacing Haden.
But Henderson is the focus of the unintroduced, gentle tunes and if he did
take a while to get dug in, it was worth the wait.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Mistress and Muse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE up, this work, which bills itself as a sophisticated sex comedy, is a
bedlam of competing imperatives: sex, friendship, work. From a distance, it
is a serious modern version of two myths: a little of what you fancy does
you good, and great art comes from great pain. It makes an exciting evening
checked by occasional tedium.
In essence, Mistress and Muse attempts for the studio stage what Something
Wild and Sex, Lies and Videotape did for the big screen: great sex can alter
one's life, but it demands sacrifices.
Situation rather than plot drives the play. James, a cerebral painter of
grey abstracts, has a new lodger. She is a stripper called Goldie; she
seduces him on her first night, rehearsing her latest raunchy routine. Mind
meets body. Her idea of love is sharing strawberries and gyrating to James
Brown; his is sharing Nietzsche and undulating to Dave Brubeck. She sets him
straight and they become lovers. James has the wit to see his own problem
clearly: 'She brings out the worst in me,' he says, 'she's so emotional.'
At first, as James' sexist friend Charles says, it's 'more sex, less art',
but gradually the muse descends, and James starts painting well. But Goldie
exists by creating chaos, breaking up order, and his life soon becomes
intolerable. She respects neither time nor place. She pleases James with
sexual treats, luxuries from the delicatessen rather than basic groceries.
Practical life stops when she behaves like a spoilt child demanding
unconditional love.
Finally she cuts her wrists and daubs one of his paintings with blood; she
recovers in hospital; the painting turns out to be his most valuable work.
Six months on, James weds the sensible, staid Amanda, fulfilling the popular
wisdom that a man marries the woman he can't love, and loves the woman he
can't marry.
The play is often confused, sometimes confusing. But it successfully makes
questions of value and lifestyle into moral matters, like Forster in Howards
End: 'Only connect the prose and the passion.'
The acting is sharp and bold, particularly from Laurie Brett as the feline
Goldie and Nigel Carrington as the old-style sexist Charles ('I noticed her
personality when she bent down to pick up her bags'). The nervousness and
tentative gestures will mellow as the play matures. John Cooper's dialogue
creaks in places by being too formal and ceremonious; and William Tanner's
direction could be wilder.
Pentameters Theatre, Hampstead, until 21 June, (071) 435 3648.

FROM COUNTER REFORMATION TO GLORIOUS REVOLUTION by Hugh Trevor-Roper, Secker
&amp; Warburg, Pounds 25
THIS third collection of Trevor-Roper's essays consists of reprints, all but
one; but they can bear a second reading, even at the cost of some repetition
 -especially about the great Dutch scholar Grotius, the inspiration of whose
life was to unite Protestants and Catholics on the basis of the Anglican
Church he so much admired. The Professor thinks that, if it had not been for
the Thirty Years War, the ecumenical movement might have got going. Some
hopes] It always was chimerical.
The most informative essay is on 'Medicine at the Early Stuart Court'. The
author had intended a full-length biography of the eminent doctor, Sir
Theodore de Mayerne: this is what remains of the project. The most
sympathetic account is that of Clarendon, a convincing one is of Prince
Rupert, a hostile one is of Bishop Wren, uncle of Sir Christopher.
Archbishop Laud is no favourite, for all the work of reparation that he did
for the Church; the Puritans did what they could to undo it, but more
remains than this historian allows.
He likes discussing issues widely - the the width of reading is impressive -
rather than in depth. Options are left open - just as well in the case of
'Anglo-Scottish Union'. This makes for exciting reading, but sober
historians accept that many of these issues are closed.
Personalities make good reading, and they have their place, but it is the
estimation of forces - economic, social, political - that counts in the
longer run. There never really was a likelihood of an absolutist monarchy in
England: the whole balance of forces was against the consensus of the
country - it couldn't hold.
Again, with the Revolution of 1688, Trevor-Roper supposes 'if William's
fleet had been destroyed at sea or his enterprise had foundered in civil war
. . .', then what? But James II's fleet would not fight for him; neither
would his army. His favourite general and his nephew deserted him, along
with his daughters and both parties, Tories as well as Whigs. The whole
consensus was against him - proved by the rapid success of the 'glorious'
Revolution, and with no bloodshed]
I do not care for snap historical generalisations, but will try a provoking
thought. The fact that historical events turn out as they do is a fair
indication that that is how they would go anyway. Great historians are
plodders, researching their subjects in depth for years - compare Hume,
Gibbon, Macaulay, Trevelyan, who are all mentioned here. We may fairly say
that Trevor-Roper is our most stimulating and discursive, historical
essayist.

JERNIGAN by David Gates, Picador Pounds 14.99, 238 pages
THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET by Sandra Cisneros, Bloomsbury Pounds 6.99, 110
pages
1959 by Thulani Davis, Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 297 pages
FLICKER by Theodore Roszak, Bantam Pounds 6.99, 672 pages
THE eponymous hero of David Gates's remarkable first novel, Jernigan, is so
down-and-out it's a wonder he can stay on the page. Peter Jernigan is a
drunken 40-year-old widower who, having recently been deposited in a rehab
clinic, finds himself in the unenviable position of trying to figure out
what went wrong.
The story he tells, set in a faceless New Jersey suburb, opens on the first
anniversary of his wife's death. True to form, he marks the occasion by
starting an impetuous affair with the mother of his teenage son's
girlfriend. Soon, both couples are cohabitating in a ramshackle house,
living the life of suburban survivalists by forgoing central heating and
raising rabbits for dinner.
This ersatz paradise provides Jernigan with scant comfort, however, as
drugs, booze, teen suicide and sexual abuse intrude on his happy home.
Unable to hold on to even the most tenuous thread of his life, he sets off
on a nightmarish binge which ends with him institutionalised.
What makes Gates's novel so good is not only its unblinking view of the
horror and anomie of the American suburb, but also his hero's strangely
seductive voice, which manages to be at once bitter and remorseful, funny
and deluded. Jernigan's 78 rpm mind is stuck in a groove, forever lunging
toward the truth only to skip backwards into a self-absorption that is both
epic and comic. Not surprisingly, the novel's most lingering image is one of
dissolution, as Jernigan remembers watching his wife's footprints evaporate
after she ran from the pool to her drunken death. Some may find Jernigan too
cynical to stomach, for this is a book for those who like their antiheroics
straight.
The House on Mango Street is so short that if you blink you might miss it,
which would be a shame because this carefully wrought account of a young
girl's coming of age in Hispanic Chicago affords many pleasures. Told in a
series of vignettes, many no more than a few hundred words, Sandra
Cisneros's first novel manages to convey the rich, sometimes stifling
atmosphere of an ethnic neighbourhood, showing with admirable precision how
her narrator, Esperanza, finally realises that she must flee Mango Street to
survive, but must also keep it alive in her soul if she is to flourish.
Cisneros is particularly good at eking volumes out of the smallest of
images, such as the way 'dizzy' bees reel drunkenly above a young girl as
she enjoys her first kiss. My only complaint is that the author is too
frugal with her considerable talents, occasionally granting the pleasures of
poetry by denying the consolations of prose.
Thulani Davis's heartfelt 1959 is another ethnic coming-of-age story, this
one set in the first turbulent days of the American Civil Rights movement.
It tells the story of Willie Tarrant, a 12-year-old girl who watches her
sleepily segregated Virginia town wake up in a spasm of sit-ins, law-suits
and violent confrontations as it tries to come to terms with its racial
divide.
Davis has composed an evocative picture of a town's growing pains; the
device of presenting it through the eyes of a girl as she becomes a woman is
particularly apt. Indeed, the best parts of this book deal with Willie's
evolving attitudes toward sex, family and her place in a hateful society.
Davis is less successful in dealing with book's broader topics, content to
let historical worthiness take the place of a more nuanced drama. Still,
1959 provides a welcome view of the public and private tensions at work on
African-Americans as they decided to fight the good fight.
An altogether different kind of coming-of-age takes place in Theodore
Roszak's compulsive page-turner, Flicker. In 1950s LA, young Jonathan Gates
goes searching for glimpses of sex at a local arthouse cinema only to
discover the work of Max Castle, a forgotten master of early schlock horror
movies. Castle becomes Gates' obsession, and his quest for the truth about
Castle's genius causes him to discover a secret history of the movies,
leading him eventually into fateful contact with a menacingly secretive
religious order.
The book's mystical elements work less well than the movie lore, in which
Roszak brilliantly blends fact with fiction - dinner with Orson Wells and
letters from John Huston fuel the plot, leaving us unsure which of the more
obscure personalities, films and movie-making techniques are real and which
made up. Indeed, this aura of verisimilitude eventually has you wondering if
the book's sinister view of moviemaking might not really be true, a feeling
of uncertainty which persists even after you turn the last page.

BURNING ISSY, Melvin Burgess, Andersen Press, Pounds 6.99, 155pp.
THE witch, that hardy perennial of literature for children cackles lustily,
dresses top-to-toe in black, with pointed hat, pointed shoes - and a pointed
chin. Her long, horny finger nail beckons from behind every gnarled oak.
Though timelessly old, she is youthfully mischievous; and when she flies
through the starless skies at midnight, her tatterdemalion skirts stream
back in the wind. And she may or may not on closer inspection prove to be
your own grandmother. . .
In short, the witch of the average children's book has been reduced to a
harmless figure of fun: neutered; superannuated; robbed of her sting.
Which leads us on to a puzzling question: why cannot writers of books for
children, given their degree of fascination with these poor creatures, ever
tell the truth about witches? Melvin Burgess has endeavoured to do just that
in his second novel, Burning Issy, which deals with the persecution of the
tribe in 17th-century England.
One difficulty, of course, is that the subject is frightening, morally
repugnant, and a horrifying indictment of the established church; and this
novel does not try to avoid these problems. In fact, it is brutally honest
in its treatment of the subject, and for that reason alone parents who buy
this book for their children or recommend it to others should be warned of
such incidents as the one in which a parson, in order to extract a
confession from a child that he believes to be a witch, grasps hold of her
wrist and holds it as steadily as he is able over a naked candle flame.
This remarkable historical novel erupts into life from the very first page.
A beggarwoman thrusts a warm bundle into the arms of a man who happens to be
passing through the market square of a small village in the West Riding of
Yorkshire. The unwilling, though kindly, recipient carries the unexpected
gift, wrapped in filthy rags and coughing like a cat, back home to his son
and daughter. It's a pitiful sight indeed beneath the swaddling bands - all
blotched, red skin on its two-year-old face as if it had been burnt in a
fire.
The child, Isabel, is both welcome and not welcome in these parts. The
villagers whisper that it's the devil in hell who owns her, and that's why
they call her Burning Issy. The child herself is terribly afraid of fire,
even going so far as to shun the light of the candle at her own bedside. It
seems that she can never quite efface some terrible, searing memory of
burning.
Solitary by nature, her only playmate is Jennet, daughter of a local witch
who, some day soon, will be obliged to pledge herself to the devil too.
Issy, fascinated by the goings on up Malkin Hill where the witches weave
their spells, sneaks up with her foster-brother to observe the hags shaping
their wax images as they spit and curse into the flames.
The oldest witch senses the presence of strangers and they are caught; but
Issy, possessed of her own brand of magic, pitches the old crone Demdyke
into the fire, and for that act of gross impertinence the witch makes an
image of the foster-brother Ghyll and threatens to kill him, little by
little over the next fortnight or so by melting his effigy over the fire.
The only way out is for Issy to give herself, body and soul, to the witches;
and, in their opinion, that is only right and proper. Has she not already
demonstrated by the use of her own strange powers that she is no ordinary
mortal?
Freedom comes with the return of the woman who gave Issy away. Having
tricked Issy's adopted family into believing she has wrested the image of
Ghyll from the witches, she and Issy travel north to the woman's house.
But the forces of repression in the shape of the brutal witch-finder Bawdwen
are closing in. At the novel's end Issy, Jennet and the other local witches
are captured and forced to recant or suffer the terrible consequences.
This novel helps us to understand not only that many witches were nothing
worse than poor, persecuted beggars, but also that their beliefs were
grounded in a set of religious practices that often antedated Christianity;
vestiges of a paganism that the furiously proselytising Christians of the
day could show no mercy toward.
There was a terrible climate of superstition and fear in which the words
'Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' were intoned from every pulpit.
For all the impressive simplicity of the language of this book, the
complexity of its ideas and the stark, brutal honesty of so many of its
scenes suggests a readership of 10 and above.

SIMON: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF SIR JOHN SIMON by David Dutton Aurum Press,
Pounds 25, 364 pages
WHO, apart from Churchill, was a member of the British cabinet at the
beginning of the first world war in 1914 and at the start of the second in
1939? The answer is Sir John Simon and if you had to think for a moment, do
not fret. David Dutton's book is the first full-scale biography of the man
to have been written; it may also be the last.
Simon was Attorney-General when the first war broke out and Chancellor of
the Exchequer at the outbreak of the second. In between he had been Home
Secretary (twice) and Foreign Secretary. He spent the second world war as
Lord Chancellor. Although he was out of office for the entire period
1916-1931, for much of his political life he was thought of, and certainly
thought of himself, as a potential Prime Minister. Simon was one of the very
few Liberals to survive the effective demise of his own party.
Dutton's book is not so much a labour of love as a serious attempt to gather
together the pieces of Simon's career. He makes no attempt to say that the
man, who in the 1930s and after was execrated as an arch-appeaser, has been
under-rated. Instead he tells the story as it was, and it is not
particularly pleasant.
Simon was an ambitious politician, a lawyer and a Liberal, probably in that
order. The fact that the law came second was illustrated by his turning down
the offer of the Woolsack in 1914 when, at the age of 42, he would have
become the youngest Lord Chancellor in history, the reason being that
elevation to the Lords would have cut off his political ambitions. The
refusal, said Lord Justice Darling at the time, showed him to be the
'maddest lawyer in London'.
Yet the lawyer's mark tended to dog Simon throughout his political career.
Professor Gilbert Murray said that he had the 'most irritating set of
gestures' he had ever seen in a public speaker: they were picked up from the
bar. Simon was aware of the problem. He once advised a young barrister MP
that the House of Commons is the only legislative assembly in the world
where lawyers are unpopular. 'Try and make your speeches on some political
topic and not on a legal one. Get them to regard you as one of themselves
and dispose of the idea that you could make just as effective a speech for
the other side of the argument.' It was sound advice but, as Dutton
comments, Simon never fully took it himself.
In a moment of insight Simon commented on his own abilities and
shortcomings: 'While I have no great admiration for my own judgment, I do
believe in my powers of deductive reasoning.' Lloyd George put it more
sharply. What Simon liked, he said, was that someone else should present him
with a decision and then he could put up a brilliant case for it. It was
Lloyd George again who made the famous remark about Simon having sat on the
fence so long that 'the iron had entered into his soul'.
The trouble was that Simon was extremely bad at developing and then
defending a policy of his own. His name is perhaps best remembered for the
Simon Report on the constitutional future of India in 1930. Although it was
widely acclaimed as a brilliant piece of analysis and became briefly a
best-seller, it was less forthright on what ought to be done. With
hindsight, its chief claim to fame is that one of the members of the
commission was a relatively unknown Labour MP, CR Attlee, who subsequently
became prime minister. Attlee's experience of work on the committee helped
shape his views about Indian independence.
It is wrong to blame Simon for failing to stand up to the Japanese in
Manchuria, when foreign secretary from 1931-35. There were limits to British
power and influence and, as Dutton points out, the thesis that if Japan had
been checked then, there might have been no second world war stretches the
imagination almost to breaking point. Dutton's comment on Manchuria is that
'with an almost hopeless hand, Simon played his cards with some skill'.
Nevertheless, Simon was an appeaser. He disliked the idea of giving a
guarantee to Czechoslovakia so much that he spelled the country's name with
a hyphen as if to suggest it was not a legitimate state worth defending. He
insisted in believing that Hitler was just another German leader who could
be dealt with and accommodated by patient diplomacy. In the climate of the
time, Simon was not alone, but it is not surprising that Michael Foot and
his left wing colleagues picked him off as second only to Chamberlain in the
appeasement stakes in their 1940 pamphlet Guilty Men. The charge has stuck
and Dutton recognises its validity.
Simon had begun his political career as a Liberal. One of his most liberal
acts was to resign from the government in 1915 in protest at the
introduction of conscription. By the end of the war, however, the Liberal
Party which had been so strong in 1910 was beginning to collapse as it was
overtaken by the rise of the Labour Party.
Simon probably saw what was happening more clearly than most of his
contemporaries. He wanted to maintain a liberal identity which he defined as
'an attitude of mind about public affairs which always preserves a just
balance between the heart and the head'. In other words, 'toughness and
tenderness'. Yet as subsequent Liberal leaders have discovered, that is not
sufficient for a third party to make a breakthrough in British politics.
Simon in any case was one of those Liberals who are much more anti-socialist
than anti-Tory. That is why he was invited to join all
Conservative-dominated cabinets from 1931-45. He died at the age of 80 in
1954, a Tory in all but name.
In a remarkable act of censorship Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New
Statesman, once deleted from a profile of Simon the line 'Many of those who
have shivered as he took their arm. . .' Possibly Simon mellowed with age:
it was said he had more friends on his 80th birthday than on his 70th. Yet,
taken all in all, Dutton does little to relieve the impression that Simon
was cold and calculating.
This painstaking book is not nearly as dry as its subject. If it has a
fault, it is that it does not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Simon was
the most brilliant barrister of his generation. For that, we have only the
word of the lawyers.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Books: Poetic reputation ripe for reassessment - Anthony
Curtis re-reads C. Day Lewis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLETE POEMS by C. Day Lewis Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 25, 746 pages
POETIC reputations have fluctuated over the years as unpredictably as shares
on the stock exchange. What would your holding be worth today if you had
bought equity in the 'MacSpaunday' (modern poetry) sector in, say, 1930?
You would have done awfully well with your Audens. In spite of some gloomy
forecasts during the American takeover in 1939, the upward curve has been
steadily maintained and they are worth many times over what you would have
paid for them.
As for your MacNeices, they have been quietly firm for some time and are due
soon for a revaluation which should show a considerable discount on the
underlying assets.
The Spenders have been dullish for decades but, with the original chairman
still in charge, they do continue to find buyers.
It is the Day Lewises that have been the big disappointment in spite of the
cachet of royal warrantry. After performing extremely well in the period
from 1929 to 1933 - the lively experimental period of Transitional Poem,
From Feathers to Iron and The Magnetic Mountain - they seemed to cut back on
resources, and following a series of devastatingly adverse reports by a
leading analyst called Geoffrey Grigson, never to recover the confidence of
the market.
Now with the welcome appearance of C. Day Lewis: The Complete Poems, to
coincide with the 20th anniversary of the poet's death, we have the chance
to read his work as a whole and to consider whether the low rating was
justified. The first thing that strikes one is the sheer quantity of work
here, much more than one had realised.
Historically, Day Lewis emerges as an accurate recorder of national moods.
After the optimism of the 1930s, the poet revelling in the new landscape of
arterial roads, he feels a sense of paralysis at the imminent war.
Then comes the mood of wartime solidarity well conveyed in a poem about
fire-watching with a local farmer. After V-Day there is a blessed sense of
release at war's end, only to be followed by guilt at the mess of the
post-war world combined with further guilt at the mess the poet seems to be
making of his private life.
After the war he pursued several careers at the same time - director of, and
literary adviser to, Chatto &amp; Windus; public performer of poetry with his
second wife, Jill Balcon who contributes an introduction to the volume; and
most lucratively that of a successful writer of detective stories under the
nom de plume Nicholas Blake.
But Day Lewis never relaxed his commitment to his chosen last of writing
poetry. The book does not include his translations from Virgil. They must,
surely, be reckoned a strong plus in any assessment of his poetic
achievement.
What the volume does contain, happily, is the translation he made of Paul
Valery's poem Le Cimetiere Marin, a version he called The Graveyard By the
Sea.
The original captures the French poet's musing beside the tombs of dead
sailors in the cemetry at Sete (Herault); at its deepest level, it is a poem
about re-birth, through which the pounding rhythm of the sea beats
continually.
It is rendered into superbly eloquent English with a minimum of loss of
meaning by Day Lewis. If one had to sum up what Day Lewis stood for as an
artist, what he came to believe in his heart of hearts, it would have to be
a paradoxical credo of being through not being, close to that of Valery.
But if Day Lewis arrived in middle age at a quietist outlook, in his youth
the thrust and tenor of his poetry had been riotously iconoclastic and
aggressive. The Magnetic Mountain was dedicated to Auden and hailed him as a
winged explorer hovering like a bird over the landscape of England:
Look west, Wystan, lone flyer, birdman, my bully boy
. . . Gain altitude, Auden, then let the base beware]
Migrate, chaste my kestrel, you need a change of air]
This advice was, as we now know, taken literally. Auden did migrate, if not
chastely, to New York. The 1930s pylon poets of which Auden had been the
leader broke up as a group and Day Lewis was left isolated and insular. His
response was to revert to more traditional forms, to embrace a neo-Georgian
style in which rural pursuits, friendships, love-affairs, the joys and
trials of parenthood, homage to other poets like Hardy or Edmund Blunden,
formed the staple subject-matter. Some of these poems still make pleasant
reading even though they lack the Audenesque fizz of the early ones.
The most moving tend to derive from some private experience, such as his
sense of the slow decline of his first marriage. The grief that inspired a
poem often remains submerged beneath its surface. The reader who is not in
the know feels excluded. Short footnotes by Jill Balcon help one to get
one's bearings about many of the more public poems, but one day there will
need to be an edition elucidating all the personal references and allusions.
Meanwhile a glance at Sean Day Lewis's frank biography of his father C. Day
Lewis: An English Literary Life (1980) will illuminate some of them.
The impressive long poem in several sections A Visit To Italy was written in
1948-9, but not published until four years later. This was because - as Jill
Balcon points out - 'Rosamond Lehmann with whom CDL had a long liaison until
1949 laid an embargo on its publication, which she lifted in 1953'. That
explains the 'we' who are travelling and experiencing post-war Italy
together in the poem and the elegaic note that sounds through its exaltation
 -their great affair was indeed coming to an end. The section about
Renaissance paintings gains from learning, from the biography, that part of
the time they went to I Tatti to stay with Berenson.
Day Lewis could sustain a long poem, but Noah and the Waters written in 1935
at the end of his dalliance with communism suggests he was wise to eschew
verse drama. His strength lay in formal lyrics, odes and sonnet-sequences,
as in the celebrated 'O Dreams O Destinations' and latterly in shorter,
occasional poems.
The book has a final section called Vers d'Occasion containing work
published for the first time in collected form where, as poet laureate, Day
Lewis wrote to fulfil a request - a poem in support of the I'm Backing
Britain campaign, another heralding National Library Week, and yet another
commemorating the Investiture of Charles as Prince of Wales.
Day Lewis was a good poetic journalist, and at times rather more than that.
Grigson's rusty hatchet should now be buried and the poems allowed to speak
for themselves.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Property: Buyers are tempted with extras galore - Moves to
coax life into the market in the north-west of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WORRALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the whole country waits for the start of the house-buying season -
reports of its birth have been somewhat exaggerated so far - the north-west
of England might take comfort in the latest Halifax house price index. It
shows that the region's prices continue to underperform the national trend,
which has been downwards for some time. Prices in the north-west fell by 2.7
per cent in the first quarter of 1992, compared with a 3.2 per cent national
decline, giving an annual rate of 2.3 per cent compared with 4.4.
There is little rejoicing, though, for minds remain concentrated on further
pump-priming measures. The fact is that while those famous ripples of the
late 1980s were smaller at the top end of the M6 than they were in, say,
East Anglia, over-pricing and consequent market inertia are still the
legacy.
Since the autumn, big developers have been courting first- and second-time
buyers with offers of carpets, curtains and almost any fittings they care to
name. There are creative financing packages with low deposits and deferred
initial payments, direct help and costs on the disposal of buyers' present
homes, and legal costs on both sale and purchase. 'If stamp duty comes back
in August,' said one agent, 'they will no doubt pay that as well.'
Part-exchange arrangements abound, although some developers require a
discount on the buying-in price, sometimes as much as 17 per cent on the
average of three agents' valuations. But redundancy cover on mortgage
payments for up to three years has probably done most to boost morale in an
area of unnerving retrenchments by major employers.
Not surprisingly, in view of the money they are spending on advertising and
incentives, most developers now claim an upturn in interest since the
general election, even if this is not always reflected in apparent on-site
activity. Terms are being agreed, they say, as their agents struggle to sell
potential buyers' existing homes.
But while attempts are made to coax life into the starter market, vendors in
the higher price brackets of prime commuter country can only wait and hope.
There is little reported activity above Pounds 200,000 - and that category
is not particularly responsive to massive price reductions in the present
climate, says Alan Kay, group business executive in the Halifax's Preston
office. 'If we reduce prices drastically on houses in the higher brackets,
we still have no proof that they will sell,' he adds.
Manchester commuting has now moved well into the Ribble Valley and the
Fylde, places from where people can reach the city's traffic jams just as
quickly as from the still desirable but now heavily built-up south
Manchester conurbation.
The city is a 40-minute drive from the Ribble Valley (add perhaps another 40
to park) and, during the boom, its picture postcard villages and the market
town of Clitheroe were awash with southern ripples and local executive
demand. Even now, the average three-bedroom terrace costs Pounds 50,000
while the proportion of houses in the Pounds 200,000-Pounds 400,000 range is
probably the highest in the north-west.
Ian Lloyd, of agent Mortimer, Gorse &amp; Ross, detects renewed confidence since
the election. 'Values had certainly decreased by 10-15 per cent since the
boom,' he says. 'But while there is no evidence of a new increase, prices do
seem to be holding now. Only those desperate to sell are reducing prices.'
That probably goes for developers, too, in an area where planning
restrictions mean that developments come in small numbers of select units.
One scheme, in the village of Chipping, has four units backing onto Chipping
Brook which are offered through the Clitheroe office of Mortimer, Gorse &amp;
Ross. One of the four- and five-bedroom houses has been sold and the rest
are available at around Pounds 235,000.
Barn conversions, which tend to clash less with planning restrictions, often
allow scope for a little originality. That is a great asset in the present
market, according to Duncan Raistrick, new homes' director of agent Reeds
Rains. He is offering Huntsman's Chase at Treales, north-west of Preston on
the Fylde. The scheme, by Lancashire Homes, involves barns and other farm
buildings which now comprise seven units with between two and five bedrooms.
In addition, they do not have the problem of small gardens and vast common
areas often found with multiple conversions. Most of these houses carry the
option of an extra four-acre paddock which has, apart from anything else,
commended them to the equestrian set. Three of the seven units have been
sold while the others are available at prices between Pounds 98,500 and
Pounds 195,000.
Out at Cleveleys on the coast, Manchester-based Roland Bardsley Homes has
built 12 luxury flats in a scheme known as Grosvenor Court. This is hardly
Manchester commuter country but, with some units facing directly onto the
seafront and all with a sight of the water, interest has been strong from
the retirement sector. Four have been sold and the rest are available from
Pounds 99,950.
Bardsley's financial director, Keith Spencer, is another noting some general
improvement in demand. He says that while his company averages 300 sales a
year, 35 have been achieved in the past five weeks.
Cumbria, further north, is a case apart, Much of it is national park where
development is unwelcome (except for low-cost housing, for which the Lake
District National Park Authority reports a 'welcome upturn' in applications
recently). But one interesting scheme, which gets as close to the Lake
District as posible without actually impinging on a national treasure, is
Heathcliffe Court at Arnside. This development of 16 flats faces the
Langdale peaks across the Kent estuary and its grounds run down to the
water's edge.
Formed from the conversion and extension of a large Victorian house, it is
the brainchild of Stephen Bernhard. His formative career stages were spent
with the family firm of Geoffrey Bernhard &amp; Sons Ltd of Rugby,
horticulturalists and landscapers.
That experience, and some years in Europe and America, persuaded him that
the original house - which, like many in that part of the country, was
heavy, grey and sombre - needed special treatment if justice was to be done
to the site. 'I did not want to create a retirement home but a place with
mixed abilities and mixed incomes and a place of security, a place where a
community could live,' he says.
The result is four penthouses with three bedrooms, eight two-bed apartments,
and four single-bed flats aranged in two blocks with an intervening atrium.
Prices range from Pounds 86,000 to Pounds 167,000. There is underground
parking for 12 cars; but for those who prefer not to drive, Arnside is just
three hours by train from London.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Motoring: Britain's debt to those Japanese transplants /
Putting the new Carina range through its paces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THOUGHT might stick in the gullet of some Britons but, in a few years,
nearly a quarter of all cars made in the UK will have Japanese names. They
will, though, be proper British cars - far more British than some makes most
people now think are British, but which are made in Germany or Spain by
US-owned companies.
Nissan's factory at Washington, Co. Durham, exported 90 per cent of the
112,700 Primeras it made last year, earning Pounds 695m in foreign
currencies. This year, its export earnings will rise to more than Pounds
900m. From 1993, when production of the Primera and the
soon-to-be-introduced Micra replacement goes up to 270,000 units a year,
export earnings must top Pounds 1bn.
Toyota's new Carina E - which I sampled in Italy and Switzerland earlier
this month - is being imported from Japan. In December, though, a greenfield
plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, will start building the car for UK and
export (mainly European) buyers at the rate of 100,000 a year. The engines
will come from another new Toyota plant at Shotton, north Wales. By
mid-1993, Honda will be producing a two-litre model (code-named Synchro) at
an annual rate of 100,000 at Swindon, Wiltshire, 75 per cent of them for
export. Already, 25 per cent of all Honda cars sold in Britain are made in
the country and the figure will be nearly 40 per cent by this time next
year.
These Japanese transplants are at least part of the reason why Britain's
motor industry can face the future with some confidence. But why did the
Japanese come to the UK? I believe there are two main reasons: that English
has been a compulsory second language in Japanese schools for a long time,
and because golf is their national passion.
Japanese businessmen can talk to Britons more easily than other Europeans.
And they know there are more golf courses in the UK than all mainland
European countries put together. Luckily for Britain, it has been a winning
combination. If they had been hooked on pelota or bull-fighting, and spoke
Spanish as well as they speak English, the consequences for Britain's car
industry would not have borne thinking about. I had all this in mind when I
tried-out the Carina E range (the E stands for Excellence in Europe).
The Carina E is a front wheel-driven four-door saloon or five-door
hatchback. It comes with a choice of four petrol engines of 1.6 or two
litres, all with twin camshafts, 16 valves and three-way catalytic
converters. Power outputs range from the Pounds 12,145 XLi entry model's 114
horsepower to 155 horsepower in the highest-performing GTi (Pounds 16,980 as
back). A two-litre, 72-horsepower diesel joins the range in September.
The Carina E and Primera are pointed like daggers at the heart of the
Vauxhall Cavalier (Opel Vectra), which is the car to beat in the
modestly-priced European mid-range. Unsurprisingly, they all look very much
alike although the Carina E has a leaner line and, because it is a bit
longer, is roomier inside than either the Primera or Cavalier. Stripped of
their badges, I doubt I would have known if I was driving a Carina E,
Primera or Cavalier. You cannot say that all modern cars in this size and
price class are the same but the differences are in degree, not principle.
It was a demanding drive; 200 miles (322 km) between breakfast and lunch
including the San Bernadino, Julier and Maloja passes and, for a
less-than-grand finale, a narrow road infested with tourist coaches down the
entire length of Lake Como. I started with the 1.6-litre, five-door XLi;
moved on to a two-litre, 114-horsepower GLi automatic; changed to a manual
two-litre, 131-horsepower Executive; and finished up in the GTi.
The cheapest car made the best impression. They nearly always do. The XLi
was very quiet and nicely-balanced. Its 70-series Dunlops had ample
cornering grip but thumped not at all. The engine hummed sweetly and the air
flowed almost silently around curvy body panels and well-fitted doors. It
rode shock-absorbently, swung smoothly through hairpin bends, handled with
precision and parked easily (all Carina Es have power steering).
Toyota claims a top speed of 119 mph (191 kmh) and 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh)
acceleration in 11.2 seconds for the 1.6 LX. More to the point, it is
economical as well as agreeably driveable. Its lean-burn engine works on an
air/fuel mix of about 23:1 compared with a normal engine's 14.7:1.
The official constant 56 mph (90 kmh) figure of 57.6 mpg (4.9 l/100 km) is
close to the two-litre diesel's 64.2 mpg (4.4 l/100 km). The equivalent 1.6
Cavalier manages 56.5 mpg (5.0 l/100 km) and the 1.6 Primera 54.3 mpg (5.2
l/100 km). Of course, in the cut and thrust of daily motoring, with cold
starts and stop-start traffic driving, the gap between petrol and diesel
would be much wider.
The two-pedal, lean-burn GLi went well on mountain roads but I wished I had
saved it for the last leg on the cluttered, slow road to Como. The
Executive, with its lusher interior, reminded me of its up-market relative,
the Camry. And although it was a stimulating drive, the GTi, on its
60-series tyres and firmer suspension, was less to my taste than the others.
Hard, thrusting drivers would, I am sure, rate it the best of the lot. I
liked it least - but I am not really a GTi or hot hatch person any more.
As you expect of Japanese-designed cars, all the Carinas have the lightest
of clutches and gear-shifts and excellent fresh-air ventilation, with
air-conditioning an optional extra on every model. To meet British needs,
there is a standard anti-theft system with ultra-sonic sensors. Both saloons
and hatchbacks have low sills for easy loading and the split rear seats fold
down, estate-car style.
Is the Carina E better than the Primera or Cavalier? On that question, I
pass. Two days after driving the Carinas, I tried the Primera equivalents of
the 1.6 XLi and two-litre GLi (and also a Cavalier, a quite sensationally
good 1.7-litre turbo-diesel with an engine made by Isuzu in Japan) at the
British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association's test day at Donington Park.
As a result, I decided the only sensible way for a buyer to choose between
the Carina E, Primera and Cavalier would be to compare prices (the Toyotas
cost more than the Nissans and Vauxhalls), warranty terms and equipment
levels. Then, all three should be tried to discover which felt best.
If, as a private motorist or fleet manager, you feel you should buy only
British, then the choice must be between Nissan and Vauxhall - until
December. After that, with cars rolling off the line at Burnaston, the
Carina enters the equation. And don't forget that the Swindon-built Honda
Synchro will be moving up to the starting gate.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Golf: Seve builds for glory - The unbuilt Spanish courses
already vying to host the next Ryder Cup but two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1993 Ryder Cup is 16 months away, the 1995 event 24 months after that.
Why, then, are we about to discuss the 1997 Ryder Cup? The answer is that
the race to stage the event in five years' time has just begun.
Things are starting to resemble the haggling that precedes the announcement
of a winter or summer Olympics except that, for 1997, the Ryder Cup
committee has already indicated that it wants the event to be held in Spain
that year. Thus, the question is less which country as which course.
These days, a potential Ryder Cup venue must have so much more than an
excellent course. Huge amounts of land for parking, exhibition centres,
catering, entertaining and spectators' facilities are almost as important as
the course itself.
Conventional wisdom has it that the Ryder Cup must be staged near a large
population source and have good access and egress. The Belfry, the site of
the 1985, 1989 and 1993 matches, meets this requirement perfectly. It is
close to the 2.5m population of greater Birmingham and has five motorways
within 15 minutes' drive of its main entrance.
The exception that proves the rule was Kiawah Island. Last year's event was
played on a brand-new course, at the far end of an 11-mile-long island,
which was 30 miles from Charleston via a two-lane road. Brilliant
organisation, not to mention spending Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 424,000) on
transport, made it a success.
Perhaps, then, we should scrutinise the Spanish clubs which have declared
their candidacy for 1997 so far.
The first to throw its hat into the ring was Valderrama, the exclusive club
much favoured by international businessmen at Sotogrande in southern Spain.
Although its members come from 22 countries, the club is well-nigh the
personal fiefdom of Jimmy Ortiz-Patino, a tireless and gifted organiser and
a man who would like nothing more than to stage the 1997 Ryder Cup.
Valderrama is to him what Xanadu was to Charles Foster Kane, and there is
little doubt he has the money and the will to do whatever is deemed
necessary to get the Ryder Cup and to make it a success.
The Volvo Masters has been held at Valderrama for the past four years. As a
result, the club has acquired considerable expertise at managing events.
Valderrama at Masters'-time is a bit like a swan, imperiously calm on the
surface although paddling hard underneath. Its case was helped by the recent
strike by employees at Club de Campo in Madrid which caused the last-minute
relocation of the Spanish Open and resulted in considerable extra expense
for the promoters.
Yet management expertise counts for little if the course is not of the
highest standard. In this regard, Valderrama could hardly be bettered. Last
year, it was voted the best course in continental Europe.
The next three requirements are space for exhibitions, catering, parking and
the like; good communications for the media; and satisfactory accommodation
and viewing facilities for the 20,000-plus spectators expected to attend
each day.
At Valderrama, space exists to the right of the present fourth fairway where
there would be parking for 12,000 cars. Television cables are laid
underground already. As to accommodation, the two teams would be put up at
the San Roque hotel, less than 10 minutes away by a back road. Within
comfortable driving distance are hotels of appropriate standard offering
17,000 beds.
Valderrama's most serious weakness is that it is not in Madrid. Undoubtedly,
this is an advantage as far as traffic movement is concerned, but a
disadvantage in that the catchment area contains a relatively small
population. Perhaps, though, Bernard Gallacher, the European team captain,
is right when he says that the contemporary Ryder Cup generates its own
support. Large numbers of spectators will attend wherever it is held.
The second challenger for the right to stage the 32nd Ryder Cup is the
Severiano Ballesteros golf club in the Galapagar district of Madrid, 15
minutes from the centre. Ballesteros might have been forced into declaring
his hand earlier than he intended because the course does not exist yet. But
he is confident of receiving planning permission in time for work to start
in the autumn.
'There will be two courses, but we will concentrate on making the A course
first-class in time for the Ryder Cup,' said Ballesteros last month. 'The
spectators will be able to park and they will all be able to see.'
Ballesteros is a key figure in all this. He will be 40 in 1997 and probably
making his final appearance in the Ryder Cup as a player. He might even be
non-playing captain. In either capacity, he is a powerful force to argue
against or ignore. Two years ago, he fought for Club de Campo to stage the
1993 Ryder Cup. He will be no less powerful in supporting his own venue in
1997.
'The Ryder Cup has to be in Madrid,' said Ballesteros. 'Everything is here.
It is the right place. Valderrama is a good-enough golf course, and so is El
Saler near Valencia, but they are in the wrong places.'
The third contender is La Moraleja's new course on the outskirts of Madrid.
It has been built with the Ryder Cup in mind, and an announcement will
probably be made at the time of the World Cup in November. For the moment,
it remains a little-known quantity.
The Ryder Cup committee will make a decision towards the end of next year.
Gallacher has approved of Valderrama. 'It is the right course and it has the
right infrastructure,' he says. 'People want to see the best players in the
world playing on one of the best courses in the world.'
He added, however, that he expected to see more than one bid from Spain and
that he expected the Spanish federation to indicate its support for one
venue above all others.
One thing is clear. If any club is to mount a serious challenge to
Valderrama, then it had better get its skates on. Valderrama, as they say in
golf, is the leader in the clubhouse.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Cricket: Umpires need to put their foot down - The contrast
between this summer's test opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S spirited cricket this summer, notably in their struggle with
England at the Oval last Friday, has highlighted several issues which never
loom large in the modern game: issues of play, not public relations.
While comment on the ancient art of swearing at the enemy continues to
proliferate, little has been said about the far more interesting question
which Inzamam-ul-Haq's dismissal at the Oval brought to light but not, for
some reason, to much discussion.
Inzamam was out leg-before-wicket to Derek Pringle for 15. He left the pitch
with momentous slowness, trailing his bat behind him across the grass in
little stretches. He was not pleased with the decision. Nor were any of his
countrymen. A group of Pakistani spectators near me shrieked and held their
heads, bewailing his departure. 'Again] Again] Given out when he's not out]'
I plucked up courage and asked why he was not out. The answer came with
furious contempt. 'Because he was playing forward.'
Lbw has never been popular. Its unpopularity has gone through phases. In its
early, absolute days it was best expressed by umpire Fuller Pilch's scornful
response to lbw appeals in the late 1850s: 'None o' that. Bowl 'em out. Bowl
'em out.'
As time passed, cricketers became more used to lbw, but the advent of swing
bowling brought new scepticism about an umpire's ability to judge whether
the ball was going to hit the stumps. Modern cricket retains this
scepticism, crystallised in the belief that a batsman playing forward is
pretty well immune to lbw.
In fact, an lbw conviction should be made if the ball pitches 'between
wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket' and 'the point
of impact is in a straight line between wicket and wicket' (law 36). Inzamam
was unlucky because he was well forward, making it hard to judge whether the
ball was stump-bound. But when the ball hit him, in front of the stumps, it
was going low and straight. There is no reason a batsman playing forward
should be an automatic innocent.
In this series, umpires must make their lbw decisions - and all other
decisions - confidently, or at least firmly. Anglo-Pakistani umpiring
relations have not produced much tranquillity in recent years, as anyone who
remembers the Mike Gatting / Shakoor Rana troubles of 1987 will know. Happy
the men in white coats in the next few months, with their harrowing chance
to improve international cricket relations.
Authority is crucial for umpires. There is a new power parasite overhanging
that authority in all cricket nowadays, from international right down to
club level: management, with its match referees, its committees, boards and
executives, its endless meetings, discussions and talks to 'media personnel'
like myself and its public statements about things like the need to keep
quiet.
Umpires' authority is based on the rules of cricket, not the advice of
managers, and would do well to take a strong, simple line on some of the
more outrageous breaches of the rules.
Many of these we see so often we scarcely notice them any more. Leaving the
field with invisible injuries, for instance. English cricket is fraught with
health consciousness and concern; hypochondriacs abound. Pakistani cricket
is bored with fielding. Both are inclined to produce players who leave the
field of play a bit too easily.
It goes without saying that I am unfamiliar with Aamer Sohail's internal
condition and I can only describe what I saw at the Oval, where a short
spell of his slow left-arm bowling induced Allan Lamb to commit suicide with
a hideous attempt at a heave, after which fielding looked like a fall from
grace. Sohail stayed in the pavilion after lunch until Pakistan came out to
bat, when he was well enough to open the innings in a fierce, fast
partnership with Ramiz Raja.
My Pakistani guide to the Oval explained in fluorescent prose: 'We are a
cross between Italians and West Indians. We like drama. Our great love is
batting because that is where the glory lies.' Bowling is important, of
course, and the absence of Wasim Akram, since the Lord's one-day game, and
Waqar Younis, since the start of the series, has badly damaged Pakistani
morale.
Much will depend on how well these two recover and, if they do not, how well
their substitutes can be encouraged to bowl. But the supreme skill is
batting, not bowling. Wasim, like Imran, is idolised back home because he
can bat as well as bowl, successfully.
A good development of the modern game, especially in its one-day form, is
the greater importance attached to fielding and the higher standard
achieved. Pakistan remain aloof from this and prefer the traditional view of
fielding as one of the suburbs of the game. While Pringle could manage only
some ill-footed lumbering round the boundary, Aqib Javed entertained south
London with bad fielding on a truly heroic scale.
When Salim Malik, Pakistan's one great 'touch' fielder, threw down the
wicket to run out Graham Gooch for 25, my Pakistani instructor hastened to
explain that Salim only did it because Gooch was his captain in Essex last
year. 'Every time Salim fields well he is telling Gooch: 'I'm as good as
you.' His real triumphs are as a batsman. He is Pakistan's David Gower, a
natural genius with the bat.'
As with Gower, the game comes so easily to Salim that he is liable to
periodic lapses of concentration. When he played on to Pringle for 26, it
was a symbolic defeat of elegance by persistence.
Alec Stewart is the star of the hard-working school of cricket in favour in
England at the moment. He batted wonderfully well, not least in his nifty
running between the wickets, in humid, scorching heat, his unnecessary
helmet stuck to his head with sweat as he hit Sohail and Mushtaq Ahmed's
gentle deliveries all over the place. His wicket-keeping was all right, but
no more than that.
Pakistan's use of a specialist wicket-keeper is another example of their
traditionalism, and a most welcome one. Moin Khan's work behind the stumps
was extremely good. It cannot have been funny, catching everything behind to
young Tanvir Mehdi's fast medium pace entry into international cricket. The
bowling was often wide, always enterprising and given to trying out the full
possibilities of both off and leg side. Moin stood very deep, like all
modern glovemen, but kept sharply. His appeals grew more belligerent as his
team's chances weakened.
The Test matches will make more subtle demands. Doubtless Pakistan will go
into them with a battle campaign. Their greatest problem will be keeping
carefully to the plan worked out for each situation. The English problem, by
contrast, is lack of initiative in changing situations. The greatest help
for both sides will be knowing that five days give ample time for plotting
and retaliation. In good Test cricket, attack breeds counter-attack.
Collapse inspires come-back. My advice to those engaged in Test (or any
other) matches is to grovel to the umpires and keep the spinners spinning.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Golf: A waste of good Cotton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR HENRY Cotton is revered in golf, as much for his heroic performances on
the course as his considerable achievements off it. Cotton did many things
for the game he loved so much. He won three Opens and was among the very
best in the world for a short time.
He was a good writer, and several of the most popular books about the game
were compilations of his photographs and accompanying text. He waged a
campaign for the acceptance of the bigger, American-sized ball in Britain,
believing that it encouraged better striking. And he was an outstanding
teacher.
Above all, he liberated professionals from their menial station in life. It
was Cotton, a former public schoolboy, who made professional golf a
respectable way to earn a living. He broadened its appeal to such an extent
that he appeared in cabaret at the London Coliseum and consorted with kings
and courtiers.
Walter Hagen said he did not want to be a millionaire, he just wanted to
live like one. For a while, Cotton was a millionaire and lived like one. His
houses were lavish, the ne plus ultra being 74 Eaton Square in London where
he kept a cellar containing only champagne and fine claret and 150 varieties
of liqueur. He had numerous servants and an expensive taste in cars.
From soon after his birth to his death in 1987, Cotton lived for golf. He
talked enthusiastically and articulately about it to anyone who would
listen. These and other attributes combined to make him a giant in his own
field and one of the outstanding sporting figures of the first half of the
20th century. They are some of the reasons why a biography is long overdue.
Maestro, The Life of Henry Cotton, is written by Peter Dobereiner, formerly
the golf correspondent of The Observer. The blurb suggests that the book 'is
the extraordinary biography of one of the great sporting individuals of the
20th century.' It is extraordinary all right. It is said to be a biography,
yet nowhere in its 150 pages are we told the date of birth of Henry Cotton,
nor his birthplace, nor the date of death. For that matter, there is no
reference to his alleged homosexuality, which was mentioned in the press
release accompanying the book. There are moments when Dobereiner reveals
himself to be the maestro of the sweeping superficiality. The opening
chapter lasts for nine pages. By the end of it, Dobereiner has sped breezily
to the point where Cotton leaves school, aged 16. Time and again, one longs
for more detail.
In an afterword, Dobereiner wrings his hands self-consciously at the
inadequacy of his effort. 'I determined to eliminate myself totally . . .'
he writes. He seems to have used that as an excuse for eliminating the need
for research.
The result is a slim book. It contains an informative introduction of six
pages, written elegantly by Laddie Lucas. This is followed by 139 pages
about Cotton, the six-page afterword, appendices and six blank pages at the
end. This is not the extraordinary biography the publishers claim. It is a
monograph, more like, and it does not do its subject justice.
Maestro, The Life of Henry Cotton, by Peter Dobereiner, Hodder &amp; Stoughton,
Pounds 14.99.

FT  30 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Rejoice, bosoms are back at the poolside -
Summer is here, and Lucia van der Post has been browsing amid the latest
lines in fashionable swimwear and garden goods for lazy days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'ENGLISH WOMEN are so refined,' goes Roy Campbell's famous couplet, 'They
have no bosoms and no behind.'
THIS was a view clearly endorsed until a few years ago by the British
swimwear industry, which seemed to regard bosoms more as optional extras or
vulgar inconveniences best ignored, disguised or flattened.
As underwear has become more and more of an influence on mainstream fashion
so the bosom has, at last, been properly reinstated and the latest swimwear
does as much for the modern bosom as any of Esther Williams' ritzy numbers
did for hers.
Often the line between underwear, swimwear and even eveningwear turns out to
be more a matter of semantics than anything tangible.
There are bodies (for the uninitiated the body, a must-have these days in
the fashionable wardrobe, is a clinging Lycra-based number, a cross between
a foundation garment and a blouse) that double as swimsuits, and swimsuits
that can also be bodies.
There are bras that can be worn as bikini tops that are also corsets, and
corsets that are also bustieres which can, and often are, worn under the
chicest of dinner jackets.
A range such as La Perla's, for instance, comes in solid colours with lots
of tassels, beading and jewels drawing attention to the bust.
All it takes is confidence - flaunt it during the day and it becomes
daywear, put it under a sequinned jacket and it becomes a bustiere, dive
into a pool and it is a swimsuit. So there.
Part of the reason for the trend has been the invention and development of
stretchy Lycra-type fabrics which have become the mainstay of the lingerie
and swimwear industries as well as an essential ingredient in the skinny,
figure-hugging dresses so beloved of Azzedine Alaia and his many imitators.
But, besides the stretchy fabrics, the best of this year's designer swimwear
also uses corsetry techniques more than ever before - underwiring, padding
and clever stitching are all reminiscent of the corsetiere's art while the
best, most modish of swimsuits feature proper built-in bras.
Many swimwear makers deliberately give swimwear extra roles to play by
offering ancillary pieces such as leggings, skirts, sarongs, shirts or
cover-ups that can be quickly flung on for walking into a restaurant, for
going shopping and even for a glam evening out.
The trend, beginning with the exclusive, expensive designer names such as
Giorgio di Sant Angelo, Gideon Oberson, Liza Bruce et al, has now become
part of the strategy of the more accessible manufacturers as well.
Even Marks and Spencer this season has a stunning black and white gingham
swimsuit (seen photographed here above right) with a beautiful crafted,
built-in bra for just Pounds 19.99. You could almost plan an entire holiday
wardrobe around it.
Seen here with matching Lycra Capri pants (Pounds 15.99), there are also
shorts, skirts and shirts in the same gingham fabric, as well as the black
PVC mac with the same gingham trim photographed here (Pounds 65.)
At the other end of the design and price scale, Moschino has also used
gingham, appliqued with fruits and flowers. Much of it can be teamed with
other pieces in his collection. If you are tired of gingham you can go for
his nautical look - all navy-blue and white or cream with lots of gilt -
lots of fun.
Slix, one of the leading swimwear companies, has always been good at seeing
swimsuits as the basis of a holiday wardrobe and this year almost all its
swimsuits come with a range of matching or mixing lycra Capri-style pants.
Photographed above left is one of this year's designs - a daisy print
two-piece bikini (Pounds 39) in a navy and white daisy print over which is
shown shorts (Pounds 51) and a shirt (Pounds 75).
Two of the best-known swimwear companies, Slix and La Perla both started
life making underwear. Slix was a corsetry company in the mid-1930's and
only moved into swimwear after the Second World War. For this season's
collection, the fashionable swimsuit draws heavily on subtle corsetry
techniques - the swimsuit rather than the bikini is the style to go for.
The 1950s-style sweetheart necklines, sculpted accentuated bra-shaped tops
(look at Slix's one-piece black velour swimsuit, above centre, Pounds 56),
lots of colours and, in the case of designers such as Moschino and La Perla,
lots of drama and fun as well.
A good range of Slix swimsuits is stocked by Fenwick of Brent Cross and by
House of Fraser stores.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: Self-raising standards for food aficionados
 -All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some
of the best courses for cooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT

<TEXT>
SELECTING worthwhile cookery courses is becoming more tricky as their scope
and numbers increase. Here, I have chosen a baker's dozen which should
appeal to enthusiastic, amateur cooks:
A Taste of Tuscany is a glorious introduction to the area. Hosted by food
writer and historian Anna Del Conte, with Betsy Newell, experienced cookery
tutor, it has been praised by participants for its happy mix of cuisine,
culture, comfort and companionship. It is decidedly top end of the market.
The party stays in four-star luxury at the Villa Areono on an estate
complete with cypress-lined avenue, classical follies, its own winery, olive
oil and wild boar. Wild mushroom hunts, comparative tastings, hands-on
cooking, cookery demonstrations and talks are backed by excursions -
exploring Florence's famous mercato centrale, sightseeing in Siena, and
sampling some of the best eating houses in the region. There are only 18
places on each of the eight-day courses to be held in October. Cost: Pounds
1,450 per person including Heathrow-Pisa return flights and just about
everything else except for the postcards you send home.
Tasting Italy is Chiantishire again. Inevitably, there is some overlap with
A Taste of Tuscany, but this is less luxe, more rustic. The course is based
in a farmhouse where the large, airy bedrooms do not come automatically with
bathrooms en suite. Young Italian chefs working in London take turns as
instructor: Maddalona Bonino (ex 192, now putting fresh zip into
Bertorelli's in Covent Garden), Francesco Zanchetta of Riva, and Claudio
Percorari of Cibo. They may be joined by Lucia Bartolini, advocate of the
Italian slow-cooking movement. Launched in the spring, with much rejoicing
in the cornucopia of young peas, asparagus and artichokes, October sessions
will concentrate on autumn produce. Cooking in the mornings, leisurely
afternoons. Probably one dinner out and an after-dinner visit to a local
sagra or festival, such as Marradi's sagra of the chestnut. The one-week
courses in October are limited to 20 places and cost Pounds 795 per person
including scheduled flights.
Further south, where the sun lingers longer, Nicola Cox escorts groups of up
to 24 to Amalfi for Fine Italian Cuisine in early November and February. The
party stays at the four-star Luna Convento and morning classes are given by
resident chef Eurico Franzese (ex-Cipriani in Venice and The Hassler in Rome
and a TV personality). Basically, it is a demonstration of the dishes that
go to make up that day's lunch. Explore Amalfi, visit Ravello, Positano and
Sorrento in the afternoons. Marinated fresh anchovies and the exquisite
semi-sweet lemons of the area are not to be missed. A six-day course costs
Pounds 729 including flights but excluding drinks, and dinner on one 'free'
evening.
Count Tasca's Cookery Course is a rare opportunity to savour the remarkable
haute cuisine of Sicily on a family estate 55 miles inland of Palermo where
up to 12 participants can stay as house guests in the homes of Count Tasca's
daughters. Maria Lo Monzo, the family chef, has worked in Count Tasca's
kitchen for nearly 40 years. Three hours are spend in Lo Menzo's kitchen
each morning. Afternoons are spent visiting archaeological sites or
exploring the estate to see the production of ingredients - wheat, wines,
olive oil, orchard fruit, vegetables, poultry, sheep meat and cheeses.
Dinner is at the paterfamilias' table. Courses run from Monday evenings to
Saturday mornings in early November and spring and Dollars 2,000 (Pounds
1,129.90) a person covers accommodation, all meals, wines and tuition.
Gourmet breaks organised by Gencon chef-patron Andrew Daguin offer more than
a mouth-watering taste of duck, goose, cassoulet and armagnac. Sunday
evening to Wednesday morning 'specials', available from October to April,
include visits to a marche au gras and the cellars of chateaux Cassaigne and
Monluc, lunch in a ferme auberge, and cookery classes in the hotel's
kitchen. Accommodation and hotel meals cost FFr2,850 and you will need your
own car for the outings. Serious students prepared to knuckle down to long
hours can apply for professional training courses over one or two weeks.
Les Casseroles du Midi. Subject: Mediterranean cuisine du marche. Location:
the rambling and comfortable provencal home of distiller Henri Manguin and
his Italian-born wife Olga (ex chef-proprietor of Les Nattes in Avignon).
Programmes and dates are a la carte and numbers are restricted to between
four and six so events can be tailored to individual tastes. The unusual
format involves daily shopping trips to Avignon market, cooking lunch and
preparing dinner with afternoon outings. Favourite recipes include pesto
soups, bouillabaisse, truffle omelette, artichauts a la barigoule, gras
double, pieds et paquets, civets and daubes. Six-day courses available most
months cost FFr1,000 (Pounds 101.21) per day.
For luxury and exclusiveness, La Petite Cuisine in the Savoie is hard to
beat. The setting is an 18th century chalet farmhouse outside Morzino. It
sleeps eight, so you could join forces with friends to make it a private
house party. Your tutor: Lyn Hall, director of Michel Roux's Waterside Inn
cooking school. The programme: cooking in the mornings and some preparations
for dinner; excursions to a Reblochon dairy, baker, Annecy market, a
mountain farm. Cuisine: Savoyard rustic finesse influenced by neighbouring
Val d'Aosta, Switzerland, and the haute cuisine of Lyon and Nantua - for
example, warm goat's cheese mousse with extra virgin and basil sauce. Dates
and cost: Seven nights in late June or September, Pounds 8.50.
Hotelier Kit Chapman has organised a summer cookery weekend for July 9-12 at
The Castle in Taunton, Somerset. Hotel comfort plus my favourite writer,
Arabella Boxer, as guest speaker on English food of the '20s and '30s;
cook-gardener Geraldene Holt on rare old-fashioned fruits, vegetables and
herbs; a visit to Haten Court Victorian walled garden where produce is grown
for the hotel; and resident chef Phil Vickery demonstrating fish cookery and
barbecue lunch - weather permitting. Pounds 395 a person.
Mary Berry's Aga Workshops offer the essential introduction to the Aga plus
'top up' sessions for Aga addicts: New Aga Owners, Making the Most of the
Aga, More Adventurous Aga Cookery, Summer Parties, Buffets, Traditional or
Gourmet Christmas, etc. One-day courses for a maximum of 18 in Mary's
Buckinghamshire kitchen. A jolly and practical cook's day out. Closed in
August. Cost: Pounds 68.15 including elevenses and lunch.
Master chef Sonia Stevenson, founder of the acclaimed Horn of Plenty near
Tavistock, Devon, ran occasional classes in her restaurant kitchen by
customer demand. The Horn has been sold and Stevenson is now London-based,
lecturing, doing consultancy work and giving short (2 1/2 to four-day)
cookery courses at various UK venues. In other words, this outstanding
itinerant teacher will travel to you providing a suitable kitchen is
available. Stevenson specialises in sauces and fish cookery and takes six
(or occasionally eight) people at a time. Participants tend to include as
many men as women, absolute beginners and pros. I joined a sauce class and
found it time well spent. This is serious stuff - and exhilarating. Not a
minute passes without some gem of information being imparted. She starts by
making you ruin a sauce to explore the nature of the ingredients. The 2 1/2
 day course, including lunch on two days, costs Pounds 195 a person.
I wrote about Carla Tomasi's Turnaround Cooks recently so this is a quick
re-cap. Day classes include vegetarian cooking of all sorts, pasta, breads,
Thai cooking, chocolate workshops. Also five-day intensive courses including
visits to London markets such as Brixton and Spitalfields. Held in the
kitchens over Books for Cooks in London's Notting Hill Gate: Pounds 50
including lunch for a day of fun.
Loaves &amp; Fishes Cookschool &amp; Bookshop is yet another venture by former
restaurateurs Angela Rawson and Nikki Routledge who served good,
unpretentious food in a converted chapel at Rockley for several years and
have written three cookbooks. Their Marlborough, Wiltshire, bookshop opens
on June 1 and the kitchens on June 15. Courses will range from one to four
days, covering many subjects. Fortes of their restaurant - likely to do well
here, I think - include summer puddings, game cookery and traditional
English puddings and pies. On the first Saturday of each month, there will
be a children's cookery club for four- to seven-year-olds. One-day courses
cost Pounds 62 including lunch.
Young Cooks of Britain consists of hugely popular short cookery and activity
holidays for 11/16-year-olds (in practice, mostly 12-14) held in a school
near Chichester. Jam-packed schedules: rounders, swimming, tennis, optional
riding, treasure hunt, quizzes, barbecue, visit to a restaurant's kitchens,
plus plenty of hands-on and demonstration cookery classes. Midnight feasts,
yes. Television, no. Session 1: August 24-28, with Sophie Grigson at the
helm. Session 2: Aug 29-Sept 2, with Janet Laurence. Maximum 20 youngsters
per session. Cost: Pounds 265.

AFTER the uncertain, albeit dignified, approach of English cooks to a course
in Normandy, it came as quite a surprise to witness the passionate
commitment to gastronomy which exists in more prosperous parts of Germany.
From my recent experience I should say that the interest which Germans take
in food can be compared only to the pre-occupation of Austrians with their
own wines: both amount to obsessions.
One of the newest coinages in the German language is the word 'hobbycook.'
This describes a man or a woman who uses up a substantial part of his or her
free time to perfect recipes, preferably under the eye of a talented
professional.
Something of this recent German craze is evident from the competition
launched by Wolfram Siebeck, Die Zeit's gastronomic correspondent, last
month. Siebeck's last contest was held 11 years ago. At that time, few
German men took any interest in what went into the Sunday pot. Now, the talk
is of char cooked in cling-film served with potato puree made with olive
oil; of tuna or shark steaks; or some recipe beloved of Frederick the Great,
such as carp cooked in beer. Siebeck expects a good number of the responses
to come from men.
Men were in the majority on the first course I attended: run by Herr Jehli
in the Romantik Hotel Stollen at Gutach in the Black Forest. The group was
not, however, exclusively masculine and a woman doctor had come on her own
from Garmisch, as had a Parisian long domiciled in Munich.
In Gutach, I had a brief insight into the sort of courses which are
organised by German gastronomic associations such as Feinschmecker or
Marmite eV (the name will make some English people giggle, but it is no more
than the French word for a cooking pot). As a businessman from Frankfurt
told me, the aim was to perfect certain dishes 'up to two Michelin star
standard.'
I had a chance to see how this worked out in Jehli's kitchen. To my
surprise, we stood around armed with spoons while the genial Jehli and his
crew prepared our meal. Only one man, a pharmacist, managed to change the
course of a sauce, and then after repeated pleas to be given some
responsibility in the affair. At its worst, I thought, hobbycookery was
little more than a superior way of exciting a jaded appetite in an advanced
consumer society.
My second cookery course was in the Romantik Hotel Adler Post at Neustadt,
above the popular Black Forest resort of Titisee. Here, courses were
prefaced by a magisterial expose on raw materials delivered by Rudolf Lipp
from the catering school in nearby Villingen.
Some of Lipp's wisdom was stirring stuff: how to choose the right (white)
asparagus; the decline of freshwater crayfish; the need to avoid Danish
farmed salmon.
In the hotel kitchen I was set to work with a pleasant, if laconic,
landscape gardener from Hessen who bred sheep as a hobby (more hobbies]).
Over the two days of cooking together, we prepared some highly-spiced
Barnsley chops with a yoghurt sauce; some entrecotes with chervil sauce and
maize drop-cakes; and a combination of asparagus and just-cooked salmon
under an orange butter sauce. Except on the evening of our arrival, we ate
our own creations.
I had done little more than visit Jehli's course in Gutach. Perhaps because
I was there for the duration, I found the atmosphere more relaxed in
Neustadt. After dinner on Saturday night, Herr and Frau Ketterer invited us
over to their Stammtisch (the regulars' table) where a lively discussion
took place on the difference between a 'fillet' and a 'Lendchen.'
Both courses were in German but, given sufficient numbers, it would be easy
to arrange for someone to translate. All three Ketterers, including the
93-year-old mother, speak impeccable English and there is the added bonus of
a charming Sri Lankan sous-chef. Both hotels are in ravishing locations.
Information about Romantik Hotel courses may be had from Representation
Plus, 375 Upper Richmond Road, London SW14 (tel: 081-392-1589; fax:
081-392-1318). The next Adler Post course is scheduled for the last weekend
in November. Prices start at DM455 (Pounds 154.70) per person: but you will
need to make your own way to the Black Forest.

THE situation must be quite idyllic in season: a Second Empire manor house
built in honey coloured sandstone, surrounded by its own park and lying just
2km from the Channel at Port-en-Bessin. If you point your nose in the other
direction, within five minutes you can be in the centre of Bayeux with its
cathedral and tapestry. Off-season the weather can be as treacherous as that
in Britain: walking down to the coast on the day of our arrival I was all
but blown out to sea by a freak gust of wind.
La Cheneviere is a 15-bedroom country house hotel which opened just four
years ago. Already it has received a number of very positive reviews,
especially for the quality of its kitchen. The rooms are extremely
comfortable and golf courses and stables abound for hearty guests. For the
more sedentary the hotel is well situated for excursions to local beauty
spots.
The cookery weekends at La Cheneviere are organised by Arblaster and Clarke,
a Hampshire company which specialises in wine tours. The four-day trip to
Normandy includes 1 1/2 days spent visiting Calvados producers with plenty
of opportunites to sample local ciders. On the last day of the cookery
course we were also treated to a calvados tasting put on by Yan, La
Cheneviere's maitre d'hotel. This proved one of the most popular
extra-curricular events on the course.
The chef at La Cheneviere is Francois Laurent, a tall, shy man in his late
20s whose self-confidence tends to desert him as soon as he leaves his
kitchen. Within his domain, however, he is an able teacher and communicator,
with a good command of English. Laurent and his team showed admirable
patience when it came to dealing with a posse of cack-handed interlopers
clogging up the usual flow of a fast-moving kitchen.
There were eight people in the group. Apart from one professional couple,
the rest were retired. Lynette Arblaster, who accompanied the group and
acted as interpreter, thought the relative seniority of the participants
quite usual given the length of the trip: younger people tend to find it
difficult to take four days off.
The two cookery sessions took place on Friday afternoon and Saturday
morning. We were split into three groups and each of the three prepared a
course. When an important technique needed to be understood, Laurent halted
the class and brought us all together to demonstrate the principle; when
this was over we returned to our separate corners of the kitchen.
The high points in these demonstrations were: the puff pastry (with Laurent
whacking the butter into shape with his rolling pin); different stocks and
courts bouillons; the uses of pork caul; creme patissiere and sabayons;
filleting fish; how to use unripe or overripe cheese in tarts or ramekins
and, of course, all sorts of creamy, buttery, appley Norman specialities
suitably splashed with calvados.
What struck me as quaint at the time was the readiness of our group to
prepare things which they would have eaten only with the greatest
reluctance. The greatest interest was elicited by the preparation of
puddings, cakes and biscuits, and I can imagine that some of these have
already been served up to friends of the participants in Wales, Hampshire
and Surrey.
Although there was considerable interest in trying the products of our
labours, on the two occasions we ate in the hotel dining room, we were
offered a menu devised and prepared by Laurent. We never learned what
happened to our own chef d'oeuvres. I suspect they must have been consumed
by the staff.
With just two cookery sessions the workload was comparatively light.
Saturday lunch we ate in a ferme auberge a few miles down the road before
visiting the pontoon harbour at Arromanches - and spending the rest of the
afternoon in Bayeux. Bayeux was also our destination on Sunday, where we
were due to lunch at the Lion d'Or, the only local restaurant with a
Michelin star. Before lunch there was the chance to visit the tapestry and
look at scenes of feasting Normans who, like us, were fortifying themselves
prior to setting sail for England.
Information: La Cheneviere, Escures-Commes 14520 Port-en-Bessin-Huppain
(tel: 31.21.47.96). Arblaster and Clarke, 104 Church Road, Steep,
Petersfield, Hampshire (tel: 0730-266883). The next cookery course at La
Cheneviere is scheduled for October 7-11. Price Pounds 409 per person.

IF YOU have always wanted to make your own bread, but have lacked even the
basic skills required, a couple of days in Wales may be just what you need.
At the Ty Mawr Country Hotel, in Brechfa, Dyfed, weekend sessions introduce
course members to the use of yeast in cooking and the use of flavourings to
create savoury and sweet breads including a Welsh favourite, bara brith.
Hotel proprietor Beryl Tudhope runs the courses and numbers are limited. All
the ingredients are natural, with no additives. Local stone ground flour is
used from the 18th century water-powered Melin Maesdulais. Emphasis is on
participation, enjoyment and personal attention. Partners are welcome and,
if watching dough rise is not your scene, there are plenty of other
activities to enjoy in the area.
The cost for the next course from June 12-14 is Pounds 150 per person
including accommodation, meals and ingredients. For non-participating
partners the inclusive cost is Pounds 55. Additional nights may be booked at
Pounds 30 per person including dinner, bed and breakfast. A further course
is planned for November and others will be organised depending on demand.

THE ONLY time a professional chef in Europe is likely to participate in a
cookery course is when he - or she - is famous enough to run one.
From expansive - and expensive - kitchens, Michel Roux discourses on the art
of patisserie at the Waterside Inn, Bray, Berkshire. Not far away, Raymond
Blanc holds forth at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire.
Those with spacious kitchens and rooms have used cookery courses to
stimulate takings in the quieter months and preach their vision of cooking.
At Ballymaloe House in Cork, Ireland, Darina Allen passes on the cooking she
learnt from her mother, Myrtle Allen. At Chateau de Montreuil, in northern
France, top chef Christian Germain runs cookery courses in November,
December, February and March (tel: 21.81.53.04.) Even those top chefs
without their own permanent kitchens have been able to find somewhere to
teach. You could stir fry with Ken Hom in the top hotel kitchens of Hong
Kong; buy fish at the Venice fish market with Marcella Hazan; or eat, drink
and learn with Sacramento wine merchant Darrell Corti in Chianti. The only
two conditions arean interest in food and enough money to afford the cost.
It is this last condition which has precluded most professional cooks from
learning that way. Low wages in the catering trade - at least until you
reach head chef status, when you take on administrative duties as well -
mean that professional chefs have, devised their own method of further
education.
Once chef de partie status - a minimum four years' work experience after a
college course - has been reached, the chef may be introduced into the
stagiere system. The chef will need to be lucky, have an impressive
curriculum vitae, and a concerned and well-connected employer. Knives
packed, the chef will spend an unpaid week, fortnight (or possibly longer)
in one of the Europe's top kitchens.
The stagiere network began in the early 1970s when the kitchens and dishes
of France's leading chefs - Bocuse, Chapel, Verge and Troisgros, among
others - became internationally famous. It started as an informal
arrangement: word of mouth recommendations were good enough and no money was
involved. The chef gained valuable experience and the kitchen got a free
pair of hands.
Such has been the success of this system that demand has far outstripped
supply. Already this year, Shaun Hill, the popular chef at Gidleigh Park in
Devon, has taken six chefs on week-long stages and has received many more
applicants.
He has, in turn, sent members of his own brigade to work with Raymond Blanc,
John Burton-Race at L'Ortolan, in Berkshire, and Andre Jaeger at the
Fischerzunft, in Switzerland, and watched them return full of enthusiasm and
new ideas.
The best chefs today receive hundreds of applications from would-be
stagieres from all over the world. Although the practice of taking on young
chefs via personal recommendation still persists, top restaurants are
beginning to charge handsomely for the privilege of working an unpaid stage.
When I asked Christian Germain if he thought this was against the original
principles of the system, he scoffed. He said the sums in question, rumoured
to vary from Pounds 600 to Pounds 1,000 a person per week, were scant
compensation for the sources of supply, recipes and menu ideas which were so
promptly borrowed but never acknowledged or returned.
The Academy of Culinary Arts based in Brighton, Sussex, planned to run
courses for professionals but failed because of lack of support. This
contrasts markedly with the situation in the US where the increased demand
for professional training has been met by new courses. There are 86
professional programmes and a growing feeling that the culinary world is one
suitable for serious academic study. Boston University now offers a 'master
of liberal arts: culture and cuisine course.'
America has been fortunate in that it has been able to call for funding on
another domestic industry with an interest in training professional cooks.
For the past decade, a number of leading wineries have brought over chefs to
teach and spread the gospel of good food and wine. In 1989, Beringer
vineyards set up a culinary arts centre for professional chefs in the
grounds of its California winery under the renowned Madeleine Kamman.
Each gruelling two-week course takes four chefs from differing standards of
restaurants and puts them through their paces. With more than 300 applicants
for each course, the hardest decision for senior lecturer Tim Hanni is
selecting the chefs (tel: 707-963-7115).

IF I WERE planning a honeymoon, which I'm not, I would be tempted to swan
from one Relais &amp; Chateaux hotel to another until the money ran out. It
would evaporate fairly quickly, but I would live like a hog.
All up, there are 387 R&amp;C hotels and restaurants in 40 countries, including
28 in Britain and Ireland. What they offer is immense attention to detail,
unabashed comfort, and first-class food.
Recently, I stayed in four R&amp;C hotels: one in France, two in Germany and one
in Belgium. I was due to stay in a fifth: Hotel Schloss Durnstein near
Krems, in north-eastern Austria. But I was very late arriving, and a
mega-storm was raging. I could not find Durnstein, but am sure that its R&amp;C
establishment is as impressive as the others.
The first one I stayed in was the Royal Champagne, in the heart of Champagne
country, between Reims and Epernay. The hotel is a former 18th century
staging post. It has 24 rooms with views over the vineyards. Room rates
range from FFr830 (Pounds 83.75) to FFr1,350 , and the cooking is profoundly
accomplished. Stay as long as you can. Petit dejeuner: FFr70. Tel:
26.52.87.11. Fax: 26.52.89.69.
My next stop was Brenner's Park-Hotel in Baden-Baden: very grand (100
rooms), very quiet (it is in a large private park facing Lichtentaler Allee
and the River Oos), yet central.
A booklet published in 1972 to mark the hotel's centenary said that clients
of Brenner's Park 'do not sit at the wheel of their cars when they drive up.
That is not considered in good taste. They arrive in taxis or are driven by
a chauffeur who can chat with colleagues in a special social room provided
for this purpose.'
No wonder I felt grubby arriving in my Rover; but no-one threw me out. The
food is excellent. Room rates for a twin room with bath range from DM410
(Pounds 139.40) to DM1,500, depending on category and season. Breakfast:
DM32. Parking: DM25 per day. The high season runs until November 30; also
December 15-January 6. There is a 20 per cent room surcharge when the
Baden-Baden horseracing is on (autumn meeting: August 28-September 7). Tel:
(07221)-9000. Fax: 38772.
From Baden-Baden I drove to Austria. On the way back I stayed at a third R&amp;C
hotel, the Schlosshotel Kronberg, not far from Frankfurt, set in the middle
of extensive parkland which contains an 18-hole golf course. The schloss was
built at the end of the last century for Empress Friedrich, and is glamorous
and atmospheric. Again, first-class cooking. There are 24 single rooms
(DM260-DM365), 27 doubles (DM380-DM600), and six suites (DM840-DM1,600).
Breakfast: DM25. Tel: (06173)-70101, fax: (06173)-701267.
Finally, I spent a virtuous night at the impeccable Hostellerie Berkenhof at
Keerbergen, 30 minutes north-east of Brussels. The proprietor, Jean-Pierre
Koch, is also the Relais &amp; Chateaux president for Belgium and Luxemburg. As
the press release says: 'In cuisine, he detests routine and has banished
sauce-based recipes from his repertoire, plunges into improvisations and
masters the best produce the region offers. An expert in the art of
receiving guests . . . Jacqueline Koch manages a motivated staff and 10
beautiful rooms.' A double room costs BFr4,500 (Pounds 74.53) to BFr6,000.
Tel: (015)-730101. Fax: (015)-730202.
Michael Thompson-Noel crossed from Dover to Calais with Sealink Stena Line,
which has introduced a two-stage discount and customer loyalty programme on
all routes. Sealink's Compass Points Blue Card scheme offers savings up to
20 per cent. Frequent travellers who use their blue cards to make six return
or 12 single journeys qualify for a gold card, offering 25 per cent
discounts. Points are awarded to all cardholders at the rate of a point per
Pounds 1 spent. Sealink bookings: 0233-647047.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Travel: She Who Must Be Obeyed . . . but isn't - An
encounter with an Old Africa Hand in London helps Nicholas Woodsworth
discover why southern Africa is suffering serious drought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ON THE afternoon I was tearing around to catch a flight to South Africa, I
bumped into J D F Jones, an Old Africa Hand currently disguised as Arts
Editor of the FT. Was I going to the Transvaal, asked the OAH, who was
skulking around the High Veld before an arts page was ever dreamed of.
Indeed I was, I answered, making a rush for the door and a Heathrow train; I
would be driving north from Johannesburg towards the Zimbabwe border.
'You must turn right at Pietersburg, then', he shouted after me. 'Head due
east and you will run into King Solomon's Mines country. With a bit of luck
you may find her.'
'Her?' I shouted back. 'Who is she?'
'She Who Must Be Obeyed, of course', the OAH replied mysteriously.
Like many people, I had spent exciting hours when younger in the exotic,
dangerous, heroic world of Rider Haggard. I even remembered She, mysterious
ruler of a remote African tribe, a beautiful queen awesome in her power and
possessed of strange and terrible gifts. But no amount of luck would help me
find a figment of romantic Victorian imagination. I shook my head, putting
it all down to what must have been a long editorial lunch, and forgot about
it.
A few days later, much to my surprise, I turned right at Pietersburg as
instructed. One reason was to escape the endless plain I was driving on.
Parched, dusty, and burned brown by the sun, like most of southern Africa it
was suffering from the worst drought this century. Off to the east, though,
I could see the green hills of the Letaba district rising in the distance.
Another reason for turning right was a listing I had found in my brochure of
country hotels. Not far from the town of Tzaneen, a few hours through those
hills, was the Coach House, voted South Africa's best country hotel for the
last four years in a row.
Finally, I could not put a question out of my mind. Was there some substance
to the story of She after all?
Certainly the countryside was improbable enough for any sort of outlandish
goings-on, even by the everyday standards Haggard's heroes were accustomed
to - trackless wastes, savage beasts, blackwater fever, assegai-swinging
warriors, bewitchment by tribal sorcerers. Long ago, others beside Haggard
had noted the strangeness and beauty of the countryside near the Letaba
River. Here is John Buchan describing, in the early 1900s, the same road I
was travelling:
'Some 30 miles east of Pietersburg, the Leydsdorp coach climbs laboriously
into a nest of mountains, and on the summit enters an upland plateau, with
shallow valleys and green, forest-clad slopes. The average elevation may be
5,000 ft, and on all sides one can journey to an edge and look down on a
wholly different land. Mists and cool rains abound, every hollow has its
stream, and yet frost is rarely known. It is little explored, for until
quite lately the native tribes were troublesome. It remained therefore, a
paradise with a few devotees, a place secret and strange, with a beauty so
peculiar that the people who tried to describe it were rarely believed.'
A few things have changed in Letaba since then. Up on the plateau timber is
harvested. In the rolling lands at the bottom of the escarpment there are
plantations of tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados and lychees - a rich,
sub-tropical garden not yet planted in Buchan's day. Nor did the passengers
of the Leydsdorp coach have the wonderfully relaxing atmosphere of the
present-day Coach House to settle into. Set in fragrant woods on the edge of
the steep drop down to the lowlands, it is a cool oasis of comfort and
civility.
Apart from the current shortage of rain, the area remains what it has always
been, a place of strange, misty hills and forests not much frequented by
visitors.
A superb rack of lamb and bottle of Cape Shiraz on a terrace overlooking the
escarpment did nothing to quell the question I knew I would finally have to
ask. After dinner, feeling more than slightly sheepish, I asked Sally
Macneill, the Coach House's knowledgeable manageress, for enlightenment.
'But of course She exists]' Macneill responded emphatically, much to my
surprise. 'She is Modjadji the Rain Queen, ruler of the Lobedu tribe,
Transformer of the Clouds, the most powerful rainmaker on the continent. She
lives by the Modjadji palm forest, an hour away. If you don't believe it,
why don't you go and see her for yourself?'
And so I did, but not without some difficulty. One can no more easily stroll
into the Rain Queen's royal kraal than one can drop into Buckingham Palace
for tea and a chat with with Elizabeth II. Feelers were put out, calls made,
delegations sent to the nearby 'homeland' of Lebowa, where Modjadji V rules
the tiny kingdom of the Lobedu people.
The Modjadji, in fact, leads a much more inaccessible life than the Queen of
England. She lives isolated in a royal kraal, or enclosure, and very rarely
appears in public. Much of her power and mystique derives from her
secretiveness. But Lobedu tradition is firm on a number of points. The
Modjadji queens, all powerful rainmakers, originated in the
divinely-inspired, incestuous mating of a princess and her brother.
Recognising that women hold over men a seductive power that could be turned
to the service of the state, they established a line of female rulers free
of husbands and marital duties.
Without men or armies, the Modjadji queens cunningly used their sexual
powers and rain-making ability as tools of conquest to gain the fealty of
powerful tribal leaders. Stories of ritual sacrifice, licentious witchcraft,
and men murdered after fathering royal daughters all added to an aura of
supernatural mystery surrounding the Modjadjis.
Credited with immortality and regarded as the greatest magician in the land,
the Rain Queen received tribute even from the great Shaka, king of the
Zulus. It is little wonder that Rider Haggard took up the story. It is
little wonder that I, bearing my own tribute and accompanied by Stanley, the
royal translator, eventually stood before the wattle walls of the royal
kraal in a state of some trepidation.
I need not have. The Rain Queen may still be attended by a court of 42
'wives' - she is still allowed no husband - but exhibits neither an aura of
supernatural power nor any great sexual flair. Although we were required to
remove our shoes when we made our way across a dried dung floor to a complex
of beehive-shaped thatched huts, the Queen received us in relaxed fashion.
An enormous woman dressed in a red-and-black turban and a cotton print
sporting a tusked elephant, she gave her audience reclining on the cool
floor of the verandah of the royal residence.
But the Rain Queen knows her worth. When I presented her with my gift, a
rather nice copper bracelet - I thought - she looked at it dubiously for a
long moment, then at me for an even longer moment. There is no more fobbing
off the locals with cheap trade goods, the look seemed to say. Finally, she
suggested a more substantial gift, in cash. I hesitated, then reached for my
wallet. This, after all, was She Who Must Be Obeyed. If Shaka Zulu coughed
up tribute, so must I. Besides, I had a rather important question I wanted
answering.
Why, I asked after lengthy preambles and pleasantries about South African
inflation and the high cost of keeping 42 wives, is there no rain? The
country was suffering as it has not done in living memory. Why had she
failed to come up with the goods?
The Queen made no bones about it. Her ancestors are furious. Last year a
Lobedu peasant woman carelessly allowed a fire to run up the hill on which
the royal kraal sits. By great bad luck it destroyed the burial site of the
Rain Queens. Immediate propitiation was required, and the woman was ordered
to sacrifice five black cows and five black sheep. She could not; all-black
animals, much sought after for witchcraft purposes, command a premium price.
The Modjadji ancestors have held back the rains in consequence.
I came away marvelling at the idea that the fate of millions could hang on
so little. I also came away with two seeds from the nearby grove of the
sacred Modjadji palm. Reputed to have highly aphrodisiac qualities, the
juice of the tree is said to have much to do with the Rain Queen's
successful rule. One seed I keep for myself. The other is for a certain Old
Africa Hand, proof that, as advised, I did indeed turn right at Pietersburg.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Travel: Round and round the Algarve - John Hopkins and his
golfing friend Jenkins spend a long weekend in Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU MIGHT not have met my friend Jenkins. Jenkins spent years attending to
mundane matters so that he could throw himself at one of life's greater
challenges: reducing his golf handicap to scratch. He is quite close now,
playing off five at Sunningdale. He reminds me of the man who, when asked
how much golf he was playing, replied: 'Only days.'
When I invited him for a long weekend's golf on Portugal's Algarve coast,
there was a nanosecond of indecision. He was competing in the Sunningdale
foursomes. He is always playing in something. 'I'd love to,' he said. 'When
can we go?'
We were to stay at the Quinta do Lago hotel and play golf on Quinta's A, B,
C and D courses and at Vila Sol. Was it a feasible venue for a long
weekend's golf or not?
First day. The sun on our backs felt good as we piled the car high with
clubs and drove slowly out of Faro airport. Jenkins rubbed his hands in
anticipation of the golf we were going to play. 'The turf will be like
velvet, the greens so fast and true I will not have to cock my wrists and do
a full pivot,' he said. And then he gave a little whimper of excitement.
When we checked in at the hotel, a receptionist smiled and wished me a happy
birthday. Waiting for me in my room was a birthday cake. I rang to book a
massage and as we concluded the conversation the masseuse said, with a
tinkling laugh: 'Happy birthday, Mr Hopkins.' I wondered whether there was
anyone in Portugal who did not know it was my birthday.
My room overlooked a wildlife sanctuary and a sandy beach beyond. I rang
Jenkins and suggested an exploratory walk. He was shocked. 'I thought we
would play nine holes before supper.' The hotel receptionists found a
tee-time for us and within half-an-hour we were battling against a strong,
biting wind.
Second day. Vila Sol, a few miles up the road, had staged the Portuguese
Open the week before our visit and we were able to play the course from the
same tees. The driving range was one of the best I have seen in Europe with
regular yardage markers, firm turf from which to hit and good balls, far
superior to the pawky range and mangy balls at Quinta.
Though it only covers 100 of the available 300 acres, the Vila Sol course is
tight and it will be much tighter when the 240 villa homes and 310
apartments are sold. It will then be reminiscent of some of the golf
development in Spain, and I can't say worse than that. Too tight, I thought
to myself on the second hole as I retrieved my ball from plot D6-3 on the
right of the fairway.
Third day. At 6.30am it is dark and cold, even on the Algarve in late March.
Domingos da Silva, the managing director of Quinta, was wearing only shorts.
He knew it would warm up. Soon the temperature was a comfortable 65' or so.
Da Silva was accompanied by Stuart Woodman, director of golf at Trafalgar
House's Vilar do Golf resort on Quinta.
Da Silva, an ebullient Portuguese, took up golf only recently. He had a
hockey player's short backswing and something approaching John Daly's power.
He talked and walked fast and swung even faster, as though he resented
having to be silent for the few seconds it took him to hit the ball.
Sometimes he talked throughout his swing.
'The first time I played with Domingos he hit a three-iron further than I've
ever seen,' said Woodman, a former touring pro. 'But he lacks a little in
finesse. On another occasion he hit a huge drive to within 30 yards of the
green, and when I came upon him he was about to play his second shot with
his driver as well. 'You can't use your driver, Domingos' I said. 'Why not?'
he replied. 'It worked so well for the last shot I thought I'd use it
again'.'
After our round we sat in the sun and sipped our beer, dreamily looking at
some of the trees that make up the biggest collection of umbrella pines in
the world. The faces around us were bronzed and smiling. The language was
predominantly English.
Fourth and fifth days. Another early start. It was barely light when we hit
our first drives on the two other nines at Quinta that we had not yet
played. After 99 holes in four days, my hands were blistered and my golf
seemed to be getting worse. But Jenkins was in his element. 'I must say that
if I had to play this course for the rest of my life I would not mind,' he
said.
At a time when so many new golf courses are just too hard for average
golfers, it was refreshing to be able to cope with Quinta's four nine-hole
lay-outs. Not every par 4 required a long iron or even a wood for a second
shot.
There was time on the flight home to assess the merits of Quinta do Lago as
a venue for a weekend's golf. It has much to commend it over many places
nearer Britain, not least the proximity of the hotel to the airport (20
minutes). Overall, my journey was less than six hours door-to-door (I live
in north London). Furthermore, the flights work conveniently: it is possible
to play golf on arriving at the hotel, and before departing. All this - plus
guaranteed sunshine.
John Hopkins flew c/o British Airways and was a guest of the Quinta do Lago
hotel. Five and eight-day holidays inclusive of accommodation, breakfast and
evening meals, guaranteed tee times and green fees (18 holes each day) at
Quinta do Lago, Vila Sol or Vale do Lobo golf courses are available from
approximately Pounds 335 and Pounds 605 respectively per person. Also
included are transfers to Quinta do Lago golf course and one hour of tennis.

FT  30 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: A very French view of the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW weeks ago, I wrote unsystematically of the vices and virtues of some
European papers and made the mistake, judging by the reaction, of not
mentioning Le Monde. It has a charisma that no other continental paper can
rival. I remember how, as a student, I would pretentiously be seen with it
and later how, from Saigon to Montreal, from Abidjan to Algiers, it was (and
probably still is) plucked from the news-stands the moment it arrived.
This is not due to the faintly dishonest dating system: Le Monde is
published in the afternoon but carries the following day's date, so giving
it the air of being what it would not deign to be - the first with the news.
It appears in time for the Paris evening rush hour and offers a lot at a
time when the average reader has time to take it in.
Le Monde does not seem to compete, even though much of the ground it
occupies has been under attack, sometimes successfully, by Liberation That
ground is the educated centre-left; Le Monde is its ultimate quality daily.
As a result, it is often boring and occasionally written slackly. I read
some paragraphs, scratch my head and ask French colleagues what it all
means. They say: 'Well, you know, it is about, how does one put it? The idea
is that one might question certain assumptions, if you see what I mean.'
Shoulders are shrugged, hands raised.
The paper is run as a kind of co-operative which, presumably, accounts for
what Anglo-Saxon readers might regard as its apparent self-indulgence.
Writers enjoy themselves on subjects they like. Page two often is given over
to accounts of incidents of varying importance which happened on that day
100 or 75 years ago. Those incidents can be minor or world-shaking; it
hardly matters.
All this pleases the French. Journalists are expected to provoke, not just
by being controversial but through jeux d'esprits and being what the English
would call too clever by half. The great pillar of this approach is twice as
clever as that: Paul Fabra, the paper's chief economic commentator, a man
who makes Sir Alan Walters seem non-committal. He also writes tomes about
the triumph of Ricardian economics.
The didactic approach can be seen even in 'soft' stories. Le Monde's choice
might be the same as that of The Times but the approach is different. The
other day, a correspondent filed the following item:
'The issue, by the Bank of Mauritius, of a 20-rupee banknote carrying the
effigy of the wife of the prime minister, Mr Aneerood Jungnauth, has
provoked a lively argument. On the day of the issue, the government was
celebrating the birthday of Mrs Jungnauth in the presence of the diplomatic
corps. According to the Mauritian press and the opposition, led by Mr Navin
Ramgoolam (son of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the 'father of independence'), the
coincidence of the two events has sown trouble in the heart of the
diplomatic corps and brought discredit on the country . . . the argument has
weakened the government coalition, ministers belonging to the Mauritian
Militant Movement having not concealed their irritation with the
'clumsiness' of Mr Jungnauth of the Mauritian Socialist Movement. The
latter, observers say, listened to the sirens among his 'courtiers' and
gradually lost contact with the real country.'
Le Monde overlooked the ludicrous aspects of this story and used it to
instruct readers in the wider background of contemporary Mauritian politics.
The island is French-speaking (although a former British colony) and,
therefore, the kind of place to keep before the mind of France. The only
trouble is that the reader is left with little idea of what the fuss was
about, or why the story appeared at all.
Le Monde has its detractors, who complain it is not what it was. Certainly,
circulation has fallen from its peak; the paper's correspondents no longer
appear in the ambassadorial role they once adopted. This could be because of
an incident that friend and foe recall from April 1975. In one of the few
despatches to emerge from Phnom Penh the day the Khmers Rouges seized power
in Cambodia, the Monde correspondent wrote of the 'glorious liberation' of
the capital by the guerrillas and celebrated the victory in terms that, even
at that time, seemed excessive.
The trouble with the newspaper business is that skeletons rattle around
outside the cupboards for years and years. This is hard luck on Le Monde,
because it is one of the great institutions of France and one of the world's
great newspapers. In recent years, it has gained a new reputation for
bravery in exposing sin and stupidity. The paper revealed the corruption at
the heart of the socialist establishment; it sorts out the Catholic church
in no uncertain terms; it has no fear of Jean-Marie Le Pen's new barbarians;
and has the finest political cartoonist in the world.
It is still the paper that the would-be intellectual would choose to carry,
and the one that could most easily turn him, or her, into one.
James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A very attractive genus of Asiatic primroses, mainly from Japan, and
flowering in late spring and early summer. The leaves are softly hairy, the
flower stems about six inches high but variable and the primrose-like
flowers are carried in loose clusters. They are variable in colour from
white to lavender and pink to quite deep shades of red. Numerous varieties
have been given garden names but this has never been a really common or
popular plant. It is hardy and thrives in peaty soils that are porous but do
not dry out readily. A little shade will do it no harm.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Gardening: Sweet dream on a philosopher's lawn - Robin Lane
Fox asks if the riot of blooms in his garden is just a glorious illusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL YEARS ago, I spent a long, hot summer examining the cream of
Oxford's young intelligences with the help of two extremely respected
philosophers. We sweated and agonised; we tried to turn Bs into As;
meanwhile, outside the pseudo-Gothic windows, sunlight fell in patterns on
those hallmarks of academic gardening, an immaculate sward of lawn and beds
of modern roses with vermilion flowers.
When at last we finished, I asked the philosophers the plain man's question:
of all the dozens of questions which you have set, which was the hardest to
answer? After six weeks' hard labour, they agreed with hardly a pause. The
question: how can we be sure we are not dreaming?
How not, O Socrates? I gave the plain man's response: that our non-dream
world is more orderly and most of its events are effects of more or less
obvious causes, even when people kick over the traces, fall in love, or lend
far too much money to Olympia &amp; York. No, they corrected me, we might be
dreaming orderly dreams, not just those dreams of tea with the royal family,
which are supposed to be an English favourite, but dreams here and now of
reading the FT.
I have been haunted by this awful question. It surfaces in becalmed
committee meetings, or during breakdowns on the London Underground, or when
Britain's city councils start competing for the best in bloom. This week, it
has returned with unanswerable force: am I living in accelerated time while
a film of summer is being run too fast before my eyes? Gardens have been
dreamy but the sequence has gone mad. Is it May, June, or time for
Wimbledon, and why is everything happening here at once?
There has never been a year like this, not in my horticultural memory, which
goes back to 1956. Ten days ago, there were tulips and the buttercups were
mildly premature; wallflowers were drawing to an early close; and narcissi
were reassuring non-gardeners that they could grow something pretty to round
off spring.
In a rush, in a bound, summer has been rampant. Showers of roses have
started to open before the lilacs have begun to fade; the dianthus of late
June are showing colour. On May 20 I woke up, or re-entered dreamland, and
found pale yellow day lilies in flower; sweet philadelphus became impatient
and on the bank holiday joined them.
Not until the last fortnight in June do I usually turn to the best of all
pink roses, the old-fashioned Fantin Latour. Already, it is open, with
spring's Blue-eyed Mary still out beneath it.
Day by day, the sequence has become crazier, cramming six weeks into one
with ominous warnings of a future climate change. Green observers have
warned that we will know when the world starts to warm and we have punctured
the atmosphere because the bluebell woods in Britain will be the first
casualties, hating the new warmth. They have not gone, this year, but they
have gone into fast-forward, flowering two weeks earlier than usual.
After the first primeval sleep, so the poet Keats tells us, Adam awoke and
found truth. On bank holiday, Lane Fox was dreaming and awoke to find it
mid-summer. Portland roses seemed to be tumbling beside delphiniums; the
lavender buds are showing a purple colour beside the greengage iris
graminea, which is fighting for its usual place in the button-hole during
the final week of May.
Is it, perhaps, a personalised dream, and has something simply gone wrong
with me? Here, great philosophers are helpful: private worlds, they tell us,
cannot be communicated in language. Worried that I might be trapped in a
private net, I have been cross-communicating and verifying sensations. Are
you, too, seeing rivers of laburnum among rose Mme Alfred Carriere, and
scenting orange blossom as the flowers fade on Solomon's Seal? If it is all
a dream, it seems to be a public epidemic in which dandelions have remained
a nightmare and there is always the harsh reality of mowing the grass twice
weekly. Perhaps it looked this way in Paradise, but the garden owner then
stopped the film. He froze it, perhaps, in just such a rush when the first
fresh greens of the year were present.
Does this sudden hint of Paradise matter in 1992? Sleep-walking, I am
telling myself that I must absorb it at every moment, economise on work, see
it all before the season has disappeared in seven days. It is so
extraordinary that perhaps it can be forgiven; meanwhile, I am sowing a
fresh round of annuals for late summer, tall white tobacco plants and the
new white cosmos daisy called Sonata.
Sweet dreams are fine but, when we come down to earth in mid-June, there
will have to be some young plants coming on to carry us into October.
Unless, that is, the Heavenly Director changes the score once more and sends
a frost on Derby day to remind us we are British. There would be nothing
better to wake us from this philosophic dreaminess than a short, sharp
shock.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Gardening: Instant trees - by the tonne / A forest on the
move . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the talking points at the Chelsea flower show was the 25 ft-high oak
growing in a container holding a metric tonne of soil, thought to be the
biggest tree ever moved into the exhibition marquee. Shown by Hillier
Nurseries of Ampfield, Romsey, Hants, it was, however, typical of a side of
the nursery trade which is little-known outside professional circles.
Hillier Broadmead Trees, the branch of the company responsible, produces
trees up to 30 ft ready for immediate planting. These giant, container-grown
trees are a development from the heavy standard trees which long have been
available for autumn and winter planting direct from the open ground.
Many buyers - chiefly municipal authorities, which use them for street
planting, and large landscape firms - increasingly are turning to container
trees. They cost more than trees lifted from the open ground, but have a
greater chance of success. Hillier Broadmead is growing around 15,000 and
demand is rising.
Many varieties are available, although the larger sizes seem to be
restricted to beech and oak. Trees in containers with 200 litres of soil - a
very respectable size, although containers can go up to 1,000 litres -
include several varieties of maple; horse chestnut; two kinds of alder;
ailanthus; two kinds of birch; fastigiate hornbeam (which is very good as a
street tree because its head is so compact); the Paul Scarlet variety of
hawthorn; purple-leaved and Dawyck beech; several varieties of ash, rowan
and lime; walnut; Spanish plane; several species of prunus; false acacia;
sophora, and golden weeping willow.
Another specialised company in this trade is Pantiles Nurseries Ltd, which
is both a plant and garden centre and has its own landscaping side able to
handle the largest container trees.
It grows fewer trees than Hilliers although the variety is greater and
includes some rare examples, including many good conifers. The explanation
is that almost all the trees are bought in Europe, mainly from Tuscany where
the soil and climate are ideal for cultivating them and there is a tradition
of producing many scarce types.
At Pantiles, you will see such things as big specimens of the weeping cedar,
a rare tree in English nurseries, and also Blue Atlas cedars up to 30 ft.
The biggest containers are even larger than those at Hilliers; I have seen
one with 1.5 tonnes of soil holding an evergreen Magnolia grandiflora,
rather a speciality with Italian growers.
What do you pay for such trees? Anything from Pounds 75 to more than Pounds
2,000 for some of the rarities. To this, though, must be added a charge for
delivery, planting and (almost certainly) anchorage in the soil with steel
guy ropes.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Poachers on the wild ocean: Michael Wigan tells a tale of
skulduggery and shrinking salmon stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Sir David Nickson, chairman of the Atlantic Salmon Trust, the
only epitaph for the Atlantic salmon is: 'Lost at sea.'
NOTHING produces more dark murmurs and knowing winks in fishing circles than
the suggestion that skulduggery is rife on the high seas - that salmon have
become a substitute for European Community fishing boats hemmed in by tie-up
restrictions and quotas of dwindling fish stocks.
The stories are intriguing, heightened in drama by their association with
truly wild places - faraway St Kilda, where islanders with prehensile feet
used to live on gannets, or the Outer Hebrides, regarded by many inhabitants
as hardly part of the UK at all.
One theory is that Irish boats, which tirelessly patrol the British/Irish
territorial line, take on board salmon caught illegally at sea off Scotland
and land them as part of their legitimate drift-net catch on their return
home.
Certainly, north-western Irish salmon catches have been large -
'astronomical' in the words of Group Captain John Proudlock, secretary of
the Association of Scottish Salmon District Fishery Boards, which is
responsible for conserving salmon in its home waters.
The Irish have persisted with drift-netting even after most other nations
banned it as a danger to fishery resources, and large catches inside the
Irish 12-mile fishing limit seem surprising in view of recent depleted
catches in Irish rivers.
Then again, a 12-mile limit can be an elastic dimension in Irish minds, and
Irish boats regularly stray 50 miles or more from the west coast and beyond.
Who is to say whether the salmon in the hold were caught outside the 12-mile
limit (breaking both EC and Irish law), or within it?
Are they indeed fish from off the Emerald Isle at all? One known fact is
that the western Irish seaboard is the migratory route for salmon returning
from the sea to rivers in western England, such as the Wye. This, however,
has not visibly exercised the consciences of some Irish skippers. There are
places still where a fish is a fish.
There are also places where a 'territorial boundary' is a flexible
conception. Irish/British waters, as well as lands, are vexed by sovereignty
disputes. The first official claim to St Kilda was lodged by the British
government to isolate the fall-out area for American rockets. No one wanted
Russians picking up the bits in the east Atlantic. The 200-mile sovereignty
limit around St Kilda enormously increases British territorial waters, which
irks the Irish. The suitably nebulous Irish claim is not that they own St
Kilda, but that Britain does not.
The result of this quandary is the presence of a grey area between the
Irish/British sea boundaries, where the Irish fisheries protection service
is supposed to monitor Irish boats, and the British theirs. They co-operate
only to chase out anyone else.
Can the fishery protection service actually protect salmon, even though its
main duties cover other fish stocks in the sea?
The firepower certainly looks good. In Scottish waters, where the majority
of British salmon are found, the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency
(SFPA), revamped in April 1991, can deploy four fishery cruisers, one Royal
Navy offshore cruiser, two fixed-wing aircraft, a helicopter (hired) for
peak season, and a maximum of three launches.
The problem is that its remit covers 185,000 square miles of seawater. Two
fishing boats transferring a catch in this area would be, can we say, a drop
in the ocean. To the cynical, the fact that co-operation between Irish
fishing boats and the Irish protection service extends to the latter telling
the former about patrols in advance is disquieting.
The SFPA also battles against procedural problems. Finding fishermen who are
committing offences is only the first step in getting a conviction. In 1991
in Scotland, only three cases of salmon poaching at sea were successfully
prosecuted (fines ranged between Pounds 500 and Pounds 5,000). Yet, 110
individual nets measuring more than 6,000 yards were seized in addition to
20 miles of gill-nets.
Why so many nets and so few offenders? The answer is that fishermen spying a
fishery protection vessel on the horizon, or a spotter-plane, cut loose
their nets. Many of those found by the agency have been abandoned, which is
profoundly unecological. No one would abandon valuable nets if they were
fishing legally.
In Scotland, poaching cases are presented to the procurator fiscal, who
decides whether to proceed. The SFPA is reticent about how many cases the
fiscal turned away in 1991, but admits that the majority never reach court
for, having submitted the case, the agency may have trouble backing it up.
Tracing ownership of an abandoned net is time-consuming. Tracing the origins
of a fishing boat can be, too; even the ownership of the boat. Fishing crews
under questioning have even disagreed about who is the captain. The agency
has six months in which to establish the facts.
These types of problems surfaced in a notorious re-flagging case in which
Denmark, a fellow signatory to the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation
Organisation, was discovered netting salmon under bogus Panamanian and
Polish colours. Investigations revealed that although the boats were really
Danish, the company head office was in Austria. The catch was being landed
in Poland and was re-entering western Europe on the black market. To add to
the headaches of the SFPA, in Scotland poaching offences have to be
corroborated by a witness to the act. Successful cases must be foolproof.
There are many ways in which wild salmon can end up on fishmongers' slabs.
Boxes of Scottish farmed salmon are regularly transported by lorry to the
main fish markets in London and Aberdeen. Among them are boxes of slightly
different-looking fish, salmon still, but with sharper fins and a more
elegantly-cleft, longer tail.
These are boxes of wild salmon. They are not from Scottish legal netters -
those using what are called 'fixed engines' to catch inshore or in-river
fish; they are poached at sea.
Time was when the price differential between farmed and wild fish meant no
one would want to sell wild fish over farmed. Not so in today's
viciously-squeezed market. With a commodity in over-supply, the price gap
may be no more than 10p a pound.
Ex-policeman Walter Beattie is the fishmongers' inspector for Scotland, a
man whose ancestors have been salmon netters for three generations and who
has spent his working life in the salmon business. He points out that wild
fish can easily be hidden in a container-load of farmed salmon; after all,
the volume of traffic in the farmed fish is huge. To persuade the police to
get a warrant to stop a lorry, empty all the boxes of salmon, and go through
them for wild variety presents insurmountable difficulties.
On the wider front, Beattie thinks that confiscation of fishing gear acts as
a deterrent to trawlermen with expensive boats, especially when salmon
prices are low. However, the small-time operator who gets a kick out of
poaching is, in his view, ineradicable. This man uses a little creel-boat at
night, fishes close-in and is ever-watchful, ever-daring.
Such people could potentially have a substantial effect on salmon runs. But
the big operators with high-tech gear, scooping out whole shoals at sea, are
far more damaging to the species. The sea is a roomy place, and some
desperate fishermen have everything to play for. On the other hand, Beattie
adds, there is abundant hype about the abuse of salmon and, often,
unnecessary worry.
Perhaps. But the only surviving Atlantic salmon run of antediluvian
proportions is off north Russia. Here there is ice, the Russian navy - and
no one else.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Idyll spoiled by customers - Nick
Garnett visits a family working hard down on the farm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SETTING of the main house at Keynston Mill food farm is as close as you
can get to a real version of Wind in the Willows. Resting on the banks of a
small rivulet trickling off the river Stour in Dorset, the tree-decked land
forms a creek which the Partridge family, owners of Keynston Mill, use as a
swimming pool.
At the side of the 18th century house a wooden bridge spans a narrow brook,
by the disused mill wheel. The grassed promontories jutting out into the
reaches are mowed by Richard Partridge like any back garden lawn. In this
idyllic English landscape, the only unpleasant intruder is what is known
locally as the Blandford Beastie. This tropical fly, named after the nearby
town and brought in by a local schoolteacher before it escaped into the
wild, occasionally leaves wounds as big as golf balls on the faces of
Keynston Mill's fruit pickers.
Tranquil it might be but running the food farm has not been easy since
Richard Partridge and his wife Nicky bought the 50 acre property in the
early 1980s. Keynston Mill incorporates six acres of commercial vines, more
than 30 acres of other fruits and vegetables, a licensed tea room and a shop
selling kitchenware and gifts as well as food and wine. Turnover for the
whole business last year was Pounds 202,000 on which it made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 30,000. This formed the relatively modest income for the
couple and for daughter Anni, who also works on the smallholding.
'It is kind of a mad business to be in.' says Nicky. 'You are so dependent
on the weather.'
However, the business has given the Partridges a great deal of capital
growth. Former tenant farmers in Gloucestershire, the couple came to Dorset
in 1969 when Richard worked for a local agro-chemical company. They started
renting the land at Keynston Mill and bought it in 1984 for Pounds 1,000 an
acre, including the five bedroomed farmhouse. For an outlay of Pounds
50,000, paid off over five years, the Partridges own an asset worth probably
Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 if it were sold. But then it could not be
kept in the family.
The shop generates half of Keynston Mill's turnover. The Partridges spent
Pounds 16,000 converting an old building on the site, doing a lot of the
work themselves. 'It was a revolting remains of a barn,' says Richard 'It
was deep in mud, generations of uncleaned out manure and a lot of diesel
fuel. All the wood was rotten.'
The shop sells Italian salad bowls at Pounds 37, tea mugs at Pounds 7, local
produce such as Dorset bread biscuits known as 'knobs', muesli from
Dorchester and Childhay Manor ice cream as well as more unusual food
products including balsamic vinegar and walnut oil.
'There is no point in competing with Safeways in Blandford,' says Anni, who
runs the shop. 'Some of this we stock for weekenders from London. The
biggest margins are on hardware at about 100 per cent. We make 30 per cent
on books and 25 to 35 per cent on food.'
While the shop has been a success, the licensed tea room has proved more of
a headache. It cost Pounds 20,000 to convert the building and meet hygiene
regulations but turned over Pounds 13,500 last year. 'It has been a bit
disappointing and we'd be pushed to say it makes a profit,' Richard says.
Fruit and vegetable sales amount to about Pounds 80,000 yearly. Keynston
Mill produces more than 40 types, from cooking apples and blackberries to
courgettes and dwarf beans.
'This is in a way far too many but we have taken the view that to attract
people here and therefore to use the shop and tea room we have to offer such
a wide range.'
Strawberries generate by far the biggest profit margin. 'It is the only
fruit whose prices have increased at a reasonable rate. The cost of growing
fruit must have gone up 200 per cent since the late 1970s but the sale price
of, say, raspberries, has on blackcurrants and gooseberries is only
marginal. You can make a lot of money just doing strawberries but you need
better land. This here is third quality barley and sheep land, not good
enough for high output cropping.'
British vineyards have had a difficult time recently. 'There won't be many
left the way they are falling, left, right and centre,' Richard says. He
concedes, though, that a six acre vineyard is a 'mad enterprise.' Growing
grapes, he says, is 'an emotional thing, a very strong feeling you get for
vines.'
Keynston Mill produced 12,000 bottles last year compared with 23,000 two
years earlier. Some of that drop was caused by the weather but there is
little pressure to make more wine as Pounds 80,000 of wine stocks wait to be
sold.
The wine, for which Keynston Mill does hardly any wholesaling, is made by a
company in Somerset from Keynston Mill grapes and another wine maker in
Sussex produces sparkling wine.
'Quality sparkling wine selling at Pounds 10 a bottle gives us a profit
margin of Pounds 3. That compares with a margin of Pounds 1.50 for our best
table wine and just 50p for the cheaper bottles.' Keynston Mill's most
expensive non-sparkling wine, Dry Bacchus, sells for Pounds 5.95.
Richard employs one man full time on fruit growing and himself often works
from 6 am until late evening, seven days a week. Three or four others work
part time through the year while fruit picking raises the number of
temporary workers to about 40.
Partridge says he loves growing but not selling. The Partridges love privacy
but must attract as many customers as possible to the farm.
'By the end of the year I want to shoot people,' says Richard.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The revival of the species: The rebirth of the extinct
quagga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   THE QUAGGA is extinct
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or at least it was, until a team of international scientists began trying to
resurrect this zebra-like creature, native to the arid vastness of South
Africa's Karoo.
Coloured rich brown to blend in with the red dust of the Karoo - a huge,
infertile, sparsely populated area of the Cape - the quagga looked like a
zebra with less than half the normal stripes. Karoo farmers saw it as an
unwelcome competitor for grazing, and set out to exterminate it. The last
specimen died more than a hundred years ago in an Amsterdam zoo.
Now scientists believe they can bring back the quagga, named by the original
Hottentot inhabitants of the Karoo for the distinctive sound it made. At a
nature reserve 200 kilometres north-east of Cape Town, they have begun
selectively breeding plains zebras (the striped animals most familiar to
Europeans), hoping to restore the distinctive colouration of the quagga.
If they succeed, there is a chance that other long-dead animals could be
saved from extinction - but only if they are closely related to an extant
species which can be used as a breeding base. The dinosaur and the
brontosaurus will remain in oblivion; but scientists might, for example, be
able to recreate the extinct blue antelope.
In fact, the only hope for resurrecting the quagga is that it is not truly
'extinct'. Genetic research has shown that it was a sub-species of the
plains zebra; scientists believe its colouration may simply be diluted in
the extant population of such zebras, where isolated individuals (darker in
colour and faintly striped) already slightly resemble quaggas.
This resemblance is borne out by genetic evidence: DNA extracted from dried
tissue and blood of stuffed quaggas matches that of the plains Zebra,
proving that the quagga is a sub-species.
'If a species is gone, nothing can be done about it because the entire gene
pool is gone,' says Reinhold Rau, head of taxidermy at the South African
museum in Cape Town, and the father of the quagga project. But the gene pool
of the plains zebra is still available for re-breeding the quagga, by a
process similar to selective breeding of livestock.
Baby Reina, one of six foals who form the first generation of the quagga
breeding project, demonstrates how it is done. She was born of parents
specially selected in the wild for their faint striping, and her stripes are
fainter still. But scientists were not so lucky with the other foals: one
has distinctly more prominent stripes than either parent, and the others
show little progress toward quagga colouration. Scientists hope to see firm
results in 10 years - but it could take longer.
Some wildlife experts dispute the validity of the project: 'We can breed a
zebra which will look like a quagga but it will never, ever be a quagga. All
we know about the quagga was what it looked like and where it was found. We
know nothing about its behaviour, its habitat . . . ' says Zane Erasmus,
ranger at the Vrolijkheid Nature Reserve where the breeding is being done.
Scientists were not able to get a full genetic fingerprint of the quagga,
because none of the crucial 'nuclear DNA' survived in the stuffed specimens;
so they will never know whether a re-bred quagga is just a man-made
lookalike or a truly genetic recreation.
And after several generations in captivity the quagga may no longer be able
to survive in the wild. But if they can be released into Karoo nature
reserves, where there are no major predators, it would be a small step
towards rectifying the damage done by man to Africa's wildlife.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Sea captain who perverted Utopia: Dan Gawthrop tells one of
the century's strangest tales of religious humbug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAN GAWTHROP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SEVEN explosive years, 20,000 followers worldwide contributed hundreds of
thousands of dollars to support the Aquarian Foundation - a utopian, pre-60s
spiritual colony which was ultimately destroyed by the deceit, black magic
and slave labour imposed by its founding visionary.
The story of this 'false prophet', Edward Arthur Wilson, a former English
sea captain who changed his name to Brother Twelve after a vision in the
south of France, is told in a fascinating biography by Canadian author John
Oliphant.
Wilson's experience was later referred to in newspapers as the most amazing
story ever told in a Canadian court.
As Oliphant reveals, Wilson, who was nearly penniless and in poor health
when he had his first 'vision' in 1924, seemed an unlikely candidate to lead
multitudes.
Born in Ladywood, Birmingham in 1878, Wilson was raised by his craftsman
father as an 'Irvingite' - an obscure sect of the Catholic Apostolic Church
which singled out the Book of Revelations as the most important scripture,
interpreted numerical symbols in the Bible, 'and believed that the
archangels, seraphim and cherubim, were living spiritual beings.'
Oliphant describes Wilson as a restless young adult who worked various jobs
as a seaman and got married in New Zealand before abandoning his wife and
two children in Victoria, British Columbia.
He served as a navigator in the First World War, sailed around the world and
studied the ancient religions of Egypt, India, China and Mexico. In addition
to writing several scholarly texts on astrology, and joining the American
Theosophical Society, his social circle in England was said to include
Neville Chamberlain, the British Conservative statesman, Jan Smuts, the Boer
War general and Sir Arthur Eddington, a distinguished astro-physicist.
The 'voice' Wilson heard in his vision said he had been an ancient Egyptian
ruler and that his current mission was to 'rebuild' and 'restore' the human
race.
Dubbing himself 'Brother Twelve' - after his Master, the Twelfth Brother in
the Great White Lodge - he began writing a series of theosophical texts
which were remarkable for their sweeping, apocalyptic prophecy. His vision
of Europe on the brink of destruction, outlined in a 1926 article in the
Occult Review, sparked a debate on spiritualism with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
He also predicted a major stock market crash within four months of the
actual event.
By this time, however, Wilson had already formed the Aquarian Foundation and
moved to Vancouver Island. Only a handful of people joined him at the time,
but Mary Connally - a rich American widow who learned of Brother Twelve
after reading a copy of Foundation Letters and Teachings - gave Wilson an
initial donation of Dollars 2,000. She then met him in a Toronto hotel room
where, after a three-hour discussion, she signed a cheque for Dollars
23,000. Eventually she moved to the settlement on Decourcy Island.
ect, with communal living arrangements and daily spiritual gatherings, the
foundation soon became a fortress in which colony members stockpiled food to
prepare for the Apocalypse and armed themselves with rifles to ward off
unseen enemies and unwanted provincial authorities.
The project was doomed from the start. Many disciples were surprised to
learn that their spiritual leader was a virulent anti-Semite, whose belief
in the worldwide banking conspiracy led him to endorse a Ku Klux Klan
sympathiser as a third party candidate in the 1928 US presidential election.
In one of his more startling discoveries, Oliphant reveals that Brother
Twelve's efforts on behalf of Alabama Senator James 'Tom Tom' Heflin were
based on his fear that a civil war would result if Heflin's Catholic
opponent were elected.
Brother Twelve was a notorious womaniser. He often used spiritual
justification for his dalliances, including the claim that one Myrtle
Baumgartner - whom he seduced on a train journey to Chicago - had returned
as Isis to couple with his Osiris. The most notorious affair was with Mabel
Skottowe: referred to by disciples as 'Madame Zee,' Brother Twelve's chief
mistress was a powerful figure who used a rider's crop to intimidate
residents and cast spells on any woman she suspected of trying to steal the
affections of Wilson.
Even the 67-year-old aristocrat, Mary Connally, was reduced to humiliating
labour conditions and forced to spend the winter in a dilapidated shack with
loose floorboards and no heating. The abuse Connally was willing to endure
until her final breakdown is astonishing, given that the elderly widow had
travelled across the continent from North Carolina to testify on Wilson's
behalf, in an earlier lawsuit where Wilson was accused of misappropriating
her money. That case fell apart when a key witness for the disciples, Robert
England, mysteriously disappeared after resigning from the Foundation.
By the time the colony finally collapsed in the summer of 1932, foundation
members launched a second series of court actions against Brother Twelve.
Testimony included allegations of death threats, spellcasting and a plot to
assassinate a member of the provincial cabinet who had earlier been asked to
intervene.
The foundation members won the second case, but their money was never
recovered. Following the first court action, Brother Twelve had converted
the cash into gold nuggets and had his disciples bury it on the island. By
the time authorities were able to excavate the area, all they found in one
hole was an empty box containing the note: 'For fools and traitors -
nothing]' By that time, Brother Twelve and Madame Zee had fled the country.
Wilson was reported to have died in Switzerland in 1934.
Oliphant, a Vancouver resident, confesses to a life-long interest in Brother
Twelve. He learned of the legend when he sailed through the Gulf Islands as
a child, and his interest was sparked further when he read a pulp novel on
the subject in the 1970s. His book is the result of 10 years of research in
which he acquired court documents and previously unreleased letters. Before
Oliphant's book, Wilson's life was shrouded in mystery.
Many surviving members of the Aquarian Foundation remained loyal to the
principles of theosophy, and were not eager to contribute to sensational
accounts of Brother Twelve which would distort the message of the Work.
Thus, it was only his extensive reading of Wilson's books and sympathetic
view of his theosopical teachings that won Oliphant access to some of the
key players.
In addition to surviving members of the Aquarian Foundation, original
testimony includes a statement by the son of Brother Twelve's lawyer, who
recalls a mysterious meeting in San Francisco between his father and a man
of Wilson's exact description, following his reported death in 1934 ('quite
pale-dressed in white and had a white wide-brimmed hat. I was particularly
struck by his eyes'). Oliphant even located Wilson 's daughter, Margery
Ellen Bell, who last saw her father when she was an eight-year-old in 1912.
What could have attracted so many people to Wilson's bizarre cult? When
asked to explain Brother Twelve's enduring intrigue, the author's response
is reminiscent of a 1960s credo.
'In the Age of Aquarius,' he says in an interview, paraphrasing Brother
Twelve, 'people will recognise the inherent divinity of nature, and that
we're all one and should co-operate rather than compete with each other -
our welfare is enhanced by that co-operation.'
That Wilson's legacy and life were so tragically contrary to this ideal is
the greatest paradox of this biography.
Brother Twelve, by John Oliphant, was published last autumn by McClelland &amp;
Stewart and is released in the UK next week. (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds
14.95).

FT  30 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax losses and CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the tax years 1989-90 and 1990-91, I incurred losses, for capital
gains purposes, of Pounds 6,300 and Pounds 62 respectively, on sales of
equities.
In the following year, 1991-92 I made a capital gain; but well within my
normal entitlement for that year. The same will probably be the case in
1992-93.
Can I carry forward my losses for 1989-90 and 1990-91 to offset any excess
gains in future years?
Yes, by virtue of section 5(4)(a) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979: 'where
the amount of chargeable gains less allowable losses accruing to an
individual in any year of assessment does not exceed the exempt amount for
the year, no deduction from that amount shall be made for that year in
respect of allowable losses carried forward from a previous year'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WISH to pass on some sizeable shareholdings (pre-1982) to my children,
avoiding Capital Gains Tax and hopefully inheritance tax.
a) Can I double the flow by transferring some of my holding to my wife as an
exempt arrangement, for her then to make similar annual gifts to the
children?
b) If this is valid, what interval is necessary? Can the first gift to
children follow as soon as new certificates in my wife's name are to hand?
You cannot simply use your wife as a puppet.
If you decide to give her parcels of shares, she may decide that her
enlarged investment portfolio is greater than she needs, and she may
therefore decide to make gifts to the children, but the decisions must be
hers - with no prompting or pressure from you.
The longer the period between your gifts to her and her gifts to the
children - should she decide to make any such gifts - the easier it will be
for her to convince the Inland Revenue that she acted independently.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family (Investing in . . . Australia):
Tarnished image gets a polish - Prospects down under
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA has earned itself a bad reputation as a staunchly protectionist
economy. With the irritating exception of the Ashes, it seems to have
imported hardly anything in recent years.
It is the kind of economy which allowed a few entrepreneurs to get very rich
very quickly but the strong, consistent growth favoured by more cautious
investors has eluded it. And sentiment there has not been helped by a series
of spectacular crashes among the high-profile entrepreneurs; Alan Bond, the
British-born businessman behind the country's America's Cup triumph who was
sentenced to prison this week, was only the latest addition to this list.
Australia's market is dominated by companies from two sectors, industrials
and resources, and shares are traded tightly. None of this seems conducive
to steady profits for UK investors and, indeed, fund managers have not
rushed to offer Australian exposure to clients.
Only two new Australian unit trusts have been launched in the past 10 years
and there are only eight funds in the entire Australasian sector.
Reluctance to rush into Australia is supported by the performance of these
funds. They have miserably underperformed their rivals; over five years,
only three have increased in value at all.
The average performance for the sector over this time period is a drop of
9.4 per cent, according to Finstat.
Performance by 'Far East excluding Japan' funds, many of which include
Australasia, has been somewhat more impressive - but most of their growth
has come from the South-East Asian newly-industrialised countries (or Nics)
such as Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. At first sight, then, there is
little reason to expect a permanent change for the better in Australia.
Following the ousting of prime minister Bob Hawke by Paul Keating in
December, its politics now resemble one of the television soap operas it
exports with such success. Keating's behaviour since, including his
familiarity with the Queen during her visit, has done nothing to foster a
feeling of stability.
Because of its geographical position, Australia is also influenced heavily
by market movements in Japan. The Nikkei Dow's precipitate fall in the first
three months of this year seems, therefore, to give further good reasons for
avoiding the land down under.
But there is optimism in the air, thanks to Australia's plans to end its
economic isolationism. Since its commodity exports can no longer be relied
upon to finance support for other industries, the nation is opening up. Some
commentators believe it has little choice.
The economy underwent a round of deregulation under the Hawke government
while economic links with South-East Asia have been fostered through
organisations such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group.
While treasurer, Keating subjected the economy to the kind of fiscal rigour
familiar to Britons who have lived under Margaret Thatcher. The banks' prime
lending rate hit 20.5 per cent at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990,
and has since been pruned in stages to 10.75 per cent. Possibly pushed by
declining interest rates, the Australian stock market had a good year in
1991 and the All-Ordinary index rose 23 per cent.
Growth has been more muted this year but some fund managers feel very
optimistic. These are led by NM, which manages the most successful unit
trust in the area.
NM Australian has grown 97.6 per cent over the past five years, according to
Finstat, and by 383 per cent over 10. Its nearest rival, Schroder
Australian, has managed growth of 156.8 per cent in the decade.
In many ways, NM's success is attributable to the position of its parent
company, which is Australia's largest life group. But this does give the
company's views some weight when it reveals grounds for cautious optimism.
According to Victor De Lorenzo, NM Australian's fund manager, there are a
number of positive factors in the investment outlook. These include
Australia's inflation rate, which is now at its lowest level for 30 years
and unlikely to rise sharply. Core inflation is running at approximately 3
per cent per annum, according to NM.
Despite this, De Lorenzo says there is no significant evidence of a squeeze
on margins and these are expected to stabilise once demand stops falling.
Corporate earnings might be set for a strong rebound over the next two
years.
De Lorenzo sees potential from market valuations for a 10-15 per cent rise
in industrial shares over the next six months, and evidence that Japanese
prices have now hit the bottom also bolsters optimism.
He admits, however, that definite signs of profit recovery have yet to
emerge and that the strength of the economic recovery is uncertain. This is
a view echoed by Fidelity; its house view is optimisitic, but cautiously so.
According to Fidelity: 'It should become clearer over the next few months
that the economy is well on the way to recovery. Higher earnings' estimates
and continuing low inflation should help the market to return to the uptrend
which began in 1991.'
So, any move into Australia has to be very speculative.
Investing there is not for widows and orphans. NM's portfolio is overweight
in companies such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and TNT, which lack
for UK investors the reassuringly stable image of ICI or BP. De Lorenzo
admits that these are 'geared recovery plays.' It is overweight in
industrials, while exposure to gold has been cut radically in line with
predictions for world commodities markets.
M&amp;G Australasian, second in the sector over the year to May 1 with growth of
0.8 per cent, according to Finstat, is adopting a similar approach. At the
end of 1991, just over half of the fund's assets were invested in the
general industrial sector, and there was a bias towards companies with
strong international operations.
Like NM, M&amp;G moved into News Corporation after its debt had finally been
restructured, but admits that this also is geared to a western recovery -
particularly through the BSkyB satellite television company. M&amp;G's exposure
to the mining sector has been reduced following disappointing metal prices.
None of this adds up to an obvious buying opportunity - the Australian
sector still does not seem strong enough for that, and too many other
factors come into play. But the pointers to some form of sustained recovery
are there.

THE LIST of sales is lengthening as the stock market tests new heights.
Since coming to the market in April 1989, shares of the Capita Group - which
specialises in information technology and systems consultancy - have more
than trebled in value, although most of the gain has been achieved since the
beginning of 1991. There have been previous sales by directors. This time,
four of them, including the chairman and managing director, have sold a
total of 303,000 shares at 410p, close to their peak level.
Only one of the sales by Hanson directors resulted from the exercise of an
option. The other two were straight sales and included a disposal by Lord
Hanson himself of 2.55m shares. Interim results announced the previous week
were at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. The consensus view is that
this year's profits will fall for the first time in the company's history.
David Spencer, chairman of Tay Homes, sold 2.1m shares at 220p leaving
himself with 1.4m. The share price has moved sharply higher in the past few
weeks.
Polypipe directors have featured regularly in this column, always as
sellers. Geoffrey Harrison has reduced his holding to 90m shares by selling
1m at 141p. In April, Kevin McDonald sold 1m shares at 113p.
The only purchases of note were in British Petroleum - which is, ironically,
now viewed as a potential takeover target for Hanson. Robert Horton, the
chairman and chief executive, was buying shares in February. Now, two of his
colleagues have bought a total of 36,500 at between 254p and 258p apiece.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: Professionals who lose it all -
Bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN GREGORY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY professionals in debt. Not only are they in danger of losing their
homes and property, they also run a grave risk of having their careers
ruined by expulsion from their professional bodies.
Insolvency can spell the end of a career as an MP, chartered surveyor,
company director or even black cab driver. But for accountants and
solicitors, bankruptcy in particular is the stuff of nightmares. It means
automatic departure from chartered or certified accountancy and strips
lawyers of their practicising certificates.
'The recession has bitten very hard into the professions, with property
purchases often causing trouble,' says Tony Supperstone, an insolvency
practitioner at Stoy Hayward. He has been advising small firms of
accountants and solicitors with around five partners, all of whose careers
are on the line if a creditor makes them bankrupt.
Many of these firms bought their premises at the top of the market and have
since been squeezed by the twin jaws of the recessionary vise: rising
interest payments and falling fees.
Creditors know that bankruptcy is the ultimate sanction and go as far as
petitioning for it. Then, says Supperstone, there is around six weeks to set
up a voluntary arrangement before a bankruptcy order is made.
Such voluntary arrangements require the agreement of creditors owed at least
three-quarters of the debt and negotiations can involve considerable
brinkmanship, as bankruptcy is in neither side's interest.
But if one large creditor stands out for full repayment, bankruptcy cannot
be avoided. So far this year, 26 chartered accountants have lost membership
compared with 30 in all of 1991.
Even a voluntary arrangement will not necessarily ensure that the individual
retains membership of the professional body. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants regards such arrangements as a disciplinary matter, and the Law
Society takes them into account before renewing a practising certificate.
These attitudes are, however, tender-hearted compared with the rulebook of
the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA).
Bylaw 25 expels automatically a partner who enters into an arrangement with
his creditors, even though they want him to stay in work so that he can pay
off his debts. 'This is a bylaw we have inherited,' says Anthony Booth, of
the ACCA, 'The harshness of this rule is something we will look at.'
Voluntary arrangements can also be the undoing of chartered surveyors and
company directors.
'The traditional approach has been to treat insolvency as a hanging
offence,' says David Millar, of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors. 'One reason for this is that those who extend credit to
professionals are happier to do so if the big chopper is awaiting those who
don't meet their debts.' But the RICS does not expel members automatically
even if made bankrupt.
Millar says the fate of the 20 insolvent chartered surveyors now being
considered by the institution will depend on 'the size of the unmet debt,
whether the debt is to people who can stand the loss, and what the chartered
surveyor is doing to try to make the best of a bad job.'
Company directors cannot plead such mitigation. While it is well known that
bankruptcy bars them from holding office without the special permission of a
court, what is less publicised is that most companies' articles of
association also exclude a director if he makes 'any arrangement or
composition with his creditors.' To some extent, the public expects harsh
treatment for professionals who prove unable to manage their own affairs.
The professional bodies, therefore, need to see their members stay
respectable in the eyes of their clients. They are also concerned that
insolvent members may yield to the temptation of 'borrowing' from clients'
funds.
If they do this, though, their exclusion will probably be life-long. 'It's
extremely difficult to imagine re-admitting anyone who has been expelled for
mortgage fraud or embezzlement. They could apply until they're blue in the
face,' says Millar.
Those whose downfall was not due to a lack of virtue receive more charity,
albeit with strings attached. The 21 bankrupt solicitors now in the queue
for replacement practising certificates are unlikely to be allowed to
operate as sole practitioners but will have to operate within approved
partnerships.
Those who fail to regain their practising certificates might want to
contemplate re-training as barristers or architects. Neither profession
expels bankrupts.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: My property-free portfolio - Diary
of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's announcement that receivers have been called in at Mountleigh -
one of the UK's largest property groups - and that Olympia &amp; York's Canary
Wharf development is in the hands of administrators, did not come as much of
a surprise to me. As a private investor, I sold my last property share in
1989, although, over the years, I have made some useful profits from the
sector.
In December, 1985, my wife bought shares in the property group, Stockley,
paying 69p per share. We liked the quality and design of its buildings,
which seemed to indicate good rental levels, especially its development at
Stockley Park, near Heathrow Airport.
In May, 1987, my wife accepted Mountleigh's takeover offer for Stockley,
taking the cash option of 135p per share, rather than Mountleigh shares or
loan notes.
Reading the takeover documents, I was struck by Mountleigh's numerous
property-dealing transactions. Could Mountleigh maintain the tremendous flow
of property deals in the future?
The documents also showed that Mountleigh had a subsidiary, Mountleigh Air
Services Ltd, involved in air-charter activities. Did this mean the company
had executive jets?
Unless a company has a worldwide spread of interests, I consider ownership
of a corporate plane rather like a luxury yacht - a signal to sell the
shares.
Whether or not Mountleigh had a private aircraft, I did not bother to find
out, since at that time I was also concerned that some property companies
and City institutions were playing 'pass the parcel' with shares and
property. One company or institution seemed to acquire a property and then
quickly sell it on to another, which, in turn, added a bit to the price and
sold it on. What would happen if the game stopped and no one wanted to
accept the parcel?
Prices, too, seemed to have reached rather unrealistic levels. It was
thoughts like these that saved me from making huge losses in the stock
market crash of October 1987 - since I had heavily reduced my share
portfolio in the summer of that year.
It is interesting to look back at other examples and see some of the
disasters I avoided. At various times in 1986 I bought, for my personal
pension scheme, shares in Dares Estates at prices ranging from 12.5p to
15.5p. I sold most of them, in several stages in 1987, achieving 40p to 71p
per share. I disposed of my remaining Dares holding in 1989 for 30.5p per
share. Dares shares are now less than 2p each.
After the Stock Market crash of 1987, I avoided property shares for a while,
but then did some selective stock-picking in 1988, buying (again for my
pension scheme) shares in companies like Priest Marians, Warringtons, and
Mowat.
However, by June 1989, I was concerned about the effect of high interest
rates on heavily borrowed property companies and the massive rises in
uniform business rates on commercial property in London and the south of
England. Just walking around London, it seemed obvious that there were a lot
of empty offices and shop premises. I therefore sold my property shares.
I was fortunate, for example, to be able to dispose of my Mowat shares for
43p each. Now they are 7.5p.
Over the past few years, various people have promoted property shares,
claiming that prices had fallen to such low levels that it was now time to
go 'bottom fishing'. I ignored such blandishments.
I still believe property prices (and shares in property companies) are
likely to fall further. Why? Just look around you. Who needs all the empty
office space when companies are busily cutting staff?
Many companies in the financial services sector, such as insurance, are
looking rather sickly, and it may take further rationalisation and mergers
to save some of them. Again, this means cutting down on paper-pushers in
offices.
As to other property: if Lloyds takes over Midland (or if there are further
building society mergers), there could be a glut of bank and building
society premises on the market.
Look at the average high street. How many of the shops are boarded up,
occupied by charity organisations, or let on very short leases? Quite a lot.
Who wants to be a shopkeeper? My wife has shares in Burton Group, mainly to
get the shareholder discount on her purchases in Debenhams. This week, she
received Burton's interim statement. If you exclude Debenhams, and divide
the trading profits of all the other shops (Principles, Top Shop, Dorothy
Perkins, Burton, Champion Sport, Evans, etc) by the number of outlets of
those shops, it produces less than Pounds 2,000 profit per outlet. And that
is before interest charges. Hardly an encouragement to anyone to embark on
massive store openings]
As far as the housing market is concerned, I feel that many people have
unrealistic price expectations for their properties. The problems at Lloyds
will affect upmarket house prices; and, while so many people are unemployed
or fearful of losing their jobs, then fewer lower-price house moves will
take place. The minute economic prospects improve and unemployment is
reduced, many of the people who have delayed moving may flood the market
with their homes, which could again keep prices depressed.
But are house prices depressed enough? Why are homes in France and much of
the US lower than in the UK? Surely it cannot be due to higher UK wage
levels, but to over-optimistic evaluations.
As with shares, I believe that property does not have intrinsic value. The
true value of a property, or a share, is not its book value, but whatever
someone is genuinely prepared to pay for it, or, taking a short-term view,
what a gullible bank is prepared to lend against it - but that is another
story . . .

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: NS strategies / A look at the new
fixed-rate products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKING an income from fixed-rate National Savings products is a complicated
process. After I had, in a recent article, made all the calculations for the
36th issue of certificates, the department promptly cancelled it. So, I went
back to my calculator and worked out the figures for the latest issue, the
37th.
It should be emphasised that these certificates are not designed to offer
income; they offer the best returns to those who hold them for the full five
years. Nevertheless, many people are unable to wait that long.
It is possible to create an income stream by cashing the certificates in
successive years. The 37th issue pays 5.5 per cent on the first anniversary;
6.2 per cent in the following year; 8 per cent in year three; 9.4 per cent
in year four; and 11 per cent in the final year, for an overall return of 8
per cent per annum. (No income is paid on certificates cashed in before the
first anniversary.)
Unlike the 36th issue, the 37th allows for a maximum investment of Pounds
7,500 (Pounds 15,000 for couples), although you can re-invest old
certificates up to a further Pounds 10,000. But before attempting any of
these strategies, investors should check to see if they can get a better
return elsewhere.
According to Colin Jackson, of Baronworth Investment Services, a return of
8.46 per cent is available on a Pounds 7,500 guaranteed income bond. Since
basic-rate tax is deducted from GIBs, basic-rate taxpayers will be better
off buying them than using National Savings. The certificates are really
only suitable vehicles for higher-rate taxpayers who want income.
Strategy one is designed to produce a level income and leave the capital
intact. By cashing Pounds 550, Pounds 525, Pounds 475 and Pounds 450 of
certificates in successive years, the investor can get an income of between
Pounds 574 and Pounds 595 a year. In the fifth year, he or she is left with
Pounds 5,500 of certificates. These mature with a value of Pounds 8,081.72,
leaving the investor to take Pounds 581.72 of income and Pounds 7,500 for
re-investment.
The average tax-free income has been around 7.8 per cent a year, compared
with the 8 per cent compound total return which would have been received by
leaving the money in for the full five years. In essence, the investor has
given up Pounds 600 of return to get the income.
Strategy two is designed to produce a steadily-growing income by cashing
certificates worth Pounds 500, Pounds 500, Pounds 475 and Pounds 475 in
successive years. The income will grow from Pounds 527 after year one to
Pounds 655 after year five. Again, the full Pounds 7,500 is left for
re-investment.
What about non-taxpayers? They will be interested primarily in the new
series-D capital bonds which pay a gross 10.75 per cent if held for five
years. (Taxpayers should note that they are taxed each year on the assumed
income from these bonds, even if they do not cash the bonds until the end of
year five).
Strategy three is designed to generate a steady income by investing Pounds
10,000 in the capital bonds. By cashing Pounds 950, Pounds 875, Pounds 800
and Pounds 725 of bonds in successive years, the investor can receive an
income of between Pounds 1,014 and Pounds 1,034.
At the end of year five, he will be left with certificates with a face value
of Pounds 6,650, which will mature for Pounds 11,080. He can take the Pounds
1,080 as the final year's income, leaving Pounds 10,000 for re-investment.
But the investor would have received around Pounds 1,500 more if he had left
in the money for the full term.

Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical company, is expected on Thursday to
announce a rise in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 345m to about Pounds
360m, excluding property disposals. Attention will be focused on margins at
Boots The Chemist, and on attempts to turnround Halfords and Do-It-All.
Thames Water, largest of the privatised water companies, may announce an
increase in annual pre-tax profit of less than Pounds 20m, to Pounds 230m or
so, next Tuesday, while the dividend increase is expected to be 10 per cent.
As its area is one of the worst affected by drought, its views on metering
will be of interest. It will also be questioned on progress on its Pounds
4bn capital spending programme, including the London ring main.
Siebe, the engineering and controls group, is likely to be questioned
closely on North American trading next Wednesday. Optimists are forecasting
a modest advance in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 159m to Pounds 162m,
with the more pessimistic pitching for a decline to Pounds 150m. Both
parties agree strong cash generation is likely to have cut the high gearing.
Reed International, the publishing and information group, reports its annual
results on Wednesday, with some analysts expecting a small decline compared
with last time's pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 218.5m. However, Reed is
expected to show strong growth once the recession is clearly over.
De La Rue, the the UK-based security printer and payment machine maker, is
expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 80m, up from Pounds
58.9m, when it announces annual results on Tuesday. The group which has been
successfully turned around by Jeremy Marshall, chief executive and formerly
of Hanson, has successfully managed to cut out more costs. These profits
would represent 32.1p of earnings and analysts expect the dividend to
increase from 13.7p to 15p.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: SIB shakes up investment industry -
The proposals which have emerged from the 13-month review of UK regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS it is appropriate that a thorough review of retail investment
regulation in the UK should create a mountain of paper. This week - after 13
months and three separate consultative documents, each of which provoked
rather more than 100 closely argued submissions from interested parties -
the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) announced the final version of
its proposals for disclosure and quality of advice. By comparison, reading
the small print on a life policy would be easier.
The consultative process had been so exhaustive that Thursday's announcement
produced few surprises. Such changes as there were tended to move in favour
of the life insurance industry and against the expressed wishes of consumer
groups.
Only a few hurdles remain. The proposals will need ministerial blessing and
should be enacted by the end of this year. Product providers would then have
a two-year transitional period before the proposals on 'client-specific'
disclosure need be fully operative. This should allow their computer systems
time to adapt to the new challenges.
In spite of several climbdowns, the proposals could still have a big impact
on sales of investment products in the UK. Alert investors will be in a much
better position as, perhaps more importantly, will be financial novices.
As they stand, the proposals are centred around the simple 'key features'
document which must be presented to clients before a sale. This should be
brief (able to fit on a page of A4 paper) and should sum up the main points
of a particular product.
The main recommendations for the content of the key features document, and
SIB's other measures, can be summarised as follows:
Surrender Values
SIB's proposals have been watered down, which is rather disappointing. One
of the casualties was a proposal to make product providers reveal the
'break-even year' in which the amount investors would receive on
surrendering a policy would exceed the total premiums they had paid. On some
25-year policies, this point might not come for 10 years; but SIB decided to
abandon the idea because the timing of the break-even point is affected
strongly by investment performance.
SIB has, however, insisted that if this point is likely to come after more
than five years, this must be spelt out. And the proposal should go some way
to preventing first-time buyers who fall into arrears on their mortgages
from surrendering their endowments and then finding they have actually lost
on the deal - something that has happened often over the past two years.
Indeed, SIB has improved on the present position by requiring that projected
surrender values for each of the first five years must be printed next to
the total amount that would have been paid in premiums at each point. This
makes clear to investors that they could make a loss.
Effect of Charges
The 'reduction in policy proceeds,' which SIB planned to make companies
publish as an illustration of the effect of costs on investment returns from
life policies, could now be renamed 'reduction in benefits.' It will still
be expressed as a reduction in terms of the number of pence per pound spent
on charges, and it will remain a crucial addition to the present misleading
'reduction in yield' calculation.
RIY is valid actuarially and will continue to be shown but, as expressed
now, it is misunderstood widely. It shows the number of percentage points
which would be knocked off a given yield by an office's expenses. This makes
big reductions in yield look tiny. For example, a 1 per cent RIY on an
endowment would deter nobody. But this actually means a reduction of 1
percentage point from a yield of 7 per cent. SIB now insists that this
should also be expressed as a deduction of 14p in every Pounds 1.
There is still some fine detail to be worked out here, and the Association
of British Insurers still does not accept that RIY was not sufficient if
explained clearly. But it has pledged to work to make the new disclosure
workable.
Charges in Illustrations
This particularly arcane topic ended up causing some of the most furious
arguments. SIB has decided that when illustrating projected maturity values,
life offices can assume that their costs will be in line with the industry
average even if their costs are, in fact, much higher.
Earlier in the consultation process, it had proposed 'own charge'
illustrations. Such a move obviously would have encouraged greater
competition over cost. But SIB reached what it admits was a marginal
decision to maintain average charges because attention might have been
diverted from the even more important issue of investment return. The
decision also was swayed because even some low-cost offices (which might
have been expected to benefit) were worried that the system could be abused.
Commission Disclosure
Yet another apparently technical issue could be the hottest political potato
in the package. SIB is against mandatory disclosure of the precise
incentives an independent financial adviser (IFA) has been given by a
product provider. The Office of Fair Trading disagrees.
The FT's criticisms of the commission system for advisers are well known and
Sir David Walker, the chairman of SIB, has made clear that he agrees.
Unfortunately, though, there are some good reasons why commission disclosure
might not be a good idea.
First, Sir David points out that information about the total impact of costs
is more important for an investor than the amount of commission, which is
just one (rather large) part of this. Then, there is the problem of the
'level playing field.'
Most direct sales forces are paid by commission, but it is not difficult for
companies to introduce incentive schemes or performance-related pay of some
form so that salesmen appear to be salaried. SIB has, therefore, given up on
forcing them to reveal commissions, as it feels this would not be
enforceable.
It would be unfortunate if a cowboy salesman could claim he was paid less
commission than a reputable and experienced IFA. Thus, for the good of the
independent sector, SIB decided commission disclosure would be unwise. This
is, at best, a sad decision. As the OFT disagrees with it, the issue could
end up being settled by ministers.
Warnings
Endowments must now carry cigarette box-style warnings, although these have
been diluted somewhat from original suggestions - such as 'Warning]' and
'Danger]' - to the less pejorative 'Be Careful]' This should go some way to
preventing a repeat of the ill-thought-out plans many couples made in 1988.
Status Disclosure
It will now be much harder for the 'white socks brigade' of sales
representatives, tied to the products of only one company, to pass
themselves off as impartial advisers. SIB is requiring that a company's tied
status is advertised prominently on its premises, and is also mentioned in
both mortgage and 'image' (a la Scottish Widows) advertising.
Stationery and business cards will now need to be in the following form:
'Joe Bloggs represents only General &amp; Munificent for (the products in
question).'
Standards of Advice
This elusive concept is difficult for regulators to control. It is more or
less impossible to regulate what an unscrupulous salesman says during a
face-to-face interview. But SIB has come up with a promising method for
keeping tabs on the advice investors have been given: the 'reason why'
letter.
Advisers will be required to send a letter explaining why they have made
particular recommendations. This should enable investors to spot improper
advice before a sale has been completed. If realisation dawns only later,
the letter should be valuable evidence in showing that best advice was not
given.
This will be required both for taking on long-term commitments and for
relinquishing them, which should go some way to stamping out dubious advice
on surrendering life policies or transferring from company pension schemes.
Many issues remain suspended in mid-air. Sir David's irritation at the
over-selling of endowments, and support for fee-based advice, remain clear.
But little can be done about this without addressing the issue of regulatory
scope.
Banks and building societies are not within SIB's remit, which makes it
harder to establish a 'level playing field' with Tessas and deposit
accounts, or to regulate fully sales of mortgages. That will have to be
decided after Sir David's departure for Lloyds Bank. After this review,
though, he seems certain to leave an industry better geared to the
consumer's interests than it was five years ago.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: Why this may be the time to turn
green - Worried about the rainforest, pollution, gambling, alcohol and the
arms race? No need for the Samaritans. New and positive forms of ethical
investment are at hand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WOULD it cost you the earth to go green? Even if you do not have
pro-environmental views, the Earth Summit, which opens on Wednesday in Rio
de Janeiro, could have substantial effects on the growth and performance of
many companies.
There was a time when political and/or moral sensibilities held some
investors back from the stock market - some thought it ideologically
incorrect to invest in capitalist fat cats, others found the ethics of large
companies too questionable. Companies involved in South Africa and the arms
trade were among the favourite taboos.
One way around this for those without ideological objections to stock market
investment, but with scruples about where to invest, was to put money into
'ethical' funds, which took off in the 1980s. Friends Provident was the
pioneer; its Stewardship Unit Trust avoided companies involved in armaments,
South Africa, gambling, alcohol and tobacco. With Pounds 105m under
management, the fund is easily the largest ethical.
But fashions have changed again. Debate on environmental problems, backed by
laws geared towards cleaning the planet, produced a new breed of 'green'
funds towards the end of the 1980s.
It has led to 'positive' investment by ethical investors - instead of people
choosing stocks by refusing to invest in certain companies on ethical
grounds, they can now pick companies which contribute to the environment.
Some investors, of course, will continue to invest negatively by vetoing
companies with a bad environmental record.
Choice of green funds is still limited but most are to be found in the unit
trust sector, with a smattering of investment trusts and some pension and
insurance funds.
Homeowners, the friendly society, has a Green Chip growth bond and
StartRight, its children's savings plan, has a green option.
What is 'green'?
There are two main ways to invest environmentally. The first is to choose
companies which follow environmentally-friendly policies. The second is to
select companies which produce goods and services for cleaning the
environment, such as waste disposal companies.
The first green fund was a unit trust launched by Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin in
December 1988. It has since added an investment trust. Merlin selects
companies whose products and manufacturing processes are not causing
excessive harm to the environment. It also looks at the management's record
on these issues.
In its latest bulletin, it highlights National Westminster Bank, which has
an environmental management unit, for 'reviewing its entire lending
portfolio for potential liabilities in its attempt to achieve effective
environmental risk management.'
The object is different at Commercial Union, which launched its
environmental investment trust in April, adding to its environmental unit
trust and pension fund.
It tries to identify stocks which will be beneficiaries of the green
revolution and has mainly chosen small companies, involved in specialist
goods and services for the green market. The largest proportion is in the US
where environmental legislation is stricter than in Europe. Companies
include makers of air filters or water purifiers. This is a clear shift away
from companies which are demonstrating environmentally friendly behaviour in
their own operations.
The main reason for the shift is performance. 'You can't mix emotion with
investment,' said Peter Foster, marketing manager at Commercial Union.
Eric Hathorn, research director at Henderson Crosthwaite, private client
stockbrokers, which is recommending the new trust, agrees. 'We have to make
money for our clients. Commercial Union has gone for those companies which
provide services to improve the environment. The money they make out of that
is good environmental profit.'
Clerical Medical, which has insurance, pension funds and a unit trust in
this field, tries to marry the two main criteria for stock selection. Like
Commercial Union, it chooses companies involved in the environmental field
but does not include companies whose proudction process has adverse
environmental effects.
While National Westminster, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Bank of
Ireland have committed themselves to the protection of the environment, Hill
says: 'I can't see what a bank does that makes a positive contribution to
the environment. Companies such as Shell and ICI have vast resources but
there are still parts of their operations which could not be considered
environmentally friendly.'
The investment route chosen is very much a matter of personal choice for the
green investor. But interested investors should ask fund managers to state
their investment criteria because there is the risk that a green fund may
not be the right shade throughout.
For example, Ethical Investment Research Information Service, which screens
companies for private investors to see whether they meet ethical and
environmental criteria, identified companies involved in water pollution.
It then looked at green funds to see what percentage of their portfolio was
invested in the identified companies. Those funds with high avoidance rates
were NPI Global Care Unit Trust (97 per cent), Ethical Investment Fund run
by Bromige &amp; Partners (92 per cent), Equitable Ethical Unit Trust (89 per
cent) and Clerical Medical Evergreen, but TSB Environmental Investor Fund
had only a 14 per cent avoidance rate.
TSB does not claim to avoid companies causing water pollution but some green
investors may assume that that this is a necessary condition for an
environmental fund.
Performance
Reliable performance measures are difficult to establish.
James Capel, the broker, produces a green index which covers 30 stocks,
including the Body Shop, British Polythene and water companies such as
Severn Trent and Wessex. The index starts at 100 on December 30 1988 against
a FT-SE 100 rebased, also to 100, for the same date.
At May 15 the green index stood at 136.06 against 145.52 for the FT-SE 100.
The figures for the previous year May 17 1991) are 118.55 for the green
index and 136.55 for the rebased FT-SE 100.
'The green index has shown growth of 17.2 per cent against 9.4 per cent for
the Footsie over the past 12 months,' said Roger Hardman, co-author of the
James Capel Green Book.
'On the two year view, the two indices are bang in line.' Hardman believes
the outlook is good for green companies. 'For companies with exposure to the
environment, new markets are opening up and existing ones expanding.'
He believes companies which are not environmentally conscious are going to
find their operating costs increasing as tighter environmental legislation
is introduced. 'If you are producing toxic waste, charges to get rid of it
will increase and your profits will be hit.'
Nevertheless, there are very few points at which the green index has
overtaken the rebased Footsie and, when it has, the outperformance has been
short-lived and fractional.
In a paper on environmental investment produced last autumn, KPMG,
management consultants, found the performance of green funds 'uninspiring.'
'Both green and ethical funds tend to be heavily weighted in favour of
smaller companies, which have been hit hard by the recession, and by high
interest rates in particular,' it wrote.
'Furthermore, many of their stocks in the waste management and environmental
services sectors were over-rated at the time of purchase. However, there are
signs of improvement.'
One of the main problems affecting performance is that there are still not
enough investors, according to Commercial Union's Peter Foster. Its
investment trust, launched last month, has Pounds 17.5m under management but
this was mostly placed with institutions because there was not enough
interest on the retail side, according to Foster.
'There is about Pounds 100m in green funds in the UK but this actually is
not a lot of money. People like the concept of a green fund but when it
comes to putting their hands in their pockets, they are less keen,' he said.
This is particularly true of green pension funds. Large companies are,
perhaps understandably, reluctant to commit too large a proportion of money
set aside for employees' pensions in such a small market. 'Returns have been
respectable on our unit trust and the pension fund has not done badly, but
there have been bigger returns elsewhere,' said Foster.
Henderson Crosthwaite's Hathorn believes that a contributory factor limiting
the size of green funds was, ironically, the sudden interest in green
companies. 'The share price of companies spending on the environment went
through the roof and that is not the best way to increase the size of the
fund.' He, too, believes the outlook is good.
Green funds are limited in their choice of suitable stocks. This, and the
fact that many tend to be small companies, has resulted in these funds being
volatile in performance. 'We try to counteract the volatility by making our
fund international because there are not enough British companies for us to
choose from,' said Clerical Medical's Peter Hill.
The Evergreen trust holds about 50-60 stocks, half of which are in the US.
The rest are evenly divided between the UK, Japan and Europe. The unit trust
has shown a decline of 8.1 per cent in the year to May 1 against a 4.2 per
cent decline in the FT-A World Index over the same period.
'The Gulf crisis made the price fall and it has been a process of slow
recovery ever since,' said Hill. 'But it has tracked the World Index closely
throughout that period and since it is a volatile trust, that 4 per cent
differential can appear and disappear quite quickly.'
Jupiter Tyndall Merlin also complains of volatility but says it is taking
less risks to give a more balanced performance. The size of the Ecology unit
trust dropped from more than Pounds 10m last autumn to Pounds 8.6m today,
after one of its large institutional holders decided to withdraw.
'We used to be heavily in the US market, but when the dollar weakened
against the pound, we were at a disadvantage,' said Clare Brook, fund
manager at Merlin.
Its environmental research unit is seeking out companies for good
profitability. 'We have also tried to identify the greens among the blue
chips,' said Tessa Tennant, head of Merlin's the research unit. 'We found
that many of the companies that had a good environmental record were also
good performers in their sector. For example, Argyll came out top in food
retailing, Wessex in water and Manweb in electricity.'
For the future, along with other fund managers, Clerical Medical's Hill
takes a very positive long term outlook. Events such as the Rio summit
should put pressure on governments, in the US and West Europe, at least, to
promote measures for the protection of the environment. The process is slow,
which is why green investors need to be patient, he said.
'The legislation is passed, and it takes time for the government to allocate
resources,' said Hill. 'It may not be until two or three years later that
you get opportunities occuring so that private companies can then compete
for those opportunities thrown up by the legislation.'
The cynical may find it too long to wait and there would be no point in
trying to persuade them otherwise, since green funds have not performed
well.
But the arguments for future growth are both logical and persuasive. They
have convinced Citibank which says green companies are becoming profitable.
It thinks the time is right to launch a green fund and is launching an
insurance fund which will be managed by Jupiter Tyndall Merlin and is
offering a pre-launch bonus allocation from June 1 to June 12 to coincide
with the Earth Summit.
This may be the time for investors attracted by green funds but worried
about performance, to be less reticent.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: Hard-hit insurers claw their way back - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARES of UK composite insurance companies, so-called because they
underwrite a mixture of general and general life business, are back in
favour among investors after 18 months in the doldrums. Or are they?
Between January 1991 and March 1992, the prices of the five major composites
slid downwards, underperforming the market by some 30 per cent. But in the
four weeks following the general election, they outperformed the FT
All-Share index by more than over 15 per cent, a record second only to the
more politically sensitive water stocks.
No one doubts that insurers, perhaps more than most sectors, have benefited
from a general shift in mood in the post-electoral period, with the rise in
the stock markets shoring up their balance sheets. But opinion in the London
market is divided sharply.
Bulls point to the clear signs that the companies are beginning to stem the
large underwriting losses in the UK which sent the sector spinning into the
red in 1990 and 1991. Premium increases introduced across the board over the
past year or two are now beginning to have an effect on the bottom line as
more and more policies are renewed at prices which are often 50 per cent
higher.
Tom Bennett, an analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, believes rising
profitability will fuel an upward movement in prices. Although there will be
hiccups, the stocks will move upwards with the sharpest rises during the
weeks in which companies report their annual and interim figures.
Stressing the severity of the industry's recent difficulties, and the extent
of the shake-out and withdrawal of capacity, he says: 'The earnings
background is improving and will continue to improve for some considerable
time.'
Companies such as Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange, which have
seen their balance sheets hit worst, have reduced the amount of insurance
they underwrite and are now more selective about the type of business they
undertake. Royal, Commercial Union and General Accident all showed reduced
underwriting losses when they reported first quarter results earlier this
month.
CU, the most successful and best-managed company in the sector, has felt
confident enough to raise capital on the markets. Two weeks ago, it was
successful in placing a Pounds 100m preference share issue, the first
significant capital-raising exercise by any general insurer since the early
1980s.
On the other hand, some analysts are more cautious. Recently John Chester,
of SG Warburg, warned that although the rising stock market would replenish
the asset base and dividend-paying capacity of insurance companies,
'expectations of a massive trading improvement' were 'premature.'
Chester says it is 'probably unwise' that concerns about the housing market
have abated. Housing problems left Royal and Sun Alliance with heavy
underwriting losses as a result of claims on mortgage indemnity policies.
Bears suggest that the decline in the asset bases of the composites over the
past two to three years will undermine significant long-term recovery.
During the 1980s, composite insurers typically traded at a discount to net
asset value, and it is suggested that the recent fall in prices may reflect
a longer-term re-evaluation by the market.
Although linking share prices to asset values is problematic because of
difficulties in calculating the latter (analysts dispute how the asset
values of the life insurance component of the composites should be assessed)
more cautious observers believe that asset values are a more reliable guide
to pricing than the upturn in the upturn in the insurance cycle.
'The stock market has not woken up yet to exactly how much money these
companies have lost,' concluded one bear.

FT  30 MAY 92 / London Markets: Touch wood, we're past the trough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AROUND the corner from the FT's offices in Southwark, a notice-board
outside a reconditioned office block proudly boasts that it is now 25 per
cent let. When a letting rate that would once have been a confession of
failure is touted as a sign of success, you do not have to take the river
bus to Docklands to realise just how grim is the outlook for London's
property market.
Curiously, the property crash appears to have had little wider impact on UK
financial markets. When the administrators moved into Canary Wharf on
Thursday, for example, the effect on shares was negligible: the FT-SE index
closed down only 4.4 points. The impact on the banks has also been
surprisingly muted. Since the property market peaked in late 1989, property
shares have halved against the All-Share, but bank shares have risen nearly
a tenth in relative terms.
Along the way, there seems to have been no great correlation between the two
indices: downward lurches in property shares have left the banks unaffected.
On the whole, their shares have moved pretty much in line with the market as
a whole, reflecting the view, presumably, that the performance of the banks'
loan books depends on the overall health of the economy, rather than any
individual sector.
The worst damage to the banks' balance sheets has been done by the thousands
of small business bankruptcies, particularly in the service sector. In such
cases, there is often little in the way of assets to back up a loan, and
hence little prospect of getting much of the money back. From this point of
view, the most significant economic news of the past week - as reported by
one big bank finance director yesterday  - is that loan problems among his
small business customers seem to have bottomed out in the first quarter.
Treat that view with caution, because that is the way it was offered:
indeed, the director concerned clutched the wall as soon as the words had
left his mouth, in an effort to touch any piece of wood within reach. Still,
his comments can be added to the increasing evidence that a slow, faltering
recovery began for much of the economy towards the end of the first quarter.
The latest macro-economic support for that view came in the trade figures,
out on Tuesday, which showed a sharp pickup in imports. SG Warburg's
economists, mulling over the surprising way in which imports have been
rising while the economy has continued weak, offer as one explanation the
possibility of an unexpectedly large rebound in output in the current
quarter, now two-thirds completed.
Simultaneously, however, they revised their forecast of gdp growth for the
year down again, to growth of 0.2 per cent. That implies that the consensus
forecast of 0.8 per cent growth this year, given in an FT survey of City and
academic forecasters published on Thursday, may already need downward
revision.
The two sides of the new market consensus on the recovery - that it has
probably already started, but that it will be hard to distinguish with the
naked eye from the recession that preceded it - probably account for the
continued retreat of share prices from their mid-May peak. Since May 11,
when it reached a new record of 1326.36, the FT-Actuaries All-Share index
has dropped 1.1 per cent, closing yesterday at 1311.79. The chart alongside
show some of the ingredients of the surge that followed the election and the
subsequent correction.
The most striking bar on the chart shows the water companies' shares: they
have risen by slightly under a third since the election, easing off a trifle
since the market peaked. Other sectors where there was a particularly marked
contrast between performance in the market's two most recent legs are also
shown on the chart. Conglomerates, for example, has dropped so much in the
past few weeks - 6 per cent - that they have almost wiped out their
immediate post-election gains. Health and Household, dominated by the big
pharmaceutical stocks, has actually fallen since the election, dragged down
by a 3 per cent fall since May 11. This represents a slightly unpromising
environment for the big Wellcome share sale, for which a first prospectus (a
'pink herring' rather than a red herring, in investment-banker's jargon)
will be published next Thursday.
Two sectors where performance in the past couple of weeks has bucked the
general downward trend include Electricals, up nearly 4 per cent since May
11, and Oil and Gas, up 6 per cent. The oil shares have done particularly
well since the unexpected success of the Opec countries in reaching
agreement on output at their meeting in Vienna on May 22. North Sea oil
prices reached Dollars 20.45 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest price since
December.
Analysts wondered whether the Opec agreement represented a fundamental shift
in Saudi oil policy, towards the price hawks and away from its traditional
preference for volume rather than price. As usual, Saudi Arabia's motives
could be interpreted in any number of ways. Since early April, when the oil
shares began their run, Shell have risen 18 per cent, and BP 12 per cent.
An account of the week would not be complete without a note of one of its
less-spectacular insolvencies. Belling and Co, the privately owned cooker
manufacturer, passed into receivership on Friday. The sad event is more than
just the triumph of the microwave; in its hey-day, the company sent out Baby
Bellings in their thousands to the bedsits of Britain. For a generation of
greying veterans of the 1960s, another part of youth has slipped away. And
who's got my copy of How to Cheat at Cooking?

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - New trust from Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Investment Managers has launched a new investment trust savings
scheme linked into four trusts: First Spanish; German; German Smaller
Companies; and Lloyds Smaller Companies. Monthly savings start from a
minimum of Pounds 50 and lump sums from Pounds 500 on initial purchase
(Pounds 250 subsequently). There will be a transaction charge of 0.2 per
cent on all purchases, and a Pounds 10 selling fee.
Meanwhile, Save &amp; Prosper is launching a new unit trust on June 13 which
will invest in a selection of 20 blue-chip shares. Capital Portfolio
requires a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000. The initial charge is 5.5 per
cent with an annual management fee of 1.25 per cent. There is a 1 per cent
discount on the offer price of units from June 13 to July 3 and the trust
can be held in a Pep at no additional cost.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - N&amp;P launches Tessa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial launched a new guaranteed Tessa this week. The
interest rate of 9.7 per cent gross is fixed over the full five year period.
Savers in the guaranteed Tessa will have to commit Pounds 8,200 upfront,
Pounds 3,000 of which will be put straight into the Tessa. The remainder
will go into a feeder account, paying the same rate of interest and will top
up the Tessa to its maximum at the beginning of each year. Transfer or
closure in the first year will incur six months loss of interest.
N&amp;P says that an investment of Pounds 8,200 in its guaranteed Tessa will be
worth Pounds 12,493 after five years, compared with Pounds 11,479 for the
same amount in a National Savings Capital Bond. The Capital Bond, paying a
fixed rate of 10.75 per cent on its series D issue if held for five years,
is taxable.

Brazil's stock market has recently been soaring. Then, on Monday, it fell
7.4 per cent during the morning session, in reaction to the feud between
President Ferdinand Collor De Mello and his younger brother Pedro over
alleged drug abuse. The markets then cooled somewhat as the president denied
the charges. UK investors have still shown great interest in the Brazilian
market recently: for example, Latin American Securities' Dollars 62.5m
Brazilian investment trusts began dealing on May 12.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Property shares hit by 'Canary
factor'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
People living in London who want to know the reason for the property
sector's awful performance need not look far. Canary Wharf and its now
infamous tower are not owned by a quoted company, but their troubles this
week inflicted further damage on a sector which has been out of favour for
more than three years. Olympia &amp; York's problems were the most spectacular,
but Mountleigh's decision to call in the receivers also knocked shares
elsewhere in the sector.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: A takeover line that hasn't found favour - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUESTION: how much is your house worth? Answer: What someone is prepared
to pay for it.
This economic saw has long been used to illustrate the laws of supply and
demand in the real-world market place, and the limited use of fancy,
theoretical valuations to determine what something will fetch. But it had
some very contemporary relevance for Wall Street this week, in a case which
rings another warning bell over the elevated state of the stock market.
On Wednesday night many of America's finest brokers' analysts, as well as
some prominent institutional investors, went into apoplexies over the sale
of a company at a price far lower than their collective wisdom deemed it
worth.
The property is Centel, a big, Chicago-based local and cellular telephone
company, which agreed to be taken over by Sprint, America's third largest
long-distance carrier, which also has significant local telephone interests.
The deal has a lot of industrial logic, for the US telecommunications
industry is rapidly consolidating, thanks to technical, regulatory and
financial change, as well as international competition. Smaller players,
such as Centel, risk being left behind.
But all this was drowned out in furious condemnation of the deal's terms.
The idea is for Sprint to give Centel's investors 1.37 shares in it for
every Centel share they own. Trouble is, on the basis of Sprint's price at
the time the deal was announced, this values Centel stock at a mere Dollars
33.56. That compares with the Dollars 42.5 at which the shares traded
immediately before the announcement. Some analysts estimate that the company
could be worth more than Dollars 50 a share.
Jack Frazee, the Centel chairman who put the company up for auction, at the
start of this year, said in his defence that he had tried to get a better
price, but this was all Sprint was prepared to offer. While other companies
were interested in buying some bits of Centel, it appears no one else wanted
the lot.
Critics reply that no deal is preferable to one at this level, which they
claim will benefit only Frazee, who stands to be combined group president.
The battle is far from over. Centel needs the approval of more than half its
shareholders for the merger, and they may well block it. Another, higher
bidder could emerge, although the most likely candidate, local telephone
group GTE, is already digesting two other large deals.
It is not particularly easy for analysts to value local US
telecommunications companies, partly because of the changing regulatory
climate, and partly because the cellular telephone part of the business is
immature, but growing rapidly.
Even so, it is extraordinary for a company to be sold at a price so much at
variance with market expectations, which suggests either that Centel's
management is giving the company away, or that the analysts' sums arewrong.
So far, Wall Street plainly believes its own: the prices of other local
phone companies, particularly cellular ones, dropped after Centel's
announcement, but not too sharply.
This is only a storm in a telecommunications tea-cup, but it comes at a time
when some of the more cautious analysts are expressing renewed concern about
the fancy valuation of stocks generally - even as the Dow Jones industrial
average flirts with an unprecedented 3,400.
The price/earnings ratio on the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index stands at more
than 25, high by historic proportions, although the ratio between the
dividend yield on stocks and on 30-year Treasury bonds remains much more
normal.
The bull market is predicated on the assumption that the US economy is
picking up steam. This week brought further evidence, in the form of strong
figures for car sales and consumer confidence.
Yet there are straws in the wind to suggest a market correction, or at least
a marking of time, may be at hand. One is a spate of cancelled offerings of
shares - albeit many of them in the troubled bio-technology sector - and the
apparent acceleration of other flotations in case investors' appetites
weaken.
Bull market corrections sometimes occur when the interest rate cycle turns
from easier money to tighter conditions, and leaks from the Federal Reserve
suggest it has put on hold, at least for now, its former 'bias towards
easing.'
Couple that with growing Presidential election uncertainty, and there could
be a considerable twinge of doubt about the real worth of the desirable
property known as corporate America.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: Chancellor hits the jackpot on Peps - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORMAN Lamont has not had an easy time of it during his 18 months as
chancellor of the exchequer. But this week, at least, he can reflect that he
did something right.
Reduce unemployment? No sign of that. Defeat inflation? Not yet. His
crowning achievement was to increase the limit on unit and investment trust
personal equity plans.
Now, this might not strike you as a matter for public rejoicing. But in the
last three weeks of April, around 230,000 people opened a unit trust Pep.
What spurred this enthusiasm? It cannot have been the mouth-watering returns
enjoyed by recent unitholders. An investor who bought the average UK growth
fund in May 1987 will have seen a return of just 16.9 per cent; those who
took the plunge in May 1989 will have made a measly 4.5 per cent.
One might think that such failings would have led to a rationalisation of
the industry and a leaner, more competitive business. Not a bit. There are
more funds than ever and annual management fees have tended to drift up from
1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Indeed, performance over the past five years has
got worse while charges have increased. Anyone would think unit trusts were
a public utility.
It could simply be the tax breaks that spurred the April rush. But have
investors considered this factor carefully? For most, the capital gains tax
exemption in a Pep is academic. As for income tax, the yield on a typical UK
unit trust is probably 4 per cent. So, a basic rate taxpayer would have to
pay a quarter of that in tax, or 1 per cent. On the maximum Pounds 6,000
investment, the tax saving is thus Pounds 60 a year. Useful, but hardly
enough to start a stampede.
Why, having said all this, was the rule change still the right thing for
Norman Lamont to do? For a start, the previous Pep regulations were a dog's
breakfast. The government was convinced that investors had to experience
'real capitalism' - in other words, the ownership of individual shares.
Collective funds do not offer the same direct link to company fortunes.
The result of the rules was, however, a two-tier system. Rich investors
transferred their existing holdings into a Pep so they could build up a
substantial tax-free portfolio over time. Good news for them, but of limited
use in the cause of wider share ownership.
Everyone else was stuck with managed Peps where the charges often outweighed
the tax breaks and the holdings were too small to permit proper
diversification. Add the effect of sluggish stock markets over the past few
years and it is small wonder that so many Pep investors have been
dissatisfied.
That there was ample demand for a full Pounds 6,000 collective fund Pep was
demonstrated by a loophole in the rules. Investment trust new issues
qualified for the full allowance, and a host of launches in 1991-92 appealed
successfully to the Pep investor: M&amp;G alone raised Pounds 376m.
Investment trusts have much to offer the private investor, but there will
always be some who prefer unit trusts. The open-ended nature of unit trusts
means that investors can always sell at asset value; investment trust
shareholders (and especially those who bought in a new issue) must worry
that the shares will move to a discount.
In addition, the borrowing powers of investment trusts may enhance investor
returns in bull markets but can lead to serious problems in recessions, as
can the unquoted elements of some trust portfolios. Ask the investors in
Ensign or Drayton Consolidated.
To be fair to the unit trust industry, some managers are showing signs of
altering the charging structure. Murray Johnstone has slashed the initial
charge to 1 per cent on its range of funds while Gartmore has abolished the
charge altogether on its UK Index fund.
Others would follow suit if private investors showed some initiative. At the
moment, groups have very little success in selling trusts directly; most are
sold through independent financial advisers and salesmen, many of whom
pocket the 3 per cent commission that makes up the bulk of the initial
charge.
If investors did their own research in the unit trust field (via the
specialist publications which print detailed performance figures, and by
ordering managers' reports), or if they sought out a fee-based adviser, that
would enable more trusts to reduce their charges. But charges are a
secondary issue to performance. Unit trusts need desperately to make their
investors some money.
History certainly suggests that the past five years of poor performance has
been an aberration. Statistics can be used to prove anything; according to
the Unit Trust Association, someone who invested Pounds 500 a month in a
unit trust Pep for the past 25 years would now have over Pounds 1.7m. That
sounds good - except that the number of people able to invest Pounds 500 a
month 25 years ago could probably have been assembled in a garden shed.
Nevertheless, it seems likely that, come May 1997, most of those investors
who have bought unit trust Peps recently will feel satisfied. The UK market
might look a touch overvalued at the moment, but using a savings scheme
avoids the difficulty of investing at the top of the market. And it will
help Norman to feel he has achieved something.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The Long View: Going for the jugular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHENEVER I meet Fringe Freddie, I know I am going to start worrying. It's
catching. Either he is getting ready for the biggest boom ever known, or the
biggest crash. A quiet life never comes into it. Right now, he is in one of
his apocalyptic phases.
I occasionally run into Freddie at slightly offbeat investment seminars.
These are, I must emphasise, perfectly respectable occasions - nothing at
all like those international gatherings in places like Monte Carlo or
Acapulco where every weird investment prophet and nutty newsletter editor in
the world is gathered. They rant at geriatric American investors who can be
persuaded to pay Dollars 5,000 to enjoy two days of skilful manipulation of
their only remaining emotions of greed and fear - in between naps, of
course. Freddie is in his element in those places. But he can once in a
while come in from the fringe.
The previous time I bumped into Freddie, he was heavily into global weather
patterns. El Nino was developing again in the South Pacific. I gathered it
was some kind of surface warming effect which kills all the fish off South
America and then spreads drought and famine across large areas of the globe.
Freddie's eyes lit up at the thought. He was going heavily long of
agricultural commodities on the Chicago markets. Potatoes would be like gold
dust.
This week, I dropped into a seemingly harmless seminar on long-term cycles
and was buttonholed by Freddie again at coffee time. El Nino? He seemed to
have lost interest in Pacific sea temperatures. Evidently, those futures
contracts had drifted out of the money. Now he was into NT, which he
patiently explained was Nostradamus Theory. Did I know that a new team of
Nostradamus analysts had finally cracked the mystery of the old mystic's
code? Future disasters were being set out on an accurate timetable so that
those investors in the know could take maximum advantage.
I said I was a bit hazy about Nostradamus, although I was aware that the
International Harry Shultz Letter had confessed to an error in its last
issue. Apparently, the catastrophic Californian earthquake it had forecast
on an interpretation of Nostradamus for May 8 1992 was wrong; it should have
said May 8 1993. San Diego would still slide into the sea, but a year late.
You had better not go to Disneyland about that time, either.
Possibly Freddie twigged that I was not taking him entirely seriously, but
he pressed on. Did I not realise that the US economy was twice as
debt-ridden as it had ever been? Was I not aware that the Japanese financial
system was already technically insolvent, and that there were exact
parallels between the Wall Street slide and subsequent American slump from
1929 onwards and the Toyko market slide beginning in 1990? Had I not noticed
that Germany . . .
Look, I said, I knew some of the numbers didn't look too good, but the
global economy was still growing and over the years I had read more than my
fair ration of books by gloom and doom merchants. As far back as 1984, the
Kondratieff Wave theorists had been forecasting an imminent slump. In fact,
the world stayed in a long boom. Then there was Ravi Batra, who made a
fortune out of The Great Depression of 1990. However, there was no
depression in 1990, just a recession in 1991, while Wall Street in 1992 is
hitting all-time highs. Britain's own Lord Rees-Mogg, taking time out from
cleaning up television, had got in on the act with a co-authored financial
spinechiller called Blood in the Streets and, when that proved premature,
managed to get out a sequel called The Great Reckoning earlier this year. It
had all been good for royalty receipts but not for credibility.
Freddie was distinctly unimpressed. Hadn't I seen what was happening to
property values worldwide? Or the 60 per cent collapse of what had been the
world's biggest stock market in Tokyo? Or the dreadful economic slump in
eastern Europe? What was happening in western stock markets was just the
last gasp of the old order.
What I had missed, he said, becoming more excitable by the minute, was the
importance of the combination of the 54-year Kondratieff Wave with the
seven- to 11-year Juglar cycle, not to mention the intermediary Kuznets
cycle. After all, the Kondratieff could last as long as 60 years: what did
1932 plus 60 add up to? Put all the cycles together and you could have a
triple whammy for the early 1990s.
This was all getting beyond me, although I murmured that I remembered that
Batra had discussed something called the Jugular Cycle in his book. Either
his spelling was wrong or he was talking about blood in the streets, too. I
wished Freddie had stuck to his Peruvian fish famine.
I should never have got back to the weather. Global warming, apparently, was
the latest theme to arise from NT Why, Nostradamus himself had warned that a
great tide would arise in a second Great Flood and the hot wind would blow
as from hell itself. The date? Well, the interpreters hadn't quite decided
yet, but it wouldn't be very long.
We should be selling all energy stocks on the grounds that governments would
soon be doubling gasoline taxes and banning emissions. Commodity markets
would be transformed as food crops were devastated. By now the gleam was
really back in his eyes. The long-term punter should be buying land at least
10 metres above existing sea level, waiting for values to soar as millions
were driven out of beachside settlements by the advancing waters. Except in
California, of course, which was all going to slide into a geological fault
. . .
I made an excuse and left. The Freddie Cycle was clearly testing its low
point. But, in my experience, it never stays down for long.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The cancer eating at Russia's heartland: At Chelyabinsk, in
the Urals, Stalin and the communists created an industrial nightmare. They
built their first nuclear bomb there - and they left a legacy of pure poison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY

<TEXT>
WHEN the plane landed and switched off its engines, the passengers remained
seated and silent. No one rushed to the exit doors. No one dared to
challenge the formidable hostess who kept order on the Aeroflot flight to
Chelyabinsk, a sprawling, grim industrial city in the Urals which Stalin
helped turn into a giant factory producing tanks  - and the first nuclear
bomb.
Then, one by one, we descended quietly into the cold but bright daylight.
Immediately, we smelt the foul, polluted air. A couple of yelping mongrel
dogs raced across the runway to greet us as we walked into the dilapidated
terminal building. The local hospital was in no better shape.
By the standards of others in the region, and in Moscow, District Hospital
No. 1, near the centre of Chelyabinsk, was close to luxury. It was warm but
the lifts were not working. The corridors were clean but the cardiographic
machinery had broken down. 'We need new equipment if we are to save our
patients,' said Vladislav Zakharov, a heart surgeon. He and his colleagues
are paid about 1,000 roubles (Pounds 5) a month.
A dozen pairs of disposable surgical gloves were drying on a window sill.
The hospital has no money to replace them. The supply system, controlled in
the past by the central authorities, had broken down completely. 'We wash
the gloves out after every operation,' said Zakharov.
The parents of tiny Susha Sineya were not worried about re-used surgical
gloves. Their daughter, just six months old, had undergone a successful
heart operation. 'A vessel was worn out,' Zakharov explained. Her parents
live in Orsk, a military and industrial city in the south of the Urals.
'The air is bad in Orsk,' said Piotr Sineya, the father, who is a taxi
driver. 'I suffer from headaches. But, otherwise, we are both healthy. When
we take Susha home, though, we will face more problems. There is no baby
food and no fresh milk. There are no guarantees that she will not fall ill
again. There are no guarantees that the pollution will decrease.'
In a nearby bed lay Jenni Chernyshova, a very small four-year-old who also
had a heart operation. Her parents live in Orsk, too. Her father works at a
military factory. Her mother suffers constantly from headaches. 'Each year,
I carry out between 100 and 300 heart operations on people from Orsk,' said
Zakharov.
Chelyabinsk, like several other industrial centres in the Urals, was
earmarked by Stalin late in the 1920s to produce weapons. Large factories,
surrounded by walls and security watchtowers, were built. People could leave
Chelyabinsk but few were allowed to visit this closed city of 1.5m people
until it was opened to outsiders in 1990.
The first reactor to refine plutonium was made at Chelyabinsk. 'This was in
1949,' said Alexei Kaunov, chairman of the regional authority's economic
council. But in the rush to turn the Soviet Union into a giant super-power,
safety standards were neglected. 'Stalin was in a hurry to get there first -
he wanted to compete with the United States. The US was already ahead of us
by about five years. They (the US) had the money.
'The authorities dumped nuclear waste into the rivers,' Kaunov added; that
turned the nearby Techa river into a dead waterway. Over the years, he
continued, 1.5bn curies (the quantity of radioactive substance that
undergoes radioactive transformation) of plutonium had been stored, or
dumped, in the region.
Kaunov went on: 'In 1957, I was a 16-year-old geology student. I had been on
a field trip. They had stored some of the plutonium in containers. One of
the containers blew up. I saw the lights in the sky. For 30 years, nobody
could speak about the accident. But everybody knew about it. Over 1,000
people had been exposed to radiation. That's why there are so many heart
problems in this city.
'I remember another time. It was in 1964. Plutonium had been dumped in the
Karachia lake, north of the city. It was sometime in July. That summer was
very, very hot. The lake dried up. We could see the dust and the waste in
the lake. They put concrete in the lake to cover up the waste. There are
many other such incidents. Now, we have to try to dismantle our nuclear
strategic weapons. What will we do with the waste?' That, Kaunov added, was
still being dumped in Chelyabinsk.
The regional authority is still run by the former communist nomenklatura -
grey, elderly men who cling on doggedly to power and who, in a lengthy
discussion about previous Communist party policy in Chelyabinsk, conveyed no
sense of shame about what had happened in the past.
'I was not in power at the time,' said Piotr Necharev, head of the city
council.'
'But you were on the central committee for years. Surely you knew what was
happening, and how radioactive fall-out affected the health of the
population. Did you never think of resigning?
Necharev replied: 'I was first secretary of the city council during
perestroika. I was not head of the party. Now, we will adopt more humane
policies.' Colleague Vladimir Bagrinovtsev, a senior party member who
himself had heart surgery two years ago, nodded in silent agreement.
There is little sense of life along the highway north of Chelyabinsk.
Swathes of tall, lean, coniferous trees are dead while the spring, late in
coming, meant there was little fresh greenery to offset the dark, bleak
terrain of the Urals' landscape. We turned off the main road, passed a
poultry factory and headed down a mud track towards the village of Argayash.
The air was cold and damp. Our eyes were sore. 'The steel mills have wrecked
the air,' said Alexander, the driver.
Faya, the 30-year-old manager of the local state-owned grocery store (which
resembles an old, run-down dairy) said business was bad. The white, tiled
walls were grey with age and neglect. Old pieces of cardboard were strewn
across the stone floor to soak up the muddy boots of her few customers. The
iron shelves were empty except for some tins of fish, preservatives, and
bags of seeds.
'It was bad enough in the past, but at least we got a certain amount of
supplies from the central warehouses,' said Faya. 'But now, with all the
changes, the central supply system has broken down. We have to arrange our
own transport to go into town and buy goods for the shop from certain
warehouses. There is a shortage of petrol. Everything is very expensive.'
Next door, Valentina, 43, was running the local state-owned remont shop,
which carries out repairs and adjustments on clothes and shoes. The workshop
was warm. Two other middle-aged women were using sewing machines which
pre-dated the second world war. Valentina, a softly-spoken, melancholic
woman, said: 'We are short of all sorts of things - thread, needles.
Supplies are very irregular. During the old days of stagnation, at least
supplies were stable.'
Why did she and her colleagues not buy out the business? 'Even if we wanted
to, we have no money. All our savings have been exhausted.' Despite this,
she had few regrets about the collapse of the communist system although she
stressed that she wanted the post-communist reforms to have some positive
impact on the environment. She said the pollution and the radioactive
fall-out of the 1950s probably were the reason she could not have children.
'I had an operation a few years ago - for cancer. The doctors said I could
never have children. I still suffer from headaches and high blood pressure.
You cannot even get fresh water around here. We boil it all the time.' She
wiped away her tears.
Dr Grigory Nikonov is director of a sanatorium, located in woodland about 20
kilometres from Chelyabinsk. 'Workers came here to convalesce,' he said. 'I
remember some people from Chernobyl who were sent here.' He explained
further: 'Those people who were treated here did not live around the
Chernobyl plant. You know, they were sent from here - after the accident -
to help with the clean-up. They were never asked. They were given no choice.
We treated about 10 of those people here. They had clear signs of radiation
 -baldness, headaches, weakness, digestive problems.'
The small, clean sanatorium was built in 1927. 'It was needed even then. The
air was already bad.' Nikonov said the wind sometimes blew a dry, dirty dust
from the steel mills in the direction of the sanatorium. 'But even if the
air had not been so awful, the workers would have been sent here in order to
build up their strength. They lack nutrition. Their diets are terrible.' So
far, the sanatorium has not had cut-backs, but Nikonov is not optimistic. 'I
do not think the state, or the enterprises in the region which in the past
subsidised us, will continue to do it in the future.'
The same fear of fewer resources applies to the orphanage, which is only a
short walk from the sanatorium. There, Boris Chernov, the manager, looks
after 150 children. A third are from socially-deprived families, a third
have been abandoned by their parents, and the others are there for health
reasons. The children, aged between 11 and 17, were dressed in clean, navy
uniforms. The day we visited the orphanage, some were planting flowers and
seeds, others were playing in the corridors. They laughed excitedly when
they heard a foreign visitor had arrived.
'Financing and obtaining supplies are the two most pressing problems we face
today,' said Chernov, who has been director of the orphanage for two years.
'We are already beginning to lack the essentials - not only chairs and
laundry but nutrition for the children, which they desperately need. I have
no idea what will happen.'
Back in Chelyabinsk, the reforms had failed to dislodge the babuska - those
awesome, vigilant women who preside over each hotel floor. Ours asked for
our hotel pass before she gave us our keys. A stocky, no-nonsense lady who,
over the decades, clearly had been fed on a diet of starch, she could not
explain why the bedrooms had no hot water, why cockroaches infested the
bathroom, and why you could not get tea in the mornings. But, when asked,
she promptly ordered a taxi to take us to the airport at 4 am the next day.
Even at that hour, it was was pandemonium. Hundreds of people were milling
around, waiting to buy non-existent tickets to Moscow - still seen as
Russia's Mecca. The air was thick with the smells of dogs, stale vodka and
sweat.
Nor had the reforms managed to get rid of the special waiting room for
foreigners - a world of incredible comfort far removed from the din, grime,
and chaos of the rest of the terminal. It was certainly welcome - but also a
place designed to give the unsuspecting foreigner a false sense of reality.
We were ferried to the 'plane by special bus. Then, those hapless citizens
of Chelyabinsk who had been lucky enough to secure tickets rushed across the
runway and scampered aboard. When all the seats were filled, those without
them (seat allocations are fictional on internal flights) stood near the
main exit door, drinking beer and clinging on as the aircraft rose over the
smoke-shrouded city and headed westwards.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After enjoying a certain rehabilitation in world bond markets, South Africa
is turning its attention to international equities too. The forthcoming
Dollars 250m issue by Sappi, the paper concern, in theory offers an
opportunity to capitalise on South Africa's low-cost base as well as the
expected upturn in this sector.
That said, Sappi needs another two or three years to digest its recent
purchase of Germany's Hannover Papier. The political risk attached to South
Africa remains considerable. If its prospects are really that good, such a
low-geared company might be better off adding to its debt at this stage in
the cycle.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Forte/Compass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, it seems curious that Forte should be selling a contract
catering business which has stood it in good stead through the recession. It
is a low margin operation, however, and one which requires capital spending,
especially on the in-flight catering side. The negotiations centre on a
price of more than Pounds 500m which means that the sale will be scarcely
dilutive and will free resources for Forte to expand into European hotels.
If its share price barely responded to yesterday's announcement, it is
partly because the move has been strongly rumoured for some time. Besides,
Forte's European hotel plans are still vague. The recession exposed the
weakness inherent in the UK concentration of its hotel business which is in
stark contrast to Queens Moat. Whether Forte can successfully hedge itself
against the next UK recession depends on exactly what it manages to buy in
Europe and at what price.
Compass is expected to pay some Pounds 450m for the part of the catering
division it is buying. That is a large morsel which will require a hefty
rights issue as well as an increase in debt that will leave it once again
with negative net worth. The Forte division may represent a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and Compass can almost certainly squeeze out
some extra margin. But the need for continuing capital spend leaves the
price looking somewhat ambitious.

FT  30 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the week of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf perhaps nothing can be taken for
granted. But if a 5p rise in Eurotunnel shares was the understandable
reaction to last night's confirmation that the banks have granted a waiver,
the fundamentals for shareholders have barely changed. Eurotunnel calculates
that the unspecified sum released by the lenders will be spent come
August/September, at which point the uncertainty begins again. Its breach of
covenant may be passed off as technical - relating as it does to the margin
by which projected cash flows will cover debt repayments to the year 2012 -
but the banks nevertheless have the whip hand if negotiations with the
contractors do not proceed according to their taste.
In this respect Eurotunnel's apparently unilateral decision to make another
one-off payment of Pounds 50m to TML could be seen as conciliatory. The
trouble for investors, however, is distinguishing bluff from double bluff.
One theory has it that Eurotunnel is not really interested in a quick
settlement with the contractors and hopes that the current arbitration
procedure can be prolonged until the tunnel opening is much closer. That way
the company would have a much clearer idea of costs, and could dangle an
almost visible income stream alongside the much feared rights issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mooted Dollars 2.8bn merger of Centel, a US cellular telephone company,
and Sprint, a long-distance operator, raises important questions for the
world telecommunications industry, and for the UK market in particular. On
the face of it, Sprint stands to merge at a valuation significantly below
the market's assumed worth of Centel - hence the 25 per cent drop in the
latter's share price when the deal was announced this week. The chief
implication is that equity markets have been seduced by the cellular
operators into seeing their subscribers as intrinsically more valuable than
those of fixed-line operators. While there was an evident shortage of
capacity, cellular licences probably were worth a premium. Arguably, that is
no longer the case.
The UK market provides a telling example. On a rough calculation, Vodafone's
Pounds 3.8bn market capitalisation values each of its subscribers at more
than Pounds 5,000. By contrast, BT's fixed-line customers are worth a mere
Pounds 850 apiece. Logic suggests that the recent proliferation of ways to
access a dialling tone - from cable television to PCN - will cause
convergence of prices and, ultimately, market valuations.
Thanks in part to regulation, it will increase significantly. But Vodafone's
60 per cent return on capital was never likely to survive increasing
competition. The implications for the company's shares are obvious, not
least that the risk of hostile takeover is greatly diminished. After all, if
the above thesis is correct, its Pounds 3.8bn market worth would be much
better spent starting a new company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Post-election euphoria in the UK seems to be wearing off. Investors may be
in no mood to sell equities, but it is hard to see just what will provide
the foundation for a new leg to the current bull market. A fresh cut in UK
interest rates appears to be off the agenda for the moment, and as cautious
statements from the likes of Guinness, Reckitt and Coleman, and Thorn EMI
underlined this week signs of economic recovery are depressingly few and far
between.
Another reason for caution, indeed, is the fact that year on year dividend
growth achieved by companies in the All Share Index has dropped below 2 per
cent, rather less than expectations just a few months ago. Current forecasts
for 1992 earnings growth are almost certainly pinning too much on a
second-half recovery, something which could well be confirmed in the next
few weeks before companies go into purdah ahead of the September reporting
season. The downside to shares looks limited at current levels - but it may
be that US earners and defensive stocks like utilities will swing
temporarily back into fashion.

FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo back in favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-PROFILE health stocks were strong in reaction to overnight gains in the
US, where the Dow closed at a record high, and on reassesment by a number of
UK analysts.
In New York, on Thursday night, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham American
Depositary Receipts were both significantly higher. Yesterday, in London,
Glaxo rose 19 to 778p while SmithKline gained 18 to 918p in the shares and
110 to 4138p in the Units.
US house Salomon Brothers was an aggressive buyer of both telling clients
that they had underperformed heavily against the market and arguing that
Glaxo, particularly, had been left by the wayside. Also, Hoare Govett turned
positive on the sector and put SmithKline back on its selective buy list. Mr
James Culverwell, one of Hoare's pharmaceutical experts said; 'SmithKline is
cheaper and we know the new products are doing well while, with Glaxo the
jury is still out.' SmithKline was further helped by news that it had agreed
a swap which will give it full control of its Italian consumer brands
business, Beecham Italia.
Builders fall
The construction and building materials sectors were hit by a warning note
from County NatWest, suggesting that 1992 profits could prove disappointing.
The profits in construction are deteriorating rapidly, according to County,
because of the 'awful prices' at which work has been won in the downturn.
Costain lost 3 to 68p, despite the fact that it is generating profits in the
materials area, thanks to a good Australian coal operation and cost cutting
in US coal production. This is being offset by the depressed property
sector, and housing where there has been no upsurge in sales.
County also warned of a possible dividend cut from Pilkington, which slipped
7 to 147p. Public sector building is unlikely to provide stimulation,
because of the already large public sector borrowing requirement, while
private demand may show a slow recovery in the second half of the year. Blue
Circle lost 9 to 244p and RMC was down 6 at 629p.
ADT volatile
Business services group ADT tumbled in early trading as nerves became frayed
ahead of the release of the company's first-quarter profits.
At the day's worst, the shares were down by about 17 per cent. Dealers
interpreted the planned late afternoon announcement (timed to coincide with
the simultaneous release of results in the US) as indicating problems with
the figures. However, the stock is very tightly held and there was also a
suggestion that an early morning seller of just 2,000 shares had triggered
the fall.
The slide led the company to bring the announcement of the figures forward
by about an hour. The fears then proved unfounded and profits came in ahead
of expectations. The shares responded and eventually closed 3 ahead at 438p.
Mr Jeffrey Kessler at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a relatively
satisfactory report though not as good from the two core operations of
security and car auctions.'
Turnover in Racal Electronics rose to 22m, making it the most heavily traded
stock of the day, as dealers squared their books ahead of the demerger of
the Chubb subsidiary expected to be announced next month. There was also a
suggestion that part of the day's turnover was caused by the placing of the
recent stock overhang. The shares firmed 1 1/2 to 61 1/2 p, with one UK
broker said to have given the shares a strong push.
Barclays Bank shares were firmer as the bears closed out their positions on
the last day of the account. There was also some support from speculation
that Hong Kong magnate Li Ka-Shing would bail out Olympia &amp; Yorks's Canary
Wharf, to which Barclays is heavily exposed.
However, one analyst described the rumour as 'very low grade.' Barclays
shares closed 5 up at 374p.
Midland was 8 firmer at 417p as interested party HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation reminded shareholders that its offer could be worth as much as
449p in the light of the current HSBC share price.
Consideration of an encouraging property deal in Hong Kong helped Standard
Chartered which has fallen sharply over the past week and which is seen as
sensitive to the Hong Kong property market. Standard has been affected by
problems on the Indian Stock Exchange to which it is heavily exposed. The
shares recovered 13 to 495p.
Internationally-traded Reuters Holdings lifted 14 to 1189 on the back of a
strong Wall Street.
The world's biggest mining company, RTZ, dipped 14 to 626p after negative
noises from one securities house.
Bid speculation boosted Ranks Hovis McDougall, rising 8 to 234p, on strong
turnover of 1.9m shares. Dalgety, up 2 to 424p and Hillsdown, gaining 5 to
179p, were mentioned as possible predators.
Supermarket group Tesco improved 3 to 276p, as chairman Mr Ian Maclaurin
told the annual meeting there were signs the recession is coming to an end
and the group was well placed to gain from an upturn. J. Sainsbury also
responded to hopes of economic recovery, climbing 9 to 474p.
APV firmed 2 1/2 to 133 1/2 p on talk that company would soon announce a new
chief executive.
Compass Group was suspended at 489p, as it announced that, with US group
ARA, it was in discussions with Forte, unchanged at 239p, about acquiring
Forte's contract catering business.
Smiths Industries retreated 12 to 315p, after several brokers cut profit
expectations for the current and following year. The company, which recently
completed a series of presentations to investors, is said to have indicated
it is experiencing a slowing of defence orders due to the US presidential
elections. UBS Philips &amp; Drew, the company's broker was reported to have
reduced its profits forecast for the 1992/93 period by Pounds 13m to Pounds
100m.
Stores group Kingfisher lost 11 to 559p, on hefty turnover of 2.9m shares,
as its B&amp;Q subsidiary offered price cuts in the highly competitive DIY area.
DIY discounting was behind a profits downgrade for Kingfisher from BZW,
which also hit the shares.
Storehouse gained 5 to 142p, as 2.7m shares changed hands. Credit Lyonnais
Laing was reported to be a big buyer, on expectations that the appointment
of Mr David Dworkin, head of its BHS unit, as Storehouse chairman and chief
executive could lead to disposals within the group. Mr Tony Shiret, analyst
at Laing, also said that profit estimates are probably too low. The agency
stockbroker expects Pounds 40m to March 1993 and Pounds 60m for the next
year, compared with Pounds 15.8m previously.
Blue-chip media stocks Pearson and Reed International saw some recovery
after a weak period. Reed continued to see support from an improved
recommendation by County NatWest. Pearson lifted 5 to 865p and Reed was 9
better at 569p.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Quota
plan halts coffee price slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCERS did just enough at their meeting in London this week to
halt the latest slide in world prices. But the market's response to their
plan for export curbs, announced yesterday lunch-time, was far from
euphoric. The July position at the London Futures and Options Exchange
recovered from a morning low of Dollars 715 a tonne to end at Dollars 728 a
tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day and down Dollars 4 on the week.
The producer delegates, meeting under the auspices of the International
Coffee Organisation, were painfully aware that failure to agree a unified
stance to take to the first round of negotiations of a new International
Coffee Agreement on June 22-26 was likely to unleash a fresh wave of
speculative selling that might send prices back to the 22-year lows reached
three weeks ago. So it is perhaps understandable that discussion of details
was not allowed to obstruct the search for consensus at this week's talks.
The resulting proposals envisage a global export quota of about 62m bags (60
kg each), some 10m bags below annual demand, incorporating selectivity
between different types of coffee and shared out between producing countries
on the basis of export performance in the free market that has operated
since the collapse of the previous ICO quota scheme in July 1989.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, decribed
these proposals as 'deliberately vague'. But he said it was apparent that
the producers were in 'a very positive mood' and were aware of the need to
put a transitional accord into operation as soon as possible to prevent a
renewed slide in coffee prices.
Some ICO delegates suggested that this 'transitional' arrangement - which
would put the quota system into immediate operation, rather than waiting for
full ratification of a new pact - could be up and running by the end of
September. London traders felt that was rather optimistic, however, in view
of the need for producers to work out operational details of their plan and
sell it to the ICO's consuming country members.
In particular, said Mr Eagles, they would have to satisfy the US, the
biggest consumer, whose willingness to tolerate an agreement that would
compromise its laissez-faire principles is based solely on its eagerness to
support the war against the Colombian drug barons. The American
administration is insisting on quota selectivity between four groups of
coffees: Colombian milds, other milds, Brazilian and other arabicas and
robusta's. The imbalance under the previous non-selective quota system
between supplies of the more sought-after milds and arabicas and the
coarser, mainly African-produced robusta types was one of the reasons for
the collapse of the agreement.
The cocoa market's woes continued meanwhile as talk of producer selling
continued and users remained on the sidelines. A Pounds 4 decline yesterday
took London's July futures quotation to a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds
541 a tonne, adding Pounds 15 to last week's Pounds 23 fall.
At the London Metal Exchange attention remained focussed on the zinc market,
which continued to be distorted by a squeeze on supplies available for
nearby delivery - despite a further rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh
record. Cash zinc ended the week Dollars 72.50 up at Dollars 1,442.50 a
tonne, while the three months delivery position was unchanged at Dollars
1,284.50 a tonne; so the cash premium widened from Dollars 85.50 to Dollars
158.
Aluminium prices suffered from the effects of the dollar's strength until
Thursday, when the three months price appeared to be heading for a test of
the bottom end of the Dollars 1,320-Dollars 1,330 a tonne support band. But
yesterday a weaker dollar allowed light Far East buying to push the price up
Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 1,328.50 a tonne, down Dollars 16.25 on the week. A
1,375-tonne fall in LME aluminium stocks was less than traders had been
predicting and had little market impact.
At the London International Petroleum Exchange dealers enjoyed a livelier
time as North Sea oil prices broke through the Dollars 20 a tonne barrier
for the first time in six months following the unexpected agreement by
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna last
week to roll over its 22.98 barrels a day second-quarter output ceiling. The
July crude oil futures price gained nearly Dollars 1 a tonne when trading
resumed on Tuesday, after the long weekend, and held steady for the rest of
the week.

FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPIRY of the May FT-SE 100 index option took centre stage yesterday in
trading in derivatives, writes Joel kibazo.
The mid-morning expiry of the FT-SE option, which coincided with the end of
the account was the main feature.
Strong selling was noted ahead of the expiry, which led both the cash market
and FT-SE futures lower and generated much of the day's turnover in the
index option.
The FT-SE option traded 13,987 contracts, with the day's options total
reaching a healthy 36,339 contracts. Midland Bank was the most active stock
option, trading 2,284 lots.
Stock index futures were relatively quiet. June traded at a modest premium
to fair value for most of the session and the rolling out of June and into
September was particularly noticeable.
June closed at 2,719, around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium
to cash of about 8. Turnover was 7,640 contracts.

FT  30 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities end week with strong gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SHARE prices were in fine form as the long three-week trading account
drew to a close, with another record breaking performance by Wall Street the
driving force behind the London market.
The FT-SE 100 share index ended comfortably above the 2,700 level, closing a
net 13.4 higher at 2,707.6.
The buoyant showing by Wall Street, said to have reflected expectations that
the Federal Reserve may consider easing its monetary stance, countered a
series of setbacks for London over the week.
These included exceptionally poor trade figures for April, showing the UK's
worst deficit since 1990. Among other bearish developments were
disappointing company statements and news that receivers had been called
into Mountleigh, one of the Britain's biggest property groups. The week's
most devastating news was that Canary Wharf is being put into
administration.
Much of the early trading in was dominated by technical factors, notably the
expiry of the the May FT-SE option. The Footsie future also played a big
part during initial trading when the future moved to a good premium to fair
value.
The Footsie opened strongly, up almost 10 points, on the back of buying
stimulated by Wall Street's record close overnight and a firm performance by
Tokyo. However, early buying quickly ran out of steam and the index dipped
off as index arbitrageurs moved in to sell the underlying stocks.
Thereafter selective buying interest took the Footsie progressively higher
with the firm opening of Wall Street the trigger for a late flourish of
support for UK equities.
One of the features of trading was the continued switching out of cyclical
stocks, such as building materials and engineering, into the safer more
defensive areas of the market, such as the pharmaceuticals and utilities
sectors.
The retailing sector was viewed by many as possibly running ahead of the
growth in consumer spending.
Cadbury-Schweppes and Allied Lyons were busy as the market began to focus on
news that the proposed buy-back of stock by Philip Morris, the US tobacco
group, sharply reduced the chances of it bidding for either company.
The best performance among the Footsie constituents came from Arjo Wiggins,
said to have been oversold in recent weeks, while Pilkington took the wooden
spoon as the worst performer, followed by Blue Circle.
Customer, or retail business, picked up after a poor start to the week,
stimulated by a large programme trade and a share placing.

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest commercial bank, has
reported a loss of FM526.6m (Dollars 118.9m) for the first quarter of the
year. It follows a deficit of FM1.64bn for 1991 and compares with a FM94.8m
loss for the first three months of last year.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chief executive, said the bank was 'working hard' to
improve its performance but 'no major change will be possible until economic
growth gains momentum'.
KOP's operating income went into the red in the first quarter, to FM180.4m,
a 180 per cent fall from the FM224.2m profit in the same period of 1991. The
bank wrote off FM728.2m on lending and guarantees in the first quarter of
1992, a 212 per cent increase on the FM233.6m write-off for the same period
of last year. Equity per share fell by 18 per cent in the first quarter, to
FM48.47 on 30 April, from FM59.07 for the same date last year.
'Despite the grim environment, KOP has managed to strengthen its capital
structure,' said Mr Voutilainen. The group's capital ratio is now 8.8 per
cent calculated in accordance with the regulations of the Basle-based Bank
for International Settlements.
Mr Voutilainen said KOP planned a 10 per cent cut in the bank's payroll, a
shake-up of the management board, and an increasing focus on basic banking
services through a reallocation of capital from real estate.

WAL-MART Stores, the fast-growing US retailer, is stepping up its Latin
American expansion.
Wal-Mart, which now outsells the likes of Sears, Roebuck and K mart, said
yesterday it would extend a previously-announced joint venture arrangement
with Cifra, the largest Mexican retailer, to include Wal-Mart Supercenter
combination stores, distribution centre operations, McLane wholesale
operations and more Club Aurrera outlets.
The initial joint venture between the two companies, announced in July,
concentrated on the development of wholesale clubs around Mexico City, under
the Club Aurrera name. Wal-Mart is an important operator of warehouse clubs
 -which sell limited product ranges at rock-bottom prices to a membership
customer base - in the US.
Wal-Mart says the first Mexican 'Supercenter', where both general
merchandise and food are sold, should open next year in Monterrey. Another
six to eight Club Aurrera units should also open in the Mexico City area in
1992-1993.

JAPAN'S carmakers yesterday revealed the extent of the problems which have
hit the industry during the past 12 months.
Fuji Heavy Industries announced a Y4bn (Dollars 30.9m) loss; Daihatsu Motor
reported a 65 per cent plunge in pre-tax profit; and earnings for the year
to the end of March at Nissan Motor were down 46.7 per cent.
Only Mitsubishi Motors reported a profit increase - a slim 0.6 per cent to
Y50.5bn - and it forecast that profits would be flat this year, as domestic
demand is expected to remain weak.
Nissan's Y87.8bn pre-tax profit was bolstered by a Y38.8bn gain from the
sale of securities. It also reported extraordinary gains of Y46.6bn on the
sale of Tokyo property to a subsidiary. (Executives say that deal will be
reflected in consolidated accounts by increased borrowings.)
Nissan also reported a Y44.5bn extraordinary loss arising from the closure
of its unprofitable Australian assembly operations, announced in February.
From October, it will only export cars to Australia.
The cause of most companies' problems, however, was downturn in the domestic
market. Passenger car registrations have been falling since the final
quarter of 1990, just as makers' new production capacity came on line in
expectation of rapid sales growth.
Nissan's sales for the period rose 2.3 per cent to Y4,270bn, though vehicle
sales were down 1.5 per cent by volume, and domestic sales 3 per cent lower.
Strongest growth was in automotive parts, with exports 26.3 per cent higher
in line with increased production in the US and UK.
Mr Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice-president, said although
domestic sales were 'very slow', the UK-based European operations were
'doing well'. However, the company is forecasting a further sharp fall, to
Y40bn, in pre-tax profits this year, and virtually unchanged sales .
The situation is more serious at Fuji Heavy, despite Nissan's request for it
to produce 40,000 vehicles last year. Even including that order, unit sales
were down 1.2 per cent and, by value, sales rose 9 per cent to Y823.9bn.
Fuji Heavy is forecasting a profit of Y4bn for the current year, ending a
run of two consecutive losses. However, the forecast is based on an
optimistic sales estimate of Y900bn, which appears to take for granted a
strong recovery in the industry late this year.
Daihatsu, which has close links to Toyota Motor, is also in difficulty,
having reported a 0.5 per cent fall in sales to Y783.4bn and a 4.4 per cent
decline in sales by volume. The company is a specialist in mini-cars, sales
of which have been hurt by tougher parking regulations in Japanese cities.
The company reported a loss of Y900m related to its decision to retreat from
the US market and to concentrate on Europe. For the current year, Daihatsu
forecast that profits will remain at around Y4.5bn on a 3.8 per cent
increase in sales to Y820bn.
Mitsubishi Motors, following the successful release of a new range of
recreational and luxury models, reported that its exports rose from 617,933
units to 644,161 units, and that total sales value rose by 10.4 per cent to
Y2,554bn.
But even Mitsubishi, which has experienced strong growth despite the
downturn, expects sales for the current year to be up by a modest 1.7 per
cent.

FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pinault's General plots his
European assault - Francois Pinault talks about expansion plans for his
retail interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Pinault has a habit of sprinkling his conversation with
references to General 'Stormin'' Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the allied
forces in the Gulf war.
'Stormin'' Norman, Mr Pinault is quick to point out, won the war. Mr
Pinault, who has already turned Pinault, his tiny timber business, into one
of France's largest distribution groups, has every intention of winning too.
So far, Mr Pinault's campaign has been fought mainly on French soil,
culminating late last year with his successful - if highly controversial -
takeover of Au Printemps, one of France's best known retailing groups. Now
he is casting his sights further afield; his main aim for the next few years
will be to expand some of the Printemps' businesses - principally the La
Redoute mail order business and Conforama chain of furniture stores - into
the European market.
'Europe is our target,' said Mr Pinault from the top floor of his
headquarters in the swanky seventh arrondissement of Paris. 'We have the
right concepts and we have the right team. Our future lies in developing
them in other countries.'
Mr Pinault is well known in France, where he is seen as one of the most
aggressive entrepreneurs. The French press brackets him with Mr Bernard
Arnault, chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group, and Mr Vincent Bollore,
who heads the industrial company, Bollore. They are self-made men who built
their businesses through audacious acquisitions from outside the well-bred
ranks of the business establishment.
Mr Pinault's early deals, in the early 1960s, were in the timber industry,
where he built his original distribution business in Brittany. He
diversified into wood importing, and then into retailing, with a network of
shops selling first to the trade and later to consumers.
He came to prominence in France in 1987 by buying Chapelle Darblay, an
ailing paper mill baled out by state subsidies. Three years later Mr Pinault
turned a tidy profit by selling it. He then expanded further by buying
Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale (CFAO), which had interests in
everything from supermarkets to car dealerships.
The biggest deal was the FFr5.3bn (Dollars 970m) partial bid for Printemps,
which showed Mr Pinault at his most pugilistic as he shrugged off protests
from minority shareholders, furious at being excluded from his offer. The
acquisition sparked an official review of France's takeover legislation, but
Mr Pinault bagged his prey.
Printemps set the seal on Mr Pinault's strategy of turning his company from
a collection of timber businesses, exposed to the cyclical construction
sector, into what he calls a 'multi-disciplinary distribution group'.
Construction, he claims, is 'too cyclical' and 'too vulnerable to
competition from Asia and eastern Europe'. He says he feels more comfortable
with a combination of higher margin activities in retailing and wholesale
distribution, provided 'you are present in enough different sectors to be
protected against problems in individual markets'.
He has been left with a company with annualised sales of FFr70bn - about 30
per cent of which comes from outside France - and a workforce of 65,000. He
has also been left with net debt of FFr17bn which, even Mr Pinault admits,
must be reduced.
Debt reduction was under way two weeks ago with the sale of Pinault's
original timber interests to Dapta-Malinjoud, the French DIY group. Mr
Pinault says other sales are in the pipeline, although he will not specify
which businesses are on the block. The likeliest candidates, however, are
the manufacturing companies, which represent 20 per cent of sales and do not
fit with the new focus on distribution.
Paris analysts are sanguine about Pinault's prospects of pulling off the
disposals despite the depressed state of the construction market. Mr
Philippe Bastin, distribution analyst at James Capel, has pencilled in a
reduction in net debt to FFr14bn by the end of 1992 and FFr13bn a year
later. He also forecasts net profits of FFr750m this year and FFr980m for
1993.
Mr Pinault is resigned to 'a year of consolidation' before he pursues his
plans for Conforama and La Redoute. He is also resigned to relinquishing his
old role as a deal-maker to concentrate on organic growth. He has already
made a number of management changes, including the appointment of Mr
Jean-Paul Huchon, former head of Printemps, as group chief executive.
'Look at that,' he says, waving at a bare desk. 'There's nothing on it.
Other people are running the business. Now it's up to them.'

FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Insurer tightens broker network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; HIGGINS, the New York-based insurance broker, has announced a
number of transactions designed to strengthen the UNISON network, which
links more than a dozen independent brokers through exclusive co-operation
deals.
J&amp;H and the German UNISON partner, Jauch and Hubener, are to establish a
joint venture holding company to be based in the Netherlands.
The new company will acquire a 25 per cent stake in AB Max Mathiessen, the
Swedish partner in UNISON.
Separately, J&amp;H and Jauch &amp; Hubener are to buy a stake of between 10 and 12
per cent in Gras Savoye, the French partner.
J&amp;H has 50 per cent stake in the Spanish broker, Gil y Carvajal.
The moves take place against a background of increasing competition among
big international insurance brokers, especially in Europe, where companies
are more likely to buy their insurance from brokers rather than directly
from insurers.
J&amp;H's main competitors have stepped up their European operations in recent
months. In February, Marsh &amp; McLennan acquired full control of its French
subsidiary, Faugere et Jutheau.
Willis Corroon, which until the merger of Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black
in October 1990, was part of the UNISON network, has recently completed the
acquisition of stakes in a number of small and medium-sized brokers.
Last year Aon Corporation, which owns the US broker, Rollins Burdick Hunter,
acquired the Dutch broker, Hudig Langeveldt.
Mr David Olsen, chief executive of J&amp;H, said he expected competition between
the main international brokers to increase.
He said he ultimately envisaged room for only three genuinely international
insurance brokers.
At least seven brokers - including Alexander &amp; Alexander and Sedgwick, as
well as Willis Corroon, Marsh, Aon and J&amp;H - would lay claim to this status.
Reliance National recently announced its intention to sell a seventh
international broker, Frank B. Hall.

FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Court backs Continental voting
rights restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOSTILITIES between Continental, the German tyre company, and Pirelli, its
Italian rival and former suitor, heated up yesterday after a court decision.
A Hanover court approved the German company's rules on voting rights,
annulling a vote by shareholders on the issue last March. In common with a
number of large German companies, Continental has a rule which limits voting
rights per shareholder to 5 per cent of the total, no matter how big that
shareholder's stake.
Pirelli, which was in merger talks with Continental for almost 18 months
until negotiations broke down last December, said it would challenge the
ruling, claiming that voting right restrictions such as those in place at
Continental were 'detrimental to the interests of all shareholders'.
Pirelli said it believed that voting rights restrictions - in place at a
number of large German companies - 'in general negatively influence the
value of shares'.
The aggressive move comes shortly after it emerged that Pirelli, which owns
5 per cent of Continental and has options over a further 34 per cent of its
shares, is launching another challenge to the rule. This will be voted on by
Continental shareholders on July 3.
In the ruling yesterday, the court found that the outcome of last year's
meeting was invalid, on the grounds that Pirelli should have disclosed at
the meeting that it spoke for more than 25 per cent of Continental's shares.
At the special meeting last March, the motion calling for the the overthrow
of the 5 per cent limit, which required a simple majority of more than 50
per cent, was backed by shareholders with 65.97 of the votes. However, the
restriction has remained in place pending the courtroom appeal.
Speaking at the company's annual press conference last week, Mr Hubertus von
Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, said the move from Pirelli to put
the issue to shareholders again had to be seen as 'hostile'. Pirelli
responded by saying the move was not hostile, but an attempt to clarify the
value of its stake.
This resurfacing of hostilities comes despite the fact that Continental is
holding friendly discussions with Pirelli, with a view to buying some of its
non-tyre operations. It is hoping for the Italian company's support for a
large rights issue announced earlier this month.
The companies have not ruled out the idea of a merger in two or three years,
Mr von Grunberg said last week.
Analysts have suggested that the latest Pirelli move is, in essence, a
negotiation tactic designed to put pressure on Continental amid discussions
over Pirelli's non-tyre operations.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the Continental management is
hoping for the support of Pirelli for its forthcoming rights issue - part of
the proceeds of which may be used to buy businesses from Pirelli.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Park Food advances 73% to Pounds 6.9m as
hamper sales grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD-FASHIONED virtues such as thrift might be spurned as Dickensian in some
companies, but not at Park Food Group, where the only Victorian notion is
that Christmas is still a time for good cheer and loaded tables, financed by
weekly savings towards Park's main product, the annual hamper.
Yesterday Park Food reported a 73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 6.89m (Pounds 3.99m) for the year to March 31 1992. This was from
static turnover of Pounds 119.5m (Pounds 119.6m).
Mr Peter Johnson, chairman and managing director, said he was 'delighted'
with the results and that potential for growth in the group's core business
 -supplying Christmas hampers via a nationwide network of 65,000
commission-earning agents - was considerable.
Mr Richard Hughes, director responsible for the hamper and voucher division,
said that of the UK's 22m households, roughly half fit socio-economic C2/D/E
profiles, the central target for the group's hampers.
At the moment Park Food services some 1.5m of those homes, taking about 40
per cent of the Christmas hamper market, currently worth Pounds 300m
annually. Sales of hampers for Christmas 1991 increased by 14.7 per cent
over 1990's figure.
Mr Johnson said that Park Food's hamper business had seen sustained growth
since its establishment in 1967: 'when times are bad people feel the need to
save and when times are good they feel they can save'.
The group made a number of disposals last year, though the remaining
subsidiaries - Jetlag, supplier of travellers' kits to airlines and hotels,
and Bee Cee Foods, the group buying arm - are contributing to group
profitability.
Earnings per share increased by 79 per cent to 8.6p (4.8p). The directors
recommended a final dividend of 2.2p (1.14p) making a 3.2p (1.6p) total.
The group had nil gearing at March 31, compared with 60 per cent in 1991,
and net cash of Pounds 10.9m. There was Pounds 13m cash flow from operations
against Pounds 6.73m last time.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Morland's bid defence bolstered by large
holder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTEMPT by Morland, the Oxfordshire-based brewery, to maintain its
independence in the face of a Pounds 104m hostile bid from Greene King was
helped yesterday by a statement from one of its large institutional
shareholders.
Royal Insurance Asset Management, which holds 7.7 per cent of Morland's
shares, said it would reject the offer which it said 'considerably
undervalues the future prospects of the company'.
Mr Michael Taylor, head of RIAM's UK equities, said Morland was a strong
independent brewing company. It was well managed and had done a good deal in
buying 100 pubs from Courage last year. 'The offer is on the low side.'
He believed that there was an element of 'forced sale' on the part of
Whitbread Investment Company, which had to reduce its 43.4 per cent stake in
Morland to satisfy Monopolies and Mergers Commission requirements.
WIC has sold a 28.5 per cent holding to Greene King for accept the offer for
its remaining 14.9 per cent. Hence Morland's welcome for Royal's support.
Greene King, which produces Abbot and IPA ales, issued its offer document on
Thursday. The terms of the paper offer are nine convertible preference
shares for every two Morland ordinary, valuing the target's shares at about
490p each, compared with yesterday's 485p. There is a cash alternative of
450p.
The offer is final unless a rival emerges and Mr Simon Redman, chairman,
said yesterday that one would have done so by now as WIC's need to sell
shares had been known for some time.
He also expressed surprise at Royal making a decision at this stage, before
full details had been given by both sides.
The offer document points to the premiums over prices prevailing for Morland
earlier this year, a historic multiple of 20 to 21 times earnings and also
questions the values Morland attached to its pubs. It claims Morland's
brands, which include Old Speckled Hen, are weak and has said it would close
the Abingdon brewery.
Morland, which will issue its defence document within the next seven days,
described the attempt to find weakness in its business as futile.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: First quarter rise for ADT in spite of
difficult markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the car auctions and security company with a London and New York
listing, yesterday reported first quarter profits up 4 per cent at Dollars
32.1m (Pounds 17.8m) despite continuing difficult economic conditions in
North America and Europe.
Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 318.9m and earnings per share by 9.5 per
cent to Dollars 0.23.
The company also confirmed the appointment of three new independent
non-executive directors chosen with the agreement of Laidlaw, the Canadian
transport group which has a 28.4 per cent stake in ADT.
The non-executive directors will form an audit committee which will set its
own agenda but which is designed to bring more corporate governance to the
company.
Last April, Laidlaw suspended a case in a New York court which claimed ADT
had made misleading profits disclosures in relation to transactions with its
associated companies.
The case was dropped after ADT agreed, among other things, to appoint four
Laidlaw directors and four mutually acceptable non-executive directors.
The three new directors are Mr Peter Slusser, the president of a private
investment bank in New York and a former head of mergers and acquisitions at
Paine Webber, the investment bank; Mr James Pasman, a director of First
Boston Investment Fund and a former chief executive of Kaiser Aluminium; and
Mr Alan Henderson, vice-president of administration of Ranger Oil and a
director of Ranger Oil UK.
In security services, Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT chairman, said the commercial
sector remained soft but the group made progress in the residential market.
Operating profit in the division rose 3.8 per cent to Dollars 30.2m.
The auctions division was hit by continuing low levels of new car sales and
operating profit fell 8.5 per cent to Dollars 20.4m with the greatest fall
in the UK.
ADT said it expected overall performance of the auctions division this year
to be equal or just ahead of last year's performance.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Taking its punishment in public - The
mounting tribulations faced by Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD publicity has haunted the international investment management group,
Invesco MIM, over the past year.
The group's long-standing links with Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced
tycoon, inevitably caused embarrassment in the aftermath of the publisher's
death. Mr Maxwell owned 20 per cent of the group between 1986 and early
1991, and Invesco MIM was one of the Mirror Group's pension fund managers.
In addition, Invesco was fined Pounds 75,000 by Imro (the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation) for accounting failures relating to its
Personal Equity Plans.
Recently, however, it has been the problems of the group's investment trusts
which have attracted attention, and in particular, Drayton Consolidated. At
the end of 1989, the net asset value of this trust was 700p; it is currently
just 252p. A graph of the recent share price looks like an Alpine ski slope.
The problem has been the group's unquoted portfolio. Repeated write-downs of
the asset values alarmed investors, who marked the shares down even more
quickly. Invesco itself has had to take a Pounds 13m exceptional loss on its
holding in the trust.
Two specific investments have provoked criticism. Alma, a confectionery
company with several famous brand names, was the trust's second largest
holding. When it went into receivership in February, the failure knocked
57.8p off the trust's net asset value per share. Disquiet was expressed when
it was revealed that Drayton had extended loans to the company even after
writing down its value last year.
The basis for the valuation of City Merchants Bank, a company jointly owned
by Drayton Consolidated and Invesco and the largest holding of the trust,
has also been attacked. 'With the benefit of hindsight, too much money was
put into too few investments,' said one institutional investor Mr Nicholas
Johnson, Invesco's deputy chairman and chief executive, says that other
companies with investments in the unquoted area have had to make write-downs
because of the recession. 'What has distinguished Consolidated is that it is
a listed company and attracts publicity' he argues.
The former manager, Mr Alexander Reid, resigned and Mr Peter Knapton was
brought in from Samuel Montagu to take his place. But some investors remain
resolutely unimpressed and wonder whether Invesco should continue to be in
charge of the trust.
'If there was ever a case for taking the management away from someone, this
is it,' says one institution. 'The problem is that the whole thing is
intertwined with other trusts in the group which also own some of the same
investments.'
Invesco brought in County NatWest to conduct a review of the trust and Price
Waterhouse was asked to conduct a substantial valuation of the holdings.
That process has already resulted in a further Pounds 40m write-down of the
unquoted portfolio.
A reconstruction is being planned. Full details have yet to be revealed but
what seems likely is that as many liquid assets will be sold as possible; a
new company will be formed to hold the unquoted element, with less liquid
assets being sold gradually.
Some of the problems of Drayton Consolidated have been repeated in the
unquoted element of Drayton English &amp; International's portfolio. And one of
the trusts launched last year, Drayton Blue Chip, suffered a 33 per cent
fall in net asset value per share in the six months to March 31 (although
much of this fall has been regained since the election).
Nor has the performance of the unit trusts set the world alight. The
majority of the group's unit trusts have a below average performance in
their sectors over one, three and five years. Indeed, over the past year,
nearly half the trusts have a fourth quartile (bottom 25 per cent)
performance, according to Finstat.
But Mr Johnson feels the group has been getting an unfair press, in
particular citing the publicity given to recent sales by Invesco of shares
in United News-papers and Alexander Proudfoot, two companies of which Lord
Stevens, Invesco's head, is also chairman.
He says that Invesco retains stakes in United (of about 1 per cent) and in
Proudfoot (0.75 per cent) and the sales have been part of a long-term
process of whittling down holdings, some of which, such as United
Newspapers, had been accumulated before.
Mr Johnson said that the recent publicity must have done Invesco harm in the
short term. But he points out that the group is much larger than its UK
business. In the US, the Atlanta-based subsidiary is a substantial pension
fund manager with Dollars 24bn under management at the end of 1991.
The Denver-based mutual funds business nearly doubled its monies under
management to Dollars 5.3bn last year. Another subsidiary is Invesco
Solutions, a company which operates in the growing field of 'defined
contribution' pensions management - the US equivalent to money-purchase
company pension schemes.
In Europe, Invesco has a joint venture with IMI Capital Markets, Italy's
leading mutual fund manager, plus offices in Paris and the Netherlands and a
subsidiary in eastern Europe. In Japan, the company has established a
foothold in investment trust and pensions management.
But until the company gets over the Drayton Consolidated episode, these
other businesses may be forgotten. The County report on Drayton Consolidated
is eagerly awaited.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cakebread Robey plunges Pounds 1.7m into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cakebread Robey, the Middlesex-based builders' merchant, plunged into loss
last year as contractors delayed starting dates and cancelled orders.
The group, which warned in February the deficit would top Pounds 1.3m, swung
from a Pounds 282,000 profit to a Pounds 1.7m loss in the year to December
31.
Mr Martin Earle, chairman, said the deeper-than-expected losses had been due
to accounting inaccuracies in the manufacturing division. These had
misrepresented the level of losses, especially in the fourth quarter. The
division's accountant left before the inaccuracies were discovered.
Turnover fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 22.9m. The manufacturing division was
hardest hit with sales down by 45 per cent. Merchanting volume declined by 9
per cent, and losses had deepened, Mr Earle said.
An extraordinary gain of Pounds 256,000 on the disposal of two properties
left a Pounds 1.3m loss attributable to shareholders.
Mr Earle warned that it could 'take some time' to restore the company to
profitability.
Earnings per share swung from 3.2p to losses of 26.1p. There was no
dividend.

FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: First profit for Nissan UK with Pounds
18.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN's British car manufacturing operations made a profit last year for
the first time since the Japanese car maker began production in the UK in
1986.
Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) achieved a net profit of Pounds 18.4m on a
turnover of Pounds 779.4m in 1991 compared with a loss of Pounds 43.9m in
the nine months to the end of 1990 on a turnover of Pounds 382.9m.
Mr Ian Gibson, NMUK managing director, said yesterday that the company
expected its profit to fall this year to less than Pounds 1m under the
impact of heavy expenditure to increase production capacity for the addition
of a second car range at the Sunderland plant.
The company said that it had achieved its first profit 12 months ahead of
schedule thanks to higher than expected production in 1991.
The losses accumulated since 1985, which totalled Pounds 129m at the end of
1990, were reduced to Pounds 111m by the end of last year, and Mr Gibson
forecast that the losses should be eliminated by 1995.
Output of the Nissan Primera jumped to 124,663 last year from 76,241 in 1990
with 90.5 per cent of output exported.
Sales rose strongly in Germany to more than 30,000, and NMUK is now
exporting to more than 30 countries including Japan.
Output is planned to rise to 175,000 this year, including 37,000 Nissan
Micra small cars, which begin production in August.
Production is scheduled to jump again in 1993 to 270,000 comprising 130,000
Micras and 140,000 Primeras, as the plant moves towards its presently
planned full capacity of 300,000 cars a year.
Nissan's investment at the Sunderland site will have totalled around Pounds
900m by 1993, of which Pounds 125m-Pounds 130m will have been provided as UK
state aid.
Nissan's investment in the UK totals around Pounds 1bn including the
company's vehicle design and development operations at Cranfield,
Bedfordshire and its UK marketing and distribution operations.
The NMUK workforce at Sunderland totalled 3,770 at the end of 1991 and will
rise to around 4,600 by the end of 1992, making it one of the largest
manufacturing operations in northern England.
The total Nissan workforce at the site will reach around 5,200 by the end of
the year including more than 600 employed by Nissan Yamato Engineering,
NMUK's 80 per cent-owned pressings subsidiary.
Mr Gibson said that the Nissan Primera range had reached more than 80 per
cent local European content. Component purchases by Nissan in Europe for the
UK plant totalled Pounds 450m compared with around Pounds 145m spent on
component imports from Japan.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Government commitment to London's transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN NORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the comparison of transport conditions in London and
Paris ('France accelerates into the overtaking lane', May 29), based on a
joint report by two research organisations, well illustrates a point made in
the report itself. It points out that British commentators tend to be
generally critical of the present state of the capital's transport policy
and infrastructure, whereas in Paris 'by stark contrast, the regional
authorities seem to be more concerned with advertising what they consider to
be their achievements and future potentials'.
True to form you ignore all the positive things to be said about the
situation in London. For example, over the past five years investment in
rail infrastructure and rolling stock serving London has more than doubled,
from Pounds 420m in 1986-87 to Pounds 948m in 1990-91 (at 1990-91 prices) -
much higher than the FFrs5,517m in Paris in 1989 - and is set to increase
further over the next three years. London Underground plans to invest more
than Pounds 3.5bn over this period.
London and Paris are very different cities and their transport systems have
developed differently. Whereas the Metro serves the whole of central Paris,
London south of the Thames is mainly served by Network South East. Taking
both systems together there is very little difference in the coverage of the
inner area. As the report points out, London has much better rail coverage
both in the outer areas and the surrounding region. Traffic conditions are
actually better in central London than in central Paris in the peak hours
because of the greater density of development in Paris, and a deliberate
policy of traffic restraint in London, including restrictive parking.
Nobody denies that governments of both persuasions under-invested in our
infrastructure in the past, but our investment plans are an earnest of this
government's commitment to providing London with a modern and efficient
transport system for the next century. The creation of a minister with sole
responsibility for transport in London underlines the political will to
ensure this will be achieved.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Cadbury code a diversion from more basic and
pressing need
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RALPH WINDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Cadbury 'Code of Practice' received wide comment in your columns
('Cadbury lays out new rules for directors', May 28). 'Proposals receive
boardroom backing,' you unsurprisingly report, with the Confederation of
British Industry and Institute of Directors in close harmony. Lex, more
incisively, sees it as the work of nice men who 'do not wish to be
inconvenienced by too much change'; though even Lex oddly welcomes the
notion of it giving shareholders more ammunition to 'insist on their rights
as owners'.
It was all a monumental irrelevance and diversion from the more basic and
pressing need of improving the strategic capabilities and performance of
British boards. Sadly, the committee seems to have failed to read its FTs
just two weeks ago when Charles Handy ('Priorities and purpose at the heart
of capitalism', May 12) went to the heart of the matter and explained why
'maximising shareholder value', elevated through the 1980s into the purpose,
rather than the conditional requirement, of a healthy, surviveable business,
had become the real impediment to progress. The purpose of a business, for
which its board, not its shareholders, has the prime responsibility, is - in
his words - 'to provide quality goods and services to its customers and
quality lives and work to its people'. The latter is not charity; they
happen to be its intellectual asset base and sole distinctive competence.
The 'corporate governance' debate is anchored in the past. Meanwhile, we
still have no mechanisms for the proper audit and accountability measures of
the medium-term strategic performance of British boards outside the narrow
financial area, against this more fundamental business purpose. Others will
debate whether, even in the narrower area of necessary financial probity,
anything short of regulation will do. Once again, however, the real issues
of strategic board performance were absent from the agenda.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: A marketing ploy not enjoyed by business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL MCKEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Jane Fuller is quite correct in her article 'Paying more than a pony'
(May 26) to highlight the concern of many small companies regarding the high
cost of everyday banking transactions.
I, too, have recently queried with Barclays the charges made for routine
banking activities of a small company. The following facts emerged:
The cost of a debit entry rose by 17.8 per cent in 1991 from 45p to 53p with
a further increase of more than 10 per cent likely next month. Prices of
other standard transactions have been increased similarly.
The notional allowance on credit balances which reduces the cost of everyday
transactions has been withdrawn on most business accounts and will be
withdrawn for the remainder on June 1 1992.
If a corporate account is held in a City or West End branch of Barclays, the
per-transaction cost is 10 per cent higher than if the branch were elsewhere
in London.
The end result is a gross discrepancy between the charges made for corporate
as opposed to personal accounts. Had our account been a personal one, we
would have been paid by the bank rather than charged, even though the bank
would have done exactly the same amount of work.
When I raised this point with Barclays the reply was: 'The major difference
of course is the fact that if a personal account is maintained in credit
during any one quarter, then bank charges are not applied at all. This is a
marketing tool forced upon not only Barclays but the other clearers a few
years ago due to competition from building societies, etc.'
I trust that if this is the case, other organisations will begin active
competition for small corporate accounts.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Pension funds should be shared equitably
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RUSSELL A STRACHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barbara Ellis argued ('Pensions hit by backdoor raids', May 16) that,
in a pension scheme with a healthy surplus, to exercise augmentation powers
to help employees being made redundant harms the expectations of members
remaining in service.
Those suffering the shock and longer-term hardship of redundancy might not
agree. The other side of the argument is that such an exercise of
augmentation powers - normally powers given to the employer subject to the
consent of the trustees - is a good way of utilising surplus consistent with
the scheme's objects of providing retirement benefits for employees and
ex-employees and their dependants. The duty of the trustees is to see that
the fund is used equitably between members (whether still in service or not)
and not necessarily equally. Those continuing in employment will accrue
further years of pensionable service and can expect that their pay will at
least keep pace with inflation.
Barbara Ellis quoted two trade union opinions. I am disappointed that Bryn
Davies did not express a more rounded view. The article seems to hark back
to the historic union standpoint of being predominantly concerned with those
members still in employment at the expense of those made redundant or
already retired. Since surpluses are often attributable to funding for the
future service of employees who did not in fact complete that service, its
use to improve redundancy packages should not be attacked in such a general
and partisan manner.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY HICKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Can Mark Hayes ('The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the
purpose and standards of business', May 16) explain the attraction of
investing in non-profit enterprises in Third World countries?
My company trains managers from developing countries on residential and
outreach programmes. Its registration as a not-for-profit association does
not mean that we do not have to be profitable since expansion has to be
financed and assets renewed.
In the face of a continuously growing demand for services it is impossible
to fund all the consequential capital requirements from internal sources.
Attracting new capital is, therefore, essential to growth. However, while
non-profit status is an important factor in attracting funding for our
programmes, it prevents us from paying dividends to shareholders.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Fragile frontline of the forest: People in the Amazon need
sustainable development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Amazon rainforest has had a powerful allure ever since reports of its
existence reached Europe in 1500. Numerous adventurers have risked their
lives to penetrate its depths in search of riches such as El Dorado - the
kingdom of a man so rich that he anointed himself daily in gold dust - or,
in the past decade, Serra Pelada, the world's largest open goldmine.
A few years ago, it became clear that a less tangible, but more essential,
treasure was at risk. Foreign attention was seized by television pictures of
burnings in the Brazilian Amazon, wiping out the luxuriant forest to create
pasture.
The Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, 60 per cent of which is in
Brazil, was described as 'the lungs of the world' by experts, who warned
that the burnings were reducing the planet's oxygen and contributing to
global warming. Species were being wiped out before they had been
discovered, any of which might contain substances or genetic material that
could be used for important cures. Contact from the white man was
eliminating Indian tribes, who had no resistance to his diseases, while
cattle-ranchers were pushing out the traditional forest people in the cause
of producing hamburgers for the First World.
The outcry was immediate. Quick calculations showed that, in less than 30
years, an area of forest 10 times the size of Switzerland had been lost.
Under international pressure, the Brazilian government ended the financial
incentives it was offering for forest clearance, and halved burnings to
11,000 sq km last year compared with an average 22,000 sq km a year in
1978-88. But Mr Jose Goldemberg, the environment minister, admits: 'That was
the easy part.'
Little has been done for the 16m people for whom the forest is both home and
workplace, or about the poverty in which a total 40m Brazilians live, which
drives some of them to seek wealth - or merely survival - in the jungle. Mr
Alfredo Homma, from the Agricultural Research Institute in the Amazonian
port of Belem, complains: 'There has been too much focus on preserving the
forest and not enough on providing alternatives for people living within
it.'
This issue is at the heart of the debate at next week's Earth Summit.
Industrial nations see tropical rainforests as a kind of global asset. The
Brazilian Amazon makes up 48 per cent of the world's remaining tropical
forest; has the greatest biodiversity, with between 15 and 20 per cent of
the world's species; has a fifth of the planet's fresh water; and provides a
third of its oxygen.
To most Brazilians the Amazon is full of resources to be exploited. Its
mineral reserves include gold, copper, bauxite, nickel, manganese and the
world's largest iron ore mine with reserves of 18bn tonnes; and its
hydroelectric potential is a total 100,000MW. Yet the 5m sq km region
provides only 6 per cent of gross domestic product, and average income for
the region is just Dollars 1,270 a year. General Leonides Goncalves, a
former commander of the Amazon region, argues: 'Not to exploit and populate
this area is a luxury Brazil cannot afford. What is more important, man or a
tree?'
Brazil insists that if the north wants it to keep the forest intact and gain
access to the genetic material, it should contribute both funds and
technology transfers. Mr Jorge Ito, a farmer in the remote Amazonian town of
Tome Acu, says: 'If you pay me, I'll happily keep the forest standing.
Otherwise I'll cut it down to make a living.'
This difference appears so hard to bridge that there will be no legally
binding forest convention signed at the Earth Summit, simply a declaration
of principles.
The difficulty lies in finding a way for people to earn a living from the
forest without destroying it - sustainable development or 'living off its
interest rather than its assets', as Mr Joseph Connor, president of the
International Chamber of Commerce, describes it. The current main activities
such as ranching, logging and goldmining are not sustainable in their
present form; but they show no signs of abating.
The most destructive, ranching, is not as unprofitable as ecologists claimed
 -and land remains a safe investment with inflation topping 20 per cent a
month.
The network of roads built by the army in the 1960s and 1970s and the
increasing value of tropical wood have led to an explosion in logging. Mr
Chris Uhl, a biologist from Pennsylvania University, says: 'Logging is
likely to be the key economic activity in the Amazon for much of the next
century.' He argues that, if done selectively, it can be sustainable. But
currently there are neither the management skills nor the incentive to be
selective; Mr Uhl identifies 40 species of tree at risk.
The most frequently cited form of sustainable development for the Amazon is
'extractive reserves', where traditional populations can carry out
activities such as rubber-tapping and fruit and nut-gathering. Ms Diana
Propper from Cultural Survival International of the US, which sponsors a
reserve, explains: 'We want to give people an alternative to destruction by
providing them with greater income from the products they traditionally
harvest, by helping with processing facilities and creating markets
overseas.'
She says people are prepared to pay more for such products, but admits that,
if a market is created, there is a risk that other people would produce them
on large-scale plantations outside the Amazon (as happened with rubber). Mr
Homma of the Agricultural Research Institute says: 'At best reserves are a
short-term way to gain time while other alternatives emerge.'
Ms Propper agrees but adds: 'The people living in the forest are our
frontline of defence against destruction and that's what we must concentrate
on.'

FT  30 MAY 92 / El Greco reaches auction record: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S in London yesterday auctioned paintings by the four most
celebrated Spanish artists - El Greco, Murillo, Zurbaran and Goya. It sold
the works of the first two, but failed with Zurbaran and Goya. The auction
totalled Pounds 6.6m, with 27 per cent unsold.
'The Disrobing of Christ', a smaller version of the celebrated painting by
El Greco in Toledo cathedral, sold for Pounds 1.87m, within estimate and an
auction record for the artist. A 'Madonna and Child' by Murillo went for
Pounds 770,000, at the bottom of its estimate.
Bids for the Goya, a recently rediscovered portrait of Dona Maria Teresa de
Vallabriga, the wife of Infante Don Luis, Goya's patron, stopped at Pounds
600,000, half the expected level. Interest in the Zurbaran 'Christ and the
Virgin in the House at Nazareth', also a recent discovery, stretched to
Pounds 900,000, quite close to the Pounds 1.2m low estimate.
More stretching of a very different kind featured at Christie's South
Kensington, which sold the Forman Archive of Crime and Punishment for Pounds
97,944. The top lot was the previously unpublished execution record book of
Albert Pierrepoint, the UK's chief executioner until 1956. In it he recorded
details of the hundreds of executions he presided over. It sold for Pounds
19,800 to Derek Stevens, a former racing tipster.
Among the buyers was the former chief executioner of Algeria, who is setting
up a museum of justice in France. He paid Pounds 2,860 for the records of
Syd Dernley, who was Albert Pierrepoint's assistant, and Pounds 3,080 for a
leather strap invented for hanging a one-armed man by Henry Pierrepoint,
father of Albert and also a chief executioner. Henry's execution book made
Pounds 7,700.
An 18th-century scold's bridle for sealing the mouths of gossips sold to the
Bavarian Crime Museum for Pounds 2,530, well ahead of the Pounds 300
estimate, and a German executioner's axe of 1634, with the blade stamped
with 16 punched stars, recording the number of aristocratic beheadings it
carried out, also far exceeded estimate at Pounds 4,180.

   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WESTERN Australian court yesterday sentenced Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt
entrepreneur, to two-and-a-half years in prison for acting dishonestly
during a ADollars 370m (Pounds 153m) corporate rescue five years ago.
Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, showed no emotion
as he was sentenced by Judge Peter Blaxell in the Perth district court. Mrs
Eileen Bond, his divorced wife, burst into tears as he was led away by
police.
Mr Bond was convicted on Thursday of dishonestly inducing Mr Brian Coppin, a
Perth businessman, to subscribe to a rights issue during the rescue of
Rothwells merchant bank after the 1987 global stock market crash.
The court heard that Mr Bond concealed an agreement with Mr Laurie Connell,
the chairman of Rothwells, that Bond Corp would receive a ADollars 16m
success fee for helping to organise the rescue.
Mr Bond denied that the agreement existed, and claimed he had no intention
of misleading Mr Coppin. However, the jury accepted Mr Connell's evidence
that Mr Bond had negotiated the fee.
Mr Ian Callinan, defending, said Mr Bond had acted without premeditation at
a time when he was suffering from jetlag and tiredness caused by the
'extraordinary circumstances' of the stock market crash.
Judge Blaxell said it would be grossly unfair to make Mr Bond a scapegoat
for the events surrounding the Rothwells rescue - which is the subject of a
royal commission investigating alleged corruption and mismanagement. He also
commended Mr Bond for the 'quiet dignity' he showed during the five-day
trial. However, prison was the only appropriate penalty.
Mr Bond, 54, was declared bankrupt last month with debts and contingent
liabilities of ADollars 700m. He resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in
September 1990, two days before the group announced a record loss of
ADollars 2.2bn.
Mr Bond is under investigation by the Australian Securities Commission, the
federal corporate watchdog, and has figured in other inquiries into
corporate behaviour.
Charges are outstanding against several other former entrepreneurs,
including Mr Connell and Mr Christopher Skase, former chairman of Qintex
Australia.

THE ANZ Banking Group has again denied that it faces losses in the so-called
bankers' receipt scams that have rocked the Indian banking system.
ANZ Grindlays general manager for South Asia, Mr Bob Edgar, yesterday backed
up an earlier ANZ statement which said the bank had no reason to anticipate
losses from bankers' receipt shortfalls or associated transactions.
'Some sections of the Indian media have referred to a request from the
Reserve Bank of India to ANZ Grindlays to make a provision for the disputed
amount, relative to the alleged transaction with National Housing Bank,' Mr
Edgar said.
'ANZ Grindlays have denied the existence of the alleged transaction. ANZ
Grindlays' connection with this matter is only in respect of cheques
processed in the normal course of business. ANZ does not believe that it is
liable in this matter and has strong legal opinion to support this view. We
have been co-operating with the Reserve Bank of India to solve these
problems arising from the dealings of banks in the securities market.'

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk leaves tomorrow on a week-long visit to Russia, Japan
and Singapore which marks a further important step in South Africa's
diplomatic rehabilitation.
The trip begins in Russia where Mr de Klerk will be Mr Yeltsin's first
official visitor since he took over as Russian President. South Africa and
Moscow established full diplomatic relations in February and consulates will
soon be established in Cape Town and St Petersburg.
Mr Neil van Heerden, director-general of the Department of Foreign Affairs,
said there had been 'quite furious contact' at commercial level between
South African business organisations and their Russian counterparts. He said
the current trip, however, would be mostly of symbolic importance. 'Two
years ago if I said we were going to Moscow you would have not believed it.'
A small group of communists in Moscow opposes the trip, arguing that Mr
Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, should have been received before Mr de
Klerk.
A formal trade agreement between the two countries will probably be signed
later this year. Aerospace technology has been mentioned as a possible area
of trade, with the Russians apparently keen to sell aircraft and space
launches.
Of potentially greater commercial importance will be Mr de Klerk's visit to
Japan with whom diplomatic relations were normalised earlier this year.
Japan was South Africa's leading trading partner in 1987 before it froze
trade at those levels as a sanctions measure. Trade between the two
countries was Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.88bn) in 1991, but there is very
little Japanese investment in South Africa, following a 20-year investment
ban. Singapore is seen as an entry point for trade into East and Central
Asia.

levels, the World Bank said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
'(Czechoslovakia) has become one of the world's most polluted countries,'
the Bank said in its World Bank News publication. 'It will . . . be decades
before the country's main environmental problems are solved.' The Bank said
it had approved a Dollars 246m loan for Czechsolovakia to help the country's
major power plants run more efficiently and reduce air pollution. 'These
plants are Czechoslovakia's largest polluter, generating tons of sulphur
dioxide and dust,' it said.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Brussels weighs value of Eurocrats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THEY clutter up Brussels' best restaurants, use their inflated salaries to
push up rents for native Bruxellois, and park their polluting cars in the
locals' spaces.
Many Belgians have mixed feelings about the transient Eurocrats and their
hangers-on. But Brussels' aspirations to be the political capital of Europe
have brought growth as well as gripes, according to a report published
yesterday.
Mens en Ruimte, a Brussels consultancy, has calculated that the Belgian
capital benefited from BFr96bn (Pounds 1.6bn) last year, directly or
indirectly spent by EC institutions, diplomats, lobbyists, journalists and
other businesses. They make up a total of 46,000 people, half of them
Belgian and all employed in the service of the European ideal.
The report was commissioned by Mr Jos Chabert, the Brussels minister
responsible for external relations. Part of his job involves convincing
citizens that their snooty EC neighbours are not merely the 'Euro-parasites'
publicly reviled by some extremists.
Instead, he said yesterday, they brought 'prestige, well-being, growth and
jobs' to Brussels and Belgium. And the 75 per cent real increase in house
prices since 1985 was due mainly to other external factors and not to the
influx of non-Belgians.
Compared with diplomats and EC 'fonctionnaires', the 581 international
journalists - the largest press corps in the world outside Washington - had
the least lavish spending habits. But, as the report added tactfully, 'the
non-quantifiable, but certainly appreciable value of their presence lies in
the image of the European capital they convey to millions of readers,
listeners and viewers around the world'.
Unfortunately, there was not much to report about the EC institutions'
contribution to the Brussels economy yesterday: most Eurocrats had decided
to add to Thursday's Ascension Day holiday and take Friday off.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Japanese housing market recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S housing starts in April rose 0.4 per cent from a year earlier, the
first increase in 18 months and a sign that the recession in the residential
property market appears to have bottomed out.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from to 2.1 to 2 per cent during the
month, though the jobs-to-applicants ratio fell from 1.22:1 to 1.17:1, as
the labour shortage eased in tandem with the slowing of the economy.
The recovery in the housing market was uneven, with houses built for sale
down 28 per cent, while owner-occupied starts and houses for rent showed
increases. Starts of corporate dormitories rose 15.5 per cent, reflecting
companies' attempts to attract high-quality labour with high-quality
accommodation.
Large numbers of unsold apartments remain on the fringes of Tokyo and Osaka,
Japan's second largest city, where there was a flurry of speculative
building in 1989 and 1990 before the housing market collapsed. Until April's
increase, starts had fallen for 18 consecutive months.
Leading apartment builders are forecasting a tentative recovery in the year
ahead, with demand strongest for two-bedroom apartments of around Y40m
(Pounds 171,000), the budget end of the Japanese market. Office occupancy
remains at around 95 per cent or above in Tokyo, but renewed construction of
delayed projects is expected to depress this rate in coming months.
Japan's jobs-to-applicants ratio has been in continuous decline since it
peaked at 1.47:1 in March last year, and the present rate is the lowest
since early 1989.
The Ministry of Labour said the fall in new job offers was likely to
continue until after summer, despite the acute labour shortage in various
sectors, including the retail and construction industries.

FT  30 MAY 92 / Major makes friends in east Europe: Former Soviet satellites
want more than just EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a simple objective behind Mr John Major's tour of central Europe
this week: to convince the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary
to look to Britain as their natural ally in western Europe.
As he returned home yesterday, the British prime minister was content he had
made a good start. But he had learnt also that the aspirations of the former
Soviet satellites are running far ahead of what is on offer from the west.
The leaders of the three countries accepted with alacrity an invitation to
visit London during Britain's presidency of the European Community later
this year. They praised Mr Major's commitment to act as a sponsor in their
efforts to secure membership of the EC by the turn of the century.
Making appearances in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest does not quite add up to
striding on the world stage. But fresh from his election victory, Mr Major
left behind him an image of the sort of secure political leader they need to
fight their corner in the western club they are so anxious to join.
In Prague Czechoslovak president Vaclav Havel publicly congratulated the
British electorate on their choice on April 9. In Budapest, President Jozsef
Antall was equally effusive about Mr Major's efforts to play a prominent
role in shaping Hungary's new relationships with the west.
Mr Major intends to reinforce that goodwill by putting preparations for
enlarging the Community at the centre of the six-month British presidency
which begins in July.
He is aware that even Hungary, the most advanced of the three in terms of
the transition to a market economy, is unlikely to be ready for membership
until the year 2000.
For Poland, in the grip of political paralysis and economic crisis, even
that looks impossibly ambitious. In Czechoslovakia, the impending elections
have put a serious question mark over its future as a unitary state. And,
despite the evidence of blossoming capitalism in all three countries, they
remain desperately poor by EC standards.
From this Mr Major concludes that the Community must do more rather than
less to reassure them that the pain of economic adjustment will in the end
be rewarded with membership of the club.
He promised to press during the presidency for a joint declaration publicly
committing the Community to their eventual inclusion. On a more practical
level, he will seek to ensure that the association agreements signed with
Brussels last year do not have to wait for formal ratification by every EC
state before being put into action.
He takes as the basic premise a view that an organisation established to
entrench democracy in western Europe cannot now deny the same framework to
the fledgling democracies of the east.
His stance has also a domestic political dimension. Mr Major is aware that
the aspirations of his European partners to deepen rather than widen the
Community may produce in two or three years a new series of tensions within
his own Conservative party. He wants by then to have entrenched, as a
positive alternative to federalism, the notion of a Community of 20 or so
sovereign nations.
If this happy coincidence of self-interests brought him an enthusiastic
welcome in central Europe, Mr Major was told by his hosts that membership of
the Community marked the beginning rather than the end of their ambitions.
The recurring theme in the three capitals was that the rebuilding of
communist economies along capitalist lines had to be accompanied by much
stronger guarantees of their political and military security.
In Warsaw, Mr Jan Olszweski, the Polish prime minister, warned that the
security vacuum in the area needed to be filled by a pledge to extend Nato's
security umbrella to central Europe. The Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) was not strong enough to replace the anchor
once provided by the Warsaw Pact.
Mr Havel made the same point in Prague, drawing a comparison between the 15
permanent staff who work for the CSCE and the 30,000 employed by the United
Nations. Like its neighbours Czechoslovakia wanted the security of the US
military umbrella which could only be provided by Nato.
It was not a pledge that Mr Major could give. With much of the former Soviet
empire in turmoil, no western leader is prepared to pledge an extension of
the military guarantees which underpin Nato. A vague suggestion that it
would be a natural corollary of EC membership was as far as the British
prime minister would go.
Mr Major's hosts did not press the point. They judged that their visitor had
demonstrated his credentials as a powerful sponsor of their cause within the
Community. Now he must deliver.

THE European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, said yesterday that
nationalism was a germ which could tear Europe apart again as it stood on
the threshold of unity, Reuter reports from Aachen.
'One-sided nationalist policies are today a luxury nobody can afford, either
politically or economically,' he said after receiving one of Germany's
highest political awards, the Charlemagne Prize, for promoting European
unity.
He warned politicians against giving in to nationalist opportunism, which he
said was rooted in fear of the future and would only destabilise Europe
again if given free rein.

<TEXT>
THE US and Romania are well on the road to improved economic and political
relations, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US deputy secretary of state, said
after signing a bilateral investment treaty in Bucharest yesterday.
The treaty would lead to a 'substantial improvement' in the investment
climate in the country and would encourage more US companies to come to
Romania, said Mr Eagleburger, the most senior US official to visit the
country for more than two years.
US investment in Romania totalled Dollars 39m between January 1990 and April
1992, 12 per cent of the total pledged by foreign investors.
Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are among the country's largest
investors.
Mr Eagleburger's visit comes at a critical time for Romania which is trying
to improve its international standing and attract increased foreign
investment. Renewed US support for Romania reflects the strategic importance
of the country, which borders the Yugoslav republics, Moldova and Ukraine.
Relations between the US and Romania were strained during 1990 and 1991 due
chiefly to US concern about the Romanian authorities' handling of
anti-government demonstrations, the lack of an independent television
station and fears that the general election of 1990 were not held
democratically.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Former KGB arm to cut back agents: Russian Foreign
Intelligence Agency to close down parts of global network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency, formerly the foreign intelligence
arm of the KGB, is to cut back its agents at home and abroad by one-third,
according to Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, its deputy director.
The FIA would no longer attempt to maintain a global network and would
withdraw completely from some - unspecified - areas of the world. He
conceded that the agency, which once enjoyed unlimited access to funds, was
at times strapped for cash.
His appearance at a press conference yesterday was the most recent step in
the efforts being made by the FIA to present itself as user friendly and
little more than a modern consultancy company.
Gen Trubnikov said he also wanted to clear up misunderstandings following
statements by Mr Robert Gates, the CIA director, that the Russian FIA had
continued many of the same operations as the KGB.
He said that it was now 're-orienting itself according to the orders of the
Russian government', and was paying close attention to economic issues.
In particular, he said, the FIA was checking on the suitability of foreign
companies seeking to do business in the former Soviet Union.
It was also carrying out analysis of the Dollars 24bn-worth of aid being
offered by the Group of Seven industrial countries to Russia to determine
whether it was the best form of assistance.
General Trubnikov said that in his personal view, debt relief would be a
better form of support.
The general did not specifically refute other charges by Mr Gates that the
FIA was now oriented more towards industrial and technical espionage. Nor
did he address the charge that the US remained the main target of this
activity.
The FIA is now giving information to all member states of the Commonwealth
of Independent States - a membership which excludes the three Baltic
republics and Georgia.
He said that while Azerbaijan, the least committed of the members, had not
signed a joint security agreement, he expected it to be a customer for
Russian intelligence.
Gen Trubnikov claimed that there were, by agreement, no FIA agents operating
within the CIS member states - though he conceded that it was of primary
importance that Russia should know what decisions were being made in these
republics.
He said that relations with other intelligence agencies had 'radically
increased' - even with the historic enemy, the CIA, though he said that
there was a slow response from the US agency to FIA overtures.
'We lack a climate of confidence,' he said. 'The CIA must start thinking
about the new rules of the game, and they have suggestions from the FIA on
this'.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): Currency trading matures -
Forex rooms are far more complex than before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE popular image of foreign exchange dealers as the most frenzied of market
players  - young men burning with rage in front of computer screens,
slamming telephones on to desks while exchange rates flicker before their
eyes  - must now give way to a calmer, if occasionally frenetic, reality.
Forex dealing rooms are more complex places than they were. They are now
carefully integrated into their respective banks' operations in bonds,
domestic money markets and other activities.
Currencies are now far less volatile and in most banks, dealers spend less
time guessing whether government authorities will intervene on behalf of one
currency or another, and more looking for customers whose currency
portfolios they can manage.
Currency dealing is no less profitable. Forex can be among the most
lucrative markets in which any bank or corporation can invest. It is a
growing market, with a staggering global turnover of around Dollars 800bn a
day. 'It is easily the most consistent area for trading profits,' says Jim
O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'It is far
more difficult for a bank to have a stable basis in bonds and equities than
in forex these days.'
But forex is no longer the dynamic and speculative arena it was a decade
ago. Then, it was populated by dozens of medium-sized banks and
corporations, ready to make quick profits on gyrating exchange rates. Now,
the operators are fewer in number and bigger in size, dominated by names
such as Citibank, UBS, Bankers Trust and Barclays, all of whom are
increasing their market share while smaller operators gradually leave the
market.
Three factors have brought about the shift in the balance of power:
First, it is harder to make quick profits in currency dealing because
exchange rates are far less volatile than a decade ago. From the mid-1980s,
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations decided that they shared a
common interest in defeating inflation and intervened in the market to
manage their exchange rates.
G7 policy co-ordination is still strong, in spite of recent tensions over
the extent to which Germany and Japan are prepared to loosen their
respective fiscal policies and help improve the global economy  - G7 finance
ministers have managed to keep the Japanese yen strong against the US dollar
after stating last month that a strong yen was essential for world economic
adjustment. Central bank intervention has also become less dramatic. In the
1980s, market-makers could still gamble on how central banks might
intervene. Now the process has become more technical. 'Central Banks make
much more subtle changes,' says Mark Slater, managing director of forex at
Merrill Lynch in London, 'and intervention is more often a smoothing
process, not an attempt to turn the market. The market players, instead of
saying 'Let's take the central banks on' admit that the authorities will win
in the end.'
The second pressure is the spread of the so-called 'Basle mentality' in
international banking. Since July 1988, when the central bankers of the
world's leading countries agreed on minimum capital adequacy ratios for
international banks, awareness of credit and counterparty risk has grown.
Recession in the English-speaking world, with its trail of bad debts and the
downgrading of banks by rating agencies, has encouraged prudence in
international banking.
Third, the advent of global financial trading has meant exchange rate
movements are increasingly affected by huge financial flows rather than
trade. In the 1980s, market-makers in foreign exchange would be sufficiently
well-informed about currency flows by having a handful of large corporate
clients. Today, they need lines to fund managers all over the world if they
are to compete effectively in the market. Banks and corporations have
responded in several ways to these new pressures.
The big banks are increasingly concentrating on the development of a secure
customer base, a policy which underpins the risks they take in trading on
their own capital. Citibank, one of the biggest, with around 10 per cent of
the London market, is proud of its customer service. 'Around half our
traders are engaged in the market, and the other half are talking to
customers,' says Julian Simmonds, Citibank's managing director of forex.
'You have to get the balance right these days between customers and risk.'
Investment banks dealing in forex also believe that customers matter, if for
different reasons. Mr Slater of Merrill Lynch says that the growth in forex
trading at his investment house is due to the demands of fund managers for
'currency overlay'. This is especially necessary, given the six-point
differential between short-term interest rates in Germany and the Federal
Bank's funds rate in the US.
'More and more, we see pension funds farming out the currency side of their
portfolios,' he says. 'Eighty or 90 per cent of our revenue is now from
client-generated business. If we don't have a client base with massive
growth we will be left behind.'
In addition, foreign exchange dealers need to be constantly on the look-out
for new markets to counteract the fall in exchange rate volatility. Mr
Simmonds of Citibank believes that the market will contract further with
European Monetary Union. 'There will be less volatility as the currencies
converge,' he says, 'and we will have to look beyond the frontiers of Europe
for new currencies to trade.'
He has his sights set on two regions. First, the currencies of Latin
America, whose equity markets were among the best performers last year.
Second, the currencies of eastern Europe, above all the Russian rouble. 'As
Russia moves towards full convertibility, we need to be involved,' he says.
'If the options close in European currencies, other opportunities must open
up.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Canary Wharf move upsets equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that Canary Wharf, the docklands property development, is being put
into administration provided the trigger for another round of profit-taking
and general selling pressure in London.
Worries that the latest moves could lead to the big UK banks taking
substantial provisions against their loans to Olympia &amp; York, developers of
Canary Wharf, knocked share prices of the banks and caused tremors
throughout the rest of the market. The selling took its toll of a market
that has seemingly run out of steam as the end of the long three-week
trading account looms.
London was also subdued by the absence of any substantial interest from the
Continent, where a number of markets were closed for Ascension Day. The
FT-SE Index lost 4.4 at 2,694.2, extending the fall this week to almost 21
points.
The day began with the Footsie future leading the cash market sharply lower
on the Canary Wharf news, the June contract dropping again to a discount to
fair value. Both the futures and the cash market quickly rallied, however,
with the Footsie, down almost seven points early in the session, recovering
strongly to post a gain of more than eight points by mid-morning.
Over lunch, the markets began to wilt afresh, worried by the prospect of yet
more bad news from the property arena. The Footsie retreated to show a fall
of 9.2 before embarking on a modest late rally, helped by the relatively
good showing by Wall Street, which was up eight points as London closed.
There was more good news on turnover, with customer business on Wednesday,
admittedly boosted by a big programme trade, expanding to Pounds 1.315bn.
Turnover yesterday amounted to 520.7m shares.
Tesco, the supermarket group, produced the best performance among the
Footsie constituents, still responding to switching operations being carried
out by leading brokers, involving the sale of cyclical stocks and the
purchase of more defensive issues.
BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance group, rose strongly after
encouraging remarks by the chairman at the annual meeting. Retailing group
Sears also made good progress. On the downside, Taylor Woodrow fell almost 8
per cent, with some large lines of stock said to have been on offer. British
Steel was weak after Smith New Court adopted a bearish stance on the shares.
Suggestions that next Wednesday's preliminary figures from Siebe may include
a rights issue were rejected by dealers, but not before the shares had
fallen sharply.
British Gas, one of the market's best performers over the past week amid
stories that a break-up of the company may be in the offing, turned easier
after Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, said it was
considering downgrading Gas's debt ratings.
Vodafone, the cellular radio group, was persistently sold after news that
the merger of US groups Sprint and Centel implied lower cellular valuations.
Cable and Wireless was hit by disappointing results from its near 60 per
cent owned associate Hong Kong Telecom, while oil shares ran out of steam.

FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures started with a hangover and ended with a brief rally in
a quiet day's trading marked by the absence of continental interest because
of holidays, writes Christopher Price.
Although expected to start brightly, the June contract was marked back at
the opening as the news on Olympia &amp; York depressed both equity and futures
markets.
From the 2,700 level, June eventually shrugged off the bad news and began to
climb on limited buying interest. It reached 2,720 by 10.15am, which proved
to be the high point of the day.
From then, June spent most of the session in slow decline with few buyers -
particularly with the absence of European traders - around to enliven
proceedings. It hit its low point at 2,698 by 3.15pm, when a firmer Wall
Street reinforced a brief rally.
June closed at 2,705, two points down on the previous session, but at a
premium to fair value of around five. Volume was a paltry 4,791 contracts.
In traded options, British Steel was the top traded stock, recording 3,570
contracts. This was followed by BT with 2,364 lots, the August 360 calls
being particularly busy, and British Gas at 1,790 contracts.
Total volume was 26,544, compared with Wednesday's 37,651.

FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property woes hurt Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM CLOUDS continued to gather over Barclays, the high street clearer most
heavily exposed to the enormous debts facing the property industry.
The anticipated effect on the bank's annual profits prompted securities
house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew to cut its 1992 profits forecast by a third
yesterday. Barclays shares, which had already fallen by 25p over the past
week, ended 5 lower at 369p after 3.9m traded.
UBS pared its pre-tax figure to Pounds 400m from Pounds 600m, moving from
around the top of the range of analysts' estimates to the bottom, below even
bearish County NatWest, which is on Pounds 475m. However, it maintained its
hold recommendation and forecast a flat 21.2p dividend.
Steel retreats
Worries that British Steel might pass its final dividend depressed the
shares in heavy turnover of 14m. Citing the poor demand for steel, continued
price weakness, and the consequent effect on revenue, Mr Ian Lowe at Smith
New Court said: 'The market has a 50-50 chance of getting no final dividend
in our view.'
With the company due to report full-year results next month, there was also
talk in the market that a serious discussion about the presentation of the
figures was taking place at British Steel.
Smith is predicting a loss of around Pounds 100m for the year to March 1992.
Nomura is on a similar amount, but expects a final dividend of about 1.5p.
The shares finished 5 cheaper at 77 1/2 p.
Vodafone sold
Sellers were active in Vodafone, which recorded the second biggest turnover
of the day among the FT-SE constituents, as some investors reflected on the
implications for cellular valuations following the merger of two big US
telecoms groups on Wednesday.
The Dollars 2.85bn deal between Centel and Sprint values the former's
cellular per population at Dollars 40 - compared with a rating of around
Dollars 105 for Vodafone. This had caused some US investors to re-evaluate
Vodafone, according to market talk, and prompted a bout of selling in the
shares, which declined 10 to 384p in turnover of 13m.
Figures from Cable and Wireless subsidiary Hong Kong Telecom were in line
with expectations but failed to stop the shares sliding, which left many
commentators perplexed and blaming erroneous rumours. HK Telecom provides C
and W with some 60 per cent of its profits.
A story that Kleinwort Benson, a strong bull of C and W, had downgraded the
group filtered into the market early on and immediately depressed the
shares. The story was dismissed by Kleinwort as rubbish, analyst Mr Tim
Hurst reiterating the broker's positive stance on the stock.
There was also some talk of worries over the regulatory situation in Hong
Kong, but little evidence to sustain it. Turnover in C and W was a poor
2.6m. The shares, down to 569p at one stage, finished a net 13 off at 575p.
Conglomerate BAT Industries rose sharply after a confident statement about
expected 1992 profits and dividend payout at the company's annual meeting.
The shares are never very heavily traded and a shortage of stock among some
dealers ensured that the price was squeezed up 22 to 807p.
Warnings of a lowered rating prompted British Gas to fall 5 to 259p on
turnover of 9.1m shares. Credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said
it may lower the AAA long-term ratings of British Gas, and subsidiary debt
guaranteed by the parent.
Oils were down again after profit-takers moved in following the recent sharp
gains that reflected the rise in the price of Brent crude. Lasmo was
additionally hurt by a profits forecast cut from BZW. The investment bank
also argued that Lasmo would reduce its dividend and, although the revision
follows a sharp downgrade last week by SG Warburg, the shares fell 6 to
207p.
Exploration Co of Louisiana was firm at 85p on the back of an in-depth buy
recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite, the company's broker.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome retreated in early trading after news of
competition in Canada for its Aids drug Retrovir. The rival version is to be
sold at a big discount to Retrovir. Although analysts said there could be
pricing implications outside Canada, they pointed out that Retrovir's
Canadian market is miniscule.
The shares were off 16 at one point but volume was small and the stock was
later marked up. The announcement of a co-promotion agreement for a Zovirax
brand to treat chicken pox also helped sentiment. .Wellcome closed 3 off at
985p.
An upbeat meeting on satisfactory results failed to stop Thorn EMI sliding
10 to 835p.
South West, one of the first water companies to report son, declined 9 to
437p as investors took the slightly higher than expected dividend growth of
8.5 per cent and then sold the shares. Analysts said the price drop
represented a special ex-dividend situation and did not indicate
disappointment with the company's results, as profits rose to Pounds 90m
from Pounds 88.2m.
Laporte rose 9 to 632p, dealers focusing on the Pounds 2m a year saving from
job cuts.
The first day's full trading in Industrial Control Services saw the shares
placed at 110p and leap to 149p. Turnover was 6.2m shares.
The market was pleased at the lack of a seasonal price campaign from leading
supermarket groups, and also suggested that profits should improve during
the summer on higher margin products, such as meat, fruit and vegetables.
Tesco rose 9 1/2 to 273p ahead of today's annual meeting, which analysts
generally believe will be upbeat, while J. Sainsbury climbed 7 1/2 to 465p.
Oil manufacturer Acatos &amp; Hutcheson was the main mover in the food
manufacturing sector, surging 23 to 120p after reporting an unexpected 29
per cent rise in half-year profits and higher interim divided.
Guinness gained 13 to 589p, recovering all of the loss suffered on Wednesday
on a gloomy annual statement, as marketmakers remained generally optimistic
about the company's prospects.
Increasing concern about rising oil prices, and negative sentiment after
Goldman Sachs turned bearish on international airlines, left British Airways
6 lighter at 294p.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Program purchases lift Dow to
record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LATE round of program buying helped Wall Street set a new record yesterday
afternoon, in spite of a strong sell-off in airline issues, and in cellular
telephone stocks following news of a stock-swap merger between Sprint and
Centel valuing Centel at Dollars 2.85bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which posted only slim gains through most
of the day, surged in the last minutes of trading to close 27.99 ahead at
3,398.43.
New York SE volume stayed moderate, at 195.3m shares, while advances
outpaced declines by 986 to 689. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 4.57 to
416.74 and the Nasdaq composite was up 3.14 at 580.49.
Mr Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in New York, said equities
were helped by the strength of the bond market through the day, but 'it was
the programme buying at the end of the day which really lifted the market'.
There was little reaction to news that jobless claims for the week ending
May 16 had fallen by 4,000 in a week when many analysts had expected claims
to rise.
A proposed stock-swap merger between Sprint, the third biggest US
long-distance telephone company, and Centel, a Chicago-based local telephone
concern, wreaked havoc with telephone company stocks yesterday. Investors
were jolted by the low valuation of Centel, whose holders will receive
Sprint stock valued at Dollars 33.57, nearly Dollars 9 below Centel's
closing price of Dollars 42 1/2 on Wednesday. Centel plummeted Dollars 10
5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 yesterday and Sprint slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
23 1/8 .
The low price threw into question how other cellular companies are valued
and led to strong selling of cellular company shares. Lin Broadcasting fell
Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 68, McCaw Cellular Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2
and GTE Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 1/4 .
Among other long-distance carriers, AT&amp;T firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42
1/2 and MCI Communications put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 .
The airline sector was depressed by concern about an accelerated fare war
triggered by news that American Airlines was cutting its lowest advance
purchase fares by 50 per cent. AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed
Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 5/8 , UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 114, USAir lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 12 1/8 and
Delta Air Lines eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57.
Shares in US cereal makers rose after Kellogg said it was increasing US
cereal prices by an average of 3.5 per cent. Kellogg moved ahead Dollars 3
3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 , General Mills Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/4 and
Quaker Oats Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 .
Auto issues, which climbed on Wednesday after surprisingly strong mid-May
car sales, were higher. Ford firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 , General
Motors Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
18 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a small decline after moderate trading. The composite index
ended 7.5 off at 3,375.3 as falls outnumbered rises by 293 to 235. Volume
came to 25.6m shares valued at CDollars 324.7m.
The financial services group shed 0.88 per cent as the leading Canadian
banks continued to report their second-quarter results and the effect on
those results of Olympia &amp; York's financial problems.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar eases on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING was quiet on the foreign exchanges as much of northern Europe
celebrated Ascension Day.
The dollar drifted down on profit-taking after Wednesday's strong
performance. Modestly encouraging US weekly jobless claims data raised
barely a flicker of interest.
Jobless claims fell to a seven-month low of 403,000 from a revised 407,000
the week before. Forecasts had been for another rise to 408,000. Analysts
said the figures were consistent with a rise in May non-farm payrolls of
100,000 or slightly more, and would therefore keep the Federal Reserve from
further easing.
By mid-afternoon the US unit had drifted down about  3/4 pfennig to
DM1.6275, after Wednesday's close of DM1.6345. The softening of the US
currency also followed rumours that the Bank of Japan had been intervening
to steady the yen.
A trader said he suspected that the BoJ intervened in Tokyo over night but
doubted that it had carried on into European trading.
At the Tokyo close the dollar stood at Y129.92 and DM1.6340. It ended in
Europe at Y129.50 and DM1.6265. In the US the dollar finished around the
London levels, trading subdued by a quiet domestic news background and the
European holiday.
It finally stood at DM1.6270 and Y129.50, down from opening New York levels
of DM1.6310 and Y129.85. Traders were waiting for the M2 measure of the
money supply, which was expected to show a fall of Dollars 3.7bn compared
with a rise of Dollars 5.4bn the previous week.
A drop in M2 of Dollars 5bn or more would take annual growth back below the
floor of the Federal Reserve's 2.5 to 5.5 per cent target range and keep
fears of another easing alive, analysts said.
The pound remained subdued in the quiet market. Traders said the slight
retreat in the dollar had helped the D-Mark at sterling's expense, and there
were also signs that the pound was being sold for French francs following
news on Wednesday that the French trade surplus jumped to a record FFr7.79bn
in April from FFr1.06bn the month before.
The peseta survived a half-day general strike relatively unscathed. Spanish
officials and businesses dismissed the effect of the strike but unions
believed it would force a change of heart on controversial labour reforms.
Economy minister Mr Carlos Solchaga plans to accelerate liberalisation of
the Spanish economy in order to meet European economic and monetary union
convergence requirements.
The Spanish currency closed at Pta183.10 against the pound, compared with
Wednesday's finish of Pta183.40.
Dealers warned that trading in Europe was likely to stay quiet for the rest
of the week.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian tin mine brought back
to life - The third incarnation of the Sungei Lembing operation in Pahang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S Sungei Lembing tin deposit has demonstrated once again that you
cannot keep a good mine down.
Once the world's biggest single sources of tin, it was flooded and abandoned
during the Japanese occupation in the Second World War. It was reopened at
the end of the war but flooded again in 1987, after the operating company
was forced into liquidation as a result of the slump in tin prices.
Undaunted by its chequered history, however, a Chinese-Malaysian partnership
has reopened the mine, partially pumping out the workings to resume hard
rock mining, and has longer term plans to bring the entire complex back into
operation.
The recent recovery in tin prices, with LME quotations reaching an 18-month
high and Kuala Lumpur Tin Market prices at their highest levels since August
1991, has come too late to save many of the higher-cost producers. The
closure on May 1 of Gopeng, Malaysia's largest hydraulic tin mining
operation, is the latest casualty in a lengthy list of mine closures brought
about by the collapse of the International Tin Council's buffer stock
operation in October 1985 and the subsequent slump in prices as more than
100,000 tonnes of stockpiled tin were released on to the market.
High-cost, hard rock mining - including the whole of the Cornish industry,
the Kelapa Kampit mine in Indonesia and, briefly, Australia's Renison, the
world's largest underground tin mine - fell victim to the slump. Low-cost
Brazilian operations added to the pressure on tin prices, forcing much of
the traditional source of supply in south-east Asia - dredges and gravel
pump mines - out of business. Last year, Malaysia mined less tin than in any
year since the Second World War, producing 20,710 tonnes, 27 per cent down
on 1990's 28,468 tonnes and less than a third of average annual output in
the 1970s. The most spectacular victim of the tin price slump was the Sungei
Lembing mine, Malaysia's only hard rock mining operation, which was run by
the Pahang Consolidated Company.
Before the advent of the first dredges at the turn of the century, the mine
had employed more than 5,000 lode miners and produced in excess of 4,000
tonnes a year from more than 800km (500 miles) of workings. It was the most
extensively developed underground tin mine in the world.
The mine was still producing more than of 2,000 tonnes a year up to 1977.
But output then began to decline steadily with only 744 tonnes produced in
1986, the last full year of operations.
In 1987, PCC was forced into liquidation, the pumps were switched off and
the workings flooded. All the mining equipment and infrastructure -
including headframes, dressing sheds and the rail network - was dismantled
for scrap and among those who came to purchase PCC's salvage were two mining
executives from a recently worked-out Perak tin mine.
The two men, Chinese geologist Sia Hok Kiang and Malaysian businessman Dato'
Haji Nasir, current president of the Pahang Malay Chamber of Commerce, found
out that while the fire sale of PCC's equipment was proceeding some of the
mine's former face workers were covertly recovering valuable ore from the
abandoned mine. Disguising himself as a miner, Mr Sia joined the illegal
operators to explore the abandoned workings and concluded that, given
sufficient venture capital, it could be brought back to life.
In July 1989, the Chinese-Malaysian business partnership decided to take an
option on the mine. Mr Sia flew to the UK to discuss the viability of
reopening Sungei Lembing with PCC's former general manager, Mr Henry Hodding
and, given sufficient encouragement from Mr Hodding's extensive knowledge
and first-hand experience of the mine, he approached the World Bank in
Washington for aid. Although the Bank offered to put up 50 per cent of the
costs of a feasibility study, the scale of the Dollars 4.1m project to
reopen the mine was too small to meet the Bank's minimum project criteria.
Mr Sia then approached the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which
agreed to put up Dollars 1.5m in return for a one-third stake in the venture
and, with local financing subsequently secured to raise the minimum initial
Dollars 4.1m operating finance, the decision was taken to reopen the mine on
a 15-year lease to 2005.
By mid-1990, when tin prices were about MDollars 16 a kilogram, half the
level obtaining prior to the 1985 crisis, and with an accelerating closure
of much of the world's tin mining capacity, Sungei Lembing became the first
lode tin mine to reopen and start operations since the market collapse.
Widespread industry scepticism greeted the move, the venture being dismissed
as undercapitalised and doomed to failure.
Some two years later the new operating company, Sungei Lembing Tin, is
gearing up to increase output from an initial 1.5-2.0 tonnes a month 7
tonnes a month, and has established proved and probable reserves of 757,000
tonnes, grading 1.34 per cent tin, or 7,200 tonnes recoverable metal.
Of Sungei Lembing's three major mining sections, only Cakak is currently
being worked but the company's goal remains to make the entire mine fully
operational by pumping out and reopening the other two sections, Willinks
and Myah. The headframe is back in place at the Cakak section and the mine
has been dewatered for development down to the first level, 120 ft (40m)
below the surface. Dewatering continues and, by the end of 1993 the company
hopes to be operating down to the 15th level.
The rehabilitation of Sungei Lembing flies in the face of conventional
wisdom that tin is a sunset industry, a view most recently voiced by no less
a person than Malaysia s minister of primary industries, Datuk Seri Lim Keng
Yaik, who advised tin miners to get out of the business, export their
technology and diversify into alternative employment.
With world tin stocks expected to be down to 25,000 tonnes by the end of
this year, the lowest level since 1982, and tin prices rising in response to
near equilibrium in the supply/demand balance, the entrepreneurial courage
of a Chinese geologist and Malaysian businessman is being rewarded.
Some 100 miners currently employed at the lode mine have breathed new life
into the small township of Sungei Lembing, some 50km north of the Pahang
state capital, Kuantan. The town was wholly dependent for its livelihood on
the fortunes of the tin mine and was left for dead when PCC went into
liquidation in 1987. Business has now returned to the small shops and street
traders, and Sia Hok Kiang and Dato' Haji Nasir are being hailed as the
saviours of the local community.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tight copper supply forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER producers will struggle to keep pace with future demand because of
shortages of smelting capacity, said Mr Alex Balogh, chief executive of
Noranda Minerals, the Canadian group, yesterday.
It was impossible to justify investment in new copper smelters because the
expected rate of return on capital was inadequate, he said. New smelters
would almost certainly take much longer to be built than some observers
expected - but analysts had probably also underestimated the industry's
ability to squeeze more production out of existing smelting capacity.
For example, Noranda might spend more than USDollars 50m to double output
from 53,000 tonnes at its Gaspe copper smelter in Quebec.
Noranda's Horne smelter, also in Quebec, might expand capacity over time.
Horne once was able to treat 1.3m tonnes of copper concentrate (an
intermediate material) a year but this had been reduced to 700,000 tonnes
(producing because of environmental pressures. Horne's output might be
increased again to 850,000 to 900,000 tonnes.
Mr Balogh said: 'I have been in this business for more than 15 years and in
all that time smelters ran with charges giving an unacceptable rate of
return on the capital required just to keep them running - just to stop the
roof from leaking'.
New copper smelters had been built but for political or strategic reasons
and this would be the case in future, he added during a presentation in
London.
Expansion at Gaspe depended on Noranda buying a high-quality copper project
or operating mine outside Canada because the mine near the smelter would
last had only another seven years.
Noranda had looked at 20 copper projects and mines and was still in
discussion about six of them.
Through Falconbridge, in which Noranda has a 50 per cent stake, the group
has an interest in Collahuasi, which promises to be one of the Chile's
biggest copper projects. Mr Balogh said it would take at least another year
to complete drilling there to work out a mine plan because the ore body was
so big and rich.
He said the copper industry would probably scrape by in future but supply
would be tight, so prices could be expected to remain buoyant. Noranda
expected copper to range in price between Dollars 1 and Dollars 1.10 a lb
this year, between Dollars 1.25 and Dollars 1.40 next year and between
Dollars 1.30 and Dollars 1.50 in 1994.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Floating-rate note revival gathers pace
as issues dwindle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ISSUE activity in the international bond market ground almost to a halt
yesterday, with public holidays in most continental European markets.
However, the revival of the floating-rate note market continued to gather
pace. Instituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the double-A rated Italian
bank, launched a Dollars 150m deal lead managed by Kidder Peabody.
The deal follows Wednesday's Dollars 200m offering by Banco di Roma, and a
string of other deals from borrowers in recent weeks ranging from Sumitomo
Bank to the City of Stockholm.
The five-year paper issued yesterday pays  3/16 per cent - 18.75 basis
points - over the six-month London interbank offered rate and was re-offered
to investors at par.
The pricing was seen as fair by participants in the deal. Banco di Roma
offered 25 basis points over Libor, but does not carry a credit rating.
Kidder Peabody estimated that around 60 per cent of yesterday's issue was
purchased by other banks.
Floating-rate notes carry only a 20 per cent risk weighting under the Basle
capital adequacy accord, against 100 per cent for corporate bonds. This
means banks need to set aside only one-fifth the capital required for
corporate debt.
The rest of the paper was bought by managers of money market funds, keen to
switch out of cash deposits to pick up a higher yield.
Syndicate officials said the return of banks to the market in any numbers
for the first time since 1990 reflected the improving credit quality of many
financial institutions. Investors are now more comfortable holding bank
bonds.
For example, Bank of American - one of the most improved credits in the US
banking sector - returned to the floating-rate note market in February for
the first time since 1987.
In addition, conditions in the interest rate swaps market have deteriorated.
Banks can now achieve a cheaper cost of funds by issuing floating-rate paper
directly, rather than issuing fixed-rate bonds and swapping the liability
into floating rate.
Moreover, other sources of bank funding have dried up. For example, many
banks funded themselves by placing structured bonds - paper linked to the
Tokyo stock market, for example - with institutional investors in Japan.
This ready source of funding has declined with the turbulence of Japanese
financial markets.
New issue activity is expected to remain subdued today. Next week, however,
syndicate officials are anticipating deals in the Eurodollar sector. Among
the potential issuers is Spintab, the mortgage subsidiary of Swedbank,
rumoured to be planning a five-year issue of around Dollars 250m.
Investor AB, the holding company controlled by Sweden's Wallenberg family,
plans to make an Ecu-denominated convertible bond issue in the international
bond market Yesterday, the company started a series of presentations to
international investors and plans to launch an offer 'within the next few
weeks'.
The company already has Swedish krona-denominated convertibles outstanding
in the domestic market. It plans to buy back these bonds from institutional
investors, change the currency denomination under provisions already in
place, and re-offer the stock on the international market.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise as investors await money
supply data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY prices extended their gains yesterday afternoon, shrugging off
signs of further improvement in the US labour market, but turnover was light
as investors awaited the late afternoon release of weekly money supply
figures.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/2 at 101
19/32 , yielding 7.854 per cent. Intermediate issues posted similar gains,
while at the short end the two-year note was  1/8 higher for a yield of
5.192 per cent.
Bond prices initially slipped on the back of a decline in jobless claims in
the week ended May 16. The number of claims fell 4,000 to 403,000 when the
market had expected them to rise by about 3,000. But the lower prices
encouraged some retail buying.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange four-day repurchase
agree ments. Analysts said the Fed was facing a large requirement for
additional funds and the Fed's operation, which adds liquidity to the
banking system, was widely expected. Fed funds, the rate at which banks lend
to each other, were chang ing hands at about 7 7/8 per cent at the time of
the Fed's action. The perceived target for the rate is 3 3/4 per cent.
UK long-dated government bonds rose up to a quarter of a percentage point in
dull trade yesterday, but gains at the short end of the yield curve were
held in check now that hopes of another cut in the base rate have faded.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 118 1/8 to end
the day at 118 13/32 . News that the latest Pounds 150m tranche of 2 1/2 per
cent index-linked stock due 2020 was exhausted yesterday afternoon helped to
buoy up the index-linked sector of the market, traders said.
The tranche was one of two Pounds 150m taps of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked
stock announced on May 20. The other tranche, due 2013, was exhausted on May
21. However, a Pounds 800m issue of 9 per cent conversion stock due 2000 is
still overhanging the market, and dealers expect the Bank to set the date
for another gilt auction fairly soon.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer, helped by the slightly
stronger yen and a rebound in US Treasury bond prices early in the day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.59 per cent, corresponding
to the low price of the day, and ended at 5.555 per cent. Volumes were low,
with only Y233bn traded in the benchmark No 129 JGB. The September futures
contract moved from its opening of 101.35 to a high of 101.44 before closing
at 101.42.
The dollar traded above Y130 overnight at 130.20, but the Bank of Japan
intervened yesterday morning to support the yen, which ended trading at
around 129.75.
POSITIVE economic data pushed Australian government bond yields higher
yesterday, particularly among the short-dated issues.
Company profits jumped 13 per cent in the March quarter, whereas analysts
had expected an increase of only 10 per cent. The news prompted a sell-off
in the bond market. 'The stronger figures were taken as an indication that
the recession is bottoming out which makes the chances of another easing in
interest rates less likely now,' said one dealer.
April 1995 Commonwealth bonds closed weaker, yielding 7.97 per cent against
Wednesday's close of 7.82 per cent. The benchmark November 2001 Commonwealth
bond yield also rose, finishing the day at 9.19 per cent, compared with 9.12
per cent the previous day.
THE EUROPEAN government bond markets saw little activity yesterday as many
were closed for the Ascension Day holiday, and traders expect activity to be
lacklustre today as well. German government bond futures edged up in London
trading as dealers covered their short positions.
Italian bonds eased lower with cash and futures prices moving down in thin
trading. Operators attributed the losses to covering ploys ahead of the
expiry of the Liffe June futures contract. The cash market had been awaiting
the results of the Treasury auction for L3,000bn June 1, 1999, CCTs. The
price of 97.75, announced after the close, was in line with forecasts.
It is the first of three issues for a total of L10,000bn, with L3,000bn of
fixed-rate 10-year bonds (BTP) being auctioned today.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Du Pont reduces toxic emission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company, said the level of its toxic
chemical releases declined by 30 per cent in 1990, thanks to advanced
technologies.
Using data it supplied to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington,
Du Pont said that 1990 toxic releases from more than 80 plants in the US
amounted to 236m pounds, compared with 339m pounds in 1989.
Some two-thirds of the toxic releases were piped into deep underground
wells.
Mr Bruch Karrh, Du Pont vice-president in charge of environmental affairs,
said the company's goal by 2,000 was essentially to eliminate the
underground injection of hazardous chemical process wastes.
Meanwhile, Raytheon, the defence, electronics and aircraft company, has
issued a report on its own efforts to reduce environmental damage caused by
its manufacturing.
The Massachusetts-based company said it reduced chemical releases to the
environment by 58 per cent between 1987 and last year.
Based on reports from 22 plants across the US, Raytheon said its total
chemical releases were 2.5m pounds in 1991, down from 5.9m pounds in 1987.
It achieved the reductions through a combination of chemical substitutions,
process modifications and chemical management controls.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: HK Telecom advances on strong
growth in revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG Kong Telecommuni-cations, the colony's biggest company, yesterday met
the market's expectations when it announced a 14 per cent increase in net
earnings to HKDollars 5.67bn (USDollars 732.5m) in the year to end-March,
against HKDollars 4.96bn in the previous 12 months.
The profit rise was struck on a 13 per cent advance in turnover to HKDollars
18.37bn from HKDollars 16.26bn. International and local telephone revenues
grew by 15 per cent and other telecommunications services, which mainly
represent mobile communications, rose 13 per cent.
Mr Michael Gale, chief executive, said the results were satisfactory,
particularly as profits had been hit this year by a much higher tax rate.
The company paid HKDollars 833.4m in tax, 98 per cent higher than the
HKDollars 420m paid in 1991.
Directors have recommended a final dividend of 20.5 cents a share. With the
interim payout of 17.5 cents, the total for the year will be 38 cents, up 15
per cent.
Hong Kong Telecom's results continued to underline the importance of the
Chinese market to the company's business. Of last year's 1.6bn minutes of
international traffic, China accounted for 671m minutes - a 35 per cent
increase over the previous year. This business produced revenues of
HKDollars 2.77bn last year. For China it produced revenues in excess of
HKDollars 500m.
The company is developing its relations with Chinese telecommunications
authorities, especially in southern China. It will train 600 executives from
the Guangdong's telecoms authority this year and has so far given China 1m
lines of analogue telecommunications equipment.
The company is negotiating with the Hong Kong government over the future of
its domestic monopoly, which comes up for renewal in 1995. It is under
pressure from government to cut its domestic and international telephone
charges.
Mr Gale said the company expected to see increased competition in the coming
years. He added that the company's negotiations with government were
continuing.
However, the company appears to have persuaded the government to change its
system of regulation from one in which its domestic profits are capped to an
allowable return on shareholders funds to a system of regulation of tariffs
based on the inflation rate.
On international business, which provides more than 60 per cent of revenues,
the company is reported to have offered an 8 per cent average reduction in
charges, linked to a promise of no average increase in charges over the next
five years.
Hong Kong Telecom is 58.4 per cent owned by the UK's Cable and Wireless.
CITIC, the Beijing investor, holds 20 per cent of the company.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: BankAmerica to close 82 branches
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKAMERICA Corporation is to close 82 branches in four states as it begins
to consolidate its own branches with those of Security Pacific Corporation,
with which it merged in April, an official for the bank said in Los Angeles
yesterday.
He said BankAmerica had notified customers that it would close 21 branches
in Arizona, 32 in Washington, 22 in Oregon and 7 in Nevada.
The official would not comment on how many branches BankAmerica would close
in California, although some analysts have estimated the number at 300.
The Dollars 4bn merger of the two banks, both west coast-based, was the
biggest takeover in US banking history.
BankAmerica's chairman, Mr Richard Rosenberg, said recently that BankAmerica
would not begin the consolidation process in California until September.
As part of the merger, BankAmerica had been required to divest 220 branches
in four states.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Investors hostile to Sprint
merger proposal - Why Wall Street has not welcomed the Dollars 2.8bn Centel
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sprint, the US long-distance telephone company, and Centel, a large
Chicago-based local and cellular telephone company, were yesterday battling
to turn back a wave of investor and Wall Street hostility to the Dollars
2.8bn merger they announced on Wednesday night.
The deal put a value on Centel far lower than its recent share price had
indicated. Centel's stock plummeted yesterday and the share prices of most
other US telecommunications companies also dropped as the market puzzled
over their worth.
Mr Jack Frazee, chairman of Centel, insisted at a news conference that the
merger - to be achieved by a share swap - was 'the most financially
attractive deal for shareholders right now' and offered important long-term
advantages.
The deal is the latest example of a wave of consolidation sweeping through
the US telecommunications industry, thanks to technical, regulatory and
financial change. If it goes through, it would create a unique business -
the only US company operating in all the three leading telecommunications
markets: long distance, local and cellular.
But Wall Street analysts said the pact, which requires the approval of a
majority of Centel shareholders, might be rejected by them, and several key
investors expressed anger over the terms.
Mr Kenneth Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, said: 'I do not find the
merger attractive and believe the company's shareholders will reject it . .
. I feel the company is worth much more.'
The merger, which the two companies stress would be tax free to
shareholders, involves the conversion of each share of Centel's common stock
into 1.37 shares of Sprint stock and would leave Centel shareholders with
around 35 per cent of the combined business.
Yesterday Sprint shares dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 23 1/8 , valuing
each Centel share at Dollars 31 5/8 and the whole group at Dollars 2.69bn.
However, many analysts had previously put a break-up value of Dollars 4bn or
more on Centel and on Wednesday night, just before the merger announcement,
the shares had closed at Dollars 42 1/2 . By yesterday's close they were
down at Dollars 31 7/8 .
The combined group will be called Sprint, and Mr William Esrey, Sprint's
chairman and chief executive, will retain these titles.
Mr Frazee will become president and chief operating officer of the new
group, and Centel will get six seats on a 16-person board .
Sprint is the third largest long-distance carrier in the US, where it has
faced an uphill battle competing with industry leaders American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph and MCI. It also operates local phone services in 17 states,
serving more than 4m access lines.
The acquisition of Centel will add another 1.6m local access lines in six
states - four of them common to Sprint - and take Sprint back into the
fast-growing cellular market, where Centel serves areas with a population of
20m. Ironically, Sprint sold its cellular business to Centel several years
ago.
Mr Esrey said the combination of the local businesses would give Sprint
'real critical mass' and produce increased efficiency and lower costs. He
hoped eventually to save around Dollars 100m a year in operating costs,
including a reduction of around 1,000 in combined employees. Sprint has
43,000 workers and Centel 9,300.
He added that the US would increasingly see a 'blurring of the boundaries'
between local telephone companies, long distance ones, cellular
communications and the cable television industry. The Centel deal meant
Sprint would have a head start in this process, and would be able to offer
customers 'one stop shopping'.
Many analysts agree the US industry is heading gradually in this direction,
although there remain formidable regulatory barriers to the process.
The 1984 anti-trust break-up of AT&amp;T, or Ma Bell, which used to provide both
long-distance and local services, prevents AT&amp;T from entering the local
market and the so-called 'Baby Bell' regional companies, which were spun out
of it, from entering the long-distance market.
However, these restrictions do not apply to the non-Bell companies which
provide a substantial part of America's telecommunications services.
Several other large telecommunications companies expressed interest in
buying parts of Centel, but not all of it, and Mr Frazee said he had been
surprised that the bidding had not been more active.
'There has been widespread speculation on the value of local telephone
company assets. These have all been changed with this process,' added Mr
Esrey.
However, some Wall Street analysts argued that Centel had chosen to put
itself on the market at a poor time, when other large telephone companies
were already absorbed with recent acquisitions.

<TEXT>
FIAT Auto yesterday signed a final agreement with Poland which will give the
Italian carmaker a 90 per cent share in the Fabryka Samochodow
Malolltrazowych (FSM) car plant. The deal, worth some USDollars 2bn,
represents the largest foreign investment in the country to date.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, flew to Poland for a signing ceremony
which closed over a year of negotiations. The deal commits the Italian
carmaker to Poland for well into the next century.
'Fiat also becomes a Polish company today after 70 years of co-operation,'
said Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the interim finance minister, who signed the
agreement for the Polish government.
FSM, at Bielsko Biala in southern Poland, was built in the 1970s to produce
the Fiat 126 small car under licence from the Italians. Last year Fiat's new
Cinquecento model came on stream at the plant's Tychy works.
The agreement marks Poland's first investment deal with a big company from
the European Community. Poland has an association agreement with the
community, under which barriers to trade in industrial goods are to be
dismantled by the year 2,000.
Yesterday Mr Paolo Cantarella, the head of Fiat Auto, signed an agreement
which envisages the formation of Newco in place of FSM, which is to be
capitalised at Dollars 200m. Of this, Dollars 180m will come from Fiat. This
gives the Italian carmaker 90 per cent of the shares, with 10 per cent
retained by the Polish government.
Fiat has also agreed to cover Dollars 500m of FSM's foreign currency debts,
raised to finance the Cinquecento development. It will also cover Dollars
200m of the plant's obligations to Polish banks and suppliers. Fiat will
also have to cover the losses the plant is expected to incur up till 1996.

<TEXT>
AMOCO, the US oil and gas company suffering from reduced profit margins, has
become the latest energy group to scale back its planned 1992 capital and
exploration spending.
The company said it would cut 1992 spending by 12 per cent, from Dollars
3.7bn to Dollars 3.26bn. The scheduled 1992 budget was already lower than
the Dollars 4.16bn allocated last year.
Amoco has also told its 54,000 employees it may seek some job cuts later
this year.
Like Mobil, Texaco and other US energy groups, Amoco is feeling the effects
of a weak US economy, low energy prices, and lower demand for a range of it
petroleum products.
The US energy sector is generally seeking ways to reduce overheads, through
redundancies, plant closures, deferred project investments and immediate
cuts in capital expenditure.
Amoco's decision to cut spending comes in the wake of a 52.4 per cent drop
in its first-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 234m. Earnings at most US oil
and gas companies are expected to continue to decline during the second
quarter of 1992.

Turnover declined from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 17.9m - the USM-quoted group
has interests in the marketing, hire and development of power tools and
lifting and welding equipment.
A proposed final dividend of 4.5p on the enlarged capital makes a 7p (6.4p)
total.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Nickolls reduces deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clarke, Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property company, cut year-end pre-tax losses
to Pounds 727,000 against Pounds 7.2m after an exceptional charge of Pounds
1.5m compared with Pounds 8.5m.
Mr Eric Lyall, chairman, said the outlook was 'a little brighter' and added
that provision had been made for losses on development operations following
the decision to withdraw from that sector of the market.
Administrative expenses were reduced by a further 10 per cent to Pounds
905,000 and would continue to fall with the reduction in activities, he
said.
There is no dividend.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Coplex withdraws bid for Tuskar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coplex, the Australian exploration company, has withdrawn its all-share bid
for Tuskar Resources, the Irish oil exploration group, having received
acceptances of 47.6 per cent by the closing date.
Earlier this month Tuskar recommended acceptance of the offer.
A statement made on behalf of Coplex said given the likely time needed to
reach the objective of acquiring 80 per cent of Tuskar, it had decided to
allow the offer to lapse.
Since the offer was made in March, Coplex has acquired a derived 54 per cent
interest in Tuskar's exploration licences in Colombia, its principal asset.
The interest was acquired in exchange for 10m Coplex shares and an
undertaking to carry out drilling obligations in the licence areas over the
coming year.
Tuskar was in danger of losing the licences by June, as it was unable to
raise the necessary finance to continue the drilling programme.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Consortium buys control of Sumit Equity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT OF Sumit Equity Ventures, a group of three venture capital funds
with Pounds 43m of investments and Pounds 13m of cash under its control, has
been sold by Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based stockbroker.
A consortium led by Mr Lindsay Bury, a founder of Apricot Computers and a
founder director of Allied Dunbar, the financial services group, is paying
Pounds 200,000 to Sharp.
The transaction represents an expansion into the Midlands for the venture
capital operations of Schroder Ventures, a partnership which is part of the
Schroder Group. Schroder Ventures, with North of England Ventures, an
affiliate, are, with Sharp, the other members of the consortium.
The sale is the second transaction this week in which Sharp has been
involved. Earlier, it sold its stake in Sharelink, the execution-only share
dealing service, to the management. The two transactions, Sharp said, were
'entirely discrete': it had never intended to be a long term holder of
Sharelink and, in the case of Sumit, 'logic pointed to larger and stronger
units able to raise substantial amounts of money.'
Mr Bury explained that Sumit would remain Midlands-based but that it would
be making investments in co-operation with Schroder Ventures.
Although the performance of Sumit is acknowledged to have been disappointing
since the onset of recession, Mr Bury said the investments had been written
down to a realistic level - 'most of the difficulties have occurred.' He
added that, as the economy moves out of recession and with Sumit working
from a lower cost base, 'there is scope for upward movement.'
The boards and structures of the three Sumit funds, one of which is quoted,
will remain the same, although, as Mr Bury put it, 'there will be a hands-on
management style.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Thorn bolstered by strong performance from music arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN EMI, the UK electrical and entertainment group, yesterday reported a
slight fall in profits in the year to March, bolstered by a strong
performance from the music division.
Although the recession hit rental income, group pre-tax profits fell only
from Pounds 258.6m to Pounds 255.1m. Sales were up 8 per cent, at Pounds
3.95bn.
Earnings per share fell from 54.1p to 48.5p. Final dividend is 21.5p, making
a total of 30.1p for the year - up 3 per cent on last year after adjustment
for the rights issue that funded the Pounds 510m acquisition of Virgin Music
Group earlier this year.
The group's decision to pull out of electrical retailing led to a Pounds
42.5m extraordinary charge and a Pounds 20.8m write-off of advance
corporation tax. Disposals of other businesses and the restructuring of
Thames, the television company in which Thorn has a controlling interest,
brought total charges to Pounds 120.1m before an extraordinary gain of
Pounds 34.3m from the sale of the software business to management.
On the operating side, the music business made profits of Pounds 125m, up
from Pounds 109m, on record sales of Pounds 1.13bn after the company bought
the 50 per cent of Chrysalis Records and SBK Records it did not already own.
Thorn will begin to integrate Virgin Music next Monday, on completion of the
purchase.
While sales volume fell, profits rose because of a higher percentage of
sales in higher value CDs.
The decline in consumer confidence and the decision to pass on higher VAT -
unlike competitors Granada - hit the rentals division, where profits fell
from Pounds 139.6m to Pounds 124.2m on sales of Pounds 1.1bn. Tight credit
controls and maintenance of high prices meant the division was a 'tremendous
cash generator', said Mr Colin Southgate, chairman.
Other businesses, including lighting, security systems and defence,
continued to underperform, making only Pounds 52.9m profit - down from
Pounds 69.4m on sales of Pounds 1.07bn, but still about one third of the
group total. In particular, the security division, comprising 23 different
businesses, suffered. New management has been brought in to consolidate the
number of operating centres.
Mr Southgate said that while all the businesses apart from music and rentals
were for sale, the group would only consider offers for entire businesses.
Thorn's share price shed 10p to 835p.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Life insurers win concessions in SIB's new disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, Britain's chief investment watchdog,
announced new concessions to the life insurance industry yesterday.
But the conclusions to the SIB's 13-month review of disclosure and standards
of advice for investment companies will still, if enacted, administer a
rigorous shake-up to the UK's life insurance and investment industry.
Subject to ministerial consent, the SIB proposals will be enacted by the end
of this year. Insurance companies would then be given a two-year
transitional period to implement most of them.
Two changes, lobbied for by insurers, have been made since the last SIB
consultative document was published in March:
For endowment policies, the SIB will no longer require product providers to
reveal the 'break-even year' at which the proceeds investors would receive
on surrendering a policy would exceed the premiums they had already paid in.
On some 25-year policies, this takes 10 years.
The 'reduction in policy proceeds' which companies were required to publish
to show the effect of costs on investment returns from life policies may now
be renamed the 'reduction in benefits'.
The SIB has also dropped plans to force companies to use their own charges
in projected illustrations of future performance, and to force independent
intermediaries to disclose the commission they receive at the point of sale.
It felt they would be put at a disadvantage if forced to reveal commissions
when directly employed sales agents were not.
Sir David Walker, the SIB chairman, in his last briefing before retiring
from the post to become deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, said he disagreed
with Sir Gordon Borrie, director of the Office of Fair Trading, on the
issue. He said 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist in
mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.'
Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, said: 'We don't agree with
the SIB on commission disclosure. They are more concerned to protect the
independent sector than with protecting investors, and we very much hope the
OFT will step in.'
Apart from this, the association broadly welcomed the proposals. The
Association of British Insurers welcomed some of the proposals, including
the transitional period.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Kosovo's autonomy must be restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir RUSSELL JOHNSTON MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As sanctions are imposed on Serbia and as the possibility of using
aerial and naval blockades to restrain Serbian aggression in Bosnia
Hercegovina and Croatia is seriously considered, in my view not before time,
the EC ministers must give serious attention to the situation in Kosovo.
I have just returned from observing Sunday's unofficial elections there and
can confirm your correspondent Laura Silber's report, 'Kosovo elections
raise risk of conflict' (May 26). The position in that province, which had
full autonomy within the former Yugoslav federation, is that of a people
under occupation. Police are everywhere and, even in the short time I was
there - a day and a half - I was questioned once by the roadside and on
another occasion taken to a police station for three-quarters of an hour.
Most of the police are young, about 20, appearing at once aggressive and
insecure and all armed with Kalashnikovs.
The policy of the Albanians, led by Dr Rugova, has been to seek to avoid
both confrontation and violence. It is hard to forecast how long this can
hold in the face of continued harassment, the closure of educational
establishments (there has been no Albanian secondary education for over a
year and Albanians have been sacked from the university, this in a province
which is 90 per cent Albanian and only 8 per cent Serb) and the erosion of
job opportunities. At any time things could snap, and given that the
Serbians have all the military power and have shown a capacity to use it,
unhesitatingly and ruthlessly, the outcome could be horrendous.
Throughout the break-up of Yugoslavia the EC approach has been misplaced,
first believing that Yugoslavia could, even ought, to be held together and
then attempting even-handedness between Serbia and Croatia, in the face of
the evidence of Vukovar, Osijek and Dubrovnik.
Now that the approach is more realistic, the problem of what to do about
Kosovo cannot be avoided. It is not simply that Kosovo would be made to
suffer disproportionately if sanctions bite, it is the fact that, so far,
the EC has only reacted to displays of force. The Albanian community in
Kosovo has avoided force, so it has had little attention paid to it by the
EC and relatively little media attention. If this peaceful approach is
ignored much longer, it cannot hold and we would share responsibility for
the outcome.
The EC should now make it unequivocally clear to Milosevic that the general
resolution of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, which must come at some
stage, has to include provision for the restoration of autonomy to Kosova.
It should be guaranteed an internationally organised plebiscite on its
future, similar to what was done in the Saar.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: How to revive a dead canary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSOLVENCY of Canary Wharf raises two possible prospects. One involves
cancelling a proposed underground rail link to central London. This would
add to the pressures on tenants already dismayed by the collapse to invoke
escape clauses in their leases; everyone could then watch as Europe's
biggest office development, already half empty and worth half as much as the
debt carried in its name, becomes a marbled haunt for bats and river
rodents.
The second is that those with a direct interest in avoiding this outcome -
namely the banks which effectively own Canary Wharf and the government - do
something to stop it.
So far, the government has reasoned that the banks will see that if they are
to avoid adding to their losses they must stump up the cash the original
developer, Olympia &amp; York, promised to co-finance the Jubilee Line link. Mr
Major was firm again yesterday that he has no intention of bailing out
Canary Wharf.
The government is right to drive a hard bargain; the banks are exposed not
only to Canary Wharf but to numerous other projects in east London. They
cannot expect to avoid paying a heavy price for their commercial
misjudgments.
But the bargaining cannot end there. The upgrading of east London's
transport infrastructure is crucial to the future of the only substantial
part of greater London capable of absorbing more people and buildings, not
to mention its position at the fulcrum of the proposed Channel tunnel link.
A very large amount of public funding has already been committed to
Docklands, much of it in a belated dash to address the area's chronic
transport problems.
If it is true that the Thatcher government's biggest mistake in Docklands
was its failure to provide an adequate transport system, it hardly makes
sense to deny proper transport now that the area is heavily developed. The
government should declare swiftly and firmly that it is negotiating with the
administrator to ensure that it gets the best terms possible for moving its
civil servants to Canary Wharf and for co-financing the new railway.
There is also the wider question of the government's credibility. Its urban
development corporations, using public funding to attract private sector
investment, have mostly been a success. So much so, that Mr Peter Walker,
the former Welsh secretary with whom some of those successes are associated,
is about to become head of a new urban regeneration agency. If the
government proves too hard-nosed over Canary Wharf, it will hardly be seen
as a reliable partner in future projects.
The key to Mr Walker's Welsh achievement was his ability to combine mixed
funding and a constructive relationship with (mainly Labour-controlled)
local authorities. Most of the problems of Docklands stem from the failure
in London's more turbulent political atmosphere to achieve a similar unity
of purpose. The City of London, the east London boroughs and the government
have, literally, played beggar my neighbour.
Canary Wharf may never become a global financial centre. But there is no
reason why it cannot play a useful part in the economic rehabilitation of
east London. Mr Major has set up a cabinet committee to co-ordinate London's
woefully strategy-less development. It is time Londoners heard from it.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pianist was scheduled to give two recitals in London's Festival Hall
this week, as part of a British tour which has taken him to Oxford (where he
was awarded an honorary doctorate) and which also includes Harrogate,
Birmingham, Cheltenham and Aldeburgh. Sunday's programme of Bach and Brahms
was cancelled at three hours' notice - the pianist was suffering from heat
exhaustion. However, on Wednesday he did appear, playing to a darkened
auditorium as he always does nowadays, his scores spread before him and
illuminated by a single lamp.
Richter is 77; the stern, measured platform manner has not wavered. He has
always been the most introspective of pianists, but, if anything, his
playing appears to have become even more inward-looking and intimate over
the years.
It is less concerned than ever with projecting grand dramatic schemes, much
more focused on a minutely nuanced exploration of phrase structure and
expressive meaning. If his sheer technical power seems fractionally more
effortful than in the past, the range of colour, touch and articulation
remains unequalled.
Haydn's F minor Andante con variazioni and Beethoven's Sonata Op. 110 made
up the first half of Wednesday's programme.
The Haydn was presented at a lithe, moderate pace - for this most
Schubertian of Haydn's works one had half expected Richter to settle into
his most leisurely Schubertian mode. Each half of the main theme was
coloured and flecked with glistening detail, the tiniest of rhythmic
emphases, and there was never any doubt about the point and purpose of every
single phrase.
The sonata offered countless points for contemplation, especially the
weighty, deliberate tempo for the scherzo, certainly not the allegro molto
of standard usage, yet chiming precisely with the pulsing accompaniment to
the main theme of the following Adagio, and the extraordinary, unearthly
progression, half muffled, half percussive, that marked the mid-point of the
final fugue, in which every voice had its own colour, character and purpose.
After the interval, Richter started with Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie in a
performance almost entirely purged of rhetoric, as if conceived for a
handful of friends in a quiet dacha, its focus switched entirely from heroic
gestures to the meditations of its lyrical core.
He then moved on through Skryabin to Debussy. The Skryabin performances (the
two Mazurkas of Op. 40 and the Poeme-Nocturne Op. 61) were astonishing acts
of re-creation, poetic fantasies that hardly seemed to touch solid ground
for a moment.
Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse was warmed into life with infinite patience, the
edges of its rhythmic shapes gradually hardened, the colours moving from
indistinct greys to bright primaries.
More Debussy was offered as an encore: 'La cathedrale engloutie' from the
first book of Preludes, a sequence of veiled perspectives, controlled with
absolute precision.
No one plays Debussy's piano music like Richter; no one combines his musical
insights with the complete technical command to realise them exactly. But
then, no one plays most of the piano repertory as he does, with such love
and supreme intelligence.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: The mystery of the two yarnwinders - A question of
attribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leonardo da Vinci was infinitely distractable. In 1501, the head of the
Carmelites in Florence wrote to warn Isabella d'Este that her chances of
getting a painting out of Leonardo looked worse than ever.
Leonardo, the prior reported, was so enthralled by mathematical experiments
that 'he cannot bear the brush'. No doubt more irritating still for the
marchioness was to learn that another collector, a Frenchman called
Florimond Robertet, had now jumped the queue.
Distracted Leonardo might have been, yet even so he managed to come up with
what the prior recorded as a novel version of the Virgin and Child: the
'Madonna with the Yarnwinder'. Soon, Leonardesque painters were turning out
versions and pastiches of it, both good and bad. Leonardo da Vinci.
'The Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder', at the National Gallery of
Scotland in Edinburgh, takes a close look at a problem which has long
bothered Leonardo scholars. Two unquestionably lovely versions of the theme
have survived. Which has the stronger claim to be by Leonardo, and could it
be the painting for Robertet?
Puzzle-solving exhibitions have been the success story of this decade. The
Edinburgh show runs true to type in not being particularly large, although
it is filled out with drawings and historical material on Robertet,
secretary to Charles XII. But the fact of the puzzle being about Leonardo,
makes this the most significant show about scholarly sleuthing yet. The
scholar in question is Professor Martin Kemp, creator of the memorable
Hayward Gallery show of 1989.
In 1898, two Madonnas with Yarnwinders were exhibited in the Burlington Fine
Arts Society. One belonged - as it still does - to the Duke of Buccleuch.
The other was the property of Lord Battersea and is now owned by a New York
collector. As is the way of these things, each has had adherents as well as
detractors, even as recently as the last decade. Researchers beavering away
in the archives and scientists using infra-red reflectography, have helped
push the question forward.
Now, for the first time in almost a century, the two versions meet again. At
a glance, it is clear that for all the obvious similarity, there are
important differences. The New York version is brighter in colouring but,
even to the layman's eye, more damaged. With its deep green-blue hue, the
Buccleuch painting shows more clearly Leonardo's extraordinary 'smokey'
technique in the way the flesh is modelled. It carries a strong echo of the
Virgin of the Rocks.
But most of all, the difference lies in entirely different backgrounds. In
the New York painting, the Virgin and Child are seated in front of a
dizzying view of ice-blue alpine ranges, reminding us of Leonardo's
fascination with mountains.
The Buccleuch version sets the figures in front of a murky landscape with
rocky outcrops and bushes which border a desolate, dead-calm sea - something
found nowhere else in Leonardo's work.
If the varnish were not dirty and discoloured, the band of light at the
horizon might be more eye-catching and point more clearly to the
time-honoured description of the Virgin as stella maris, star of the sea.
That said, it is hard to feel happy with the idea that anyone might fiddle
about cleaning this calmly beautiful, melancholy painting.
As the prior Fra Pietro implied to the marchioness, there was much for a
sophisticated Christian to ponder in this novel scene. On one level,
Leonardo shows a young mother patiently restraining her lively son who is in
the way of her spinning. Medieval society naturally viewed the Virgin as a
busy working mother. But the cruciform yarnwinder represents the cross and
the Virgin's solemn expression suggests prescience of the sacrifice which
her son will one day eagerly embrace.
Many painters, notably Raphael, took up the idea of baby Jesus as an active
little chap. No one, however, appears to have followed Leonardo's notion
explored in one of the exhibition's drawings, of showing the Christ Child in
the Virgin's arms, squeezing the life out of a cat. There was a legend that
a cat gave birth at the same time as the Virgin, but Leonardo was motivated
less by an interest in inventing subjects for their meaning, and far more
for the formal opportunities they offered.
The drawings, from public and private collections, bring out well Leonardo's
insatiable curiosity about the underlying structure of the natural world.
How did a child's anatomy differ from a man's? (It is a macabre thought, but
Leonardo was presumably not able to dissect infants as he did grown men.)
Babies dimpled, he noted, exactly where grown men had bulges.
Among the sketches in the exhibition, we see a sheet covered in drawings of
chubby limbs, together with studies of the Christ Child standing and
walking, and of a child's head probably done to help members of the studio.
Contemporaries particularly admired Leonardo's brilliance at conveying
emotion through movement. Furiously executed sketches show him working out
ideas. A sketch from a private collection shows one of the artist's stranger
inventions: Christ slipping off the Virgin's lap, who in turn rises from the
lap of her mother, St Anne.
This drawing may help Leonardo scholars solve another mystery. It conforms
exactly to another description by Fra Pietro, again writing to Isabella,
this time about a cartoon. Could it be that the drawing is a fake, produced
by someone who had read the prior's letter? Professor Kemp takes a more
charitable view; that Leonardo went first, then someone with a clumsy touch
went over the top of his outlines.
What then, of the 'Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder'? Kemp's view is
that both the Buccleuch and the New York paintings were mainly painted by
Leonardo, but partly also by his assistants.
The Buccleuch painting is that is the one secured by Florimond Robertet. But
the New York painting is emphatically no mere 'copy'.
Here is yet another exhibition which, like the Mantegna and the Rembrandt
shows, aims to kick a hole through rigid ideas of Old Master authorship.
From start to finish, the professor concludes, Leonardo had his hand in both
these beautiful little Madonnas; happily for their owners, both are 'fully
acceptable as works by Leonardo'.
Exhibition runs to July 12 Sponsored by Martini Brut

in Britain. Keen to cut costs, it has embarked on a thorough search for
sources of supply cheaper than high-cost Germany.
Now that the UK has largely shed its strike-prone image, and Germany has
acquired one of its own, Daimler feels the time is ripe to look for
reliable, quality-minded suppliers.
'For several years now, we have ceased to be concerned about British
suppliers' performance,' says Klaus Engelhardt, Daimler's purchasing
director.
Last year, the company bought DM57bn (Pounds 19.3bn) worth of parts and
supplies, but only 15 per cent came from overseas. The group's aim is to
raise that share to 20 per cent in the next few years.
It is concentrating on the UK partly because it is fairly close and, as
Engelhardt says, 'we can see that the UK motor industry is starting to
flourish again'.
At present, the UK is third on the list of foreign suppliers, just behind
France and the US and accounting for DM1bn of group purchasing.
Daimler decided to make a big splash in London last June with a one-day
supplier conference, its biggest ever. Around 340 companies wanted to come,
but only 95 could be accommodated. Daimler is still in contact with most of
them.
'We don't just look at the naked price,' Engelhardt explains. Seemingly big
price advantages can be eroded by freight, packaging, insurance and other
costs. If there is still a pricing edge of at least 5 per cent Daimler will
take parts for testing and later place firm orders.
Altogether, the process from initial talks to final ordering takes around
two years. Engelhardt's department works closely with the divisions using
the bought-in components. The main thrust now is on the car side, where cost
pressures are most acute.
There is a twist to Daimler's interest in the UK. Attracted by the
Japanese-led resurgence in the UK motor sector, German suppliers like
Siemens, VDO and Bosch have set up components subsidiaries in the UK; others
are following. So Daimler may find itself buying British with a German
flavour.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Why the banks ran out
of patience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON

<TEXT>
A BOMB WENT off in the heart of London's Docklands when the companies that
own Canary Wharf, Europe's biggest new office development, went into
administration under UK insolvency procedures.
Creditors and tenants were yesterday trying to predict the damage from the
initial impact and its aftershock. Bank creditors face losses of Pounds 600m
on that project alone. But if the prices of adjacent properties fall
sharply, the financial carnage may be much worse.
The project's 11 leading bank creditors make no attempt to absolve
themselves from responsibility for causing the explosion.
At mid afternoon on Wednesday, in the offices of Allen &amp; Overy in the City
of London's Cheapside, they decided they would no longer finance the project
as a going concern. In the circumstances, there were only three
alternatives: liquidation, receivership or administration. They opted for
the route that gives Canary Wharf a vestigial chance of being 'brought back
to life', in the words of Mr Michael Dennis, a director of O&amp;Y Developments,
owner of the Canary Wharf companies.
However, some of Canary Wharf's bankers believe the UK government is partly
to blame. 'The government's silence cratered the project', one of the
lenders to Canary Wharf said yesterday.
What that banker meant was that the banks wanted the government to make a
public commitment to take space for civil servants at Canary Wharf. The
Department of the Environment, the Department of Transport and the
Department of Trade and Industry have all been in talks about renting
hundreds of thousands of square feet. The environment department in
particular is at an advanced stage of negotiations on taking 400,000 sq ft
for 2,000 civil servants.
The banks believed a government commitment of this sort would have been a
sign to other prospective tenants of the government's commitment to press
ahead with the redevelopment of Docklands and it would have lifted the
overall occupancy rate at Canary Wharf from 60 per cent to 70 per cent -
close to the level at which it would be possible to find new outside sources
of finance for individual buildings.
Yet although the government is keen that the regeneration of Docklands
should succeed, it is anxious not to appear to be giving subsidies to a
private-sector project.
So over the past week, the banks and the government began a game of cat and
mouse, with Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England,
trying to translate the meows and squeaks into a common language.
The prime minister, Mr John Major, appointed Mr John Wakeham, the lord privy
seal, to co-ordinate all government negotiations with Canary Wharf. Last
week, Lord Wakeham told Mr Kent that the government was thinking very hard
about moving to Docklands.
Mr Kent duly relayed that to the 11 banks: Barclays and Lloyds from the UK;
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank
of Canada; Commerzbank from Germany; Credit Lyonnais of France; Credit
Suisse of Switzerland; Kansallis-Osake Pankki of Finland; and, from the US,
Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover. But the government's good intentions
were not good enough for the banks. Although they understood that the
government would need time before it could sign heads of agreement to take
the space, they still wanted the government to make a public statement that
it intended to go to Canary Wharf.
Two days ago, Mr Kent then delivered that message to Lord Wakeham. The
government felt it could not comply. It sent another coded message that it
would take space - but it could not give a firm commitment to do so unless
the banks had first agreed to provide sufficient funds to keep Canary Wharf
going.
The government could not understand why the banks should insist on
embarrassing it by forcing it to make a public statement before the banks
provided the requisite funds. Anyway, some ministers did not believe the
banks would pull the plug - surely the banks had too much to lose.
Lord Wakeham was to see the banks on Wednesday to explain in person. Shortly
after 2pm on that day, though, it became clear to the banks at their meeting
that there was no possibility of their reaching a unanimous agreement on
providing the Pounds 500m of new banking facilities that Canary Wharf
needed. Unanimity was a condition of the rescue plan going ahead and only
four banks - Credit Suisse, Citibank, KOP and Credit Lyonnais - were
strongly in favour of providing the new money.
In the event, Lord Wakeham was told not to bother to come to the bankers'
meeting. Instead, he alerted Mr Major to the imminent explosion.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Political line raises
hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL collapse of Canary Wharf does not necessarily spell the end of
the Jubilee Line underground extension or the government's plan to move
civil servants to a Docklands site.
In spite of the government's insistence that there was no prospect of a
publicly funded rescue to bail out the development, the message emerging
yesterday from Westmin-ster's corridors was more hopeful.
The calculation behind it was informed both by hard-nosed pragmatism and an
assessment of the political fallout that any decision will bring in its
wake.
On the Jubilee Line, the government has repeatedly emphasised that the
extension would not be built without the Pounds 400m private-sector
contribution that Olympia &amp; York had promised to put up.
Although that remains the position, the hurdle is not as formidable as it at
first appears. Only Pounds 100m of the money is due while the extension is
being built. The balance does not even begin being paid until after
completion, with instalments stretching more than two decades into the
future. On that basis, the effective present value of the Pounds 300m
shrinks towards insignificance. If the failure to lure private money leads
to the extension's being scrapped, the government may face charges of
cutting off its nose to spite its face.
In terms of political capital, however, the government has a huge amount
staked in Docklands' success.
It might receive as much flak for deciding not to proceed with the extension
 -hence placing a question mark over its future urban regeneration policies
 -as for pumping in a relatively small amount of additional money. A
cross-party motion calling for a parliamentary inquiry to reassess future
policy in this area reinforces that impression.
Such considerations will strengthen the hand of those within the cabinet,
such as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who may be
expected to lead calls against fierce Treasury opposition for an active role
in preserving confidence.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, contrived yesterday to reinforce
the tough government line towards new public money while expressing
confidence that the extension would be built. In terms of relocating civil
servants, the government faces a fait accompli in that the Marsham Street
premises housing thousands of environment and transport department officials
are to be vacated.
As Mr Howard admits, there are strong arguments for moving to Docklands. The
department had been advised that 'the best value for money currently
available' was in the area, he said yesterday.
The prospect of Department of Transport employees being moved to the
development does appear somewhat diminished, however, after the
commissioning of an internal review into how many of its staff should remain
in London. Some 1,300 transport employees are to be relocated.

hole in the ground

<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF has been a huge drain over the past four years both on Olympia
&amp; York Developments and on its owners, the Reichmann family.
O&amp;Y was so strong when it became involved in Docklands that the Reichmanns
decided to finance the project without partners and without prearranged bank
finance.
Since 1988, O&amp;Y has ploughed USDollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of its own money
into the project.
It leveraged many of its properties in the US and Canada to provide the
funds for development of Canary Wharf, thereby heightening the risk to the
entire company if the Docklands gamble failed to pay off.
A growing chunk of income from the north American properties had to be
funnelled across the Atlantic as revenue continued to fall short.
Mr Paul Reichmann, the family's master strategist, has always had a special
affection for Canary Wharf. He has taken a close personal interest in even
the smallest details of its construction, and remained unshakably confident
in its eventual success.
Even as O&amp;Y's difficulties surfaced two months ago, it appeared that Mr
Reichmann would spend more of his time in London, seeking badly needed
tenants for the project and overseeing construction work.
Yet the cash demands of Canary Wharf, together with O&amp;Y's inability to repay
holders of short-term securities issued to refinance one of the Toronto
buildings, precipitated the liquidity shortfall that has now led the
Canadian parent and Canary Wharf to seek court protection from their
creditors.
The Reichmanns have never disclosed details of their own financial position,
but it appears that the bulk of their vast wealth is tied up in O&amp;Y. Among
the few exceptions are Olympia Tile, the business that spawned O&amp;Y in the
early 1960s and which is now one of north America's biggest floor-covering
distributors. The family also owns a few smallish buildings separately from
O&amp;Y.
Mr Paul Reichmann is working hard behind the scenes to try to dig the family
firm out of the deep hole it now finds itself in. His older brother, Albert,
as well as other members of the family and their close-knit circle of
confidants have been largely sidelined by the fast-moving events of recent
weeks.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - Property market is
jolted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF'S insolv-ency has severely dented the already battered image of
London's property industry. The banks' decision not to support the project
is a striking vote of no confidence in the property market's future over the
next ten years.
Even if the consequences are fundamental for Docklands the impact on the
rest of London's property market may be rather less dramatic than feared.
Although the market's reputation among banks and investors has been severely
tarnished by Olympia &amp; York's problems, these have been apparent for many
months.
As a result, shares in property company which were knocked sharply when the
scale of O&amp;Y's problems first became known in the spring, were little moved
yesterday.
Canary Wharf's problems could even have a beneficial effect on the market in
the rest of London. If Canary Wharf is no longer seen as a rival to the West
End and the City, the position of Central London landlords may improve.
'The impact could be quite positive in six to twelve months time if the
Jubilee Line is not built and tenants start moving back to the City,' says
Mr Graham Stanley of County NatWest, the brokers.
Canary Wharf's move into administration has large implications for tenants
who have not yet moved into the project. Only 11 per cent of the buildings
are occupied, although leases have been signed on 57 per cent of the space.
The problem is that the costs of the incentives offered to tenants such as
fitting out buildings and taking on the space left vacant in central London
could exceed the economic benefit from the rents paid on the office space.
These obligations to the tenants are not binding on the administrators,
unlike the company. The result may be that a number of Canary Wharf's leases
are cancelled.
In particular, it is possible that large tenants such as Texaco and American
Express, which are due to move to Canary Wharf, will not move from central
London.
American Express's building at Canary Wharf is not yet finished. Moreover,
the cost of the office space rented by American Express in Canary Wharf is
exceeded by the costs of the old space it occupies in central London - in
particular the 240,000 sq ft of space let by its Shearson Lehman subsidiary
in Broadgate in the City. The administrators could decide to seek to cancel
American Express's lease at Canary Wharf to limit the costs of paying rent
of about Pounds 40 per sq ft on the take-back space.
American Express declines to comment, except to say that it is monitoring
events.
The costs of rents and rates on Canary Wharf tenants' old space is likely to
exceed Pounds 20m a year. O&amp;Y took responsibility for about 500,000 sq ft of
tenants' second-hand space at a time when it expected to be able to relet
the property.
Apart from American Express, the companies that had most space taken back by
O&amp;Y are thought to be KPMG Peat Marwick - for which O&amp;Y took back 66,000 sq
ft in Queen Victoria Street, Fleet Street and Stamford Street - and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust, for which O&amp;Y also took back 40,000 sq ft at 7
Princes Street.
If some of these tenants returned to Central London and others were deterred
from taking space in the Docklands, it would have a beneficial effect on the
core London office market.
But the impact should not be overstated. Docklands accounts for just 4.1m sq
ft of empty space out of 34m sq ft in central London according to a survey
published by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What Now For Docklands - High-speed link is
stopped in its tracks - Docklands no longer a dream destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-delayed plans to build a Pounds 4bn high-speed rail link between London
and the Channel tunnel seem certain to be thrown into further turmoil by
Canary Wharf's financial collapse.
Last October the government rejected British Rail's plans for a line running
into the capital from the south and announced that the private sector would
be invited to build the link through Stratford and the east Thames corridor.
The assumption underlying the plan was that the private sector would relieve
the government of the financial burden involved because of the potential for
property gains from lineside developments.
However, the combination of Canary Wharf's insolvency, uncertainty over the
outlook for the regeneration of the east Thames corridor and a massive
overhang of empty property means it is highly improbable that the private
sector will see any potential for property gains for years.
The result may be that the construction of the line will be further delayed
until well into the next century. It may also raise fears in south London
that the original BR proposals for a southern approach might be re-adopted.
BR has been trying since 1987 to win government permission to build a new,
faster line to the Kent coast to provide extra capacity for Channel trains.
However, its plans have been stymied by a combination of Treasury objections
to the cost and the political controversy over the route.
After the rejection of two previous proposals for the line's construction -
one by BR alone and one by a consortium of BR and the private sector - BR
last year came up with its definitive plan for a line that would help to pay
for itself by providing capacity for high-speed commuter trains as well as
the Channel tunnel expresses.
In what Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, described in an unguarded moment as 'a
pantomime', the plans were thrown out by the government in favour of an
eastern approach proposed by Ove Arup, the consulting engineers, and
strongly advocated by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary.
Although appealing to the extent that it fitted in with Mr Heseltine's
vision of regenerating the east Thames corridor, the route appeared to make
little financial sense. Not only did it cost Pounds 500m more than BR's
preferred route: it also attracted Pounds 285m less in user benefits because
of the fewer commuters it would serve.
The government dismissed such criticisms, claiming that the potential for
the line lay in the development gains from the exploitation of sites along
the line from Stratford in east London to Rainham in Essex.
Doubts were cast on that assessment immediately when BR disclosed that
Pieda, the planning consultants it had retained to study the route options,
had assessed the potential benefits at Pounds 100m.
The government has nevertheless pursued its intention of finding a private
developer to fund the route. Earlier this year it appointed Samuel Montagu,
the merchant bank, to help it find a developer. BR's role has been reduced
to that of preparing a project ready for the private sector to take over at
the end of the year.
Growing uncertainty over the outlook for property gains in the east Thames
corridor, however, means it is increasingly unlikely that a private sector
developer will be found. That carries two possible implications: first, that
the Channel tunnel link will be further delayed or second, that the
government has to admit defeat and take the project back into the public
sector.
There is just one other possibility. If the Jubilee Line extension were to
be cancelled, the Department of Transport would be left with Pounds 1.6bn to
spend over the next three years and nothing to spend it on. It is just
conceivable that Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, might consider
deploying the windfall by making an early start on the Channel tunnel link
via Stratford: but the possibility is remote in the extreme.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Names at odds over the pace of protest: Action taken by
Lloyd's members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S bitter attack by Mr Peter Nutting on other prominent figures
among Lloyd's Names highlights the difficulties of organising a group of
individuals unaccustomed to collective action and political manoeuvring. It
has also illustrated the depth of divisions among the loss-making Names at
the insurance market.
Attracted by the prospect of easy money and social cachet, Lloyd's Names -
the individuals whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market -
traditionally have had little interest in campaigning.
Over the past few years that attitude has changed. Just under half of
Lloyd's 22,400 Names have joined the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
since its formation in the early 1980s has become the broad representative
body for all Names.
The association's focus, however, is on the provision of information and
advice to its members - all of whom face unlimited liability for any
insurance losses - and it cannot hope to advance the interests of the
substantial minority of Names who have suffered severe losses.
As a result, Names on loss-making syndicates have begun to form their own
organisations. Several thousand Names are either taking or contemplating
legal proceedings against their agents, and in one case against Lloyd's
itself, on grounds of negligence or a failure of duty of care.
More than a dozen associations or action groups have been created, and
groups have also appointed public-relations advisers to lead press and media
campaigns on their behalf.
Mr Nutting is himself a prominent figure in this growing movement, having
led a successful legal campaign for 1,000 Outhwaite Names which resulted in
a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in February. In April Mr Nutting
agreed to chair a new umbrella group of loss-making Names - the Lloyd's
Names Associations Working Party. With the Lloyd's Council indicating that
it was prepared to help badly affected Names, the working-party group might
have provided the Names with a way to negotiate a settlement outside the
courts.
However, Mr Nutting resigned last week, saying that he could not work with
Names' leaders who were opposed to this more moderate approach. 'Some
leaders and members of the committees of some action groups are involved in
a highly organised campaign of vilification against Lloyd's, its council and
most of those who earn their living on the market,' Mr Nutting said.
He urged other Names to reject the leadership of what he called
'extremists', and attacked efforts to obtain injunctions to prevent Lloyd's
drawing down on the deposits which all Names must lodge with their agents
when they join the market.
Mr Nutting suggested also that Names' groups should be more patient about
the pace of their legal campaigns.
However, many Names on another group of loss-making Lloyd's syndicates have
supported more radical action and reject Mr Nutting's advice as representing
the interests of the Lloyd's establishment. Those radicals are in no mood
for compromise. They are among 6,000 or so Names who are members of
syndicates - such as those managed by the Gooda Walker and Feltrim agencies
 -which specialised in catastrophe or spiral reinsurance, in which Lloyd's
syndicates and London market companies reinsure each others' exposure to
catastrophe loss, and which have borne a large share of Lloyd's losses. Many
joined the market recently and with relatively few assets are ill placed to
meet the losses that have emerged after the series of catastrophes that
shook world insurance markets between 1988 and 1990.
Their anger of Names at the scale of their losses has been fuelled by
evidence that members' agents may have mis-represented the character of the
risks to which Names were exposed, and by the degree to which the market's
overall losses have been concentrated in relatively few syndicates.
Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the
biggest single action group, which represents 2,100 Names, has been the most
publicly visible radical. He rejects the 'pay now, sue later' advice
proffered by moderates such as Mr Nutting.
Mr Doll-Steinberg's group's has launched an attempt to seek a judicial
review of Lloyd's. Mr Doll-Steinberg's legal adviser, Mr Richard Astor, has
also started a separate lobbying group, the Names Fraud Action Group.
The Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group, led by Mr Andrew Grossman, a
US lawyer and Name, has attempted to unite Names on other spiral syndicates
behind the more radical approach. His group is planning its own effort to
seek injunctions as well as launching a legal action alleging negligence.
Mr Grossman has been connected with litigation in the United States, where
about 100 Names are alleging breaches by Lloyd's of US securities laws when
it recruited them.
Both Mr Doll-Steinberg and Mr Grossman have been vigorous lobbyists. As well
as winning support in the press, Names have fought a highly effective
campaign in parliament, making common cause with a group of Conservative
MPs, many of whom are themselves Names. Extensive use of parliamentary
privilege has been made to promote allegations by MPs from both main parties
of insider trading - which say outsiders were stuffed on to the LMX or
'dustbin' syndicates while insider working Names creamed off the safest and
most profitable business for themselves.
Tensions between the more moderate and radical approaches have come to the
surface recently as leading executives at the Corporation of Lloyd's
examines the mechanics of its bail-out plan.
Mr Nutting's resignation may well set back these efforts. It indicates that
it may be difficult to reconcile the instincts of more moderate Names with
those of the more militant. That might make a compromised deal for Names
harder to achieve and must make it all the more likely that the legal action
dogging the market will continue.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Payouts increase in race bias cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS paid a total of Pounds 470,000 in compensation to employees in 120
racial discrimination cases brought to industrial tribunals by the
Commission for Racial Equality last year. The comparable figure for 1990 was
little more than Pounds 150,000.
The increase partly reflects a number of substantial damages awards and
agreed settlements by employers. The Metropolitan Police, for example, paid
about Pounds 20,000 last year in settlement of one case of alleged racist
abuse.
The rise in compensation also reflects the continuing increase in the number
of people bringing complaints - the commission says the number has risen by
about 10 per cent a year for several years.
Of 1,203 individuals who approached the commission last year, 19 won their
cases at tribunals and 101 accepted out-of-tribunal settlements.
More than 200 people complained of employers refusing to consider them for
employment or offer it to them, and a similar number complained that they
had been refused promotion because of racial discrimination.
About 800 complained of unfair dismissal while fewer than 20 complained of
victimisation after making complaints against employers.
The commission, which has been criticised for taking up only cases it knows
it can win, decided to give full advice in 342 cases.
By comparison, the Equal Opportunities Commission 'won' 40 of the 58 cases
of discrimination at work that reached a conclusion in 1990. Seven
applicants won their cases in tribunals while 33 settled out of tribunal.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Chambers warn on fax directory fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSPECTED fax directory fraud on British companies is being fuelled by the
advent of the European single market because of companies' anxiety to become
more widely known internationally, the Association of British Chambers of
Commerce has warned.
The association, which has been co-ordinating information on international
fraud for the past three years, says there is evidence that some fax or
telex directory frauds are used as fronts for money-laundering.
Companies are persuaded to pay for entries in directories that will be
published only in token editions, if at all. The frauds are difficult to
combat since each involves at least three countries, and the payments -
large numbers of small sums - can divert banks' suspicions from other
payments, representing the laundering of drug money or other criminal funds.
The latest suspected fraud is being run in Britain from Hamburg for a
classified fax directory. An invoice-cum-order form offers insertion in 'The
TVV Business Directory' for Pounds 390. Companies are targeted from The Fax
Book, BT's directory, entry in which is free.
There is no telephone number for the company, only a fax line. Ms Jocelyn
Jackson-Matthews, who co-ordinates anti-fraud activity for the chambers,
said a legitimate operator would state the directory's target audience and
print run on the form. It would then invite the order.
The Hamburg form disclaims liability to publish on any date, and does not
specify the size of the print run or distribution of the directory. The form
also reserves to the operator the right to design and illustrate directory
entries.
The forms have been posted from Prague in Czechoslovakia, giving the sender
the benefit of cheap bulk mailing rates while muddying any legal trail by
adding a third jurisdiction to those of Britain and Germany.
'The forms are illegal under the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 and
1975,' said Ms Jackson-Matthews. 'Even if the directory is published, no one
is obliged to pay. Alleged debts will be entirely un-enforceable under UK
law.'
Similar fax directory offers in the past two years have led to her dealing
with hundreds of complaints from companies. Many people became seriously
worried last year when one Swiss fraudster started printing his own
counterfeit English court enforcement orders for payment.
Mr Otto Kiehl, of Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said that although the latest
fax directory operation was illegal in Britain and contrary to his chamber's
code of ethics, no criminal offence was being committed against German
companies. The police were therefore powerless. 'The only course is for any
victims to sue in the German courts', he added.
UK police estimate that each individual directory fraud nets up to Pounds 2m
for the criminal. A typical mailing involves 100,000 fake invoices with an
average demand for Pounds 500. Police think up to 4 per cent of 'invoiced'
companies pay.
Chances of police action are slight. West Yorkshire Police said yesterday:
'It is difficult to be effective against this type of offence because of
different jurisdictions being involved and the law being different in the
countries concerned.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Younger urges split in SE functions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange should separate its commercial and regulatory
activities more sharply to avoid confusing its users, Mr George Younger,
chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said yesterday.
Mr Younger also called on the exchange to consult its users more actively to
'avoid repeating the mistakes that were made with Big Bang'.
His comments in a speech in Glasgow are the most out-spoken to have come
recently from a senior UK banker. They reflect growing frustration in the
financial community at the exchange's delay in resolving the long-running
internal debate over its future strategy.
Mr Younger pointed to the 'inherent conflict' between the exchange's
commercial ventures, such as its company news service, and its regulatory
functions. They should be separated clearly 'so customers should always know
whether they have an obligation to comply with a Stock Exchange request or
whether they are dealing with the Stock Exchange on a commercial basis'.
Some companies have complained that the exchange has used its position as a
regulator to discourage them from sending price-sensitive announcements to
rival news services, which has been allowed since early this year.
Mr Younger went on to warn that Taurus, the much-delayed paperless
settlement system, although necessary, was likely to be 'an expensive burden
on all concerned'.
Mr Younger, a former Conservative defence secretary, also suggested that
some of the exchange's functions, such as clearance and settlement, would
best be handled by other bodies.
He said: 'There are various other international centres where these are run
by co-operatives, with all interested parties being involved in policy and
operational procedures.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Manweb launches gas unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANWEB, the regional elec-tricity company, is creating a marketing company
to sell gas bought from Alliance, the supplier that aims to be a main
competitor to British Gas.
Alliance, a joint venture between BP, the oil and petrochemicals group,
Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil and gas company, and Norsk Hydro, the
Norwegian energy and chemicals group, was launched earlier this month. It
already has a marketing deal with East Midlands Electricity.
Manweb Gas will sell gas within and outside the Manweb region and will
provide energy packages of electricity and gas to industrial and commercial
customers of all sizes.
It aims to compete with British Gas on price, and hopes to provide
'added-value' services similar to those it offers electricity customers,
such as price forecasting to allow users to plan consumption.
Mr Colin Leonard, director of power marketing, said Manweb would consider
supply-ing household customers if the tariff market was de-regulated.
He said: 'If competition moves downward in terms of size of user, then if it
is profitable we would be interested in moving down with it.'
The announcement brings to seven the regional electricity companies that
have links with gas suppliers - evidence of a growing trend to combined gas
and electricity marketing.
Five have joint ventures with United Gas, an offshoot of Utilicorp, the
second-largest US gas marketing company.
Two have deals with Alliance, which said it was in talks with other regional
electricity companies and hoped to conclude at least one more similar deal.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Wholesale power prices fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOLESALE electricity prices have fallen for the first time since
privatisation, according to a report by Caminus Energy, the Cambridge
consultancy which studies the pool - the wholesale electricity market.
Prices were down by 16 per cent in the first quarter of this year, at 2.09p
a unit, as supply rose and demand steadied.
Prices over the full year to March varied, though, with the unit price
reaching a peak of 376p and falling as low as 0.5p, Caminus said. The
average price was 2.24p, an increase of 22 per cent over the previous year,
which was the first year of the pool's operation.
Caminus said the main reason for this was that power stations closed,
pushing up the part of the price that reflects supply and demand.
Caminus remained neutral on the row over whether the pool price was too high
or too low. It said both consumers, who have faced big rises, and
generators, who argue that the price is too low to cover costs, have valid
points.
The new market in electricity had been criticised, Caminus said, but it had
never been intended to give stable prices. It was not supposed to give the
generators a guaranteed return on new investments.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Civil servants may strike on tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVANTS may go on strike over plans to extend competitive tendering
arrangements under which private-sector companies bid for work previously
carried out by civil servants.
The CPSA and NUCPS, the largest Civil Service unions, are planning a ballot
on a one-day strike by members at the Scottish Office after the leaking of a
management consultants' report on the potential for tendering.
The report followed a white paper last November which called on departments
to publish annual targets for areas of activity, including professional and
specialist services and executive and clerical operations, to be
market-tested.
Unions fear competitions will be biased against internal tenders and will
lead to job losses and pay cuts similar to those suffered by blue-collar
workers in local government.
The ballots will provide the first test of the strength of Civil Service
opposition to the tendering proposals.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said yesterday he expected
support for a strike to be solid. 'The initial call came from grass-root
members. It is an honest reaction to a serious fear for their jobs. They do
not believe there is going to be a fair assessment - dogma will decide who
wins tenders rather than consideration of who can provide the better
services.'
The Scottish Office report, compiled by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
identified work done by 3,000 staff that could be put to tender in the next
two years. Although experience showed that most tenders would be won
internally, cost savings would result.
Jobs that could be contracted out included those in administering student
grants, the roads network and project management.
Mr Malcolm Lauder, CPSA branch secretary, said management had refused to
discuss the report or give the unions copies of it.
The Scottish Office said no decisions had been made by ministers. There was
nothing to consult the unions about.

BRITISH COAL appears likely to agree to lease the mothballed Monktonhall
colliery near Edinburgh to Monktonhall Mineworkers, the consortium of
mineworkers whom British Coal named last December as preferred bidder to
reopen the pit.
Earlier this month British Coal said that because Monktonhall Mineworkers
had not provided the necessary finance, it was reopening negotiations with
Caledonian Mining, a private mining company that has also bid to lease the
pit.
It now appears that the consortium has secured the necessary finance and a
lease may be granted by British Coal to Monktonhall Mineworkers next week.
Each of the miners in the consortium - about 150 in total - will be expected
to contribute Pounds 10,000 to the company's capital.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Judge orders acquittal of banker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER UK head of principal trading and sales with Banque Paribas was
cleared yesterday on the directions of an Old Bailey judge of involvement in
an alleged insider dealing network.
Mr Keith Tondeur had denied a charge of unlawfully dealing in the shares of
Pleasurama, the leisure group, in advance of an announcement of a bid for
the company by Mecca Leisure in 1988.
The charge was one of seven against Mr Tondeur and his four co-defendants
relating to Pleasurama on which Judge Bruce Laughland directed the jury to
acquit.
The remaining defendants still face between them eight charges under the
1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act relating to takeover bids in
1988 by Hawthorn Leslie Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, for
ECT Cellular and London Car Telephones, and by Goodman Fielder Wattie, an
Australian company, for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK foods group. Mr
Tondeur had been accused of dealing on the basis of unpublished
price-sensitive information he obtained from a co-defendant, Miss Catherine
Rowlands, while she worked in the corporate finance department at Samuel
Montagu, the merchant bank that acted for Mecca in the bid for Pleasurama.
The judge said Miss Rowlands had received the information from a colleague
who had heard it from another person in Samuel Montagu.
None of the defendants had known the identity or position of the original
source of the information, or that the person was an 'insider'.
There was therefore no evidence on an essential ingredient of the Pleasurama
charges under the act, the judge said.
Miss Rowlands was acquitted of two charges of unlawfully communicating
unpublished price-sensitive information but still faces one similar charge.
Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, was
acquitted on one charge of communicating information and one of counselling
or procuring another person to deal. He still faces other charges. Mr
William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, was acquitted on one of two
dealing charges.
Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the Co-operative Insurance Society
in Manchester, was acquitted on one of three dealing charges.
The trial continues today.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Old spectres haunt the party:  Labour's past still threatens
its future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Labour's leadership election grinds on into its second month, the party
appears ever more unable to avoid reminding the electorate just how fiercely
conservative and anachronistic its basic instincts remain.
A process that started with pledges that no stone would be unturned in the
pursuit of modernisation and renewal this week saw the national executive,
Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, and all three candidates for the
deputy leadership swear undying fealty to maintaining the party's historic
union links.
Meanwhile, newspaper readers have become reacquainted with the world of
block votes and union-executive recommendations.
Rather than spark debate, the leadership race has reinforced traditional
positions as candidates have vied for the votes of the party faithful. On
Wednesday the Fabian Society met in Westminster Central Hall - two
appositely early-20th-century institutions - to hear the deputy leadership
contenders stolidly oppose any tampering with Clause Four, the party's
controversial commitment to public ownership.
In consequence, Labour more and more resembles the political equivalent of
the Church of England - an introverted minority cult whose ageing followers
draw strength from an ancient litany of values, all but forgotten by the
fast-moving world outside.
Yet in spite of that, the internal power struggle might have a crucial
bearing on the party's hopes of power.
No one seriously doubts that Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will win
the leadership at a trot. The real struggle is for the deputy leadership - a
largely symbolic post that, precisely for symbolic reasons, will carry
important messages to the electorate as to what Labour represents.
The choice before Labour's electoral college is between an establishment
candidate, a self-styled radical reformer and a party traditionalist.
Mr Margaret Beckett is known to be Mr Smith's preferred choice. A one-time
leftwinger, a woman and English, her curriculum vitae meshes well with his -
as does her proven ability as shadow chief secretary to grapple with the
awkward political decisions involved in constructing a formula for
democratic socialism on a limited budget.
Many, though, find Mrs Beckett's candidature lacklustre, based above all on
her gender and her promise not to rock Mr Smith's boat.
Yesterday she tried to meet those criticisms by tabling a manifesto. It
promised such items as a 'poverty census', a charter offering lifelong
access to education and a Citizenship Commission to press for public funding
for political parties. But the package smacked more of marketing strategies
than of conviction.
Such a charge could also be levelled at Mr Bryan Gould's headily ambitious
offerings, such as Europe-wide initiatives for full employment.
In reality, the environment spokesman's case rests not on his - widely
disputed - credentials as a radical reformer but on his subtle combination
of political guile and voter appeal that carries undoubted credibility in
middle-class southern England.
By contrast, Mr John Prescott's candidature has been described by one of his
rivals as 'a cry of pain' from the increasingly marginalised traditional
blue-collar Labour vote.
Disarmingly aware of his public-relations limitations, the bluntly spoken
transport spokesman has pitched for the deputy's job as an opportunity to
shake up the party organisation.
About 10 days ago, Westminster rumours suggested that the Smith camp was
'talking up' Mr Prescott's candidature to undermine Mr Gould and bolster a
perceived flagging in the Beckett campaign. Now it appears that growing
momentum behind Mr Prescott, particularly among some blue-collar unions, has
thrown that strategy into reverse.
Several 'modernisers' supporting the shadow chancellor are coming to the
view that it would be far better to live with the creative tensions
inevitable in a Smith-Gould leadership than to end up having to offer the
voters Mr Smith and Mr Prescott - two essentially old-fashioned and possibly
electorally catastrophic versions of Labour's image.
Mr Gould's supporters believe that if he can get through to the second round
of the ballot he can win a straight run-off against either of his rivals.
Like Mr Prescott's team, they think there is strong union and constituency
party resistance to the 'dream ticket' of Smith-Beckett.
Mr Gould himself concedes that there is a real difficulty in persuading the
electoral college - in which the unions have 40 per cent, MPs and MEPs 30
per cent and constituencies 30 per cent - to vote for him both for the
leadership and the deputy posts.
Ironically, if leftwing opponents of the party establishment opt for a
Gould-Prescott protest vote, it may result in the shadow environment
secretary losing out on both jobs and letting Mr Prescott through. One Gould
campaigner said: 'Our problem is all in the first round.'
As the Tories lick their lips at the prospect of a Smith-Prescott
leadership, many neutral observers believe that only Mr Gould has the
southern appeal and potential for imaginative leaps that the pragmatic,
Scottish Mr Smith will need to broaden his appeal.
With just over six weeks to go before balloting - and in spite of the
crucial importance of the result - it looks equally clear that no one has
the vaguest notion of what that outcome will be.

THE ENTIRE corporation tax staff of BP, the oil and petrochemicals producer,
is to join Price Waterhouse in what the accountancy group claims is the
first move of its kind in the UK.
The contract for BP's corporation tax compliance work was put out to tender
after the company announced plans to save Dollars 750m (Pounds 416.6m) a
year from productivity improvements including a programme of up to 700 job
cuts or transfers and a drive to contract out work now done internally.
Mr Peter Hobbs, head of BP's global tax operations, said the move would
enable the 20-strong tax team 'to offer a more focused service to the group
while securing benefits from the diversity and scale of Price Waterhouse's
tax practice'.
BP will continue to do its own tax planning.
Contracting out has become common practice in other sectors, such as data
processing. Earlier this month BP announced the contracting out of
responsibility for its share register.

FT  29 MAY 92 / BSkyB likely to win FA Cup rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH SKY Broadcasting is likely to win the rights to show live FA Cup
games and England home internationals over the next five years in addition
to English Premier League games.
The BBC and British Satellite Broadcasting, before it merged with Sky,
signed a Pounds 30m, four-year deal with the Football Association. The deal,
which gives the BBC the right to show one live match for every round plus
the semi-finals and final, has one more year to run.
Under the terms of the original agreement, the two broadcasting
organisations have the right to first negotiations for a renewal of the
contract.
It is believed that BSkyB - a venture in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a stake - and the BBC have an agreement in principle
for a renewal.
ITV has submitted a bid for the BBC part of the package.
The BBC said last night: 'We cannot comment on negotiations which are in
progress.'
One of the conditions in the heads of agreement for the controversial Pounds
304m Premier League deal is that BSkyB reaches agreement with the FA. The
fact that this is a condition of the Premier League agreement implies that
BSkyB is confident of retaining its present access to FA Cup and
international games.
The ITV Association yesterday issued a writ against the FA and the Premier
League for breach of contract in not keeping the terms of ITV's bid
confidential.
The FA is named because of uncertainty about the constitutional status of
the Premier League when some of the negotiations were conducted.
ITV is seeking damages of up to Pounds 20m for loss of profits over the
five-year term of the Premier League agreement. ITV is also seeking an
injunction preventing the Premier League from signing a deal with BSkyB
until it has had a chance of making a further bid. A similar plea was
rejected in the High Court on Tuesday.
The writ seeks damages from BSkyB for 'inducing breach of the obligation to
keep the bid confidential'.
ITV has claimed that the substance of its Pounds 262m bid was communicated
to BSkyB, enabling the satellite company to put in a last-minute improved
offer.
Meanwhile, BBC Television said yesterday it had won the rights to televise
Liverpool's home matches in the European Cup Winner's Cup live next season.
Mr Jonathan Martin, BBC Television's head of sport, said last night:
'Alongside the FA Cup, England's home internationals and the return of Match
of the Day with Premier League games, the BBC's pattern of football coverage
is shaping up nicely.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Talks on cut-off date for the 'non-cat' car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and the motor industry are negotiating a programme in which
cars without catalytic converters still on offer after January 1 can be sold
without infringing European Community exhaust emissions rules.
EC environment ministers have accepted the principle of a 'reasonable'
period for such sales after January 1, when an EC directive requiring every
new car registered to be fitted with a 'cat' goes into effect.
The UK scheme being negotiated provides for a cut-off date for building
'non-cat' cars. Cars produced after that would not be exempt. The Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday the date was likely to be in
July.
The aim is to discourage manufacturers from continuing to produce non-cat
cars, in the hope of securing extra sales between now and January 1.
Typically, non-cat cars are Pounds 250-Pounds 400 cheaper than the same
model with a cat.
Ford, Peugeot, Vauxhall and Rover discounted any prospect of January 1
arriving with large numbers of non-cat cars in the pipeline.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Renewed deficit in motor trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOTOR industry trade balance fell back into deficit in the first
quarter, bringing an abrupt halt to the improvement achieved in the deep 2
1/2 -year recession in UK new vehicle sales.
In the last three months of last year the motor industry achieved its first
quarterly trade surplus since the early 1980s, with a surplus of Pounds
121m.
According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, the industry accumulated a trade deficit of
Pounds 532m in the first quarter of this year, compared with a deficit of
Pounds 341m in the same period a year ago.
The sudden deterioration in the sector's trade balance is a further sign
that the prolonged UK recession might be ending, as imports have again
started to rise faster than exports.
The performance of the motor industry is a large factor in the development
of the overall UK trade balance, and as domestic demand for new vehicles
rises, the deficit is expected to grow.
The motor industry trade balance has been in deficit every year since 1982,
but last year's deficit, at Pounds 1bn, was the lowest for nine years and
showed a sharp fall from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a peak deficit of Pounds
6.6bn in 1989, when UK new vehicle sales were also at a record level.
The rapid improvement in the past two years was driven both by the
recession, which sharply depressed imports of new cars and commercial
vehicles, and by the industry's strong car export perfor-mance.
According to the SMMT, the value of imported automotive products rose 12 per
cent year-on-year to Pounds 3.3bn in the first quarter, while export
earnings rose only 6 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn.
The SMMT said the increase in the value of imported products marked the
reversal of the downward trend that had become established in mid 1990.
The value of car imports rose 13 per cent in the first quarter to Pounds
1.6bn, while the value of car exports rose only 3 per cent to Pounds 987m.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Invisible exports well ahead of visibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRITAIN earned Pounds 117bn last year from the export of invisibles
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
significantly more than visible exports of Pounds 104.8bn and second only to
the US, according to a report published yesterday by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
The report says 40 per cent of Britain's output is accounted for by
invisibles, which include interest, profits and dividends earned overseas as
well as tradeable services such as tourism and insurance. About a quarter of
income from such invisibles comes from overseas. The fastest-growing areas
include information transfer and transport services.
The DTI says creation of the single market in Europe and international
recognition of a number of professional qualifications has boosted
invisibles trade.
The report illustrates how critically the UK depends on the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, which are due to
include for the first time an agreement on multilateral rules for the
liberalisation of trade in services.
World trade in invisibles was estimated to be worth more than Pounds 750bn
last year, with the UK accounting for about 14 per cent of the total. In
1990 the UK was second only to the US, which earned Pounds 151.5bn. Japan
earned Pounds 93.5bn, France Pounds 82.8bn and Germany Pounds 78.6bn. When
services alone are compared, France overtakes the UK, since Britain's
earnings are bolstered by interest, profits and dividends from overseas.
According to Mr Julian Arkell at British Invisibles, a group representing a
range of private-sector service companies, the UK has a greater dependency
on invisibles trade than any industrial country, with tradeable services
accounting for 17 per cent of gross national product. That is twice France's
dependence, four times that of the US, and five times that of Japan. The UK
has earned more from the export of invisibles than from merchandise exports
since 1980.
Small companies have been particularly active in invisibles trade. The DTI
said: 'Smaller firms have found that large turnover and staffing levels are
not a prerequisite for success, and many have been gratified to find that
the international business language in services is English.'

TOURIST officials in Northern Ireland yesterday found they had promoted fury
as well as holidaymaking after suggesting that inquisitiveness about the
conflict between Protestants and Roman Catholics could be a selling point
for the province.
The listing by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board of the 'curiosity factor'
as an important strength was condemned by politicians and business - even if
it was only acknowledging an unspoken truth: that most tourists have
previously seen Northern Ireland only in grisly news pictures.
Tourist board officials hurriedly made clear that its three-year corporate
plan did not propose the marketing of bus tours to terrorist-hit areas of
west Belfast, or listing bed and breakfast accommodation along the 'peace
line'. The emphasis would be on increasing understanding about the
'troubles', they said. The corporate plan says many visitors 'may be
motivated to visit simply to see why there should be such conflict in modern
society'.
Mr William Hastings, chief executive of the Hastings hotel group, said the
board was mistaken. 'The conflict still exists. Were it over, then some
places, like the walls which divide the Shankill and the Falls may be of
some interest. But I think we have many other things of much greater
interest to offer the tourist,' he said.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, said: 'You don't help the tourist
industry by drawing attention to the troubles.'
The Northern Ireland Office is keen to promote tourism, believing there is
scope for growth - some 263,000 holidaymakers are estimated to have visited
last year. But until now explicit mention of conflict has been shunned in
favour of Northern Ireland's scenic beauty.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Fimbra entrants will face exam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL advisers seeking to become members of Fimbra, the regulatory body
for independent advisers, will face a compulsory examination from September.
The move comes after criticism that some Fimbra members have provided
below-standard service to investors.
Last year some payouts to investors in collapsed companies were delayed
after the investors' compensation scheme, which was set up to protect
investors against bad advice, ran into funding difficulties because of the
number of claims against Fimbra members.
The examination announcement yesterday is part of a scheme designed to raise
the standards of both new and existing members of the watchdog organisation.
At present, financial advisers hoping to become members of Fimbra must have
had two years' relevant experience before they join, and do not have to take
an examination.
Last year the organisation introduced a voluntary entrance examination,
which will become compulsory in September for new entrants.
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, acknowledged yesterday that
'the standard (of the examination) is below the minimum standard we believe
necessary'. He said that efforts were being made to upgrade it 'in due
course'.
Under the new scheme, members will draw up a personal programme to include a
mixture of training, updating of knowledge, and study for qualifications in
different areas of financial advice.
The scheme is due to come into effect next year, and a pilot study is being
launched between July and December this year into its feasibility.
Mr Brian Cochrane, a Fimbra council member, said the aim was to educate
Fimbra members in order to benefit the consumer. Fimbra has been criticised
for laxity in regulating its members, but Mr Jillings said that it was
unrealistic to expect high standards overnight.
In a related move, the Securities and Investments Board the City's chief
investment watchdog, said yesterday that it had set up a panel to advise the
board on the training and competence plans for self-regulatory organisations
such as Fimbra and recognised professional bodies.
The panel will be chaired by Mr Leonard Warwick, a member of SIB's board and
a former president of the Life Insurance Association.
The new training and competence procedures are a result of proposals made
nearly two years ago by Ms Oonagh McDonald, former Labour MP, in a report
for SIB.

FT  29 MAY 92 / PowerGen staff back radical pay package
</HEADLINE>

   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES at PowerGen, the electricity generator, have voted in favour of a
radical shake-up of pay and collective bargaining arrangements that will
lead to significant salary rises, Michael Smith writes.
PowerGen is the first of the generators to win workforce approval for a
local pay and conditions deal. It will lead to harmonised terms and
conditions for all 6,500 employees, single-table bargaining and increasingly
flexible working.
Nalgo, the public-service union, said clerical assistants on Pounds 9,631
last year would receive Pounds 2,220 more this year. That was partly because
of the last national pay deal of 5.5 per cent, but mainly because of the
restructuring.
Not all of the money will be consolidated into salaries - Pounds 400 plus 2
per cent of salary was in the form of a one-off payment. Most PowerGen
employees will receive less substantial rises than the clerical assistants.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Suppose the Americans hold an election and nobody wins:
Jurek Martin burrows into the US constitution to figure out what would
happen if no-one gets an overall majority in the presidential election, come
November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS still only the Washington parlour game of the month and it is still
played more with amused detachment than with real intent. But, since life
and art are now patently indivisible, as Vice-President Dan Quayle was
merely the last to demonstrate last week, the current fascination with what
might happen if no-one wins an outright victory in the presidential election
in November might just return to haunt the country.
The starting point is the constitutional technicality that the presidency is
won not by popular assent but through an overall majority of the 538 members
of an electoral college. This is an anonymous group, chosen according to
state size, whose only task has been to ratify, in December, the election of
the previous month.
All but Maine and Nebraska instruct their electors to award all the state's
college votes to whichever candidate has carried the state, irrespective of
by what margin.
If no candidate gets the minimum 270 college votes needed for outright
victory, the 12th amendment to the constitution applies. Under that, the
House of Representatives elected in the November is to convene in January to
choose the next president from among the top three finishers in the
electoral college; this last happened in 1824. The new Senate meets
simultaneously to choose the next vice-president from the top two
running-mates.
The catch is that, although the 100 senators (two from each state) cast
individual votes, the House must decide on the basis of one vote for each
state delegation in its ranks. This puts Vermont, which has but one
congressman (and a socialist to boot), on a par with California, which has
52 members.
According to one lovely calculation by Mr Lloyd Cutler, lawyer
extraordinaire and White House counsel to President Carter, this could mean
that the 26 least populous states, with only 16 per cent of the national
population, could decide who will be president.
This system would appear at present to favour the Democrats, who have a
majority in 31 of the House delegations, compared to only 10 for the
Republicans, with the rest evenly divided and Mr Bernie Sanders representing
Vermont, assuming his re-election. But there could be a big shake-up in
November, even though the disappearance of the Democratic majority in either
chamber of Congress may be unlikely.
However, nobody knows under what rules House state caucuses would determine
who gets the single vote (simple majority? absolute majority? plurality?) or
whether indeed common rules would apply to all the states. Even if they did,
that might not help a state such as Maine, which now has one Democratic
congressman and one Republican, neither of whom might want to give way.
Mr Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, has pointed up the
extreme difficulty that individual Congress members could face. 'What if,'
he wrote in The New York Times, 'your district went for Perot, your state
went for Bush, and you are a Democrat?' The prospect of many state impasses
clearly exists.
In any event, somebody has to be sworn in as president, acting or permanent,
on Inauguration Day, January 20. If this were not to happen, then the
Senate's choice as vice-president 'shall act as president' until the House
has made up its mind. If both chambers are deadlocked, then the Speaker of
the House, by law, takes over in the interim, unless he has declined, in
which case the Secretary of State, if there is one, steps in.
These are the rules of the game, more or less. How it would play depends on
imponderables. Much would rest on the order in which the three candidates
had finished, by which time the third-placed running-mate would be out of
contention in any case. For sure, if Mr Clinton had finished a poor third,
it would be hard for a Democratic House to vote him in. But it might prefer
to hand the presidency to the independent Mr Ross Perot than to the
Republican Mr George Bush, regardless of who held the lead.
One of Mr Ornstein's scenarios posits a House deadlock, has Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey as Mr Clinton's running-mate, and assumes Mr Clinton
finishes second, not far behind Mr Bush. He cannot imagine the Senate, still
in Democratic hands and with public opinion behind it, ever preferring
Vice-President Quayle to the admirable Mr Bradley, who gets sworn in as
president pro tem - and then, when the House gives up the ghost, gets the
job.
Then again, under the divide-and-rule principle, the House might then elect
Mr Bush, producing the remarkable pairing of a Republican president and a
Democratic vice-president.
A variation in the USA Today newspaper has Mr Clinton ahead in the electoral
college and Mr Perot a poor third. The latter then endorses Mr Bush, but not
Mr Quayle, inducing the House to vote in Mr Bush and the Senate to go with
Mr Clinton's running-mate - or, if Mr Clinton finishes third and his
running-mate is thus out of it, the Senate, still baulking at Mr Quayle,
would choose Mr Perot's partner.
In all these variations, the fact that Mr Perot lacks a mainstream party
does not help, though it is increasing his appeal at present with the public
at large.
Underlying the whole game is the knowledge that nobody knows now who is
going to win in November and whether that victory will be enough. Such are
the delights of a three-horse race.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Confusion over technology moves: FT writers on prepartions
for the Earth Summit next week in Rio De Janeiro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNOLOGY transfer has been a frequent incantation in the endless
preparatory meetings for the Earth Summit.
As Mr Mostafa Tolba, director of the UN Environment Programme, told a
conference at Chatham House in London: 'If developing countries follow the
short-cuts of using obsolete, economically inefficient technologies based on
resource and energy gluttony and catastrophic pollution and waste
generation, then our destruction is assured.'
But the phrase 'technology transfer' and its practical implications are
understood quite differently on opposite sides of the north-south divide.
'It is a horribly confused issue,' says Mr Chris Rose, programmes director
of the environmental group Greenpeace. 'Some people are talking about money,
some are talking about patents and some are talking about equipment.'
Politicians in developing countries demand access to what they see as a
treasure trove of advanced technology in industrialised countries, which
would allow them to combine fast growth with environmental improvement.
In the industrialised world, governments, companies and environmentalists
agree that scientific knowledge and technical skills need to be transferred
on a large scale to developing countries, if practical progress is to be
made on any of the specific global problems from climate change to the
extinction of wildlife.
But they say the Third World is missing the point when it pays so much
attention to patented western technology.
As a UN preparatory committee for the summit pointed out, 'a large body of
useful technological knowledge lies in the public domain and is unaffected
by the international patent system. Also, most proprietary technology is
available through commercial channels.'
The obstacles for developing countries are, first, to find out about
appropriate technologies and then, far more difficult, to find funds to
introduce them.
Any practical steps taken at the Rio conference are likely to focus on the
first stage: improving access to environmental technology.
UN staff estimate the international community will need to contribute
Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m a year to run an expanded world-wide network of
technology information exchanges.
An example is the International Cleaner Production Information Clearinghouse
(ICPIC), which UNEP is using to transfer information about CFC-free
manufacturing, as part of the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty to
phase out ozone-destroying chemicals.
Mr Tolba sees the protocol as a model for environmental technology transfer.
The original 1987 Montreal accord was amended in 1990 to set up an interim
fund of Dollars 160m - contributed by the industrialised world - which will
be used to help developing countries eliminate consumption of CFCs.
Technology transfer to combat global warming through more efficient use of
energy will be more expensive. Mr Klaus Topfer, German environment minister,
pointed out after a recent visit to China that the average Chinese power
station burns 440 grams of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of
electricity, while a modern German power station consumes 300g of coal per
kwh today, and will burn 220-250g in the year 2000.
Mr Toufiq Siddiqi, an environmental policy analyst at the East-West Centre
in Hawaii, calculates that an investment of Dollars 6bn in improving the
energy efficiency of Chinese power stations would save 10m tonnes of coal a
year and reduce carbon emissions that contribute to global warming.
An even larger contribution could be made by adapting China's 400,000 small
industrial boilers to burn coal more efficiently; their efficiency today
averages 30 per cent less than that of comparable boilers in industrialised
countries. This programme too would cost billions of dollars.
The example shows that identifying the technology is the easy part of
technology transfer. The difficulty is finding funds to transfer it. Across
the range of environmental challenges discussed at Rio - reducing pollution
of the air, water and ground, together with issues such as preserving
biological diversity - hundreds of billions of dollars will be needed. There
appears little prospect that such vast sums will be available.

A PROJECT to protect the Brazilian Amazon, that was originally planned as
the centrepiece of the Earth Summit, may prove an embarrassment.
Brazil claims that the industrialised world is failing to take the project
seriously, and that too little money is being committed.
The Dollars 1.5bn Rainforest Pilot Project was approved by the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations in 1990 and declared by the World Bank to
be an 'example of co-operation between developed and developing countries on
global environmental issues.'
Yet, two years on, only Dollars 53.5m has been raised, and this only after
Brazilian President Fernando Collor had written an angry letter to G7 heads
of government. The US, which has been one of the leading critics of
Amazonian deforestation, gave only Dollars 5m.
'The first world is being very hypocritical - it annnoys me tremendously,'
complains Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's Environment Minister. 'We get a lot
of advice and rhetoric but very little money'.
He also complains that multilateral institutions are forcing Brazil to
support projects in the Amazon of which he is 'very sceptical,' such as
extractive reserves - areas reserved for such activities as the gathering of
Brazil nuts and rubber-tapping which do not harm the forest but which many
analysts believe are condemning people to poverty.
'The maintenance of extractive reserves is very artificial in economic terms
 -we're having to make an enormous effort to subsidise these people,' the
minister said.
A senior World Bank official said that he was not aware of any complaints by
Brazil on this issue. But he admitted that international response to the
Amazonian Pilot Programme had been 'disappointing' and that the project
would be 'smaller and slower than planned'.
Of the money pledged so far, Dollars 19.5m is from Germany and Dollars 15m
from the EC. Canada has contributed less than Dollars 1m. The G7 has
promised a further Dollars 200m over the next three years, of which 10 per
cent must be provided by Brazil.
However, the official said 'most of this is bilateral aid already committed
by G7 countries. There is almost no additionality, if at all - it's just
consolidating old aid in a new account'.

FT  29 MAY 92 / ANZ Grindlays asked to make Pounds 97m provision: Bombay
Stock Scandal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANZ Grindlays, India's largest foreign-owned bank, has been asked to make a
Rs5bn (Pounds 97m) provision for possible losses at its Bombay branch in
India's securities market scandal.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which asked ANZ Grindlays to
make the provision, also asked State Bank of India, the country's largest
bank, to provide Rs7bn.
Directors of Australia's ANZ Group, parent of ANZ Grindlays, said earlier
this week that they did not anticipate any losses from the Indian upheavals
and that ANZ Grindlays had reconciled all its banker's receipts, a form of
IOU at the heart of the scandal.
By issuing banker's receipts, banks pledged later delivery of securities for
which they supposedly had already paid. They were used as collateral to fund
purchases of shares in Bombay's stock market.
Two small banks which issued large amounts of receipts have been put into
liquidation by the Reserve Bank: Bank of Karad and Metropolitan Co-operative
Bank.
The extent of the involvement of ANZ Grindlays and State Bank emerged last
week after a meeting of banks to reconcile their accounts, but the Reserve
Bank attempted on Wednesday to force them to provide cover for the possible
losses.
Standard Chartered of the UK is believed to have exposure of Rs3.62bn to
Bank of Karad and Rs5.3bn to Metropolitan Co-operative Bank. Some Indian
officials believe that the Pounds 50m provision which it has made against
possible losses is inadequate.
However, the exposure of ANZ Grindlays arose because nearly Rs5bn was
credited to the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, a Bombay broker, against a
cheque issued by National Housing Bank.
The exposure of NHB to bankers' receipts is Rs13bn. The Reserve Bank
considers ANZ Grindlays' action in crediting the proceeds of the cheque,
drawn in favour of the bank, to an individual's account violated
international banking laws.
ANZ Grindlays contests this, saying it is 'established banking practice'.
The Reserve Bank's decision to ask for full cover is seen as a move to end
the stalemate and force ANZ Grindlays to settle the dispute with NHB, which
is owned by the Reserve Bank, either bilaterally or in court.
Bankers in London say that despite the high amounts of exposure of some
foreign banks, they may be able to recoup part of the lost money through
legal action and that the Reserve Bank's move to put banks into liquidation
would make it easier to track the money.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Central bank attacks Shamir on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S central bank, in its annual report, has strongly criticised the
government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, for not generating
sustainable growth or jobs for waves of immigrants, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said after delivering the
report to Mr Shamir yesterday that priorities must change. Huge state
incentives for home building discouraged the private sector from investing
in areas of permanent employment. He called for slashing housing, defence
and social spending - the three main costs in the budget besides debt
servicing - and for reforms to liberalise the state-controlled economy.
'The main three candidates for major cuts are social payments, housing and
defence. If we don't bite into one of these, or two of them, or all of them,
we simply won't mobilise the amount of money the economy needs today,' Mr
Frenkel said.
Israel's population has swelled by about 10 per cent with the arrival of
400,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union since 1989. Gross domestic product
rose 5.9 per cent in 1991, but about half was generated by a temporary
housing boom. Mr Frenkel said the lack of jobs for highly-educated
immigrants was a important reason for a sharp fall in new arrivals.
Exports fell 2.3 per cent in 1991. Unemployment hit a 20-year high of 10.9
per cent, with the rate 39 per cent among newcomers.
Mr Frenkel forecast that GDP in 1992 would rise between 5 and 6 per cent,
much less than previously expected. Investment, spurred last year by
housing, would dip after soaring 25.8 per cent.
'The investment rate grew very significantly last year. To our regret it
will be much more moderate in 1992: 10 per cent which is much lower than the
economy needs,' he said.
Ahead of the June 23 election, the opposition Labour party, led by Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, has seized on rising unemployment in a weakening economy as a
reason to oust the ruling Likud party. Mr Rabin has blamed the economic woes
on Mr Shamir's building boom in the occupied territories which led the US to
turn down a request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in loan guarantees for
immigration.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Thai political failures reach economy: Growth will be
affected but investors will not be scared off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE widely held notion of the last two decades that business could be
conducted in Thailand without too much thought for the antics of the
politicians and generals running the country appears comprehensively
discredited by last week's violence.
Government officials, economists, bankers and foreign investors have
hurriedly revised their economic forecasts downwards since Thai troops
killed at least 48 pro-democracy demonstrators at the height of a political
crisis which finally forced the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the
prime minister.
Financial institutions which had been predicting real gross domestic product
growth close to last year's 8 per cent are now talking of a figure below 7
per cent, while at the bearish end of the scale one stockbroker has reduced
his growth estimate to 5.3 per cent from 5.9 per cent.
Such predictions are of questionable value when the gap between the guesses
of different forecasters is greater than the gap between the new and old
guesses of each, but all are agreed that tourism, foreign investment and the
fragile property market will be hard hit by the sudden reduction of
confidence in Thailand. Speculative investments based on assumptions of high
growth are particularly at risk. Interest rates are likely to rise - the
interbank rate has already risen to 10.5 per cent from 6 per cent in the
last 10 days - as foreign creditors restrict their exposure to Thailand,
moderately increase risk premiums and force Thai companies to borrow more
domestically.
An anticipated increase in corporate profits will be restrained by the
crisis, with hotels, property and finance companies likely to suffer the
most.
Factory output, exports and imports were only briefly disrupted by last
week's chaos.
The most immediate blow is to tourism, which provided some Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.2bn) in income for Thailand last year, one of the largest foreign
exchange earners.
The industry was recovering only hesitantly from the Gulf war in the first
quarter, and although it is now the low season in Thailand anyway,
economists are predicting an exceptionally poor full year.
Hotels have started cutting their rates and Thai Airways International has
reported heavy cancellations of bookings on flights into Bangkok, especially
from Japan.
Loss of tourism revenue will affect the current account, and a sharp drop in
investment inflows will damage the balance of payments as a whole.
Many economists and bankers, however, dismiss fears of a balance of payments
crisis, saying that the violence has simply aided the necessary process of
slowing down an overheated economy.
Exports have been buoyant so far this year and if an expected slowdown of
imports compensates for the loss of tourism revenue, the current account
deficit could drop to just over 5 per cent of gross domestic product this
year from a dangerously high ratio of more than 8 per cent in 1991.
Thailand has not suddenly lost its fundamental economic attractions.
'People didn't come here because of good government,' says Mr Mechai
Viravaidya, a former minister.
'You ask investors. They came because of skilled workers and relatively
cheap wages.'
But the violence has reminded investors - albeit with unpleasant abruptness
 -that the failings of Thai politics were already affecting their
operations.
Years of inadequate planning, a lack of infrastructure, a shortage of
skilled workers, and corruption were all choking the development of
industry, while environmental degradation reached the point where it started
to put off potential tourists.
'People now realise they can't just leave politics alone and carry on doing
business,' says Professor Kasem Suwanagul, another former minister.
'Business depends much on politics. You've got to have a good government.'
Good government and foreign investment will be required if Thailand's
development is not to be stunted in the next few years - Bangkok's Dollars
8bn of transport projects, for example, need both foreign money and
government decisions - but it could take weeks or months before the country
has either.
There are two main threats to stability. First, there was by yesterday no
coherent government following Gen Suchinda's resignation, and second, the
military are resisting demands that those who ordered the shootings of
demonstrators be brought to justice.
Either through negotiations between the various political parties or new
elections, a prime minister will emerge, although not necessarily one with
the authority to begin solving the country's economic and political
problems.
But the issue of retribution over the killings could take longer to resolve.
Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army commander, was quoted as saying
menacingly this week: 'Don't force me into becoming a cornered dog.'
Some Thai businessmen are hoping that the generals concerned, including Gen
Suchinda, will quietly leave the country.
The alternatives of public trials or continued confrontation, would, in the
words of one senior Thai executive at a multinational company, leave the
whole economy under a shadow.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Andriessen given fresh US farm reform
ideas

<TEXT>
MR Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, left Washington
yesterday with 'new ideas' presented by US cabinet officers to break the
deadlock over farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round.
In a day of intensive talks on Wednesday, US and EC officials exchanged
suggestions and tried to work out 'new formulas' now to be discussed in the
EC Commission, an EC official said in Washington. Senior US and EC officials
are likely to meet again over agriculture before the Group of Seven summit
in Munich in early July.
Mr Graham Blight, president of the Australian national farmers' federation,
in Washington yesterday to meet US agriculture officials, said he expected a
breakthrough to come before the G7 summit.
Mr Blight suggested the 'new ideas' discussed were within the framework of
the draft proposal by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general. US officials
had given him 'no indication there is something out there that would give us
a problem,' he said.
During his visit, Mr Andriessen met Mr James Baker, US secretary of state,
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Edward Madigan, agriculture
secretary. Mr Baker's participation was seen as an important political
signal to give impetus to the Uruguay Round. Mrs Hills said both sides were
trying to narrow the gap between concessions made possible by last week's
agreement on Common Agriculture Policy reform, and wider requirements for a
Gatt deal.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Union dilemma as Spanish strike fizzles: Clashes after
government orders police to break up public transport pickets
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S trade unions face some tough political decisions after failing
yesterday to bring the country to a halt during a half-day general strike in
protest at government spending cuts.
The morning strike, which the unions claimed had been supported by an
overwhelming majority of Spaniards, had little effect in Madrid and other
big cities.
Minimum public transport services decreed by the government in the face of
fierce union criticism were exceeded in the capital. The government also
held firm to its promise to use police to break up pickets trying to stop
people using public transport. Most shops and businesses opened normally,
though people were slow to get to work either because full transport
services were not operating or had decided to spend most of the morning at
home.
There were some arrests around the country in sporadic clashes between
police and pickets, but apart from stopping work at large industrial plants,
the strike had nothing near the effect of the last national stoppage - a
full day strike in 1988 - when Spain came to a halt.
One measure of the strike's effect on business is that electricity
consumption, which fell 55 per cent in the 1988 stoppage, was yesterday down
just 13 per cent by early morning and had risen to 93 per cent of normal
national consumption half way through the morning.
The government's readiness to use police to prevent pickets stopping people
travelling is something new for Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister. But
it speaks for the confidence with which his government is facing off the
union challenges to its economic policies.
Those policies include freezing public sector subsidies and to lowering
unemployment benefits. They are part of government efforts to ensure that
Spain meets the convergence criteria set down by last year's Maastricht
agreement on European economic and monetary union.
Yesterday's uneven strike means that both government and Socialist party may
be less disposed than ever to negotiate elements of the convergence plan
with the unions. It also places an enormous political burden on union
leaders.
The latter have to decide whether to continue with the protests - and a full
day general strike in October - or let the issue drop and hope the
government will allow them to save some face by at least discussing marginal
changes to policy.
That may happen. A general election has to be held by October next year and
some peace with the unions may make the difference between an overall
Socialist party victory and the need to form a coalition with other parties.
Many analysts believe yesterday's strike marks the beginning of a long
election campaign.

HUNGARY yesterday won backing from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, for
its claim to be the first in the queue of former communist states waiting to
join the European Community, writes Philip Stephens in Budapest. A joint
declaration signed by Mr Major and Mr Jozsef Antall, his Hungarian
counterpart, included an explicit recognition of Budapest's ambition to be
part of the EC before the end of the century.
Mr Major, who arrived in Hungary after a visit to Prague, was accused
yesterday by Slovak nationalists of intervening in Czechoslovakia's general
election. He had said in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, that Britain
favoured maintaining the federation of the Czech lands and Slovakia. Mr
Jozef Prokes, leader of the secessionist Slovak National Party, was quoted
as saying: 'The visit's taking place before the election was no accident.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Hungary's new guard already beset by young blood: Ruling
conservatives, are under pressure from the youthful free-marketeers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS after free elections, Hungary's victorious conservatives are
suffering from an acute case of that very democratic malady: the mid-term
blues.
Hungarians, more accustomed to protest in demonstrations and against
communists, are learning to vent dissatisfaction with their new democratic
rulers in the time-honoured western way: through opinion polls and
by-elections.
There is much with which to be dissatisfied. Recorded gross domestic product
declined by 10 per cent last year. The bulk of the population has suffered
deteriorating or stagnating living standards, made all the more frustrating
by the showy prosperity of the rest.
No wonder that several international polls showed Hungarians to be the
gloomiest people in the world. No wonder, too, that the Hungarians want to
punish their government.
With what a vengeance. Support for the Hungarian Democratic Forum, holder of
42 per cent of seats in parliament and the leading party of the conservative
governing coalition, has dived to a humiliating 15 per cent in the latest
Gallup opinion poll - low enough to push Mr Bela Kadar, the influential
minister of international economic relations, into a humiliating third place
in a by-election last week.
One thing is even more galling for Mr Jozsef Antall, the ailing conservative
prime minister. The beneficiary of the government's unpopularity is a bunch
of kids.
If one believes the polls, a group of recent graduates from Budapest
University is heading for an absolute majority at the next parliamentary
elections. With about 50 per cent of support in recent polls, the young
free-market liberals of the Alliance of Young Democrats would reduce the
ruling centre-right coalition to a rump, and Mr Viktor Orban, the
28-year-old party leader, would sweep Mr Antall from the prime minister's
office.
The Young Democrats have gone from 9 per cent of the vote and junior partner
in the liberal opposition in the 1990 parliamentary elections, to 18 per
cent in local elections and an opinion poll lead since last year. A joint
candidate with their liberal allies inflicted this month's by-election
defeat on the government.
As a result, the government has taken more than just a leaf from the western
instruction manual: blame bad news on its bearers - the polling
organisations and the media.
Officials doubt the reliability of polling organisations, particularly
Hungarian ones. They stress the fickleness of voters in general, and
Hungarian voters in particular, whose party loyalty and sense of civic duty
remain immature.
They say that the voter's mind has been poisoned by the media, which,
conservatives claim, is full of liberals and communists. Such is the
government's displeasure with news coverage that it has tried to sack the
heads of state radio and television, stumbling into a constitutional clash
with Mr Arpad Goncz, the president.
The government, while admitting to some public dissatisfaction, is still
only halfway through its four-year term and remains sanguine. If mid-term
blues is the malady, the conservatives put their faith in a classic western
remedy: a pre-election boom. The government's strategy calls for the
recession's bottoming-out this year and output growth reaching 4 per cent in
time to win the 1994 elections.
An extraordinary cabinet session recently decided to stimulate the economy
through extra infrastructure spending and incentives for Hungarians to buy
into privatisations. 'The old industries are shut down; something has to be
started again,' said an aide to the prime minister. Even without an active
further inflating of the economy, the public-sector deficit is set to
roughly double the 1992 target agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
The conservatives also can always appeal to the voters to support the devil
they know. 'A governing party can win an election even when everybody hates
the government, if they see no real alternative,' said one official.
The government dismisses the Young Democrats as a passing phenomenon,
laughing at the notion that Mr Orban might be Hungary's version of Spain's
Felipe Gonzalez: a young radical taking power after dictatorship and a
centre-right interregnum.
But others are taking them increasingly seriously, not least the electors,
who say they like their freshness, honesty, innocence and freedom from the
past - rare enough qualities in post-communist eastern Europe.
However, the Young Democrats are not appealing just to public sympathy. They
have confronted the government on the battleground of economic competence.
It no accident that Mr Orban calls himself a 'political manager' and rivals
label the Young Democrats as 'yuppies disguised as revolutionaries'.
The party has taken a fanatically rational approach even to the most
emotional political issues. For instance, it opposed on economic grounds
legislation to compensate those whose property was confiscated by the
communists.
Moreover, the party's unswerving technocrats have attracted a warm response
from the business elite, who are still searching for a political home and
frustrated at what they see as the government's lack of understanding.
A leading Hungarian investment banker says that most older democratic
politicians are 'bruised' by life under the former communist regime: 'They
spend too much time correcting the mistakes of the past rather than building
the future. Economic problems do not get the importance they deserve. We
need a new generation which has not gone through frustrations in life.'
But then again, the mood of the business establishment could just be another
transitory symptom of the mid-term blues. The Young Democrats have two years
to ensure it is not; the conservatives have two years to start the economic
growth that makes any government look competent. The competition has a very
western feel.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Banks abandon Canary Wharf: O&amp;Y project may face liquidation
 -Creditors advance only Pounds 10m until year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT hopes to re-generate London's docklands received a potentially
lethal blow yesterday when Canary Wharf, the area's flagship development,
went into administration under UK insolvency procedures.
Mr Steve Miller, financial adviser to Olympia &amp; York, said the
administration order was a 'serious setback' in the attempt to organise a
financial reconstruction of Canary Wharf's owner, Olympia &amp; York
Developments, the world's biggest property developer.
The administrators, three partners from the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young,
hope Canary Wharf can re-emerge after several months in administration as a
going concern. But they have received only Pounds 10m from banks to cover
all the project's costs until the end of the year. Some bankers warned that
liquidation was a strong possibility.
It also emerged that the Bank of England has been acting as a messenger
between Canary Wharf's 11 leading bank creditors and the government, which
is interested in taking space at Canary Wharf but has been refusing to make
a firm commitment to do so. The Bank did all it could to keep the project
out of administration, short of putting overt pressure on the banks.
But at 4pm on Wednesday the 11 banks told O&amp;Y that an insolvency filing was
the only option. The banks had rejected three 'scenarios' - code-named Snow
White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - to maintain the project as a going
concern.
The government yesterday reiterated that civil servants would only move to
Canary Wharf on commercial terms and that there would be no official
bail-out.
However, it is understood that Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, who has
been appointed by the prime minister to co-ordinate all government
negotiations with Canary Wharf, has called an emergency meeting for early
next week of several cabinet ministers whose departments may move to Canary
Wharf.
With only Pounds 10m of new money, the administrators, who have taken
control of the project, will have to raise capital from new investors to
complete vital work on the project.
Canary Wharf executives disclosed yesterday that they had been in talks with
potential investors for three months. One possible investor is the
government of Singapore's Investment Office.
However, the likelihood that the Jubilee underground line will be extended
into east London is now small.
Bankers stressed there was no possibility that they would pay the government
the Pounds 400m which Canary Wharf had promised as its contribution to the
cost of the extension.
Mr Stephen Adamson, one of three joint administrators, said he would look at
the option of finding finance for the Jubilee extension, but he could 'not
be more positive than that'. He said Canary Wharf 'could survive without the
Jubilee Line'.
All creditors' claims on the project have been frozen under the
administration order. The group of creditors owed the most are banks, which
have lent Canary Wharf around Pounds 1.2bn. Mr Miller, a partner of
investment bank James D. Wolfensohn, said builders of the project were owed
comparatively little.
Another significant group of creditors comprises current Canary Wharf
tenants who were persuaded to take space in the dockland development by O&amp;Y
taking over their leases elsewhere. The cost to Canary Wharf of paying the
rent on these leases - including some for tenants supposed to move in later
this year - is Pounds 25m a year. These costs are now likely to revert to
the tenants.
Some prospective tenants, including American Express, the big US financial
company, and Texaco, the US oil company, are now expected to review their
plans to move to Canary Wharf.
The American Express building at Canary Wharf is only 85 per cent finished.
Bankers admitted there was a doubt about whether the administrators would
have the funds to finish the building. If it remains unfinished, there is
little chance of American Express ever occupying the building.
Any sharp drop in the forecast occupancy rate at Canary Wharf would
seriously reduce the likelihood that the project can emerge from
administration as a going concern. If administration becomes liquidation -
and Mr Adamson admitted there was a risk of that - the effect on the
property market in the adjacent area would be devastating.
It would also mean that losses faced by banks, which include Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, National Bank of Canada;
Commerzbank from Germany, Credit Lyonnais of France, Credit Suisse of
Switzerland, Citibank from the US and Barclays and its UK rival Lloyds,
would probably exceed the Pounds 600m they currently project.
Yesterday a war of words erupted between the banks. Four banks, Credit
Suisse of Switzerland, Citibank, Credit Lyonnais and Kansallis-Osake Pankki
of Finland, had been in favour of providing Canary Wharf with Pounds 500m of
new money to keep it going. One of these accused other banks, which voted in
favour of administration, of being 'unsophisticated' and 'short-sighted'.
Banks' exposure comprises a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf, a
finance lease of Pounds 58m which is guaranteed by Barclays, a separate
Pounds 450m loan from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European
Investment Bank.

FT  29 MAY 92 / US presses for Serbian oil embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, PHILIP STEPHENS and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US last night pressed for an immediate oil embargo against Serbia as
part of a tough package of United Nations sanctions aimed at stopping the
ethnic conflict in the breakaway Yugoslav republics.
A State Department official said Britain, France and Belgium had agreed to
go along with the harder line against Serbia, dropping their proposals to
put off an oil embargo to the second stage of a sanctions programme.
But the US now had to win over other members of the 15-nation UN Security
Council, notably China and Russia. China has already made plain it objects
to sanctions and Russia opposes an oil embargo, but neither is expected to
block action by using its veto - an extreme step now out of favour at the
UN.
Western nations were hoping the Security Council would pass a sanctions
resolution today. But the tougher US intervention could delay agreement
because of more difficult negotiations.
The US bid to sharpen international action against Serbia came as Serb
irregular forces last night fired further barrages of rockets and artillery
shells on Sarajevo, the besieged capital of the breakaway republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The missiles came from Serb positions in the wooded
hills ringing the city.
Earlier, there was a lull in the fighting around Sarajevo after heavy
overnight clashes. In a bid to distance itself from Wednesday's mortar
attack on Sarajevo which left 17 dead and 80 wounded, the rump Yugoslav
presidency called on the UN to investigate the 'massacre'.
A European Community suggestion that UN troops should provide protection for
humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia-Hercegovina was rejected by Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. While acknowledging it was for the
Security Council to make a final decision, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that it
would require large numbers of UN troops to secure several hundred miles of
roads and to establish a defensive perimeter around Sarajevo.
The city has been cut off by Serb militia and Yugoslav federal army troops
in a bid to starve it into submission.
Mr John Major, on his visit to Budapest, said UN sanctions were likely to
include a trade embargo, a freeze on Serbia's overseas assets, severe
restrictions on commercial flights, the suspension of all official sporting
contacts and the break-off of scientific, technical and cultural
co-operation.
Under EC proposals, there was to be provision for an oil embargo from the
middle of next month if Serbia did not act to halt the fighting.
The prime minister said the precise terms of the resolution were still under
discussion. 'But I hope it will be agreed by the United Nations by the end
of this week . . . that it will be a binding and mandatory series of
sanctions.'
In Belgrade the Serbian Orthodox Church attacked the policies of President
Slobodan Milosevic in an unprecedented open letter.
The church, which had supported the nationalist politics of Mr Milosevic,
yesterday appealed for his resignation and the formation of a government of
national salvation. Serbia's state-controlled media censored the memorandum.

FT  29 MAY 92 / PM rules out rescue but Tube line talks possible

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday ruled out a government rescue of Canary Wharf and
reaffirmed that the proposed extension of the Jubilee line depended on a
substantial contribution from the owners of the docklands development.
But, in what appeared to be a hint of flexibility over the details of the
rail financing package, the prime minister added that the government was
ready to listen to any new proposals made by the administrators.
He also emphasised that Whitehall departments would continue negotiations to
relocate upwards of 2,000 civil servants to the development as long as any
such move was 'on commercial terms'.
Speaking in Hungary at the end of a four-day visit to central Europe, Mr
Major said repeatedly that the enforced move into administration of Canary
Wharf had not changed his policy towards the project.
Under an agreement negotiated with Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary
Wharf, the government agreed to invest about Pounds 1.5bn to extend the
Jubilee line to docklands as long as the developers provided a total of
Pounds 400m towards the project. About Pounds 40m of that was due to be paid
by O&amp;Y in March with a further Pounds 60m next year and the remainder in
small instalments until well into the next century.
Last night, Mr Major said the agreement would stand with the creditors of
the development: 'We have agreed to spend around Pounds 1.5bn on the Jubilee
line but that is subject to the owners of Canary Wharf, whoever they are,
making a substantial contribution to the cost of the project and a further
contribution once the project is built'.
He added that 'nothing you should take from me suggests our position is
going to change'.
The hint of flexibility on the details came when Mr Major was pressed
repeatedly as to whether the administrators would have to agree precisely
the same conditions as those agreed with O&amp;Y. He responded: 'I think we
should wait and see what the administrators have to say. I'm not going to
prejudge that.'
Senior officials travelling with the prime minister stressed that the
comment did not imply he was ready to increase the government's financial
contribution.
The remarks, however, did suggest that Mr Major does not want to close the
door on the possibility of rescheduling the private sector contribution or
agreeing to a delay in the line's construction timetable. Mr Michael
Heseltine, president of the board of trade, is expected to be among
ministers arguing over the next few days that the government should try to
help the project.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan and Madrid gain in quiet
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses were closed for the Ascension day holiday, but Milan and Madrid
produced gains yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN, which had broken its rising trend on Wednesday, returned to the
upgrade yesterday with the Comit index closing 1.97 higher at 494.62.
A strong performance by the banking sector, assisted by foods, provided the
base for yesterday's recovery. Last week's rally had centred on the
industrial sector, noted Mr Michele Pacitti of County NatWest; banks had
been left behind, partly because there were (somewhat unlikely) rumours that
the state might sell off part of its holdings in Credito Italiano and BCI.
Credito Italiano gained 4.4 per cent on what some dealers described as
short-covering, closing L74 higher at L1,773; Banco di Roma closed L67
higher at L2,005, but surrendered L5 on the kerb; and, on-screen, BCI
touched a high of L3,195, but settled back to L3,155, up L30 at the close.
MADRID generally ignored the half-day general strike, which appeared to have
limited success, with reports of public transport running normally in many
parts of the country. The unions had called the action in protest at the
government's public spending cuts. The general index gained 1.03 to 259.04
in volume of some Pta10bn, with strong foreign interest noted.
Telefonica, Repsol and Iberdrola accounted for some 30 per cent of market
volume. The telecommunications group gained Pta5 to Pta1,165 with some 1.2m
shares traded. The company has been gaining ground since announcing earlier
in the month that it was to raise its dividend - the first time since 1979.
Iberdrola II advanced Pta47 or 9 per cent to Pta547 following comments on
Wednesday by the chairman of Iberdrola I that the merger of the two
utilities should be completed by the end of the year.
The banking sector was generally firmer following weakness this week after
reports that some banks faced bankruptcy this year. Santander was Pta90
stronger at Pta4,765, having lost Pta250 over the past few days.
DUBLIN, which had been easing backwards this week, started lower and
stabilised later yesterday, the ISEQ overall index closing only 0.44 lowerat
1,381.36.
Mr Paul Burke of Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin said that the apparently flat
trajectory of the market this year had concealed early strength in
industrials and foods - the former broken recently by disappointing 1992
prospects for Jefferson Smurfit, the paper and packaging group - and a early
lag in performance by Ireland's financials which have since come through to
support the market.
ISTANBUL fell sharply following a rise in interest rates at Wednesday's
three-month Treasury bill auction. The index closed down 58.37 at 3,233.16
in turnover estimated at TL117.5bn, down from TL130bn previously.
The Treasury sold bills worth TL1.67 trillion, up from TL241bn in the
previous auction.
Prices of 61 shares fell, 18 rose and 42 finished unchanged. Among active
stocks Eregli rose TL50 to TL3,250 while Tupras and Cukurova Elektrik were
both unchanged at TL3,700 and TL5,300 respectively.
South Africa was also closed for a public holiday.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying reverses
Nikkei's downtrend
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices, which had fallen initially on arbitrage unwinding, picked up
on late afternoon bargain hunting and index-linked buying, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average finished a net 108.69 up at 17,931.25 after a low for the
day of 17,686.07 and high of 17,944.20. The index fell on selling by
arbitrageurs, triggered by a lower futures market. However, index-linked
buying, prompted by short-covering in the futures market, and foreign
bargain hunting pushed equities into positive territory by the close.
Volume shrank to 200m shares from 294m. Advances led declines by 508 to 406,
with 204 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 3.70 to 1,356.31, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 3.78 to
1,071.14.
Foreigners were seen small-lot buying across the board. Mr Brian Tobin at SG
Warburg Securities said: 'Overseas clients are active, buying up cheaper
stocks, but domestic clients are only watching.'
Activity was dominated by short-term 'theme' trading by dealers. Meiji Milk
Products, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y35 to Y910, and
Mitsubishi Kakoki, a water treatment equipment maker, rose Y110 to Y3,810.
In addition to the bio-technology and environmental protection themes,
dealers are trying to promote companies related to China, seen as a
potentially large market for Japanese companies. Yaohan Japan, a
medium-sized retailer, added Y60 at Y1,420 on the 'China theme'.
Blue chip electricals gained ground. Foreign buying lifted Sony Y210 to
Y4,290.
Mining issues were boosted by higher gold prices. Nippon Mining moved up Y18
to Y469.
Banks were mixed ahead of profit announcements for the last fiscal year,
released after the close. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y30 to Y1,820
and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,460.
Before the market closed, Sakura Bank announced that its capital adequacy
ratio for the year ended last March fell short of 8 per cent, the level
required by the Bank for International Settlements. Investors, however,
failed to respond, and Sakura remained unchanged at Y1,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 158.77 to 20,600.52 in volume of 14.6m
shares. Strength in Ono Pharmaceutical, sought on the bio-technology theme,
encouraged small-lot buying in other issues. Ono, Osaka's leading active of
the day, rose Y320 to Y6,490.
Roundup
PROFIT-TAKING in Hong Kong was the most significant factor in a mixed day
for the region.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower, the Hang Seng index losing 94.57 to 5,988.13
in turnover of HKDollars 5.3bn.
Hutchison Whampoa gained 40 cents to HKDollars 18.80 on plans to privatise
Cavendish, the existing issued stock finishing HKDollars 1.075 up at
HKDollars 5.25. Hong Kong Land was 50 cents stronger at HKDollars 13.80
following Wednesday's announcement that it had sold a central city office
building for HKDollars 3.8bn.
Hong Kong Telecom fell 35 cents to HKDollars 9.75 on fears that revenue
would be hit by a possible drop in the tariff for long-distance calls. The
prospect of higher crude oil prices pushed Cathay Pacific down 70 cents to
HKDollars 12.90.
SEOUL declined on the detail of the government's plan to help investment
trusts suffering from liquidity problems.
Some analysts said the financial assistance would only help to reduce the
companies' interest payments. The composite index slipped 6.60 to 578.63 in
turnover of Won325.5bn.
TAIWAN saw profit-taking in financials and the weighted index shed 40.36 to
4,501.02 in turnover of TDollars 21.9bn.
Commercial banks were higher, with Hua Nan up TDollars 2 to TDollars 112.50
following the Finance Ministry's approval for its Hong Kong representative
office to be upgraded to branch status.
KUALA LUMPUR saw activity in Tenaga Nasional on its market debut, the shares
closing at MDollars 8.75 for a premium of MDollars 4.25 over the offer
price, The volume of 52m shares accounted for about 62 per cent of the
market total. The KLSE composite index ended 8.97 ahead at 600.17.
Telekom advanced 90 cents to MDollars 13.70. Malaysian Airline System dipped
15 cents to MDollars 6.25 after reporting a 43 per cent drop in annual group
net profits.
SINGAPORE rose for the third consecutive day on institutional buying. The
Straits Times Industrial index gained 21.61 to 1,528.15.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index closed 10.7 stronger at 1,676.5, starring
the market leader, BHP, which jumped 26 cents to ADollars 14.38 in turnover
of ADollars 39.4m.
Market turnover was boosted to ADollars 301m by option-linked business.
Traders said sentiment was boosted by the release of the latest round of
positive economic figures.
NEW ZEALAND was encouraged by strong performances from three leading stocks,
the NZSE-40 index advancing 18.47 to a closing 1992 high of 1,558.68.
BANGKOK fell for its third straight day on political worries, the SET index
ending 10.92 lower at 704.83 in moderate turnover of Bt3.1bn.
MANILA was affected by a loss of electricity which kept activity low, and
the composite index fell 18.48 to 1,403.35 in combined turnover of 279.8m
pesos.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities steady after
political turmoil / Putting a week's events into context
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a few days of rough and tumble, Brazilian stock markets have recovered
since Wednesday, when President Fernando Collor de Mello's brother said that
he had no proof of earlier charges of high level corruption, and drug abuse
against his presidential brother.
On Monday, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa index dropped 7.4 per
cent, its sharpest fall this year, partly in response to allegations made by
Mr Pedro Mello (as he prefers to be called) in an interview in a leading
weekly news magazine.
Equities then levelled off, in spite of rocky trading, on Tuesday, as the
president ruled out the possibility of resigning or impeachment, and moved
on to the offensive by launching a police inquiry, and legal proceedings
against his brother for 'moral damage'. On Wednesday, the Bovespa rose 7.5
per cent to 25,388, and yesterday it put on 2.2 per cent by early afternoon.
'It was a good ending,' said Mr Alvaro A. Vidigal, Bovespa president.
Other observers are more reluctant to put the lid on the Collor brothers
episode. 'Right now, everyone wants to downplay these events,' said Mr
Roberto Teixeira da Costa, director-president of Brasilpar Financial
Services. 'With the meeting of the decade coming up (next week's
environmental summit), we have got plenty of problems, and we do not need
any more.' The medium term effects on the market are hard to predict, he
believes.
This week's events may serve as a cautionary sign to some investors, who had
been stepping on the accelerator to push more money into Brazil. The
prospects were, and probably still are, enticing: during the first four
months of 1992, the Bovespa index had chalked up a 90 per cent surge in
dollar terms and steady volumes of Dollars 100m or more.
Last week, the central bank announced that Dollars 1.4bn entered Brazilian
stock markets from abroad in the first four months of this year. With
remittances of Dollars 359.9m, net investment was Dollars 990.6m - already
topping the Dollars 570.8m registered last year, most of which entered after
institutional investors were allowed to invest directly in Brazilian
equities last June.
Given enough confidence, there is room for more, say analysts. In Brazil,
foreign investment accounts for about 4 per cent of equity market
capitalisation, against 20 per cent in Mexico and 8 per cent in Chile. But
the number of companies traded (570) in Sao Paulo is far more than for any
other Latin American market.
The enigma of Brazil's market is that it began catching foreign eyes before
the country had completed the economic house cleaning that other countries
in the region undertook at an earlier stage in their stock exchange
development. Brazil has benefited from Latin America's improved image
abroad, partly thanks to moves in other countries, where the structural
reforms are more advanced and inflation is considerably more modest than
Brazil's 20 per cent monthly average.
'Sure, Brazil is hitching a ride,' said Mr Julius Buchenrode, director for
investments of the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank. 'But if it
weren't giving off the right signals, the money wouldn't be coming in. With
all of Collor's problems, he has made it clear that he will pursue
structural and fiscal reform at any cost.'
So far, most investors, both foreign and domestic, have found their
opportunities in a handful of state-controlled blue chips. The four most
traded issues account for three-quarters of Bovespa's activity. Telebras,
the public telecommunications company, is alone responsible for more than
half of trading.
The next most active stocks are: Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the
state-controlled mining group; Petrobras, the state-controlled petroleum
concern; and Eletrobras, the state-controlled energy company.
These stocks have long been considered bargains, but the scene may be
changing. Not long ago, traders habitually called attention to what they
believed was a low price for Telebras stock in comparison with other Latin
American telecommunications companies, such as Mexico's Telmex. Now many
believe that Telebras is reaching its level.
Mr Teixeira says: 'There is a saying: 'When you don't know companies, you
buy names.' That also happened in Mexico and Chile.' He believes the early,
'smart' money gave the market an initial boost, but that now serious
macroeconomic reform and company profitability should begin to weigh in more
on market performance.
Chase's Mr Buchenrode thinks foreigners are prepared to take the plunge into
second line stocks. To date, low liquidity has been an additional deterrent
to buying into the second line. 'There is concentration in blue chips.
That's where the liquidity is,' Mr Buchenrode says. 'But when there is an
offering of good paper, people snap it up.'
Many 'second line' companies are industry leaders in Brazil, but nearly all
have been hit hard by the current recession.
Mr Buchenrode expects more new issues in the second half of this year, with
greater use of underwriting. 'But companies won't want to make offerings
when stock prices are below book value,' he warns.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Pressure lifted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER several days of tight trading the pressure was finally taken off the
UK money markets yesterday.
Although the overnight rate climbed swiftly to well over 11 per cent in the
early morning it plunged at midday once it became clear that the big
liquidity shortage forecast by the Bank of England would be relieved easily,
contrary to expectations.
The Bank's initial forecast was less than the shortages forecast at the
beginning of the week but still considerable at Pounds 1.3bn .
In the early round of the Bank's operations traders held on to paper,
keeping liquidity tight. As the cost of overnight money crept upwards the
Bank acted to push overnight rates below 11 per cent. At midday it was
successful.
Overnight rates, which had started the day  3/8 of a point firmer at 11 3/8
per cent, fell to around 9 per cent after the Bank bought Pounds 1bn of
bills across the bands and conducted its second repurchase agreement of the
morning.
After that, there was little life left in the market. Many operators had
managed to square their books as the rate tumbled. Those who dithered found
themselves paying up to 10 1/2 per cent later.
In the afternoon the forecast was revised slightly to Pounds 1.35bn. The
Bank operated again, purchasing a further Pounds 65m of band-1 bills at 9
7/8 per cent. Late assistance of Pounds 35m brought total interventions for
the day to Pounds 1.3bn, all but taking out the shortage.
The key three-month rate, which opened at 10 1/8 per cent eased to 10 1/16
per cent but moved back to close unchanged on the day.
At the longer end, rates remained unchanged with six month money closing at
10 1/16 per cent, and one year money at 10 per cent.
There was very little activity on the futures market which continued to
indicate no early cut in base rates. The September sterling contract, now
the most actively traded futures contract, edged up 6 basis points during
the day from an open of 90.30. The June contract traded in a five tick range
and closed at 90.02.
The Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system with four-day
system repurchase agreements. Federal funds traded at 3 7/8 per cent.
