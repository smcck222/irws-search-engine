FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US group to put millions into European
factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent

<TEXT>
MORTON International, the US chemicals and car components group, is to
invest 'hundreds of millions of dollars' in a European factory making
emergency airbags for cars. The project will create 1,700 jobs by 1995,
rising to 3,000 in five years, the company said.
It will be a joint venture with Robert Bosch, the German engineering group,
which will make the sensing and diagnostic equipment to trigger airbag
inflation designed to protect passengers in a car crash.
Morton, which claims US market leadership in the field, will make the bags.
The company's initial list of 100 potential European locations will be cut
to three or five in July. Two UK sites are contenders, one in Clwyd,
north-east Wales, the other in Consett, Co Durham.
Ms Nancy Hobor, head of corporate communications at Morton's Chicago base,
said yesterday: 'We have spent Dollars 300m (Pounds 170m) developing this
market in the US and would expect the European investment to be of a similar
order.'
The Clwyd site is near Toyota's new factory near Chester and Wrexham;
Consett is within a few miles of Nissan's Sunderland plant. Both have good
motorway links to other carmakers in Britain. Morton has a chemicals
operation in Germany, also a contender for the factory because of the size
of the German car-making sector and the Bosch connection.

A UK-led consortium has won the right to operate one of Romania's two TV
channels, representatives of the group, led by Atlantic Television, said
after signing the deal yesterday, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. The
new station, Channel 2 TV Romania, will be the first national commercial TV
channel in the former Soviet bloc.
Mr Robin Edwards, managing director of Atlantic Television, a
Canadian-registered company, and a non-executive director of Westcountry
Television of the UK, said the station would 'set the standard' for other
ex-Comecon countries.
The deal gives the new channel, a joint-venture company allocating a 20 per
cent stake to Radio Televiziunea of Romania, broadcasting rights for 15
years. Conceived as non-political, it will import half its programmes from
the west. Atlantic hopes it will be on air by the end of the year.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Defiant Kurds flock to vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH

<DATELINE>
   ARBIL, NORTHERN IRAQ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH of the city of Arbil on a rolling plain that leads to Baghdad lies a
scattering of settlements known as Qushtapa. Yesterday its school became a
polling station for elections organised by the Kurdistan Front, the
guerrilla coalition administering 50,000 sq km of northern Iraq.
First in the queue of 400 women was Mrs Sherve Abdullah, who had arrived at
7am, an hour before the polls opened. She wore the abaa, the traditional
black veil. Nine years ago her husband and seven sons, aged from 14 to 25,
were taken in a dawn raid by soldiers of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
They, and 8,000 other men from this area, have not been seen since.
Part of the sprawl of Qushtapa is Qadisia, an attractive village built
around 1978 by members of the Barzani clan after their forced relocation
from tribal lands further north after Baghdad crushed a Kurdish revolt led
by the head of the clan, Mullah Mostafa Barzani. The adult inhabitants are
almost all women.
Mrs Aisha Otman, who said she was around 40 years old, sat huddled in a
shawl as she spoke through an interpreter in one of the two rooms she shares
with five children and two grandchildren. She explained how in 1983 soldiers
came at dawn and rounded up all the men, including her husband. 'They took
blind men, old men and handicapped men.' Mrs Otman now works in the fields
all day 'like a man' for 10 dinars (70p), enough to buy a kilo of rice.
In another house Mrs Hergaz Mullah, aged about 50, keeps a picture of two
sons in pride of place on the wall. Both were seized in 1983. Two other
sons, then aged seven and 15, escaped because they hid in a shelter built
against Iranian air raids: she said they are now bodyguards to Mr Massoud
Barzani, son of Mullah Mustafa and leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP).
The Barzani women of Qushtapa voted for the KDP yesterday, not because they
prefer the party's policy of 'autonomy' over the 'self-determination'
advocated by Mr Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Mrs
Otman said she didn't mind if Mr Barzani did not win - 'we just want to be
Kurdish'.
When the polling stations closed at midnight there were still queues. Mr
Hoshyar Zebari, a leading member of the KDP, said last night that 'the high
turnout is a challenge to the Iraqi government'. But he went on: 'We do not
think an independent state is possible in north Iraq. We are the victims of
the theory that we are undermining the sovereignty of Iraq. The Kurds can
play an important role in removing Saddam Hussein, but we are not going to
be pitted against Saddam's army without support.'
As polling ended Mr Zebari said two people had been hurt in a 'shoot-out in
Arbil' in which police opened fire on the voters trying to assault a judge.
'We don't say this election is exemplary,' he said.
Qushtapa school is one of 174 polling stations. Over 1m Kurds were expected
to have voted for national lists drawn up by seven parties. A second ballot,
for president, was contested by Mr Barzani and Mr Talabani, along with Mr
Mahmood Osman of the Socialist Party and Mullah Othman Abdul Aziz of the
Islamic Movement. If no-one gains 50 per cent there will be a second ballot
in two weeks.
The result of the elections will be known today or tomorrow. The new Iraqi
Kurd administration will have to face tensions between attempting to satisfy
the aspirations of Kurdish nationalism and allaying the fears of Iran and
Turkey that the developments may encourage Kurdish separatism there.
Barely 5km south of Qushtapa is the front line between Kurdish guerrillas
and the Iraqi army. Pashmerga guerrillas led by Mr Mosin Maullud, local
field commander, two months ago killed eight Iraqi soldiers who tried to
capture a telecommunications tower behind Kurdish lines. Yesterday, in
contrast to the hubbub at Qushtapa polling station as the Barzani women
voted, it was, for the time being at least, all quiet on the front.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Investors uneasy over Thailand's stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING foreign investors in Thailand suggested yesterday that although
coups and attempted coups are part of the country risk profile, economic
policies had remained generally stable in spite of the periodic political
upheaval.
However, in Japan - the biggest source of direct investment into Thailand -
the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said Japanese
companies now contemplating an investment in the country are likely to
rethink their plans. The military crackdown has harmed Thailand's image, it
warned.
Thailand has had an important role in the Japanese corporate strategy of
relocating manufacturing operations to low-cost south-east Asian sites.
Japan's direct foreign investment was Dollars 1.28bn in fiscal 1989 and
Dollars 1.15bn in 1990, sharply up on the Dollars 124m of 1986.
Japan accounts for about a quarter of all the country's inward direct
investment, followed by the US, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the UK.
Thailand has also become a leading trade partner for Japan, with exports to
Thailand rising 3.4 per cent last fiscal year to Dollars 9.4bn and imports
from Thailand 26.6 per cent higher at Dollars 5.2bn, with a significant
percentage of the increase being components for Japanese products exported
to third countries.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the electronics company, has four factories
in the suburbs of Bangkok and two sales offices in the city. It said that
factory production had not been disrupted, but 'there has been some
disturbance to our sales activities'.
'We think the situation is not very serious, but we are watching closely.
According to our previous experiences, the Thai people know when to pull
back during times of upheaval. We expect that the protests will stop soon,'
it said.
Toyota Motor, the leading car maker, runs three factories and a sales
company in Thailand, which is central to the company's strategy of producing
components in a range of south-east Asian countries to create a regional
car. 'We are continuing to run our factories, but long-term political
stability is important to the success of our operations.'
British companies with interests in Thailand echoed similar sentiments. 'The
Thais have done well up until now. But if they blow this one they'll be
turning the clock back,' said one UK businessman with extensive involvements
in the region. 'We managed to brush off last year's coup, but this latest
incident goes much further,' he added.
Although Germany is by far the leading EC exporter to Thailand, the UK is
becoming more important as a trading partner. UK exports in 1991 were Pounds
463.5m (Dollars 820m), up from Pounds 410.5m the previous year. Main exports
included machinery and transport equipment - totalling Pounds 219.5m in
1991. UK imports from Thailand were Pounds 625.4m from Pounds 484m.
Historically, Thailand has not been a starting point for British companies
seeking a toe-hold in south-east Asia, but that has changed over recent
years. Bangkok's British Chamber of Commerce is now said to be one of the
most active in the world, with more than 250 members.
Mr Iain Dale, chief executive of Yorkshire-based Dale Electrics, which has
an office and a factory in Bangkok, said: 'Thailand must offer stability to
investors.'
Dale's offices, which are on the Airport Road, and its factory in the
capital's Yannawa district, have been closed 'because our 50 employees there
would have had to have fought their way to work,' Mr Dale said. 'We'll
decide on Thursday when to re-open them.' Dale manufactures power generating
equipment, and Thailand accounts for about Pounds 3m of the group's annual
turnover of Pounds 55m.
BICC, the engineering and construction group, recently completed the Pounds
7m international trade centre in the capital and is currently working on a
building of similar size for Thailand's biggest newspaper. It also has a
Pounds 6m cabling contract with the Bangkok post and telecommunications
authority. The company said: 'We will be watching carefully events in the
country.'
Wall Street analysts said most US interests in Thailand were in
manufacturing plants - assets that could not be liquidated quickly. US
companies with operations in the country were, therefore, likely to wait
until the situation had become clearer before taking any longer term
decisions.
The two closed-end country funds quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, Thai
Capital Fund and Thai Fund, showed no significant initial reaction to the
violence in Bangkok, although one fund manager privately expressed concern
that if the troubles persisted the long-term commitment of US investors
could suffer.
Far East equity analysts in New York also noted that interest in Thailand
among US investors had levelled off, and perhaps even declined, since the
coup last year.
The most immediate impact was being felt by world airlines and holiday
companies, in the light of advice by several western governments that its
nationals should avoid travel to Bangkok. British Airways suspended flights
for 24 hours and Kuoni, the Swiss-owned tour operator, stopped operations
into Thailand for a day because of difficulties in moving people to hotels
from Bangkok airport.

THE ARREST of Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of deposed
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was ordered yesterday by a Manila
judge.
Judge Teresita Flores issued the order after Mrs Marcos failed to appear at
an arraignment in connection with charges of failing to report foreign
exchange deposits abroad.
Mrs Marcos had been accused by the government of having conspired with her
late husband in looting the economy while they were in power.
She had said she would defy the courts in protest against what she described
as 'systematic cheating' in May 11 voting when she ran as one of seven
presidential candidates.

FT  20 MAY 92 / W European car sales grow 0.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe rose in April by 0.4 per cent helped by a
strong rise in demand in Italy and Spain and the first sign of a recovery in
the UK.
Demand weakened further in Germany with an estimated 11.2 per cent drop, and
in France registrations were 5 per cent lower than a year ago.
According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe totalled 1.314m
last month compared with 1.308m in the same month a year ago. New car sales
in Italy jumped by 15.2 per cent while sales in Spain were 19 per cent
higher.
In the first four months new car sales across 17 markets in west Europe rose
by an estimated 0.8 per cent to 5.018m from 4.976m in the corresponding
period a year ago. Sales were higher than a year ago in ten of the 17
markets.
The strongest growth in demand this year has been achieved in Spain and in
Portugal where new car sales in the first four months have jumped by 26 and
34 per cent.
The 9.1 per cent rise in UK new car sales in April was the first
year-on-year increase in 30 months and the first indication that the
severest recession in the British car market in the post-war period may have
ended.
In the first four months sales were still 6.7 per cent lower than a year ago
at 544,317.
Among the big six volume car makers in west Europe Renault and Peugeot have
achieved the fastest growth in the first four months this year with
increases in sales volume of 8.9 per cent and 5.2 per cent.
Volkswagen, achieved a record market share in the first four months of 17.3
per cent further strengthening its seven-year leadership of the west
European new car market.
Rover has suffered a 22 per cent fall in demand in the first four months.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Hungary stokes bitter row over Danube dam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and ARIANE GENILLARD

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST, PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY said yesterday it was officially pulling out of the controversial
Danube hydro-electric scheme, fuelling its fierce row with Czechoslovakia.
Budapest said it was abrogating the 1977 treaty governing construction of
the power plant at Bos-Gabcikovo, and was considering turning to the
European Community, the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe
or the international court in The Hague if the Czechoslovaks did not stop
building.
Environmentalists regard the project as a communist monstrosity, which will
force much of the flow into a 17km-long elevated channel. They claim that
the project will damage water supply and destroy wetlands.
Slovakia says the work - which is mostly on its side of the border - is 90
per cent complete and that Korunas 20bn (Pounds 390m) has been spent.
The issue adds another volatile ingredient to the complicated tensions
between Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. As Slovakia approaches
elections which are likely to produce a more nationalist government,
Hungarian nervousness about the 800,000 fellow nationals there is mounting
along with Czech fears of the break-up of the Czechoslovak federation.
Hungary's move follows three years of bitter arguments over the project
since Budapest halted its part of the construction in 1989.
The uncompromising tone adopted by both Hungary and Czechoslovakia yesterday
underlines the fact that neither side can afford to give in for domestic
political reasons.
In Hungary, the democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was
born out of hostility to the dam.
Last week, Mr Villiam Oberhauser, Slovak minister of forest and water
management, said too much damage had been done to reverse the situation
ecologically, while the plant would produce Kcs6bn of power a year for
Slovakia.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S president, citing a danger to 'democratic order' in the country,
yesterday confronted the government on its attempts to exercise control of
the media.
Mr Arpad Goncz, the president and a member of the Liberal opposition, said
he was refusing to carry out the prime minister's recommendation to sack the
head of the state-owned radio.
He referred to the danger of 'serious damage to the democratic operation of
the state,' a claim rejected by the government, setting the scene for a
constitutional stand-off.
Mr Jozsef Antall, the conservative premier has made it plain he sees the
radio station as hostile to the party's interests. Yesterday he responded
with a prickly defence of his government's policy, saying: 'poor relations
with the press are due to the fact that I have high standards for the
media.'
It was the latest and most dramatic episode in a struggle between government
and opposition for influence over the media which has dominated domestic
politics since free elections in 1990.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Croats face Serb military show trial: Seven civilians seem
to have already been judged guilty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SEVEN Croat nationals, accused by the Yugoslav army of war crimes and taking
part in an 'armed uprising against Yugoslavia' went before a military
tribunal yesterday in what looked destined to turn into a show trial.
The seven Croats from a village near Vukovar, the devastated city in eastern
Croatia, are accused of crimes committed last autumn at the height of the
army siege of the town, set on the banks of the River Danube. The crimes
range from murder to 'endangering the security of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia'.
The trial in the first floor courtroom of Belgrade's main military
courthouse is quickly turning into a Kafkaesque parody. The defendants, who
face the death penalty, are being tried by a military court although they
are all civilians.
The five defendants filed into court looking bewildered, while one was
obviously mentally disturbed. They sat facing five military judges, whose
uniforms were decorated with from two to five stars.
The main witness, who was present at the hearing, cursed and jeered:
'Ustashe (Croat fascists) animals'.
A guilty verdict seems inevitable in a trial where most of the defendants
have not been allowed to choose their own lawyers. Instead 'defence'
counsels from the ranks of embittered Serb refugees from Croatia have been
imposed upon them.
Mrs Nadezhda Danilovic, an attorney from Belgrade, yesterday objected to the
military tribunal, arguing that the court was not authorised to try Croat,
now foreign, citizens. She added that the reconstituted state of Yugoslavia
had not been internationally recognised.
A western diplomat yesterday said: 'We are not questioning the right of
Serbia to try war criminals if it is based on real evidence. But there is
also a legal and moral responsibility to try criminals from their own side.'
Mrs Danilovic fears the trial may mark the beginning of a wave of show
trials. She said the defendants were being tried for heinous war crimes,
although Yugoslavia was never officially at war with Croatia.
Defence lawyers fear that Serbia's state-controlled media will use this and

FT  20 MAY 92 / Bosnia holds secret talks on Croatia link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECRET talks on a confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina were
revealed yesterday as Serb irregulars tightened their noose around Sarajevo,
the ravaged capital of Bosnia.
News of the negotiations came as Bosnia's rival ethnic leaders were due to
resume European Community-brokered peace talks in Lisbon tomorrow. Diplomats
however held out little hope that the talks would take place as planned.
Croatia's pro-government media yesterday reported that Croat and Moslem
leaders from Bosnia last week held secret talks in Split, the Croatian port,
on a confederal relationship between the two republics and on the internal
arrangement of Bosnia. 'Confederation of Croatia and Bosnia is acceptable to
both the Croatian and Moslem people of Bosnia,' a statement said.
Bosnian leaders did not confirm yesterday's disclosure, but talk of a
confederation is a sign of the desperation gripping Bosnia's Moslems reeling
from the Serb onslaught on Bosnia.
Mr Frederic Maurice, 39, a Swiss relief worker from the International Red
Cross, yesterday died in hospital after a mortar attack, which wounded two
other relief workers on Monday.
Meanwhile the announcement by Serb leaders of plans to form the army of the
self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, yesterday
threatened the UN peace plan. The plan calls for some 14,000 peacekeepers to
monitor the demilitarisation and disarming of three crisis areas in Croatia.
The Yugoslav army, which is withdrawing from Croatia, is due to complete its
withdrawal from Bosnia. But the bulk of its weaponry and personnel are being
transferred to the newly-proclaimed Serb army of Bosnia.
The army yesterday left the military airport in Tuzla after evacuating the
military barracks, reported Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.
Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, have seized control of some
two-thirds of Bosnia's territory. Relief convoys have been blocked from
distributing aid throughout the republic of 4.35m Moslems, Serbs and Croats,
who are desparately short of food and medicine.
The Italian government yesterday approved a series of administrative
measures to cut red tape in the handling of refugees from the fighting in
Bosnia.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Armenia 'annexing' part of Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BAKU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces is now going on in or
around four key towns on Azerbaijani territory, according to a senior
Azerbaijani politician.
Mr Niazi Ibragimov, a deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front, said
last night that Armenia was 'annexing' major parts of Azeribaijan territory
and that 'the world community must know what is happening - it has
encouraged it to happen.'
The escalation of the fighting over the past few days has raised the
conflict between the two Caucasian republics to a level of virtual war, with
the smaller Armenian republic attacking strongly on two fronts.
Mr Ibragimov said that a land corridor between Armenia and the
Armenia-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan was now under
Armenian control and that Sadarak on the north-east of the Azerbaijani
autonomous republic of Nakhichevan - which is between Armenia and Turkey -
was last night being hit by rockets.
'All of the fighting is now on Azerbaijani territory - at Agdam (to the east
of Karabakh), Fizuli (to its south), Lachin (to its west, and to the end of
the Armenian corridor) and Sadarak. The Azerbaijani population of Karabakh
has been partly destroyed, partly made refugees. And the world's press and
governments go on babbling about the plight of the Armenians in Karabakh.'
The Popular Front has now taken political control in the Azerbaijani capital
of Baku, with the election on Monday of Mr Isa Gambarov, a deputy chairman
of the Front, as speaker of parliament and acting president. Mr Ibragimov
said presidential elections were planned for June 7 'unless the situation in
Baku is destabilised', with parliamentary elections within the year, under
the same conditions.
The republic, with 7m population, is potentially rich in oil in offshore
deposits now being prospected by a group of western oil companies.
An Amoco representative in Baku said last night that the leaders of the
republic's oil and gas corporation remained in place, and he expected them
to continue to do so.
Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the former communist president who briefly took power
last Thursday was, according to unconfirmed reports, in a Moscow military
hospital last night after fleeing Baku from a military airfield. Mr
Ibragimov said he did not expect any attempt at a further coup from Mr
Mutalibov's supporters.
The Popular Front, a secular force created by intellectuals four years ago,
and favouring closer relations with Turkey, now controls half the 50 seats
in the Meijlis, or National Council of the republic.
He said Russian intelligence services had collaborated in the attempted
rehabilitation of Mr Mutalibov last week because Russia believed he would
have sought closer relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Azerbaijan, with four other CIS members, refused to sign a pact on
collective security in Tashkent last Friday. Armenia, with Russia, was among
the six which did sign.
Turkey yesterday warned Armenia of the consequences of its 'aggression and
expansionism' following intensified fighting, Reuter reports. The US also
condemned the escalating violence but avoided taking sides.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Spain threatens to impede Community enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN will withhold co-operation on enlarging the European Community unless
it wins speedy agreement on bringing into operation a new EC mechanism for
channelling resources to poorer countries.
Mr Carlos Westendorp, minister for European affairs, said yesterday that
Spain wants the Community's new 'cohesion fund' agreed at Maastricht five
months ago to come into effect at the start of next year.
He also served notice that Britain's Pounds 2bn a year EC rebate, agreed in
1984 to compensate it for undue financial burdens from the common
agricultural policy, will probably have to be renegotiated.
Germany has already cast a cloud over Britain's presidency of the Community
in the second half of this year by suggesting that the rebate will have to
be cut to help improve EC finances.
The cohesion fund will represent an important source of funding for Spain's
overall efforts to improve its economic structure in preparation for
economic and monetary union later in the decade. The fund, as proposed by Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, would channel Ecu2bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) a year to Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland by the end of
1997.
Spain is insisting that the EC settle the financial details of the
Maastricht process before negotiations on widening the Community can begin.
This means the 12 members will have to clinch an accord on the cohesion
fund, as part of general efforts to boost the EC's resources, at the
Edinburgh summit in early December. Germany and Britain have expressed
scepticism whether the fund needs to be operating before the end of 1993.
Mr Westendorp warned that unless agreement were reached, Spain would be
'less co-operative in other operations' - above all, concerning the plans
for Sweden, Austria and Finland to start EC entry talks next year.
Mr Delors' proposals, put forward in February, for increasing the EC budget
by Ecu21bn up to 1997 have drawn sharp criticism from Britain, Germany and
others. Roughly half the extra funds would go to the four poorer EC members,
both through the cohesion fund and through an enlargement of the existing
structural fund for economic development.
The Delors package, if accepted, would increase Spain's net receipts from
the Community from Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1992 to roughly Dollars 6bn
in 1997. The extra funding was 'the minimum necessary', he said, to aid
Spain's attempts to bring its economy into line with its better-off
partners.

The budget, which sets total expenditure at Rbs1,179bn with a deficit of 2
per cent of gross domestic product, was attacked by reformers for failing to
initiate structural economic changes and by hardliners for capping social
subsidies. After two days of fierce debate, deputies endorsed the budget in
principle and ordered the government to present a final draft by June 15.

FT  20 MAY 92 / EC energy tax plan 'interests' Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has expressed 'clear interest' in the EC's proposed tax on energy to
combat global warming, while the US continues to rule out fiscal means to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, according to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC
environment commissioner.
At last weekend's informal meeting in Bonn of environment ministers of the
Group of Seven most industrialised nations, he said, 'there was clear
interest from the Japanese side. It is not yet an agreement, but not a
refusal. They are studying (the tax) carefully without discarding it.'
The Commission proposal, for a Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent tax
by 2000, levied half on energy value and half on carbon content, depends on
the EC's main industrial partners following suit. Environment ministers of
the 12 are expected to endorse the thrust of this plan on May 26.
At the Bonn meeting the US expressed 'a drastic refusal', Mr Ripa di Meana
said. However, he stressed the 'very powerful boost' to the plan in the
'unprecedented and unexpected support from the World Bank', contained in its
latest development report.
The commissioner believes concerted political pressure could lead Washington
to move further, now that in the run-up to the Rio de Janeiro earth summit
next month, the US has 'accepted the logic of stabilising' CO emissions for
the first time.
The EC's proposed carbon tax would have to be Dollars 36 rather than Dollars
10 per barrel of oil equivalent if CO emissions were to be stabilised in
line with international recommendations, according to an economic report
published today by Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute, Tim
Coone adds from Dublin.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Lamont vows to defeat inflation: Government and Bank stress
price stability as centrepiece of economic strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and the Bank of England yesterday served notice that the
battle against inflation, far from being over, would remain the centrepiece
of their economic strategy amid signs that Britain's longest recession since
the 1940s is coming to an end.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the annual dinner of the
Confederation of British Industry that Britain should aim to match Japan's
inflation performance, which is around 2 per cent, if it wants to be 'a
first-rank commercial power'.
His theme was echoed in the latest Bank of England quarterly bulletin, which
yesterday warned that there was 'no room for complacency' about the UK's
inflation performance.
The Bank urged the government to take 'firm control of public expenditure'
as part of a strategy for price stability.
The twin warnings from the chancellor and the Bank are a clear signal that
the government intends rigorously to control the pace of Britain's economic
recovery and the fall in interest rates.
The Central Statistical Office disclosed that manufacturing output grew by
0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year, compared with the previous
quarter, fuelling hopes that the recession might soon be over. The increase
came after six quarters of falling output.
However, overall industrial production, comprising manufacturing and energy
output, fell by 1 per cent in the latest quarter, dragged down by a sharp
drop in energy production during the mild winter.
The decline in overall industrial production will probably mean that first
quarter non-oil gross domestic product figures, due to be published on
Friday, will show a fall for the seventh successive quarter.
However, both the Treasury and the Bank of England were cautiously upbeat
about the economy.
The Treasury said that yesterday's figures suggested that 'the fall in
manufacturing output may have ended and growth will become firmly
established during 1992' while the Bank commented that 'the prospects for
recovery now appear better than for some time'.
In his speech to the CBI, however, Mr Lamont said underlying inflation in
the UK was 'still too high' in spite of the progress made in bringing the
annual rate of retail price inflation down to 4.3 per cent.
He said that sterling's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System required a 'sea change in attitudes to inflation in
Britain'. Devaluation was not an option, so high pay increases would
'translate directly into a loss of competitiveness and hence of market
share, profits and jobs'.
In a move that could prove significant in the long term, the chancellor
yesterday ordered the government's retail prices index advisory committee to
review the way housing costs are treatedin the retail prices index. He said
the government:
Aimed to keep downward pressure on inflation by intensifying competition in
the economy. 'We will continue to look to the regulators and increased
competition to bring pressure to bear on privatised industries and keep
prices down,' he said.
'Must put the firm control of public expenditure at the heart of economic
policy'. He warned that public sector pay awards must not be allowed to run
ahead of what was justified by the need to recruit, retain and motivate good
quality public servants.
Was firmly committed to meeting the strict economic convergence criteria of
the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union. That would mean firm
budget discipline, membership of the narrow bands of the ERM and bringing UK
inflation and interest rates 'in line with the best in Europe'.
But he appeared to damp expectations that UK rates might fall below those in
Germany. 'Those who argue that we could have had lower interest rates
outside the ERM seem conveniently to forget that only for four months in the
1980s did the UK have lower rates than Germany.'
But the Bank is giving thought to the possibility of UK rates falling below
German levels. This would be likely in the event of German rates rising and
would depend on Britain's counter-inflation policy and commitment to the ERM
parity of DM2.95 enjoying high credibility in markets.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Premier brings touch of glasnost to Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR brought a touch of glasnost to Whitehall yesterday by
revealing details of the ministerial committees which underpin government
decision-making.
One of the first insights provided by the published outline of the machinery
of cabinet government was that Mr Michael Hes-eltine has won a partial
victory in his attempts to upgrade the authority of the Department of Trade
and Industry.
As president of the board of trade, Mr Heseltine is listed as a member of an
expanded cabinet committee charged with industrial policy. Senior officials
said the committee would have the brief of taking a Whitehall-wide view of
the impact of government policy on industrial competitiveness.
Mr Major, however, has acknowledged the sensitivities of the Treasury over
Mr Heseltine's ambitions by appointing Lord Wakeham, the lord privy seal, as
a 'neutral' chairman of the committee. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has
also been given an important role.
Breaking with the tradition of secrecy which has shrouded the cabinet
committee system since its creation after the First World War, the
government gave details of the 26 groups which act for the full cabinet in
deciding policy.
Mr William Waldegrave, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, also published
the official guidance given to ministers on their conduct in government and
on conflicts of interest in their financial affairs.
Mr Waldegrave, who is charged with leading Mr Major's drive for greater
openness, said publication of the information was an important contribution
to changing the 'culture' of Whitehall. But he rejected calls for a freedom
of information act.
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, and Mr Gus O'Donnell, the prime
minister's press secretary, signalled there were strict limits to the new
openness. Sir Robin said he was reluctant to reveal the precise timing of
the establishment of other cabinet committees. Mr O'Donnell indicated
proceedings of the meetings would remain secret, echoing official warnings
that ministers should not reveal details of their deliberations.
The Campaign for the Freedom of Information described the announcements as a
'modest gesture' towards more openness, while Charter 88, the group pressing
for constitutional change, also cautiously welcomed the move.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Thai army crackdown fails to stop unrest spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MILITARY crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Bangkok failed to clear
protesters off the streets yesterday as demonstrations continued for a third
day and unrest spread to other parts of the country.
The beleaguered government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime
minister, has withheld details of casualties in the bloodiest clashes seen
in the Thai capital since 1976, but information from hospital doctors
suggested that at least 50 people had been killed since Sunday night.
The US stepped up its pressure on Bangkok to resolve the crisis peacefully -
suspending its role in a joint military exercise. It said a normal
relationship with the Thai government under current conditions was
impossible.
Last night several thousand demonstrators barricaded a highway outside
Ramkhamhaeng university in eastern Bangkok. Although gatherings of 10 or
more people are banned under the state of emergency, security forces kept a
low profile and allowed a protest rally at the university to pass off
peacefully.
Thousands of protesters were also reported to have held a rally in Songkhla,
a university town in the south of Thailand. Smaller demonstrations have
taken place in other towns, including the resort island of Phuket.
The privy council met yesterday in emergency session and a group of
influential academics submitted an appeal to King Bhumibol Adulyadej to
break the deadlock. Thais are beginning to hope the king will intervene to
resolve the matter as he did at the time of anti-government student
demonstrations in 1973.
The academics also suggested that General Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister
from 1980 to 1988, should return to the post, and that constitutional
amendments to reduce the power of the military should be passed within three
weeks, but that parliament should not be dissolved.
Many shops, offices and banks reopened in the capital but hurriedly closed
again at midday as rumours of looting and violence swept through the city.
One hotel boarded up its windows.
'There's quite a lot of panic in commercial circles,' said one foreign
banker. 'There's going to be very little commerce tomorrow.'
Some bank branches ran out of cash and queues grew at automatic tellers and
petrol stations. By evening, normally a time of acute traffic congestion,
Bangkok's streets were almost deserted. Soldiers, harried by groups of
youths in the city centre, set up roadblocks and searched motorcyclists, who
have been at the forefront of some rioting.
On the stock market the SET index fell by nearly 9 per cent to close at
667.84, down 65.05, its largest single daily fall.
Some tourist flights into Bangkok were cancelled as foreign governments
advised their nationals to stay away.
Although Gen Suchinda and the military have regained a measure of control
over the capital, many Thais question whether he can continue to govern the
country. The heavy-handed suppression of the demonstrations and the abrasive
statements issued by the prime minister and his commanders has further
alienated the inhabitants of Bangkok.
A parliamentary debate on constitutional amendments originally seen as a way
out of the crisis, scheduled for Friday, has been postponed indefinitely.
The military are using the state media to portray the violence as urban
rioting. During yesterday morning's violence, angry protesters burned down
the state lottery building and the government public relations department,
both traditional targets of demonstrations against corruption and media
censorship.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Moderates thwart Militant in Civil Service union election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAR-LEFT Militant group yesterday lost its strongest chance of winning
the leadership of a UK union when moderates swept the board in the elections
for top jobs at the Civil and Public Services Association.
The 125,000-strong CPSA is Britain's largest Civil Service union.
The election of Mr Barry Reamsbottom as general secretary and other
moderates to positions including deputy general secretary, treasurer and
president is likely to be welcomed by the government.
During the past 10 years, Militant has had a stronger influence in the CPSA
than in any other union, winning control of its executive for a year in
1987-88. This year, Mr John Macreadie, Militant's candidate for general
secretary and the union's deputy general secretary, was thought to have a
good chance against Mr Reamsbottom.
Under the leadership of Mr Reamsbottom and a moderate-dominated executive,
also elected yesterday, the CPSA is far less likely to clash with the
government or organise industrial action than it would under Militant.
'We will do a deal with John Major,' said Mr Reamsbottom yesterday. 'We are
pragmatists and I respect the decision of the British people to re-elect
him. He says he wants good public services; so do our members and the way to
get them is by giving them good pay and good conditions.'
The moderates are in favour of this year's pay offer to members which would
extend performance-related pay and provide basic rises of 4.25 per cent.
They are also more amenable to the creation of Civil Service agencies and
will adopt a less confrontational approach on the contracting out of
services than would a Militant-led union.
In the general secretary election, Mr Reamsbottom polled 13,649 votes
against Mr Macreadie's 10,561 and 3,918 for Mr Peter Thomason, candidate of
the soft left. Mr Alan Churchard, a moderate, succeeds Mr Macreadie as
deputy general secretary.
Mr Macreadie will become a national officer, a post he held before his 1987
election as deputy general secretary. In the poll for treasurer, Mr Keith
Mills defeated the incumbent Ms Chris Kirk, a soft left candidate.
In elections for the 26-seat executive, the moderates won 20 seats, the same
as last year, and Militant sympathisers three. Ms Marion Chambers was
re-elected as president and her moderate vice-presidents were also
re-elected.
Mr Reamsbottom said yesterday he wanted to establish a closer relationship
with the other Civil Service unions. However, merger with the NUCPS, the
second-largest Civil Service union, would not be brought back on to the
agenda following a vote by union members against it last year.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record 3,397.99, up 21.96, as
the biggest monthly drop in US housing starts for more than eight years
renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve might signal a small cut in
interest rates.

FT  20 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie struggles to hold above 2,700
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LATE burst of activity, prompted by some rather spurious takeover
speculation, enabled London's equity market to end a difficult day with only
minor damage. More importantly, it finished above the psychologically
important 2,700 level on the Footsie index. At the close the index was 3
points lower at 2,700.6.
Equity market specialists were encouraged that the market had managed to
hold above 2,700, although there were suspicions that dealers were more than
keen to see the index close above that level.
There was turmoil in the market at the outset of trading, when a fault in
the Stock Exchange computing system led to incorrect FT-SE 100 share indices
being published on the Stock Exchange TOPIC system during the first few
minutes of trading. The fault also meant that prices carried on TOPIC's
Footsie trigger page were incorrect. There were no problems, however, with
the market's Seaq trading system, enabling dealers to trade normally
throughout the session.
The problems were quickly corrected, showing that the Footsie opened some
3.6 higher at 2,707.2. The early rise in the Footsie reflected the latest
strong showing by Wall Street overnight and a positive performance by Tokyo.
However, a decline in the Footsie future and the emergence of only scattered
support for leading shares saw the market begin to drift off and dip below
2,700 to reach the day's low point of 2,693.7, or 9.9 lower.
April's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement of Pounds 3.6bn came as no
surprise to the City, nor did figures for industrial production and unit
wage costs. Thereafter, the market managed to recoup some of the lost
ground, with an early modest fall by Wall Street having little effect on
London. Dealers were quick to point out that sterling continued to perform
well against the D-Mark and the dollar and that there had been few signs of
pressure in the gilts market.
News that the Bank of England had waved through the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking bid for Midland Bank caused a flurry in Midland shares amid rather
unconvincing stories that Hongkong Bank may well launch a market raid to
pick up a further 10 per cent of Midland shares.
Another suggestion was that Lloyds, increasingly viewed as being thwarted in
its attempts to acquire Midland, could now turn its attentions towards Royal
Bank of Scotland.
Heavy turnover in Asda also revived old bid hints in the supermarket chain.
The best showing in the Footsie came from British Airways, whose shares ran
up 5.2 per cent after more than doubled profits.
Lasmo, the oil group, took a hammering after SG Warburg Securities
downgraded its earnings and dividend projections for the stock.
Turnover in equities accelerated after a slow start, helped by a
medium-sized programme trade executed around midday, and reached 565.4m
shares. As expected, the value of customer business on Monday dropped below
Pounds 1bn, only the third time since the general election that turnover has
fallen below that level.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall back after
Monday's enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST bourses fell back after Monday's gains, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated, with news of a 5.8 per cent building workers' pay
deal helping to maintain the equilibrium. Carmakers and engineers, which led
on Monday after the settlement of the metalworkers' pay talks, were mixed
and the main move came in chemicals.
At Hoare Govett, Mr Robert Willis took the view that the pay settlements and
the removal of the solidarity tax in the second half of this year should
give the German consumer, and German equities a good run between now and
Christmas. The DAX and FAZ indices seemed to support this, rising another
4.83 to 1,763.26 and 2.43 to 710.56 respectively.
Turnover fell from DM8.2bn to DM7.2bn. BASF and Bayer led chemicals up with
rises of DM3.50 to DM243.90 and DM4.40 to DM293.90. Companies with long-term
problems shed the gains achieved on Monday as Deutsche Babcock fell DM4 to
DM167.50 and Porsche going further with a drop of DM15 to DM490.
Linde added another DM8.50 to Monday's DM24 gain, closing at DM852.50 after
its forecast of at least 10 per cent turnover growth this year and
satisfactory profits.
Continental, rose DM2 to DM265.50 on reports that the state government of
Lower Saxony was encouraging companies in the state to take stakes in the
tyre maker and on rumours that Sumitomo of Japan was interested in the Conti
stake owned by Pirelli.
PARIS ran into profit-taking and arbitrage ahead of the close of the account
on Thursday. The CAC-40 index fell 28.51 or 1.4 per cent to 2,023.13 in
modest turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Generale des Eaux dropped FFr50 to FFr2,390 on news that it was spending
DM1bn in buying and modernising Berlin's Defa film studios.
The biggest loser of the day was the insurer UAP which dropped FFr27 or 4.8
per cent to FFr541 in arbitrage-related trading. Another casualty was Euro
Disney which fell FFr3.80 or 2.9 per cent to FFr124.
Pinault rose FFR6.30 to FFr371 amid talk that it was close to selling off
its wood joinery activities.
MILAN fell back after Monday's brief recovery, dragged down by reports that
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) could face up to L1,000bn in back taxes and
fines stemming from its takeover of a loss-making Milan state bank two years
ago. The Comit index lost 1.85 to 472.80 in turnover estimated at
L70bn-L80bn after Monday's L85.6bn.
BCI dropped L123 or 4 per cent to L2,918, dragging the rest of the banking
sector down with it. Industrials bucked the weaker trend however, with
Olivetti, gaining L47 to L3,032 and Fiat adding L6 to L4,941.
AMSTERDAM had a quiet day with the CBS Tendency index closing unchanged at
129.4. Fokker attracted some interest early on, rising 50 cents to Fl 36.60,
following Monday's news that a consortium of European aerospace companies
was negotiating to take a 51 per cent stake in the group. However,
profit-taking pushed the price down to close 10 cents off at Fl 36.10, but
above an intraday low of Fl 35.70.
KLM gained 10 cents to Fl 39.40 on rumours, later denied, that merger talks
with BA had been reopened.
Unilever saw one of the day's biggest falls, losing Fl 1.00 to Fl 185.60
following its disappointing first quarter figures. However, some analysts
feel that the group is in line for recovery, with earnings growth forecast
for 1993.
STOCKHOLM recovered after a weak start to end flat. The Affarsvarlden
general index eased just 0.2 to 998.4, in turnover of SKr580m.
Asea rose SKr4 to SKr377 after reporting a pre-tax profit of SKr624m in the
first quarter, in line with expectations. But Volvo tumbled ahead of news
that it swung to a pre-tax loss after financial items of SKr248m in the
first quarter. Volvo B free's lost SKr4 to SKr431 at the close and was
quoted at SKr429 in London later in the day.
COPENHAGEN registered its fifth successive decline, the all-share index
falling another 2.80 to 334.26. The shipping shares, Svendborg B and 1912 B,
fell by DKr3,200 to DKr133,100 and DKr3,100 to DKr93,400 respectively. Low
turnover, ahead of the June 2 referendum to clarify Denmark's future
relationship to the EC, continues to plague the market, writes Hilary
Barnes.
MADRID's general index eased 0.86 to 259.76. Telefonica continued to attract
buyers following Monday's pleasing first quarter results, gaining Pta10 to
Pta1,115 in volume of some 2.6m shares.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Traders move in on
higher yen and bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES gained further ground yesterday on the strength of the yen and
higher bond prices, activity centring on trading of 'environmental' and
bio-technology issues, while leading institutions stayed on the sidelines,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was finally 311.01 ahead at 18,754.11, after opening at
the day's low of 18,479.53 and reaching a high of 18,775.79 just before the
close.
Volume rose from 216m shares to 320m. Traders said dealer activity led
trading, while investment trusts were seen bargain hunting. They added that
buying by foreign investors, who are reluctant to 'chase' stock prices
higher, has thinned out.
However, analysts said investor confidence was gradually recovering. Mr
Jason James, strategist at James Capel, commented: 'Investors, who
previously were only willing to buy at the 17,000 level, came in to buy at
the 18,000 level on Monday.'
Advances far outnumbered declines by 833 to 172, with 118 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks moved ahead 22.57 to 1,393.31,
and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.45 to 1,111.28.
Reports pointing to the possibility of postal insurance and annuity funds
investing directly into the stock market also encouraged investors.
Currently the funds can only be invested in the stock market through
designated money trust accounts.
According to James Capel, if the plan were permitted, the direct investment
by postal insurance funds could mean an inflow of Y5,000bn into the stock
market.
Buyers followed good company results. Traders said firm forecasts from some
companies were adding to the positive sentiment. Kyocera climbed Y120 to
Y4,490. The semiconductor component maker posted a 27 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the past fiscal year, but forecast a 6.8 per cent
increase for 1992/93.
Mitsubishi Kasei rose Y13 to Y447 in spite of a 53.4 per cent drop in
profits; it forecast a 5.4 per cent improvement for the current year.
Real estate issues continued to lose ground, with Mitsui Fudosan, which
announced a pre-tax loss for the first time in 16 years, dipping Y10 to
Y1,030, and Sumitomo Realty and Development, after posting a 31 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, shedding Y4 to Y734.
Reports that Showa Denko would produce biodegradable plastic developed by
Showa Highpolymer sparked renewed interest in the environmental protection
theme. Showa Denko gained Y43 to Y340 and Japan Metals and Chemicals
appreciated Y20 to Y790.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 315.15 to 21,347.42 in volume of
19.4m shares.
Roundup
THE worsening political situation in Bangkok had little negative influence
on Pacific Basin markets yesterday as sentiment was buoyed by a stronger
Tokyo. Manila registered a 1992 high.
HONG KONG traded in a narrow range and the Hang Seng index ended 5.15 up at
5,642.24 in HKDollars 3.23bn turnover.
Brokers said rumours about HSBC's exposure to O &amp; Y, of Canada, caused the
bank to ease 25 cents to HKDollars 43.25.
MANILA reversed Monday's losses in active trade on bargain hunting. The
composite index rose 21.84 to 1,338.95 in combined turnover of 443.8m pesos.
SEOUL was held down by weakness in large-capitalisation issues. The
composite index eased 0.08 to 587.97 in turnover of Won346.32bn.
TAIWAN saw late buying in financials, which helped to push the weighted
index up 63.19 to 4,500.82. Turnover rose to TDollars 26.58bn from TDollars
22.67bn.
The market was buoyed by reports that the government might alter the stock
transaction tax. The financial sector gained 4 per cent, with First
Commercial Bank adding TDollars 6 at TDollars 106, after officials said last
week that they planned to ease curbs on banks doing business in China.
KUALA LUMPUR opened firmer and then wavered in a narrow range throughout
much of the day. The composite index edged up 0.57 to 590.91. Retail
investors again dominated trading as institutional support remained small.
Newly listed Peladang Kimia saw 6.2m shares traded and closed at MDollars
1.68 for a premium of 38 cents over its offer price.
AUSTRALIA declined in lacklustre trading. The All Ordinaries index lost 2.2
to 1,666.3 in turnover of ADollars 179.5m. Banks were weaker ahead of
forthcoming interim results and the sector index shed 25.1, or 1.1 per cent,
to 2,205.1.
Westpac lost 6 cents to ADollars 3.94 on rights issue rumours. National
Australia, which releases its results tomorrow, dipped 10 cents to ADollars
7.95. ANZ, which reports next week, was off 7 cents at ADollars 4.36.
News Corp rose 12 cents to ADollars 21.62 on news that its UK satellite unit
had won the rights to televise games of the leading British football teams.
NEW ZEALAND recorded its seventh successive gain on the strength of firm
overseas markets and the weak New Zealand dollar. The NZSE-40 index added
13.24 at 1,552.69.
Newspaper shares did well, with Independent Newspapers firming 10 cents to
NZDollars 4.75.
SINGAPORE ended mixed in featureless trading. The Straits Times Industrial
index edged ahead 3.08 to 1,469.80.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Military might crushes Thai equities -
The civil unrest has upset attempts to encourage investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER UNGPHAKORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices suffered their worst falls in history on the Bangkok stock
market yesterday, the first day of trading since the military crushed
protests against the appointment of General Suchinda Kraprayoon as a
non-elected prime minister.
Prices of all but three stocks fell, and many hit their floor prices -
suffering declines of 10 per cent, the maximum permitted in a single day's
trading. The SET index dropped 8.9 per cent to close at 667.84, down 65.05
from last Friday, its lowest close since December 1991. Monday was a bank
holiday.
Stock market directors and members of the Securities and Exchange Commission
said they had been watching the situation carefully to see whether the
political crisis would justify closing the market.
They are scheduled to meet before the market opens this morning to decide
whether the situation has eased overnight. Mr Nibhat Bukkanasut, chairman of
the SET board, said that Thailand's fundamental economic position remained
sound and he urged investors to ignore rumours.
Trading was thin yesterday, turnover being about Bt3.14bn (Dollars 123m).
Investors in brokers' trading rooms were reported to be more interested in
the previous night's violence and the many unsubstantiated rumours about
further protests and other political developments.
One broker attributed the sharp setback in prices and the low trading volume
to the difficulty of obtaining reliable information.
Television and radio coverage of political events has been heavily censored,
and telephone connections were severely disrupted yesterday, apparently by
the high volume of calls, as people all over Bangkok tried to find out what
was happening.
One group of investors was reported to have organised a petition calling for
General Suchinda's resignation.
In the first quarter of the year, the market appeared to be heading for a
recovery, after last year's global recession and the coup d'etat in
Thailand. After the March 22 general election, the SET index climbed to
reach this year's peak of 832.39 on April 7, the day General Suchinda's
appointment was announced.
Since then, the index has declined with increasing speed, except for a few
days of short-lived recovery. The announcement on April 17 of General
Suchinda's cabinet, which included a number of ministers from the government
that he overthrew in last year's coup, and accused of being corrupt, set off
sharper falls that only eased last week, when the crisis appeared to be
resolved.
The nervous market has reacted particularly sensitively to political
developments. On May 7, the index weakened 25.5 points in only about 10
minutes, the time General Suchinda took to make a controversial televised
speech in parliament attacking his opponents.
For the SET, the political troubles come at an unfortunate time. Yesterday
was the first day of trading under new legislation that is designed to
reduce manipulation and political interference, encourage more companies to
list, and promote new types of equity and loan papers. One of the objectives
is to increase national savings in order to meet the rapidly expanding
economy's surging need for investment.
A new Securities and Exchange Commission has been created with powers to set
broad policy guidelines for the SET, and to supervise new share issues and
trading in existing shares both on the stock market and over the counter.
Companies listed on the SET will have to become public companies within the
next two years. The new law seeks to make this more attractive by easing
some of the stringent conditions of the previous public company law, such as
the requirement that a large proportion of shares be owned by many small
investors.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commission fights against
dilution of CAP reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission and the current Portuguese presidency of the EC were
last night still locked in negotiations as Brussels sought to resist
dilution of its planned reform of the Common Agricultural Policy by farm
ministers of the Twelve.
Hard bargaining between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and
Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese agriculture minister currently heading the
farm council, delayed resumption of the ministerial meeting, which broke off
on Monday afternoon for bilateral negotiations the Commission and Presidency
held with each member state.
The cause of the impasse was last month's fourth attempt by the presidency
to strike a compromise, which suggested lowering cereals prices to only
Ecu112 a tonne, or by 27 per cent from current prices, against the Ecu100
per tonne sought by the Commission - a 35 per cent drop.
Because the cereals chapter is the core of the MacSharry reform, he was said
by aides last night to have dug in his heels and refused to budge. One
source said a likely new compromise was Ecu110 per tonne.
Germany wants a far less severe reduction in price than even the Portuguese
compromise, while France fears that if the price does not come down far
enough, its competitive grains exporters will be hit by greater 'set-aside'
requirements to restrain production.
A new compromise paper was expected late last night, to enable ministers not
only to judge the cereals price target, but to a range of tightly knotted
problems to be resolved in the livestock and dairy sectors.
These cannot be given full consideration until the cereals issue is
resolved, since the lower cost of grain as feedstock is part of the
compensation promised livestock farmers for also accepting severe price
cuts.
With the Council of Ministers as such not sitting for all but a few minutes
of the first 36 hours of a meeting which could run all week, there was doubt
that the agreement in principle on the reform package the Commission and
Presidency were seeking this week could be reached.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec can afford a touch of
manana - Mark Nicholson explains why a production agreement is likely to
defer hard choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER arguments reverberate around Vienna's hotel suites over the next
few days, ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
gathered therein look likely to reach a production agreement for the third
quarter based on deferring for today hard choices which, with luck, may have
evaporated tomorrow.
The usual pre-summit posturing has made it clear that debate in the
ministerial meeting, opening today, will centre on whether Opec should raise
its production ceiling for the quarter by around 1m barrels a day to 24m b/d
from the second quarter limit agreed in February.
Saudi Arabia, Opec's predominant producer with a 34 per cent share of the
cartel's output, will enter the fray arguing that 24m b/d is the least the
cartel should pump for the third quarter to meet a rising appetite for crude
from nascent US and European recoveries and what Riyadh believes will be a
healthy stock build up over the quarter.
Venezuela has already signalled its approval of such a position and Saudi
delegates are said to be confident that their view will be the consensus
this week. Moreover, many in the oil market are already discounting a 1m b/d
rise, and analysts suggest this will not derail the recently firmer trend in
prices.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst for Kleinwort Benson, says he sees Brent crude
reaching Dollars 21-Dollars 22 by the end of the third quarter even given an
Opec production rise. 'We've not seen the peak in prices yet,' he says.
In familiar opposition to the Saudi-led view, however, will be the
price-hawks Iran, Algeria and perhaps Libya and Nigeria. They will argue
with varying force that production should be held at the nominal, and
slightly exceeded, February ceiling of 22.98m b/d - or even cut slightly -
in the face of stiffening demand, to raise the price for the Opec basket of
crudes towards Opec's formal target price of Dollars 21 a barrel.
Should the Saudi view prevail, and it will do so only against shrill
opposition from Iran, it will be thanks largely to the steady, if
unspectacular, recent firming of crude prices, which last week saw the Opec
basket price rise to a high since November of Dollars 18.45 a barrel.
Many analysts believe this firming should continue in modest tandem with the
economic upturn, with prices underpinned by uncertainty over a possible oil
embargo against Libya - a factor which remains in the market despite few in
the oil industry believing such an embargo is politically feasible.
Some analysts estimate that demand for Opec crude in the third quarter could
top 24.5m b/d, rising to just below 25m
b/d for the fourth. The Saudis certainly believe that 24m b/d is the minimum
required for a balanced oil market in the next quarter - implying that Opec
discipline at that level could push prices slightly higher, and thus offer
Iran room to concede a higher overall ceiling in Vienna.
The medium-term outlook for prices is also supported by the growing
certainty that Iraq will not re-enter the oil market before next year at the
earliest. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, earlier this month
rejected once again the United Nations formula for permitting an exceptional
sale of Iraqi crude to pay for humanitarian needs. The Saudis, meanwhile,
are privately confident that Iraq will export no oil while Mr Saddam Hussein
remains its president.
Without Opec having to face, for this and perhaps the next quarter, the hard
choices raised by a return of Iraqi crude to the market, a raised ceiling
could - if the Saudis have their way - see the Kingdom raise output to 8.2m
b/d from the present 8.02m b/d (thus retaining its 34 per cent Opec share)
with an eager Kuwait taking much of the additional slack.
Accommodating Kuwait's rapid resumption of output is something else Opec can
better weather in the present market climate. While analysts such as
Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimate that Kuwaiti claims to be
producing 900,000 b/d may be optimistic by 100,000 b/d, few doubt that the
emirate will be far off its target 1.5m b/d by the fourth quarter.
Mr Homoud al Rqobah, the Kuwait oil minister, is likely to stress once again
in Vienna that the emirate will not accept any Opec strictures on its oil
production - and thus its revenues. A report by the Kuwaiti Al-Shall
economic consultancy at the weekend suggesting that the emirate could end up
spending nearly a third of total oil revenues this year on servicing debt
from its reconstruction borrowing gives some idea why.
If Kuwait feels it has overwhelming economic cause to resist an Opec
straitjacket, it is not alone. Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria, and
Algeria each have urgent economic and political reasons for maximising their
revenues - something which only the former pair can adequately manage at
present prices.
Iran, in particular, feels pressed. The continued domestic appeal of
President Hashemi Rafsanjani's 'moderate' policies, now backed by a strong
majority in the recently elected majilis, will depend upon his ability to
deliver a swift and tangible improvement in the economic lot of an
increasingly bitter and impoverished population.
The force of an Opec majority and somewhat improved prices should bring Iran
under the umbrella of a deal to raise production ceilings this weekend,
after perhaps three or four days bargaining. But for Tehran, as for
high-deficit Saudi Arabia, heavily borrowed Kuwait and politically troubled
Algeria and Nigeria, the real hope is for a substantial growth in oil demand
towards the end of this year and early next.
While analysts are predicting as much, and while Iraq continues to produce
only 500,000 b/d and purely for domestic use, Opec's ministers can afford a
touch of manana about their Viennese deliberations. Certainly any thoughts
about fourth-quarter ceilings appear likely to be deferred until a further
meeting in September.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western gold mine output nears
a plateau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN MINE gold production is 'edging towards a plateau if not a peak,'
according to the annual survey of the market by Gold Fields Mineral
Services.
Mine output was up by only 2 per cent in 1991, the lowest increase for the
past 10 years. Nevertheless it was still at a record 1,782 tonnes.
The slowdown in the rate of increase reflects 'the increasing difficulty of
attracting finance for marginal properties and the depletion,
rationalisation or closure of some older mines,' the report says.
The total world supply of gold fell for the first time since 1983, to 2,815
tonnes from 2,913 tonnes in 1990. The fall reflects a decline in supplies
from the former communist bloc (from 425 tonnes in 1990 to 226 tonnes), and
a lower level of hedging by producers.
The impact of forward sales and gold loans - put at a net 40 tonnes -
'declined sharply last year owing to the combination of low spot prices, a
less attractive forward price, due to lower interest rates, and an absence
of price spikes'. The lack of demand for gold loans 'resulted in a net
pay-back of loans from new production rather than a net draw-down of new
loans'.
Central banks' net sales of gold were 105 tonnes, compared with net
purchases of 66 tonnes in 1990. But a bigger shift in the market occurred in
the private sector, which offloaded 241 tonnes. The selling included bullion
and coins from Europeans, as well as sales from stocks held in Europe on
behalf of Japanese and Middle Eastern investors.
On the demand side, jewellery fabrication rose by 4 per cent to 2,111 tonnes
and a new record 'in spite of the impact of recession.'
The report cites stockbuilding by distributors and retail outlets in Europe
and the Middle East, as well as a rapid rise in demand from the newly
prosperous China.
Other areas of demand, including electronic, dental and industrial uses,
remained largely unchanged. However, total hoarding of gold in Latin
America, the Middle East and Far East declined.
The report wonders whether 'the behaviour of bar hoarders in Asia is now
becoming more similar to that of Western investors, with a falling price
promoting disillusioned sales rather than bargain hunting purchases'.
The gold price averaged Dollars 362.26 an ounce, 6 per cent down on 1990 and
the lowest real level since the 1970s. Among factors behind gold's fall were
the decline in global economic output for only the second time since the
Second World War, the rapid resolution of the Gulf war and the easing of
political tension with the demise of the Soviet Union.
The outlook should be more positive, with more than a third of production
unprofitable and consumer spending and inflation near cyclical lows. But if
economic recovery is weak, additional gold sales could be prompted, keeping
the lid on prices for some time.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney smelter 'breaking
even'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUNKIRK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PECHINEY'S new Dollars 1bn aluminium smelter at Dunkirk already is producing
at its full annual capacity rate of 215,000 tonnes and, in spite of the
seriously depressed market conditions, is breaking even financially, said Mr
Bernard Legrand, an executive vice president and head of the state-owned
groups's world wide aluminium operations, yesterday.
The smelter, brought into operation in 22 months just ahead of schedule and
slightly under budget, will produce 180,000 tonnes of aluminium this year,
account for half of France's output of the metal and confirm Pechiney's
position as the world's third largest producer.
It will boost Pechiney's total output this year by about 100,000 tonnes from
the 1991 level to 870,000 tonnes, said Mr Legrand when his group showed the
smelter to the press for the first time. Pechiney is the second largest
supplier of aluminium to the free market in the western world after Alcan of
Canada and means to retain that position.
Mr Legrand said Pechiney had turned down approaches by two European
competitors wishing to share Dunkirk's output. 'This going to be low cost
aluminium and we quickly decided we wanted it all for ourselves,' he said.
As planned, Pechiney has closed two old smelters in France and has been
forced by market conditions to curtail production at its Vlissingen smelter
in the Netherlands.
Dunkirk produces low cost aluminium partly by using high technology and
partly because it benefits from a favourable electricity supply contract
signed with Electricite de France (EDF), which is also a state-owned
company. The project originated because EDF had substantial excess nuclear
power capacity.
Pechiney has a 35 per cent shareholding in Aluminium Dunkirk, the company
which owns the Dunkirk smelter, and private investors own the rest. The
group also has a one-third share in the Dunkirk operating company with the
rest of the equity shared by the ownership company and EDF.
Pechiney is responsible for ensuring the smelter's supply of alumina - all
400,000 tonnes of this essential raw material is coming this year from
Alcoa's subsidiary in Surinam.
Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's chairman, said yesterday that the project showed
there was still a place for large, heavy industrial projects in Europe. The
smelter emits virtually no pollution and its productivity is claimed to be
the best in the world - 400 tonnes a year for each member of the work force
by the end of 1992. It employs 550 directly.
It also brings FFr2bn positive benefit to the French trace balance. Last
year net imports of aluminium to France rose from 405,000 tonnes in 1990 to
424,000 tonnes. Dunkirk also confirms Pechiney's leading role in aluminium
smelter technology - two thirds of all new smelters in the past 10 years
have employed its technology.

Growing sentiment that producers are close to a unified stance on price
supports helped to lift COFFEE prices in London and New York. The July New
York arabica contract moved above key resistance at 65.20 cents a lb in
early trading. Traders were hesitant to sell despite conflicting reports on
whether questions had been reached regarding agreement on shares in any new
quota plan, a target price or selectivity, analysts said. In Chicago MAIZE
and SOYABEANS were sharply lower at midday in reaction to bearish export,
planting, and weather reports. 'You are starting to blow people out of
here,' one broker said of the domino affect of fund selling in the maize
market. The pressure spilled over into WHEAT. PLATINUM rose as the London
bullion market digested Monday's bullish Johnson and Matthey report. New
York platinum futures pared early gains by midday. A 17 per cent fall in US
housing starts in April, the biggest drop in eight years, undermined
sentiment by pointing to a still-anaemic economy, analysts said. The New
York COTTON market was limit down at midday following overnight rain in the
Delta region of the US.

<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN and Columbian officials hope to forge a 'transitional' accord, to
boost the currently depressed coffee market, at the September meeting on the
International Coffee Agreement. They believe that some clauses can be ready
to take effect as early as October.
This position emerged from a Monday meeting in Rio de Janeiro of
representatives of the two governments. They now plan to canvass Indonesia
and leading producers in central America and Africa in an attempt to build a
consensus among producers at their meeting in London on 27 May. That
gathering is in preparation for the coming round of negotiations with
consumers in late June.
Brazilian private sector sources say that the initiative for the fast-track
transitional pact comes from the Colombians. Some of them doubt whether a
consensual agreement can be hammered out in such a short period of time.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Equities: Investors expect steady flow of
share offers from France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL equity investors expect to see a steady flow of global share
offerings from France following last week's surprise announcement that the
French government plans to raise FFr9.5bn from selling its 19 per cent stake
in Total, the French oil group.
Analysts predict the French government may raise up to FFr15bn this year and
a further FFr20bn-FFr30bn from partial privatisations in 1993, depending on
which party wins the general election. Given the large size of the deals,
the government may need to raise up to 25 per cent of the total from
international investors.
Ms Sophie Blanpain, French analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, says
attention will focus initially on Total's equity offering, adding that if
this is well-received and takes place soon, it could pave the way for
another privatisation later this year.
No date has been given for the Total offering, which is the biggest of the
partial privatisations so far, although market participants expect it to
take place within the next two months, probably in June. Ms Blanpain
believes the international tranche could represent up to 25 per cent of the
issue.
The state has already raised FFr2bn from the sale of its 2.3 per cent stake
in the oil group Elf Aquitaine, and is expected to sell shares in the Caisse
Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP), a life insurance company, raising an
estimated FFr2bn.
Ms Blanpain points out that the state is likely to sell shares in companies
which have completed their restructuring. She believes the next candidate
for partial privatisation is likely to be either Rhone Poulenc, the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, or Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium
producer.
Shearson Lehman forecast that if the Conservative Party wins the general
election next year, it would probably introduce a large-scale privatisation
programme, raising about FFr30bn in 1993 and up to FFr60bn a year thereafter
 -equivalent to 0.8 per cent of GDP. Most of the proceeds would be used to
repay government debt or reduce its net issuance.
Recent opinion polls and the results of the regional elections earlier this
year have suggested that the ruling Socialist Party is unlikely to form the
government.
Reliance, the Indian petrochemical group controlled by the Ambani family,
looks set to push ahead with its international equity offering, despite the
recent financial scandal in India which has hit stock prices on the local
stock market.
Morgan Stanley, lead manager for the Dollars 100m equity issue, said pricing
is expected to take place 'within the next few days' provided market
conditions were favourable.
The deal, which marks the first time an Indian private sector company has
issued an international share offering, is to help finance a gas cracker.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Ontario's Dollars 2bn issue launched to
warm reception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROVINCE of Ontario's new programme of large global bond issues was
launched to a largely appreciative market yesterday, enabling Dollars 2bn of
bonds to be soaked up with relative ease.
Against a positive background in the US Treasuries market, strong demand
from US investors set the tone and acted to bring in investors from Europe
later in the day. The 10-year bonds were offered with an indicated yield
spread of 64-66 basis points over the US government market but, given the
level of demand, it seemed likely last night that the deal would be priced
at the lower level.
For Ontario, which this year expects to raise around CDollars 10bn from the
capital markets to finance its budget deficit, the issue was an important
launch for its new funding programme. Had it chosen to raise money through a
smaller issue in the Yankee (domestic US) market, it could have offered a
yield spread of close to 60, some bond market professionals said. But the
price was widely seen to have been pitched at the right level to ensure true
global distribution for the issue.
Ahead of the opening in the Far East, around half of the bonds seemed
destined for the US. JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers, joint lead managers,
each of which took Dollars 600m of bonds, said the issue size would not be
raised, and that allocations would be scaled back.
The second huge dollar offering of the week seemed imminent last night: a
Dollars 1bn, five-year issue from Toyota Motor Credit. Judging by early
indications, the Toyota issue will also be priced attractively to ensure a
successful take-up, and the bonds could encounter strong demand.
For anything less than the sort of Dollars 1bn issue it is planning, Toyota
might expect to pay a yield spread of around 35 basis points over the
government benchmark. To succeed in placing the largest-ever international
bond issue by a corporate, however, it is expected to offer an extra 3-5
basis points, taking the yield spread to as much as 40 basis points.
Meanwhile, the Euromarket saw two other unusual dollar issues yesterday:
Dollars 200m of floating-rate notes from the Swedish National Housing
Corporation (SBAB), and Dollars 250m (raised from Dollars 200m) of five-year
bonds from Goldman Sachs. The floating-rate notes, yielding around 8 basis
points over Libor at the reoffered price, were aimed at a market which has
seen little issuance other than from banks recently. Coming from a strong
double-A credit, the issue was reported to have met firm demand.
Goldman's deal, priced to yield 91 basis points over Treasuries, was its
second in the international market (it had offered a 100-basis point yield
spread in the first issue, last autumn.)
During an active day, the Euromarkets also saw a pair of competing 10-year
Canadian dollar deals, both from high-class borrowers: the Inter-American
Development Bank and OKB. The former offered a yield spread of 43 basis
points, the latter 38, prompting some complaints that the latter was too
keenly priced. The IADB sold out quickly, while OKB was reported to have met
comfortable demand, the syndicate breaking later in the day to leave the
bonds trading at around their yield spread at issue.
Finnish Export Credit came with an Ecu300m, three-year transaction,
following the spate of shorter-dated Ecu deals of recent days. The maturity
was pushed beyond two years to get away from the high money market rates in
Ecu, which made very short bond yields appear unattractive, the lead manager
said.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, reported pre-tax
profit down 3 per cent in the first quarter, to Dollars 225m. It said it had
not yet experienced an upturn in any industrialised markets.
Orders received reached Dollars 7.8bn, 1 per cent higher than in the first
quarter of 1991. Revenues were up 2 per cent to Dollars 6.5bn, and operating
earnings were 4 per cent higher at Dollars 407m. Pre-tax profit after
non-recurring items was down 9 per cent at Dollars 222m.
The group said its infrastructure-related businesses, such as power plants
and power transmission, had higher earnings. However, its
power-distribution, industrial and environmental-controls divisions - which
are related to construction and capital spending - reported weaker results.
Demand in Asian markets remained strong, with the group winning large power
plant orders in India and Indonesia since the beginning of the year.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: BTR Nylex sells two US assets

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BTR Nylex, a quoted Australian subsidiary of BTR, the UK industrial
conglomerate, yesterday announced two US disposals together worth Dollars
171m.
It has sold ACI America, its US glass business for Dollars 89m and also part
of its shareholding in General Chemical Soda Ash Partners (GCSAP), a US soda
ash producer, for Dollars 82m.
Mr Alan Jackson, chairman, said that the ACI America sale - to the Vitro
Group of Mexico - was part of an overall group review of operations which
might include other disposals of non-core assets 'where prudent'.
ACI America was acquired in 1988 when BTR Nylex bought ACI International, a
diversified industrial group, for ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.29bn). ACI
America is a market leader in glass distribution, with more than 120
distribution and retail sales outlets on the US west and south coasts, and
in the eastern states.
BTR Nylex said ACI America would complement the glass manufacturing
activities of Vitro Plan SA, a subsidiary of Vitro Sociedad Anomica of
Mexico.
The company manufactures and distributes flat and autoglass products. BTR
Nylex's main glass interests are in bottle manufacturing.
BTR Nylex announced plans for a restructuring before reporting a 41 per cent
slump in annual net profits to ADollars 286m six weeks ago. The group's
shares closed unchanged at ADollars 3.61 on the Australian Stock Exchange.
The shares in GCSAP are being acquired by Tosoh, the leading Japanese
integrated chemical company. The company's US arm will buy 24 per cent of
GCSAP, reducing the BTR Nylex stake from 49 per cent to 25 per cent.
GCSAP was set up by General Chemical Corporation, a US chemical company, and
BTR Nylex in 1986. The company's current soda ash production capacity is
2.2m tonnes a year.
The purchase will make Tosoh one of the world's leading soda ash producers,
and will give the company access to a ready supply of alkali in the US.
Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate and producer of flat glass,
is listed on the the New York Stock Exchange, writes Damian Fraser.
The purchase of ACI furthers Vitro's aim of becoming an integrated North
American group ahead of a free trade pact with the US and Canada. More than
50 per cent of Vitro's sales are now outside Mexico, largely as a result of
the 40 per cent accounted for by its US arm, Anchor Glass.

<TEXT>
BIC, the French company and leader in the international market for
disposable pens, razors and cigarette lighters, is expanding its stationery
interests in the US by buying Wite-Out for an undisclosed sum.
Wite-Out specialises in the production of corrective fluids for blotting out
mistakes made on typewriters. It has annual sales of Dollars 12m and a
market share of 15 per cent.
In recent years, the corrective fluids market has come under pressure
because of the development of typewriters and word processors with automatic
correction facilities.
However, Mr Bruno Bich, chairman of Bic's US subsidiary, said the
acquisition of Wite-Out was an 'excellent extension' of the group's product
portfolio.
Bic, which is best known for its ball-point pens and disposable razors, also
owns a number of prominent stationery brands, including Conte, one of
France's most exclusive lines of pencils and papers.
The Bic group has been expanding its US interests in recent years under Mr
Bich, who was recently named the successor to his father, Baron Marcel Bich,
as chairman of the Bic holding company when the latter retires.

THE SWISS franc foreign bond market was surprisingly resilient last year,
considering the background of a weakening franc, rising interest rates and
dreary Japanese equity trends.
The value of the market dropped only 11.4 per cent to SFr28.8bn (USDollars
19.7m), and the Japanese share actually rose slightly from SFr12.1bn to
SFr12.9bn.
Equity related issues - convertible bonds and warrant bonds - accounted for
37 per cent of the value of all issues, up from 34 per cent in 1990, and
Japanese issuers were responsible for more than 99 per cent of them.
The league table of lead managers shifted slightly, with Credit Suisse
displacing Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) at the head.
It was expected that the dominance of the big three Swiss banks would
decline after the issue of banking licences to Japanese securities houses in
1988, but their combined share of 61.2 per cent last year was only 2 per
cent less than in 1990.
No Japanese house has yet taken away a lead management position from a Swiss
bank for a repeat Japanese borrower although that milestone has been
anticipated for months.
Things have been moving more rapidly in the equity-linked table, with
Japanese firms taking three of the top five places in the period up to
mid-May this year, compared with only two last year.
Market specialists agree that the introduction of conversion price
adjustments on equity related issues - an innovation attributed to Yamaichi
Bank (Switzerland) - has helped move these issues in a year when Japanese
equity prices were plunging.
The feature enables the conversion or exercise price to be reduced by up to
20 per cent several months before the conversion date.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: La Caixa set to acquire Progreso
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LA CAIXA, the Barcelona-based savings bank that ranks as Spain's biggest
financial institution, is seeking to add investment banking to its growing
business empire by means of the acquisition of Banco de Progreso.
The March family, one of the wealthiest in Spain, owns 65 per cent of
Progreso, a stake valued at about Dollars 116m at current stock market
prices. Spokesmen for the family and for La Caixa said that the negotiations
for Progreso's purchase were at an advanced stage.
The acquisition will gain La Caixa entry into the major corporate business
in Spain and through the company's London office.
La Caixa has customer deposits of some Pta47,000bn (Dollars 471.1m). It made
a net profit last year of Pta30.7bn.
La Caixa's decision about Progreso follows its acquisition of a 50-branch
strong banking network in France from Paribas, as well as purchases of an
asset management bank in Monaco and of a major stake in Credit Andorra. In
Spain, La Caixa paid Pta2.8bn earlier this month for the small private bank,
Isobank.
Strongly-entrenched in Catalonia, La Caixa is seen in Spain as a pioneer in
what is viewed as a steady encroachment by the big savings banks on what was
traditionally considered the preserve of the major domestic banks.
For the March family, the prospective disposal of Progreso represents a
further retreat from the financial sector.
Three months ago, Corporacion Alba, the stock market listed holding company
controlled by the family, realised Pta12bn with the sale of its 15.5 per
cent stake in the Signet Banking, its financial arm in the US.

ICI AUSTRALIA, a subsidiary of the UK chemicals group, yesterday reported a
27 per cent increase in net profits to ADollars 30m (USDollars 23m) on
turnover down 3 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn for the six months ended March.
The company said the result would have been still better but for the impact
of the depressed plastics market and increased competition from imports,
some of which it claimed had been dumped.
Mr Michael Deeley, chief executive, said the company was pleased with the
recovery in profits, but warned that full-year earnings were not likely to
show much improvement on last year.
'We are hoping to do a little better (this year), but we are not promising
any big improvements,' he said. 'There are few signs yet of a recovery in
volumes or prices in Australia or on world markets.'
ICI said the plastics division made a trading loss before abnormal items of
ADollars 22m, compared with a profit of ADollars 5m in the comparable period
of the previous year.
'Sales volumes were similar to last year, but overseas plastics prices
continued to decline, leading to weaker local and export prices and
margins,' he said.
Mr Deeley said increased import competition and dumping particularly
affected local vinyl resin and polythene polymer prices. 'Despite concerted
efforts, no effective dumping protection has been achieved,' he said.
ICI said the recent sale of its 12.5 per cent holding in Vinidex Tubemakers
to Tubemakers of Australia would result in an abnormal net profit of about
ADollars 14m in the second half.
Oil and gas producer Santos said first-quarter sales revenue fell 12.2 per
cent to ADollars 144m, mainly due to lower oil prices, Reuter reports from
Adelaide .
Mr Stan Wallis, chairman told the annual meeting crude oil prices for the
March quarter were on average USDollars 3 a barrel lower than for the 1991
first quarter.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Managers of India Fund suggest
unit trust structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGERS of the India Fund, one of the largest country funds quoted on
the London market with net assets of more than Pounds 300m, (Dollars 531m)
have proposed it could be restructured as a unit trust.
Merrill Lynch, which manages the fund, said that the change in capital
structure would close the discount to asset value at which the shares
currently trade.
With an open-ended or unit trust structure, the unit price should reflect
the asset value of the fund.
The rapid rise of the Indian market this year has not been reflected in the
share price of the India Fund.
Yesterday shares were quoted at Pounds 3.44, a 37 per cent discount to asset
value. When the fund was launched in 1986, by comparison, shares were quoted
at 100p.
An open-ended structure can be difficult for investment managers however,
since assets may have to be liquidated rapidly if investors withdraw funds.
Merrill Lynch said that an extraordinary meeting of shareholders would be
called next year in order to vote on the proposals.
A 75 per cent majority in favour would be required for any change of capital
structure to be implemented.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Scepticism grows over Australian
brewing deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SA Brewing shares rose 9 cents to ADollars 3.10 on the Australian Stock
Exchange yesterday, reflecting growing scepticism about the group's proposed
merger with Foster's Brewing Group. Foster's shares fell 7 cents to ADollars
1.92.
The share movements suggest investors believe the proposed merger would
benefit International Brewing Holdings (IBH), Foster's main shareholder, at
the expense of SA Brewing shareholders.
Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, placed both
companies on creditwatch for a possible downgrading, further complicating
the proposal.
'In our view, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the merger proposal
and its effects on lenders to Foster's is sufficient to place Foster's on
creditwatch with developing implications,' the ratings agency said.
It said the merger would affect SA Brewing's credit rating by exposing the
group to a higher degree of leverage, and reducing the strength of its
conservatively-geared balance sheet.
Foster's long-term unsecured debt is rated BB, and its commercial paper B1.
The longer-term unsecured debt of SA Brewing is rated BBB plus, and its
commercial paper A2.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, is in the middle of a roadshow
for institutional investors in Melbourne and Sydney, in an attempt to
generate enthusiasm for the merger proposal.
However, brokers said that the deal was unlikely to succeed because of the
opposition of Foster's' directors, lack of enthusiasm from Asahi Breweries
of Japan, which owns 20 per cent of Foster's, and also regulatory
difficulties.
SA Brewing was believed to be having trouble persuading institutional
investors to support the sale of about 6 per cent of IBH's entitlement to
shares in the merged group at a price valuing its Foster's shares at
ADollars 2.50.

<TEXT>
KYOCERA, the world's top maker of integrated circuit ceramic packages,
unveiled an 11.1 per cent fall to Y58bn (Dollars 436.1m) in consolidated
pre-tax profits for the year ended March.
The company was hit by slack demand for semi-conductor components, the yen's
gains against the dollar, and high research and development costs.
Non-consolidated profits were off by a steeper 26.7 per cent to Y41.1bn,
marking the first decline in five years. Net profits for the group,
meanwhile, fell 15.9 per cent to Y27.1bn, and 21.1 per cent to Y23.3bn for
the parent company.
Consolidated sales were off 1.7 per cent to Y453bn. At the parent company,
they were down 4.2 per cent to Y317bn.
The group's ceramic product sales increased 1.7 per cent to Y340bn, but
electronic equipment sales fell 15.9 per cent to Y66.3bn, on a sharp drop in
foreign demand for computer equipment and laser printers. Optical precision
equipment was also off, 1.8 per cent to Y47.2bn.
Consolidated domestic sales slipped 3.7 per cent to Y339bn. In contrast,
they gained 1.5 per cent to Y121.6bn in the US, 6.5 per cent to Y76bn in
Europe and 14.1 per cent to Y49bn in other areas.
The company also cut long-term liabilities 68 per cent, to Y18.8bn, on a
consolidated basis, and 86 per cent to Y6bn on a parent basis, largely by
reducing the level of corporate bonds outstanding.
For the year to March 1993, Kyocera expects non-consolidated sales to rise 5
per cent to Y333bn, and pre-tax profits 6.8 per cent to Y43.9bn. The gains
are based on expectations of revived demand at home and in the US.

CASIO, one of the world's leading makers of digital watches and calculators,
unveiled a 10 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits, to a record
Y19.1bn (Dollars 143.60m) in the year ended March. Net profits also gained
14.6 per cent to an all-time high of Y9.5bn.
Casio saw strong performances in all divisions, including an overall 15.6
per cent rise in sales to Y325bn. New products led the gains, with a label
printer and a watch-tonometer combination selling particularly well.
On a consolidated basis, Casio enjoyed an 11.8 per cent gain in pre-tax
profits, to Y22bn, and 14.9 per cent improvement in net profits to Y10.5bn.
Sales climbed 14.4 per cent to Y383bn.
By division, parent firm calculator sales increased 10.3 per cent to Y126bn;
electronic watches 14.8 per cent to Y81bn; computer and other equipment 27.3
per cent to Y77bn; and electronic musical instruments 14.8 per cent to
Y42bn.
The company's plant and equipment budget is scheduled to rise to between
Y22bn and Y24bn during the current term, from 15.3bn in the year ended
March. Research spending is expected to remain largely unchanged at Y15.3bn.
Casio forecasts a 14.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Y22bn, and a
15.4 per cent in net profits to Y11bn for the year ending March 1993. Sales
are seen gaining 15.3 per cent to Y375bn.
Consolidated figures are expected to rise similarly, with sales up 18 per
cent to Y455bn, pre-tax profits 10 per cent to Y24.5bn, and net profits 14
per cent to Y12bn.

YAMAHA Motor, the world's second leading motorcycle manufacturer, saw an
11.9 per cent decline in non-consolidated pre-tax profits in the year ended
March. It blamed the drop on unfavourable foreign exchange moves.
In contrast, company sales climbed 5.5 per cent to Y480.5bn (Dollars
3.61bn). Domestic turnover slipped 1.2 to per cent to Y198bn on sluggish
demand for sports motorcycles.
Total export sales, however, gained 10.8 per cent to Y282.5bn, led by a 16.7
per cent jump in motorcycle shipments. Demand recovered in the US and was
also strong in Europe and Asia, the company said.
By sector, sales of motorcycles increased 10 per cent to Y231.3bn, and
special-duty products, including golf carts, 2.5 per cent to Y47.1bn. Marine
equipment sales fell 4.4 per cent to Y107.9bn, and auto engines 5 per cent
to Y39.7bn.
For the year to March 1993, Yamaha expects pre-tax profits to fall 13.4 per
cent to Y6.5bn, on a 1 per cent gain in sales to Y485bn.

NATIONAL Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the largest bank in the United Arab

to Dh92.6m (Dollars 25.33m) from Dh90.2m the previous year, AP-DJ reports
from Manama.
The bank said it had set aside Dh68.3m as a provision for possible loans
losses, 37 per cent above the Dh50m of provisions in 1990.
Net interest income rose 12 per cent to Dh260.8m from Dh233m in 1990, the
bank said.
Total assets at the end of December 1991 stood at Dh25.45bn, up 8 per cent
from Dh23.549bn a year earlier.
Bank deposits with NBAD dropped sharply, by 26 per cent, to Dh2.98bn at the
year end, from Dh4.04bn. That was partly offset by a 17 per cent rise in
customer deposits, which gained to Dh20.1bn from Dh17.2bn.
Loans and advances were up 23 per cent, to Dh9.549bn from 7.77bn.
NBAD proposed total dividends of Dh75.3m, unchanged from the 1990 payout.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Omron tumbles 51% despite better
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMRON, one of the world's leading makers of switches and other machine
control components, has reported a 51.2 per cent fall in pre-tax profit, to
Y13.55bn (Dollars 101.87m), for the year to the end of March. The company
blamed the decline on aggressive investment in research and the slowing of
the Japanese economy.
Sales rose 3.3 per cent to Y388.8bn, with sales in core control systems and
office equipment softened by the general reductions in capital spending by
Japanese companies. Demand remained strong for electronic fund transfer
systems; sales in this area rose 11 per cent.
The company has been confident that the fall in capital spending in recent
months will soon bottom, as Japanese industry needs to invest in
labour-saving technology and pollution-control equipment.
The downturn, however, has affected Omron, whose cash reserves fell from
Y99.58bn to Y68.59bn over the period, and whose unrealised gains on
long-term holdings of shares plunged from Y37.5bn to Y13.7bn.
These two trends are common at most leading Japanese companies, which
attempted to avoid higher interest rates last year by drawing down their
cash reserves. Companies' unrealised gains have been eroded by the stock
market collapse.
For this year, Omron is expecting a 3 per cent increase in sales, to Y400bn,
and flat pre-tax profit at Y13.5bn.
Rinnai, Japan's largest maker of gas home appliances, reported a 2.3 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit, to Y7bn, on a 3.7 per cent increase in sales to
Y113.9bn.
Demand for Rinnai's products was dampened by weakness in housing
construction, though sales of kitchen equipment rose by 3.8 per cent and of
water heaters by 3.1 per cent.
For the current year, pre-tax profit is forecast to be slightly higher at
Y7.1bn, with sales rising 3 per cent to Y117bn.

<TEXT>
KOITO Manufacturing, Japan's top maker of automotive lighting equipment,
suffered a 28 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y5.3bn (Dollars 39.84m)
for the year ended March. The result reflects the first fall in domestic
sales of cars and trucks in over a decade.
Net profits were off 19.8 per cent to Y2.7bn.
The close Toyota Motor affiliate attributed the lower profits to increased
expenses associated with new product launches, higher depreciation, and the
need to source a greater share of parts outside the company due to labour
shortages.
Sales rose 12.8 per cent to Y162bn, with new products and high-mount tail
lights and other safety equipment leading the gains.
Auto-lighting sales were up 13 per cent to Y149.4bn; aircraft parts 11.8 per
cent to Y2.9bn; and other products 12.4 per cent to Y9.6bn.
Exports to the US remained dull due to rising local production by Japanese
car-makers and the slow economic recovery. However, shipments were brisk to
the Middle East and Central and South America.
For the year ended March 1993, Koito expects sales to rise 5.6 per cent to
Y171.5bn. Pre-tax profits are forecast to fall 7 per cent to Y4.8bn, and net
profits 32 per cent to Y2.3bn.

TDK, the Japanese maker of magnetic tapes, has reported a 20.7 per cent fall
in consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y54bn (Dollars 419m). Sales were flat in
Japan and down in international markets for integrated circuits and magnetic
heads.
Total sales were 0.9 per lower at Y534.87bn, with recording media sales down
4 per cent. Foreign sales slipped 2.3 per cent, and sales of electronic
materials and components were up 0.5 per cent.
Parent company pre-tax profit fell 25.4 per cent to Y33.4bn, on a 1.4 per
cent decline in sales to Y408.3bn. It was the first profit and sales fall
for six years.
Apart from the lower sales, the company blamed the poor performance on
'exchange-rate fluctuations, start-up costs for a new tape plant in
Luxembourg, and a lower fourth-quarter operational rate in order to adjust
inventory'.
Like many Japanese companies, the slowing of production was necessary after
a sharp build-up of stock with Japanese retailers.
In TDK's case, the problem was heightened when its consumer electronics
clients also reduced their inventories, cutting demand for its components.
Meanwhile, the collapse of Tokyo share prices reduced the company's
unrealised gains on long-term holdings of stocks from Y33.37bn to Y21.36bn.
For the current year, parent company sales are expected to rise 0.4 per cent
to Y410bn, with pre-tax profit up 4.7 per cent to Y35bn. Capital spending,
which was Y57.5bn last year, is forecast at about Y30bn.

Mitsubishi hopes its Apple-related sales will rise to Y30bn (Dollars

JAPANESE cotton spinners reported mixed results for the fiscal year to
March.
Kurabo Industries posted a 19.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y1.8bn
(Dollars 13.5m) on a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to Y144.4bn. After-tax
profits rose 6.2 per cent to Y1.8bn.
For the current year to March, Kurabo forecasts a 19.5 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y2.2bn on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y148bn.
Daiwabo returned to the black with a non-consolidated pre-tax profit of
Y1bn, against the previous year's loss of Y162m. Overall sales fell 5.7 per
cent to Y71.1bn due to sluggish sales of cotton yarn.
However, Daiwabo posted after-tax losses of Y873m due to a Y2.8bn
extraordinary loss as a result of inventory liquidation. Daiwabo said it
will not pay annual dividends.
For the current year to March 1993, it expects a 22.5 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits to Y800m on a 4.2 per cent increase in sales to Y74.2bn.
Shikibo posted a pre-tax loss of Y5.3bn against the previous year's loss of
Y1.3bn. Sales rose 11.9 per cent to Y77.5bn.
However, Shikibo posted an extraordinary loss of Y13.5bn due to the
liquidation of its two financing affiliates, which incurred heavy losses as
a result of extensive stock speculation. After-tax losses totalled Y4.7bn.
The company will also skip its dividend payment.
For the current year, Shikibo expects to reduce its pre-tax loss to Y2bn.

VOLVO, the Swedish vehicle group which is moving closer to a possible merger
with Renault, suffered a first-quarter loss of SKr248m (Dollars 43m) after
financial items. This contrasts with a SKr340m profit for the same period of
1991.
The return to the red at Volvo with a SKr347m operating loss for the first
quarter follows a small SKr88m operating profit in the fourth quarter of
1991 following five consecutive quarterly operating losses. It recorded a
SKr397m deficit for the first quarter of last year.
By contrast, group sales revenue rose by 10 per cent to SKr20.02bn for the
first quarter of 1992, from SKr17.46bn last year.
Total group assets rose to SKr108.6bn from SKr106.7bn at the end of December
due to acquisitions and divestments, while liquid funds fell to SKr18.4bn in
the first quarter from SKr18.8bn.
Return on capital employed rose to 6.2 per cent in the latest 12-month
period from 3.8 per cent last time, while income per share was SKr2. I0
compared with a loss of SKr12.90.
The negative trend in its most important vehicle markets - the US, Britain
and Sweden - had brought 'heavy pressure' on the group's profits
performance.
But the company also pointed out the operating loss had 'declined
significantly', mainly due to rationalisation measures, first adopted in the
autumn of 1990. Volvo estimates its cost level - calculated on an annual
basis - was reduced by SKr500m.
So far, cost-saving measures have totalled SKr3.5bn, and by the end of this
year Volvo calculates its total cost level will have been cut by as much as
SKr5.2bn.
But the group said yesterday that 'despite this achievement, continued
efficiency improvements and aggressive marketing efforts' were required.
It added that the alliance with Renault had already yielded gains and this
would strengthen the group's long-term competitiveness, while co-operation
with Japanese car maker Mitsubishi would provide Volvo with 'important
knowledge in the area of production technology' in the medium-size car
range.
Volvo's truck division sales, meanwhile, rose by 8 per cent to SKr7.42bn
from SKr6.55b. n Volvo said there had been some recovery in the US and
Britain in the first quarter and its share of the truck market had risen
slightly in Europe.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saudi Arabian bank closes London
branch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia's biggest in terms of assets, said
yesterday it was closing its London branch as part of a rationalisation and
to cut costs.
The bank said its London branch, one of eight branches or representative
offices overseas, had not been profitable since it was set up six years ago.
Mr Jinx Grafftey Smith, the Jeddah-based bank's London representative, said
the branch, which has a staff of 53, would be scaled down to representative
status.
'One is not leaving London - one is cutting costs though,' he said.
However, bankers close to the Saudi banking market expressed surprise at the
move yesterday, suggesting that even if it made financial sense, it
represented some loss of face for one of the most established and
best-connected banks in the Kingdom.
Bankers in Riyadh also speculated that behind the move may have lain some
discomfort within the Bank of England over the fact that NCB has not
produced any financial figures since 1989 - a result, according to some
Saudi bankers, of an internal dispute among the bank's Saudi owners.
The bank, owned by Sheikh Khaled bin Mafouz, showed assets in 1989 of SR84bn
(Dollars 22.4bn), and, although it has not produced any figures since 1989,
it is widely viewed as profitable and liquid by bankers in Riyadh and
Jeddah.
However, its accounts were qualified in Saudi Arabia in 1987, 1988 and 1989
under articles of the Saudi banking control law banning lending to a client
in excess of a quarter of reserves and prohibiting some types of credit
without security.
Mr Grafftey Smith yesterday firmly denied the closure was the result of any
pressure from the Bank of England. The Bank itself declined to comment.
However, the Bank is understood to have communicated its concern over NCB's
lack of published figures directly to the bank's owners last year.
Mr Grafftey Smith said the branch, which undertook trade, treasury and
corporate lending operations out of London, with a total book of some
Dollars 1bn, had returned modest profits on the former two, but had made
substantial losses on its lending.
Bankers close to the Saudi market in London suggested the branch closure was
not entirely surprising in that light.
'It's a loss of face, but they'll be better off without it,' said one.

<TEXT>
DELL Computer more than doubled first-quarter revenues as US personal
computer sales boomed. The Texas company, a pioneer in the mail order
distribution of computers, also nearly doubled its earnings, reporting
results well above expectations.
Net income was Dollars 19.8m or 52 cents a share, up from Dollars 10.1m or
30 cents in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the quarter were
Dollars 366.1m, compared with Dollars 174.8m a year earlier.
'Our market-share momentum accelerated during the quarter and confirms our
belief that Dell's business model may be imitated - but not duplicated,'
said Mr Michael S. Dell, chairman and chief executive officer.
In recent months, several of Dell's competitors, including International
Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Compaq Computer have begun offering
mail order services.
Dell's strong earnings are particularly remarkable at a time when many
personal computer manufacturers are struggling to adjust to rapidly
declining prices and changing distribution channels, with discount
'superstores' now representing a primary sales channel in the US.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1993, sales doubled in both US and
international operations and were higher in every country and in every
customer segment over the comparable quarter a year ago, the company said.
'Our domestic sales were up more than 35 per cent from the fourth quarter of
last fiscal year and order rates accelerated as the quarter progressed,'
said Mr Dell.
International sales were Dollars 139.8m, compared with Dollars 70.1m
previously.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Setting the stage for
realignment - Paul Betts on the future of the European regional aircraft
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, is at the centre of an effort to
rationalise the European regional airliner industry. The driving force
behind the move appears to be the success achieved by the European Airbus
consortium in the large airliner business.
If a partnership involving Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), Aerospatiale of France
and Alenia of Italy succeeds in acquiring control of Fokker, it could set
the stage for a significant realignment of the European regional aircraft
business.
It would also put pressure on other manufacturers, including British
Aerospace and SAAB of Sweden, to accelerate their efforts to find partners
or join forces with the proposed alliance between Dasa, Aerospatiale, Alenia
and Fokker.
In contrast with the large airliner industry - dominated by only three
companies (Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus) - the regional and commuter
aircraft industry includes at least nine manufacturers competing in a
cut-throat market depressed by the financial problems of smaller airlines.
With too much capacity, manufacturers have increasingly sought to
rationalise the market through partnerships and other links. Some
consolidation has already begun.
Bombardier of Canada absorbed Short Brothers of Northern Ireland and, more
recently, de Havilland of Canada, after a bid for the Canadian group by
Aerospatiale and Alenia was blocked by the European Commission.
In Europe, Aerospatiale and Alenia have pooled their resources to form the
ATR regional turbopropeller aircraft consortium, and they both joined forces
with Dasa last year to set up the Regioliner consortium to develop a new
family of regional jets.
It is this German-led partnership which is seeking to take control of
Fokker. Although Fokker has recovered from its financial crisis of 1987,
when the Dutch government stepped in to take a 32 per cent stake, few
believe Fokker can survive without partners.
The Dutch government has also made it clear on several occasions that Fokker
would need to find an industrial partner if it wanted to develop a new
aircraft. It has said it has no objection in principle to foreign interests
acquiring control of companies in which it had a stake.
However, the negotiations between Dasa, Fokker and the Dutch authorities are
understood to be difficult. Any deal is also likely to face intense scrutiny
from the European Commission on the grounds it could give the combined group
a dominant position in the market. On the other hand, France and Germany
have long argued for an industrial policy in Europe to rationalise the
regional airliner business.
What makes the situation even more complex is the intricate web of alliances
between various European companies on certain projects while these same
companies compete on other market sectors.
Dasa and Aerospatiale are both partners in Airbus, with a 37.9 per cent
stake each in the European large airliner consortium. BAe is also an Airbus
partner with 20 per cent but is in direct competition with both Dasa and
Aerospatiale in the regional aircraft market.
Alenia is an ally of Dasa and Aerospatiale, but it does some subcontracting
work for Airbus and is at the same time involved on Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas programmes. Its parent company, Finmeccanica, also own 6 per cent of
Fokker.
The heavy costs of launching a new aircraft family in a weak market, coupled
with Airbus's plans to develop the 125-seat A319 airliner (a shorter
derivative of the 150-seat A320), appears to have prompted Dasa to turn its
attention on Fokker.
Dasa, which is already co-operating with Fokker on the Fokker 100 jet,
clearly saw an opportunity to lead a rationalisation by forging closer links
with the Dutch group.
Fokker has been working on plans to develop a smaller 70-seat version of the
Fokker 100 and eventually a larger 120 to 130-seat derivative. Both aircraft
would be direct competitors to the original Dasa-led Regioliner jet family.
If the talks between Dasa and Fokker succeed, it would be likely to put
greater pressure on BAe to find a partner for its loss-making regional
aircraft operations. BAe has had contacts with Japanese manufacturers over a
possible partnership, but it would also have to consider joining the new
European grouping.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz shows 14% advance
in net profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-Benz, the German motor, aerospace and electronics group, expects an
'excellent result' this year after a strong performance in the first
quarter, Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, said yesterday.
Net profits in the first three months were 14 per cent higher at DM480m
(Dollars 291m), with turnover gaining 16 per cent to DM22bn. Business growth
was faster abroad than at home.
Mr Reuter said turnover for the full year would total around DM100bn,
compared with DM95bn last year, a rise of 11 per cent on 1990.
The group's figures for 1991 show that Mercedes-Benz, the car and truck
subsidiary, remains the chief profit-earner for the group, in spite of the
costly diversifications of the 1980s. Mercedes' net profits totalled
DM1.5bn, roughly the same as the previous year.
One company into which Daimler diversified, the AEG electrical and
electronics company, turned in a sharply higher loss of DM624m, against a
DM205m loss the previous year. This resulted from the DM1bn cost of closing
the heavily loss-making Olympia office equipment division, partly offset by
a DM490m gain on the sale of its cable activities.
Daimler has already announced an 8 per cent rise in group net income to
DM1.9bn - because of inter-company accounting, this figure is not comparable
with divisional results - and its first dividend increase since 1986 with a
payment of DM13, against DM12 a year earlier.
Earnings per share increased from DM36.20 to DM40.20.
However, pre-tax income was 5 per cent lower at DM4bn, with the net result
benefitting from a sharp drop in the tax bill.
For the first time, the group was able to offset against tax losses at AEG
and Dornier, part of its aerospace operation.
Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director, said Mercedes' share of total profits
was higher than its 69 per cent of turnover last year.
In the first quarter, Mercedes' sales advanced by 17 per cent to DM17.1bn,
with most of the growth coming from foreign markets, especially in western
Europe. The waiting time for the new S-class executive model is nine months.
While relieved that an engineering strike had been averted, Mr Reuter said
the settlement would result in an 'excessive wage burden'. Daimler has
already embarked on a streamlining programme to squeeze DM4bn a year from
total costs by 1995. Mr Reuter said around DM2bn of this had been achieved.
He said internal operating profits should double this year, although he gave
no figures. This would largely reflect the rationalisation moves. However,
Daimler will also benefit from the elimination of AEG's losses.

FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pinault sale severs link with
origins in timber
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the French company which recently won a controversial bid for the
Au Printemps department store chain, is severing its links with its original
timber interests by selling the business to Dapta-Mallinjoud, the French
do-it-yourself group.
The withdrawal from timber marks the culmination of the strategy pursued by
Pinault under the chairmanship of Mr Francois Pinault. He has transformed
his family timber company - founded in Brittany in 1963 - into a large
retailing group by a series of audacious acquisitions.
The series of deals, which culminated in the takeover of Au Printemps, one
of the most famous names in French retailing, has left Pinault with a hefty
burden of debt. The proceeds from the sale of the timber business - for an
undisclosed sum - will be used to reduce group borrowings which totalled
FFr15.5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) at the end of last year.
Pinault has sold a group of companies - including the Lafa furniture
businesses and Sofiseb, a kitchen unit manufacturer - with combined sales of
FFr1.13bn. Dapta-Mallinjoud, which is quoted on the secondary market in
Paris, suspended its shares on Monday pending the announcement of the
acquisition. It sees the deal as a way of expanding its original
do-it-yourself interests into new product sectors. After the disposal
Pinault will be established as a leading player in the French service sector
with the Conforama chain of furniture stores as well as Au Printemps.
Pinault's total annual turnover is now estimated at about FFr70bn, with
distribution providing 80 per cent of that total.
Pinault recently announced that its net profits had halved from FFr1.05bn in
1990 to FFr503m in 1991. That was attributed to a sharp fall in exceptional
earnings.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Staying aloft amid a stream of approaches -
Paul Betts on British Airways' strategy to stay ahead in a
highly-competitive market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOBALISATION remains the buzz-word at British Airways. But the airline,
which impressively more than doubled pre-tax profits for the year to
end-March, said yesterday it was in no hurry to find a partner.
'We want to be the global leader in our industry and we firmly believe we
need to find strong partnerships for the future,' explained Sir Colin
Marshall, BA's chief executive. 'But we feel no urgency to rush into
anything: we are a strong, financially solid company that can withstand
competition', he added.
The carrier was clearly disappointed by the collapse in February of its
efforts to merge with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines: a partnership which would
have strengthened its position in continental Europe and other international
markets. It would also have had significant implications on the airline
industry as a whole, accelerating the trend towards greater airline
concentration.
It was also the third unsuccessful attempt by BA in barely three years to
forge an equity partnership with another carrier following the failure of
earlier efforts to link-up with United Airlines of the US and Sabena of
Belgium.
But with its strong recovery last year, and one of the healthiest balance
sheets in the airline industry, BA has clearly become wary of entering into
any deal which risks undermining its turnaround. Lord King, the chairman,
put it bluntly yesterday when he said: 'We don't want to consolidate someone
else's losses'.
However, he added that finding a partner remained high on BA's agenda but
'in the meantime bachelorhood continues to be both agreeable and
profitable'. Indeed, BA is not looking just for one partner but strong
allies in its three leading markets: Europe, North America and Asia.
Although BA is not now talking to KLM, contacts between the two carriers
could conceivably resume at some later stage. In the Asia-Pacific area, the
airline is understood to be interested in taking a stake in Qantas, the
Australian international carrier, as well as in Australian Airlines, the
domestic carrier. But it is facing competition from Singapore Airlines and
Japan Air Lines. BA is also scouting the US for a possible deal.
Sir Colin indicated the airline received a steady flow of approaches from
other carriers. 'We get two a week on average', he said.
But while BA, in the standard pilot's jargon at the beginning of every
flight, sits back and relaxes as it waits for a partnership opportunity of
its liking, it has taken comfort at its success in coming out of the
industry's worst-ever recession with improvements in all of its principal
markets.
In Europe, where the airline lost Pounds 10m last year, BA made an operating
surplus of Pounds 20m, despite difficult trading conditions in the UK and a
big reversal in Germany following the impact of re-unification.
In America, BA saw only a small decline in operating profits from Pounds
123m to Pounds 119m, although it faced acute competition across the North
Atlantic with the arrival of new US carriers such as United and American
Airlines at Heathrow, its London home base.
The UK government's decision last year to open up Heathrow to new
competition put pressure on BA, with 17 new carriers moving into the
airport. But BA still managed to increase its market share.
The biggest boost came from the strong recovery in the Middle Eastern,
African and Indian subcontinent routes, which earned an operating surplus of
Pounds 119m last year compared to only Pounds 13m previously. This largely
reflected the recovery from the dramatic effects of the Gulf war on
business.
There was continued growth in Asia-Pacific, with BA's operating profits more
than doubling from Pounds 41m to Pounds 86m despite slower growth in Japan.
Continued improvements in traffic are expected this year as business
recovers from last year's slump caused by the combined effects of the Gulf
war and the recession. In the near-term, Sir Colin expected to see traffic
rising by some 10 per cent in each of the coming two to three months over
the levels of two years ago before the Gulf war started.
But BA is likely to face even fiercer competition this year as US carriers
launch a new offensive on the North Atlantic routes and as liberalisation
spreads in Europe and other markets. Sir Colin acknowledged BA would need
partners to cope with the new era of deregulation. But Lord King added that
the company, for the time being at least, had no intention to 'act in haste
and repent at leisure'.

<TEXT>
Corporate Services Group, USM-quoted recruitment company, announced a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.13m in 1991, against a Pounds 813,000 profit in the
previous nine months. The fall was due to restructuring costs and losses in
discontinued businesses.
Turnover increased to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 10.9m). Following the company's
switch from energy to employment services, completed in 1990, CSG said the
two periods were not directly comparable.
The core employment services division expanded last year through
acquisitions andreported operating profits of Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 51,000)
on turnover of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 2.31m).
Losses per share came out at 9.2p (earnings 4.2p).

<TEXT>
CONCENTRIC, the West Midlands-based maker of automotive and industrial
components and industrial controls, is raising Pounds 12.5m net of expenses
in a rights issue to fund investment.
The company also announced a 74 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 3.52m on turnover down at Pounds 58.7m (Pounds
61.2m). The company said the progress made to recover margins was
encouraging and the improvement was expected to continue in the present
period.
The company is issuing 4.5m shares on a 1-for-5 basis at 285p in the
fully-underwritten rights. The share closed 15p higher at 355p.
The proceeds are earmarked for increasing output in the moulded plastic
components business and the metal pressing and fabrication business as well
as the US offshoot. Funds will also be used to address environmental
problems at its iron foundry.
The fall in turnover resulted from a decline in the world price of
aluminium, the erratic demand for satellite dishes and the generally flat
demand for the group's other products, the directors said.
Many of last year's problems at Concentric Pumps were said to be behind it
and Concentric Controls, which had undergone a considerable reorganisation,
was trading profitably after a number of difficult years.
In December Yorkshire Moulds moved into a new factory with twice the
previous capacity.
After tax of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 627,000) earnings per share came out at
10.77p (6.19p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.54p and the company
expects the final dividend to be at least maintained at 7.63p.

advance at Anglo Irish Bank

AN EXCEPTIONAL charge of IPounds 500,000 relating to the aborted purchase of
Hill Samuel Bank's subsidiary in Ireland, has held down profits at Anglo
Irish Bank Corporation which published its results yesterday for the six
months to March 31.
Pre-tax profits for the period were virtually static at IPounds 3.25m
(Pounds 2.96m sterling). Earnings per share declined to 2.69p (3.33p) due to
the exceptional item and the 1-for-1 rights issue last January. The issue
was 92 per cent subscribed.
Mr Gerry Murphy, chairman, said 'these results are highly satisfactory in
what is a tough banking climate worldwide. Our advances are up 30 per cent
and deposits up 24 per cent . . . We have continued to reduce our emphasis
on leasing and we have regrouped into two new divisions, corporate banking
and retail banking. Results in Ireland are well ahead of targets'.
Negotiations over the purchase of Hill Samuel Ireland broke down last month
after failure to agree on a cash price for the merchant bank. It has total
assets in excess of IPounds 500m. Anglo Irish Bank's total assets are
IPounds 831m. Mr Murphy said the decision to withdraw from the Hill Samuel
deal 'shows our determination to only make acquisitions at the right price
for our shareholders'.
The family interests of Mr John Clegg continue to hold the largest stake in
Anglo Irish with 14 per cent, despite continuing efforts by the board and Mr
Sean Fitzpatrick, the chief executive, to persuade them to sell.
Mr Clegg resigned from the boards of Wace and Anglo Irish Bank earlier this
year, because of allegations concerning shares dealing by members of Mr
Clegg's family.
A senior executive of the bank apparently travelled to South Africa recently
to talk to relatives of Mr Clegg who control the 14 per cent holding, to try
to persuade them to sell to interested institutional shareholders. The offer
was rejected.
Senior Anglo Irish executives believe that such a large private stake in the
company overhangs the market for its shares and depresses their price. The
Clegg family have consistently followed Anglo's successive rights issues.

READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
weathered recession in its main markets to report profits at the top end of
market expectations.
The company announced a 11.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
13.5m in the year to March 31, despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 220m
(Pounds 226m).
Professor Sir Roland Smith, chairman, said tight cost controls introduced in
the last two years led to a 'quite remarkably profitable performance'.
The workforce was cut by 5 per cent in the UK, with additional cuts in the
US and the Netherlands, at a cost of Pounds 639,000. This follows an 11 per
cent cut in the previous year.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said the UK's recession had bottomed out
and the US was improving. But continental Europe remained depressed  - '1992
is going to be tough there', he said.
Interest costs fell steeply to Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 3.54m) due to lower
interest rates and reduced net borrowings of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12.8m),
equal to 19 per cent of shareholders' funds (21 per cent).
Earnings improved to 4.79p (4.25p). The company is recommending a maintained
final dividend of 2.81p to make an unchanged total of 3.44p. Dividend cover
improved from 1.2 times to 1.4 times.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.37m due to Firth Furnishing's
withdrawal from seating fabrics. The division returned to profit during the
period and will begin manufacturing for Ford in Belgium and Honda in the UK.
Readicut's shares were unchanged at 85p.
COMMENT
Readicut's results were well received by the market, which is beginning to
see the benefits of the last two years of rationalisation come through.
Firth Furnishing's performance and Firth Carpets improved profits, were also
pleasing given their respective exposure to the depressed car and retailing
sectors. But the company's gloomy forecasts for Europe, and the likelihood
of no great improvement in the UK, suggests a return to late 1980s levels of
profitability remains elusive. Forecast profits of Pounds 15m put the shares
on about 15 times, which is below the sector average. Despite a strong run
over the last 12 months, the shares can go higher if there are sustained
signs of recovery on the high street.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Leeds Group jumps by 34% as diversification
pays off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS Group, textile dyer, printer and finisher, yesterday announced a 34
per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 2.51m for the
six months ended March 31 1991. The shares rose 14p to 406p.
The company had benefited from diversification - started before the
recession - away from its traditional apparel business, and moves from long
to short fabric runs.
Mr Robert Wade, chairman and managing director, said Leeds' 'steady growth
in an unattractive sector' could in part be ascribed to a much more 'normal'
pattern of trading - last time a satisfactory first quarter was spoiled by a
poor second; this time the performance was more 'solid' throughout.
Decreasing the reliance on apparel with moves into furnishing fabrics, which
had shown growth, and military camouflage, where Leeds has secured seven
contracts with non-UK defence ministries, had broadened the base of the
company, Mr Wade said, offsetting the 50 to 60 per cent downturn in its
conventional apparel business.
He pointed to the contribution of Strines Textiles, the high-tech printer
acquired last April which caters to the top end of the market, in particular
making dress prints for Liberty, the fabrics retailer. Strines added Pounds
400,000 to group profits after acquisition costs.
The fall in demand for volume production, prompted both by clothing
manufacturers' reluctance to commit themselves to long print runs, and the
flighty demands of the fashion industry, was more than compensated by Leeds'
concentration on short-run contracts.
On these, some efficiency is lost, but delivery times are greatly shortened.
The ability to leave dyeing or printing as late as possible in the
production process - producer colourisation - also helps speed up response
to demand.
Group turnover rose 48 per cent to Pounds 20.4m. The interim dividend is
lifted 17 per cent to 3.5p (3p), payable from earnings per share - diluted
by the 1m shares issued in the acquisition of Strines - up from 11.5p to
14.2p.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Conservative accounting leaves HCI with
Pounds 21.4m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSPITAL Corporation International Group, has reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 21.4m for the nine months to December 31. The company was created in
January when Hospital Corporation International of the US reversed into
Bioplan Holdings, the UK healthcare group.
Operating losses of Pounds 2.82m were swelled by Pounds 16.8m of exceptional
charges, derived mainly from the new management's adoption of a more
conservative approach to Bioplan's accounting policies.
The write-downs on overall property asset values went deeper than had been
anticipated at the time of the merger and the capitalised interest and
capitalised overheads have been reversed out. Restated pre-tax losses for
the 15 months to March 31 1991 were Pounds 113,000.
Mr Dennis Sokol, chief executive since the merger and chairman since
February, said that Bioplan's evaluations of its hospitals were overstated.
In spite of its Pounds 22.3m rights issue in May 1991, raised to fund the
hospital building programmes, the group ran into 'considerable financial
difficulties' in the latter half of 1991. Its shares were suspended at 44p
in November. They closed at 15 1/2 p yesterday, down 1/2 p.
Mr Sokol said that HCI Group was 'now a real company, rather than a
development business'. He has restructured the board, bringing in Mr James
Mills-Webb, formerly finance director at AMI Healthcare, as finance
director, and Mr Anthony Bryan, Sir David Rowe-Ham and Sir Ronald Grierson,
as non-executives.
Mr Sokol said the company was in partnership with the NHS in 70 per cent of
its hospitals and that it now had 37 per cent more beds, on an annualised
basis, than last time, though he conceded that occupancy needed building.
Turnover in the nine months totalled Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 16.3m for 15
months). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.26m related to losses on the
sale of Bioplan's furniture business. This led to losses for the period of
Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 1.47m). Losses per share emerged at 54.9p (earnings
4.6p).

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Arjo Wiggins chairman quizzed over Walls'
sacking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEFENSIVE Mr Cob Sten-ham, chairman of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
Franco-British paper company, was yesterday repeatedly asked at the annual
general meeting to explain last week's sacking of Mr Stephen Walls, the
group's chief executive.
In a pre-prepared speech to shareholders, Mr Stenham gave no reasons for Mr
Walls' departure. However, on four separate occasions he was subsequently
asked by shareholders for an explanation.
Mr Stenham, sitting next to Mr Walls, denied an acquisition had been
responsible for the differences between the board and its chief executive.
He also insisted Mr Walls' departure did not signify a change of strategy.
The company was still aiming to become the world's leading manufacturer of
high-value paper and become the sector's most profitable group.
There was no conflict of interest between minority shareholders and other
shareholders, said Mr Stenham. The group would be run in the interest of all
shareholders. Worms et Cie, the French financial company, indirectly owns 39
per cent of AWA.
Mr Nicholas Clive Worms, a non-executive director, said AWA was looking
consistently at opportunities, in particular the northern countries, such as
the Netherlands, Germany and southern Europe. However, a number of these
were involved in joint ventures dealing in newsprint and pulp. They were
areas AWA did not want to participate in. He said AWA still needed to
consolidate, particularly in the area of carbonless paper in Europe.
Mr Stenham said he was looking at possible replacements for Mr Walls. They
included one internal candidate.
A special resolution to allow the company to buy up to 80m of its own
shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of all shares, was passed.
Mr Stenham denied this was part of a devious scheme to increase the
proportion of shares owned by the French minority shareholders.
Mr Walls remained quiet for most of the meeting, but answered questions on
women employees and the environment.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cost containment helps BOC advance to
Pounds 163m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the UK industrial gases and healthcare concern, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 12 per cent from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 162.7m for the
six months to March 31.
The company said most markets had failed to show tangible signs of a
recovery and warned that hitherto buoyant areas such as Japan were
experiencing a slow-down in growth rates. Earnings per share increased 11
per cent from 19.14p to 21.3p.
Most of the improvement had been through cost-containment. Currency gains
accounted for Pounds 4m of operating profits, according to Mr Ian Clubb,
finance director. He said without them, pre-tax profits would have increased
9 per cent.
'We feel comfortable with the results,' said Mr Clubb. 'If the much
talked-about upturn in the world economy takes place, the company will be
well-placed to take advantage of it.'
The gases businesses experienced mixed fortunes as operating profits
increased 6 per cent from Pounds 136m to Pounds 144.5m on turnover of Pounds
1.01bn (Pounds 932.8m).
Mr Clubb said demand for liquefied gases for general purpose use had
increased in the UK and US by about 4 to 5 per cent over the past few months
compared with last year.
However sales of compressed gases, used for welding and cutting, had not
picked up. Sales of piped gases for bulk users had also remained flat. The
plant design and construction businesses had experienced a fall in demand.
Operating profits at the healthcare division increased 22 per cent from
Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 49.8m on turnover of Pounds 291m (Pounds 268.8m).
Mr Clubb said rationalisation at Glasrock, the home health care operation,
meant it was only two-thirds of its previous size, but that it was now
showing a modest profit. The US pharmaceuticals operations performed
particularly well.
The vacuum technology and distribution services operations' operating
profits were severely affected by the recession, falling from Pounds 12.6m
last year to Pounds 6.8m on turnover of Pounds 131.9m (Pounds 126m).
Results at the distribution services business improved their results and all
of the fall was due to the vacuum side of the operations. Mr Clubb said
sales of pumps for the semiconductor industry had been suffering from a
freeze on capital expenditure.
A second interim dividend of 11p was declared, representing an increase of 8
per cent in the annual dividend.
BOC's shares fell 15p to 703p on profit-taking.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SURPRISING falls in rates in the US insurance market have held back profit
growth at Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which yesterday reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 41.5m for the first quarter to March 31, marginally down
on the Pounds 42.6m recorded last year.
Earnings per share were 6.4p (6.6p).
Operating income grew to Pounds 178m (Pounds 169m) with expenses rising to
Pounds 147m (Pounds 139m), increases of 2 per cent at constant exchange
rates.
Although insurance underwriting contributed Pounds 200,000 this was offset
by a fall in investment income to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 14m) and the share of
profits earned by associates to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 900,000).
Interest payable rose to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.6m).
A strengthening in the US dollar was worth Pounds 1.3m to the group.
Insurance rates in the London market have continued to increase but weakness
in the US market, which contributes between 35 and 40 per cent to the
group's turnover, has undermined growth.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said US rates had fallen by between 12 and 15
per cent in the first quarter. 'No-one was expecting a glorious upswing but
that it softened again was a surprise.'
Hinting at continual pressure on the group's US expenses Mr Rowland said
Sedgwick saw 'no sign of any change.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Water in engineering joint
venture with Babcock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE WATER and Bab-cock International yesterday unveiled a joint
venture aimed at tackling engineering opportunities in the rapidly-changing
global water industry.
The move marks a further step in the diversification programme of the
recently-privatised water companies. Until now, many have largely
concentrated on diversifying into waste management.
Babcock International will pay Yorkshire Water Pounds 5m for 50 per cent of
the new company, to be called Babcock Water Engineering.
BWE will comprise Yorkshire's engineering subsidiary - employing 400
engineers and support staff - and about 20 Babcock employees. The chairman
will be Mr Eric Masell, who joined Babcock last year to advise on
opportunities in the water sector.
Initially, the company will rely on business supplied by Yorkshire Water,
which currently feeds about 70 per cent of its Pounds 300m per annum capital
spending through its engineering subsidiary, Yorkshire Enterprises. Sir
Gordon Jones, chairman of Yorkshire, said that the venture would retain the
orders only if competitive. 'They will have to fight for business,' he said.
Yorkshire's current capital spending programme is expected to benefit BWE
for three years. By 1995, the company is forecast to have about 20 per cent
of its business from customers other than Yorkshire.
Sir Gordon said his company's engineering subsidiary would benefit from
Babcock's international exposure and marketing expertise. There were several
other markets which were moving towards privatisation - such as North
America, Australia and eastern Europe - where Yorkshire's expertise in the
water sector could be put to good use.
The deal also pushes forward the company's programme to achieve 10 per cent
of group profits from non-regulatory businesses within five years of
privatisation. 'The non-regulated businesses will grow,' Sir Gordon said.
'The regulated side will only ever get more regulated.'
Analysts cautioned against too much optimism, however, saying the venture
was only a drop in the bucket of Yorkshire Water's total business. Based on
company estimates that the joint venture might achieve sales of Pounds 200m
in five years, profits would be about Pounds 10m compared with a forecast
Pounds 185m for the group as a whole by 1997.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Customers likely to stay with enlarged bank
 -The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has now given formal permission for Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation to buy Midland Bank, having already given the
banks guidance that such a deal would be allowed, writes Robert Peston.
Having been given this permission, Hongkong Bank now has the right to buy
Midland shares in the stock market to add to its existing 15 per cent stake.
However, it is understood that Hongkong Bank is reluctant to exercise this
right for the time being.
LLOYDS BANK would not expect to lose a significant proportion of Midland
Bank's customer base if its proposed takeover was successful, Mr Brian
Pitman, the bank's chief executive, said yesterday.
He pointed to the recent merger of ABN and Amro, the Dutch banks, where he
said a tiny percentage of customers had deserted the new bank, and to the
sale by Midland of Crocker Bank to Wells Fargo. 'There was a fear that they
would lose many customers, but they didn't,' he said.
However, he did not follow up the commitment Lloyds made last week to
provide support for small businesses with any equivalent promise for private
customers.
He said the bank may make further commitments to private customers, and
promised that integration of products would involve keeping the better
product provided by the two banks in each case. But he declined to comment
further on what Lloyds might offer.
He said integration of the banks' products, including changes to cheque
books and charge cards, could start 'quite quickly' after the passing of the
act of parliament which would be needed before the merger could go through.
Until this happened, Midland Bank would operate as a subsidiary of Lloyds,
and its products would remain unchanged. He predicted that the process would
start by the end of 1993.
Midland has suggested that product integration would be a difficult process.
Lloyds also revealed a few extra details about the mechanics of the changes
it would make to the new combined bank's product range:
Midland's range of credit cards, including the 'affinity' cards which at
present do not carry an annual charge, would be maintained;
Firstdirect, Midland's telephone banking subsidiary, would be expanded;
Midland Life, Midland's life assurance company, would continue to operate
separately thanks to the difficulties involved in merging life companies,
although Lloyds would look to extend its successful Black Horse Life range
of products to existing Midland customers.
Mr Pitman said that the transition would be made 'as smooth as possible' for
both Lloyds and Midland customers, and remained very optimistic that this
could be achieved, despite the doubts of some observers.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kunick drops to Pounds 5.9m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the amusement machine and nursing homes group, plunged into the red
in the first half as Pounds 6.2m in property write-downs and restructuring
charges wiped out depressed trading profits.
Pre-tax losses, after the exceptional charges, came to Pounds 5.9m for the
six months to March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 5.2m last time.
Turnover rose marginally to Pounds 58m.
Mr Christopher Burnett, who is replacing Mr Russell Smith as chairman, said
the bulk of losses occurred in the amusement machine operation, where the UK
market declined by about 15 per cent. Operating profits fell from Pounds
4.7m to Pounds 500,000.
The nursing care side reported a 50 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 1.2m.
Debt of Pounds 45m represented 64 per cent of shareholders' funds.
There is no interim dividend.
COMMENT
The company has been left well and truly reeling by the triple whammy of
recession, fruit machine stake increases and fewer pubs following the
intervention of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. So much so, that
Kunick has even had to offer the brewers a hefty Pounds 5.5m up front to
allow its machines through the door and preserve some sort of steady,
longer-term business. Whether it can survive the impact of recent trials
depends on several factors: property disposals, rapid cost-cutting, and the
long-awaited economic upturn. The market appears to be pessimistic and the
shares - which were 38p in September - fell 3p last night to close at 6 1/4
p. Certainly, the fact that analysts are betting on Kunick having to
negotiate new interest covenants with bankers does not offer comfort.
Forecasts are for losses of about Pounds 4.8m after the exceptionals.

FT  20 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dowty estimates Pounds 29m in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY GROUP, the aerospace and specialist engineering company, yesterday
produced a robust response to the hostile Pounds 497m bid from TI,
estimating pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March 1992 of Pounds
29m.
The unaudited figure was Pounds 8.5m higher than the assumption TI made of
Dowty's profits in its offer document and also Pounds 4m higher than the
figure Cazenove, Dowty's brokers, had expected before the bid.
Mr Bruce Ralph, Dowty chief executive, said the 1992 profits on their own
showed the 183p bid and TI's cash alternative of 175p were too low. Accusing
TI of being obsessed with the past, Mr Ralph said the offer also grossly
undervalued Dowty's prospects. Dowty closed 2p lower at 179p.
Dowty also drew on forecasts from the world's airframe builders to highlight
an estimated Pounds 9.8bn of future sales it would make on current aircraft
programmes in the next 10 to 15 years.
The higher-than-expected profits estimate arose from a restructuring that
included the cutting of a fifth of the Dowty workforce - or 3,000 people -
in the first nine months of the financial year. The benefits had begun to
work through in the last quarter.
Initial reactions from institutional shareholders was that Dowty had at
least dealt itself back into the game after letting TI make all the moves
since it launched the bid almost a month ago.
However Dowty would need to convince the City and shareholders that
aerospace profits had bottomed out. It would also have to produce a vision
for the aerospace division that went beyond simply enjoying the benefits of
recovery in the industry in the next two years and the cost-cutting
programme.
Dowty has wanted to turn its shareholders' attention away from the dire
performance of last year to the more promising future. But it is unlikely to
be able to produce a forecast for the year to March 1993.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI's chairman and chief executive, said there was
nothing in the document to alter his view that TI's final offer fully valued
Dowty and its prospects.
Dowty derived its Pounds 29m pre-tax profits from operating profits of
Pounds 28m in aerospace, Pounds 9.5m from polymer engineering, Pounds 11m
from electronic systems - which analysts said suggested a very strong
recovery in second half - and losses of Pounds 4m in information technology.

FT  20 MAY 92 / BA shares rise on 119% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS has staged a strong recovery from the worst slump in civil
aviation with pre-tax profits more than doubling in the year to March 31.
The 119 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 285m from Pounds 130m
the previous year sent BA shares 5 per cent higher yesterday.
The company broke even in the fourth quarter compared with a Pounds 210m
loss the year before which included Pounds 120m in exceptional restructuring
charges.
The shares, also boosted by a 20 per cent increase in BA's final dividend,
gained 15p yesterday to close at 302p. The company is increasing the final
dividend to 7.24p against 6.05p in each of the past two years, making 10.18p
for the full year, a rise of 15 per cent.
Lord King, chairman, said the performance was 'highly creditable' given the
impact of the recession and the Gulf crisis on airline travel.
He said BA was in no hurry to forge a partnership with another airline but
emphasised he remained committed to the concept of a global airline.
'Finding a right partner remains high on the agenda,' he said. Merger
negotiations between BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines collapsed in February.
BA's performance reflects a recovery in airline operations and the company's
efforts to hold down costs. Although it faced increasing competition at its
London Heathrow hub last year with the arrival of new carriers, Sir Colin
Marshall, chief executive, said BA had managed to gain market share there.
Profits after tax rose 168 per cent to Pounds 255m (compared with Pounds
95m), equivalent to earnings of 35.3p a share against 13.2p last year.
There was also an additional Pounds 140m after-tax extraordinary gain from
the sale of BA's engine overhaul business to General Electric of the US.
Turnover rose 5.8 per cent to Pounds 5.2bn and BA's passenger traffic was up
1.8 per cent.
The company shed 4,560 jobs last year cutting employment to 48,453 people at
the end of March.
Overall costs rose 2.3 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn last year reflecting UK pay
settlements and real increases in airport landing fees and air traffic
control charges.
Capital and reserves grew by Pounds 326m and net borrowings fell by Pounds
53m, giving a seven percentage point improvement in the net debt to capital
ratio at 42 per cent.
Lord King said recession in the company's main markets meant recovery to
more normal trading conditions had not been as swift as hoped. But growth
prospects remained sound.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Slimming to fit a shrinking business: While many US defence
groups branch into commercial areas, General Dynamics is holding an auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are the chairman of a company in an industry doomed to decline. What is
your best strategy?
'Consolidate the sector and diversify into new businesses,' is the answer
given by many businessmen. Tobacco companies, for example, anticipating a
shrinking US market, have branched out into areas such as food, drink,
retailing and financial services.
Now the US defence industry is taking a similar route. Faced with
contracting Pentagon equipment spending, companies have been pushing into
commercial businesses, ranging from environmental services to airport
management.
Except for General Dynamics. The second largest US defence contractor is
auctioning off its commercial operations. It recently clinched a deal to
sell its missiles division to Hughes Aircraft for at least Dollars 450m
(Pounds 244.4m).
What is under way is a 'quasi liquidation' of General Dynamics, in the words
of Mr Cai von Rumohr, securities analyst with Cowen &amp; Co. Mr William Anders,
former air force pilot and astronaut who took over as chairman at the start
of last year, calls it a 'plan of contraction'.
The commercial businesses on the block, which account for about Dollars 1bn
of the company's Dollars 8.7bn of annual revenues, include a subsidiary
making civil aircraft fuselages, a manufacturer of avionics test equipment,
and a construction materials division. And this comes on top of the sale
earlier this year of Cessna, its profitable business jet subsidiary, to
Textron for Dollars 600m.
This is the outcome of an examination of General Dynamics's strategy by Mr
Anders. After toying with the idea of diversification, he has plumped for
the opposite policy: slimming the company down to four core defence
businesses.
These are tactical military aircraft, where it makes the popular F-16 and is
co-developer of the US's F-22 advanced tactical fighter; nuclear submarines;
armoured vehicles, with the M1 Abrams battle tank; and a space launch
business.
The thinking behind this has two elements. The first is Mr Anders's
recognition that the contracting Pentagon budget has left the US defence
industry with 'massive overcapacity' which needs to be rationalised.
General Dynamics is concentrating on the four core businesses and buying
assets to reinforce their 'critical mass' or selling peripheral defence
operations to bolster the strengths of rival companies.
The missiles agreement with Hughes fits into the latter category. General
Dynamics is getting out of a commodity product where it faced tough
competition from other suppliers.
The second element in his thinking - that diversification simply does not
work - is more controversial. Mr Anders says two independent studies have
found that the diversification failure rate among defence companies is
'unacceptably high'. Diversification would therefore be too risky,
especially when General Dynamics is trying to sort out the challenges facing
its defence operations. Far better, he says, to sell off its existing
commercial businesses and return much of this money to shareholders.
Investors should 'have the opportunity to make their own individual
decisions regarding commercial diversification'.
The shock treatment involves shaking up the four core businesses. General
Dynamics over the past 18 months has seen a sharp reversal of its declining
profit margins as Mr Anders has improved productivity, slashed the workforce
and sought to eliminate bureaucratic complacency.
Some analysts fear Mr Anders's pruning may be too severe, while he prompted
almost universal condemnation last year - including the ire of the Pentagon
 -with a compensation package which awarded top managers huge cash bonuses
for very short term increases in the share price.
The aim, he claimed, was to align 'employee interests' more closely with
those of shareholders. But critics saw it as an incentive for a handful of
executives to grow rich by shrinking the business and firing colleagues. So
great was the opposition that the plan was watered down to a more
conventional share option scheme - but not before Mr Anders and 24 senior
colleagues benefited to the tune of more than Dollars 20m from the company's
contraction.
Still, investors have also profited from Mr Anders's strategy. The company's
share price has rocketed from Dollars 25 1/4 at the start of 1991 to around
Dollars 63 now, thanks to the tighter management controls, disposal
programme and promise of a large payout to shareholders. The quarterly
dividend has also been boosted from 25 cents a share to 40 cents - the first
change since 1984.
General Dynamics is now sitting on Dollars 1.2bn in cash and marketable
securities and this will grow as the missiles division and other assets are
sold off.
The company will need some of this to lower its debt, for research and
development and to cover any potential liability from a dispute with the
Pentagon over last year's cancellation of the A-12 aircraft programme.
Mr von Rumohr says the company's free cash by the end of next year could
amount to Dollars 53 to Dollars 64 a share, while the company's remaining
'core' operations could bring the total value to between Dollars 79 and
Dollars 97. Much depends on the prices the company gets from its disposals.
Already the missiles sale looks like raising more than some analysts
expected.
So while Mr Anders's basic strategy is as clear as a flight path while many
rivals still seem to be groping for a map, it is also likely to produce
interesting acrobatics along the way.

FT  20 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Yorkshire Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The joint venture between Yorkshire Water and Babcock looks a neat solution
to two long-term problems for the UK water industry. Other companies,
notably Thames and North West, have already seen the logic of developing
their engineering skills into separate operations. Their wholly-owned
ventures and Yorkshire's more elegant example mark a logical progression in
the water sector's diversification away from business regulated by Ofwat. In
contrast to earlier deals in which water companies were inveigled into the
mysteries of waste management, Yorkshire is investing in an area where its
experience is not in question.
The venture has an additional attraction. Water companies' huge investment
programmes are spread between treatment plants and underground pipes. At
present, more money is being spent on plants; by the middle of the decade,
the companies will generally be investing more in pipes. The question is
what to do with the hundreds of plant process engineers who will no longer
be needed.
Yorkshire's answer has been to bring in a specialist engineering partner at
once. The joint venture is unlikely to make much money for a year or two.
But by the time Yorkshire would otherwise be expensively laying off staff,
they should instead be making profits selling services and project skills in
the UK and abroad. As for Babcock, the deal represents a timely return to a
business which FKI sold off to Biwater four years ago. Doubtless other
engineering groups will try to follow suit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dowty has so little ammunition with which to defend itself against TI that a
sparkling profits estimate for the financial year which ended in March was
almost inevitable. The company appears to have reaped an early harvest from
its reorganisation efforts and to have benefited from a spurt in demand
during the final quarter. The trouble is that there is not much flesh on the
bones. It is difficult to see where its estimate leaves the outlook for the
current year, especially since there is not much sign of recovery elsewhere
in the sector.
Admittedly, there is some justification to Dowty's arguments about the lack
of TI's industrial fit. But TI looks likely to be a more determined seller
of the electronics and information technology business, and it has an
underwritten offer of 175p on the table. Small wonder the market behaves as
if it expects TI to win.

FT  20 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's annual figures from Allied-Lyons are very much the product of
the company's recent turbulent history. On the surface, pre-tax profits
after property disposals rose 28 per cent. But if the 1990-91 comparative
figure is adjusted for that year's currency-trading loss, profits would
actually have fallen by 2 per cent. Moreover, the 1991-92 result is
flattered by a Pounds 61m credit from sales of businesses which in turn
masks a Pounds 71m exceptional provision for reorganisation. Cynics might
say that unwinding the provision will reduce the quality of earnings in
future years. Such a view took the upper hand in the market yesterday, as
the shares were marked down by just over 1 per cent.
All the same, the underlying picture is not bad for a recession year.
Trading profit, struck before the exceptional items and property disposals,
was up by nearly 4 per cent. Hiram Walker is producing impressive growth in
Spain and Japan, while the continuing food businesses were up by a healthy
11 per cent. As the new management tightens its grip there should be less
reason for Allied-Lyons to trade at a discount to the likes of Guinness and
Grand Metropolitan. Its growth could even be faster because it has some
catching up to do.
First, however, it must settle its differences with the competition
authorities. Though Allied-Lyons claims to have reached an accommodation
with the Office of Fair Trading on its pub-licensing deal with Brent Walker,
it is cagey about the details and about how much it will have to water down
the accompanying supply agreement. More important to the market is the fate
of its joint venture with Carlsberg. Though probably over-rated in terms of
its long-term significance, this will hang over the price until the
government reaches its decision later in the summer.

FT  20 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BA flies high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord King plays hard to get when it comes to possible airline alliances. But
the stock market is showing no such reticence in its increasingly passionate
love affair with British Airways. BA's shares have outperformed by more than
55 per cent over the last nine months, and predictably took off again
yesterday on the back of better-than-expected fourth-quarter passenger
yields and a 20 per cent jump in the final dividend.
Given the dreadful industry background - and the dismal performance of most
of its international competitors - the City is certainly right to applaud
the company's navigational skill. The danger, however, is in getting carried
away. The argument of the bulls is simple enough: if this is what BA can do
in a recession, what is it capable of when recovery gets under way, and
increased passenger volumes combine with a slimmed-down cost base to
transform the bottom line?
BA is operationally geared, to be sure, but it is important to remember that
growth markets will also be increasingly competitive markets. The signs are
already there over the North Atlantic, as reflected by the fall from more
than 60 per cent in 1990 to 35 per cent last year in the contribution to
operating surplus from the Americas. The immediate threat from American
Airlines and United has been headed off, but BA for one is not under any
illusion that this state of affairs will last. Europe looks set for renewed
turbulence after next year's third phase of liberalisation. While BA should
end a winner the impact of independents picking off its most profitable
routes should not be discounted.
There is also the question of the company's medium-term financing needs.
Cash flow and existing loan facilities should be sufficient to fund the
aircraft purchase programme for at least a couple of years. But BA could
well come back to shareholders when Lord King finally leads an airline
partner to the altar.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: Reaper of a whirlwind - Environmentalism
does not come naturally to the new man in charge of Brazil's ecology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Goldemberg is on the defensive.
Two months ago, his colleague Mr Jose Lutzemberger, one of the world's
leading defenders of the Amazon rainforest, was sacked as Brazilian
environment minister by President Fernando Collor de Mello for publicly
accusing the federal agency responsible for protecting the forest -
supposedly under Mr Lutzemberger's own ministerial control - of corruption
and misuse of foreign funds. With barely 10 weeks to go before the Rio Earth
Summit, Mr Goldemberg stepped in as acting minister, while retaining his
education portfolio. He thus has responsibility for Brazil's two most urgent
problems, after the struggle to contain inflation - and the latter means he
has very little money to spend on either.
He also has to defend the environmental policies of a country whose already
low credibility in that department has been further lowered by Mr
Lutzemberger's departure, at a time when, by hosting the Earth Summit, it
has invited the scrutiny of environmentalists the world over.
He is at least able to say that the rate of deforestation of the Amazon has
fallen by half since the government took office, which, he claims, means a 1
per cent cut in worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. This has been achieved
partly by the removal of tax incentives, which previously encouraged
'development' of the area, and partly by more vigorous policing - though it
may also reflect a drop in demand for both timber and cattle due to the
country's recession.
But environmentalism does not come naturally to Mr Goldemberg. A nuclear
physicist by training, he exudes the self-confidence and certainty of the
great 19th-century educational reformers, rather than the diffidence and
guilt that are more fashionable among late 20th century scientists. 'I'm not
an environmentalist,' he says frankly. 'I'm a scientist who happens to know
what causes environmental destruction.' He then pulls out a hefty tome,
Energy for a Sustainable World, of which he is co-author, to prove that he
is, in his own words, 'not a completely worthless person'.
Certainly, his attitude is more sophisticated than that of many Brazilians
who ask, 'how can people in Europe make so much fuss about trees, when
three-year-old children here are begging in the street?' (A question usually
asked by members of the top 20 per cent of Brazil's population, who receive
26 times the income of the bottom 20 per cent.) But to conclude from that
that the rainforest is safe in his hands is a leap many environmentalists
will be unwilling to make.
In Mr Goldemberg's view, scouring the forest for medicinal substances, on
the off chance that 'eventually in one of these plants you might find a cure
for cancer', is 'not what science is about'. On the contrary, 'to discover
things requires a great deal of expenditure and equipment: just because a
tree belongs to a people doesn't give them a right to exploit it.' He thus
brushes aside the grievance of the Jaburandi people, who claim to have
discovered the only effective cure for glaucoma, only to see a big
international pharmaceutical company buy the entire crop of the plant and
patent the formula.
The Jaburandi are paid only per tonne of leaves harvested, although they say
it was their knowledge that led to the discovery in the first place. Other
Amazonian peoples are now said to be keeping their medical knowledge (for
instance, of the contraceptive properties of various plants) a
closely-guarded secret, until their right to share in the proceeds can be
guaranteed.
Brazil has already, in its 1988 constitution, recognised the Indians' rights
to the lands they occupy, and the government is carrying out the demarcation
of those lands. Indigenous peoples are thus already recognised as legal
entities enjoying collective rights. It seems only a small step from there
for them to take out patents and sign contracts. One problem that can be
anticipated is that more than one of them would claim 'ownership' of the
same traditional remedy. Ideally, perhaps, they should be persuaded to set
up a common forest protection fund, into which all royalties on traditional
forest products could be paid. But there might well be difficulty in
agreeing who should administer such a fund and how it could be spent.
Efforts to forge a nationwide representative body for the indigenous peoples
have so far been abortive. Their most eloquent spokesman is Mr Aylton Krenak
who is most often to be found squatting by a log fire in the 'Forest
People's Embassy' in Sao Paulo. But according to Mr Fabio Vilas, secretary
of the Brazilian Bishops' Conference's Conselho Indigenista Missionario
(CIMI), Mr Krenak is simply 'one person who decided he represented the
indigenous peoples: his movement has no elections, no general meetings, no
groups affiliated to it'. Mr Krenak's supporters accuse CIMI of seeking to
group the indigenous peoples 'under the skirts of the padres', instead of
enabling them 'to participate in Brazilian society while maintaining our own
customs'.
The problem of organising the indigenous peoples is real, but Mr Goldemberg
shows no interest in solving it. Stressing his 'enormous respect for
scientific knowledge' (and for the research costs involved in converting a
traditional herbal remedy into a saleable pharmaceutical drug), he admits
that he is 'too reactionary' to take alternative medicine seriously; and
even where forest products do turn out to have commercial value he doubts
the realism of trying to preserve the benefit for forest people.
'The world is a very nasty world,' he declares, citing the 19th-century
rubber boom which went bust when British adventurers 'stole' samples of
rubber trees and took them to Malaya, where they were soon able to producer
rubber much more cheaply than the Brazilian rubber-tappers could. He claims
that schemes to preserve or revive the forest economy always require an
unrealistic degree of state subsidy, and that the destiny of most forest
dwellers at the end of the 20th century must be to join the great mass
movement of urbanisation.
In practice, for most forest people, that could only mean a squalid and
marginal existence in the favelas (shantytowns) of the great Brazilian
cities. Statistically their life in the forest may be poorer, but there can
be little doubt that it is happier and more complete.
Does the law of history and the market forbid them to improve their living
standards by any other route? Perhaps mass urbanisation is indeed their
unavoidable fate, but there was a time when slavery was regarded as
similarly inevitable. History is not static: it is above all a record of
changing human attitudes and behaviour. We have learnt to set a value on
bio-diversity (the multiplicity of species) and on cultural diversity within
the human race. In the Amazon rainforest, both are at stake, and preserving
one can help to preserve the other.
One way to go about it, and perhaps the most effective in a market economy,
is to set a price on forest products reflecting the value of the environment
and culture which lie behind them. Perhaps European and North American
consumers could be persuaded to pay extra for a 'rain forest condom' made
from Amazon rubber? Another would be to recognise the inhabitants of the
forest as its custodians, and pay them a direct salary for performing that
role.
Brazil, and the world, can surely improve on Mr Goldemberg's Darwinian
fatalism.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: Clarifying advisers' position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JACK BEATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The statement that regulators and firms believe that the present
uncertainty about the impact of the Financial Services Act on the common law
fiduciary duties of advisers and brokers is preferable to the introduction
of new legislation ('Results of City rules review welcomed', May 12) does
not represent the complete picture.
The responses to a questionnaire circulated by the Law Commission in
November 1990 to firms, individuals, regulatory bodies and organisations
representing the different interests involved (business, professional and
consumer interests) revealed that while many respondents were of the view
set out in your article, many others, including City solicitors, regulatory
bodies and several merchant banks, believe that the present uncertainty is
unacceptable.
For example, provision is made in regulatory rules for 'Chinese walls' but,
although in some instances courts have taken account of regulatory rules in
determining whether common law and fiduciary duties have been complied with,
on those occasions in which courts have considered the efficacy of 'Chinese
walls' (most recently last year) they have not been seen as providing
satisfactory protection for clients.
The Law Commission provisionally believes that a short piece of legislation
is necessary to clarify the legal position by providing that account should
be taken of reasonable regulatory rules when determining the content of
fiduciary duties. This would not represent a further upheaval for firms and
their customers. It would rather facilitate the efficient functioning of the
market by introducing reasonable certainty as to the duties of advisers,
brokers and other practitioners.
However the Law Commission wants to obtain as many views as possible on the
various options for reform set out in its consultation paper before
finalising its recommendations.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Letter: The costs of Concorde that should not be ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ROBIN MAXWELL-HYSLOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Taylor blandly states ('Concorde: a hard act to follow', business
air travel survey, May 11) that 10 years after its introduction on to the
North Atlantic service 'British Airways was able to report that the aircraft
was making a healthy profit'. Yet nowhere does he report that the aircraft
were a free gift from the taxpayer to British Airways for which the latter
declined to pay a penny of purchase price. Nor did that exhaust the public
subsidy of this operation: as the select committee on industry and trade
recorded in its report on the Concorde in April 1981, there was continuing
project support from public funds, which the Department of Trade and
Industry then expected to amount to about Pounds 123m between 1980-1985.
Against this the provision for BA to repay part of its operating surplus to
the government permitted even this to be offset by earlier operating losses,
and certain 'post-review capital expenditure'.
Unless it is seriously suggested that the taxpayer should again pay huge
sums of public money to subsidise supersonic flight in a new generation of
aircraft, nobody should be misled into making false judgments about
commercial viability based on Concorde experience.
Another omission from the article is the cost to other airlines of Concorde
being given priority passage through a 'stack' in which less privileged
aircraft are forced to keep their passengers waiting to land because
Concorde has such alarming fuel flows at low speed and altitude.
The prospect of greatly extending the nuisance, and very possibly structural
damage, caused by secondary shock waves from Concorde also needs to be faced
before any investment in further supersonic aircraft development takes
place.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Personal View: Bring back apprentices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM CRAIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports of skill shortages, although inconsistent across the UK, do have
some substance. In particular, the skills required by manufacturing
companies and by users of information technology have become a focus of
attention.
There have been various theories about causes. One of the most common is
Britain's failure to invest in training. But little consideration has been
given to a possible relationship between skill shortages and the decline in
apprenticeships. This decline shows signs of slowing; ICI and British Steel
have significantly increased the number of apprentices being recruited.
There is little evidence, however, that this has become a national trend. It
can be argued that neglect of apprentice provision has damaged the UK's
industrial base.
Critics of the old apprentice system claimed that it was rigid and nurtured
prejudices about skills and how they should be taught. Apprenticeships, they
said, had become too closely identified with restrictive craft practices, in
particular the strict demarcation of work.
Changes were needed in the design, timing and presentation of
apprenticeships. But the response - to put them into decline - has proved to
be a mistake, and is a good example of throwing the baby out with the bath
water.
The 'baby' is job-specific training and education. Too much training today
is in the form of short courses, isolated from actual jobs. Fundamental to
the concept of apprenticeship is the aim of introducing a person to a
specific area of employment to learn essential skills and knowledge. This is
in sharp contrast to teaching someone skills and knowledge that, it is
claimed, can be transferred to different jobs.
An apprentice joins a group of like-minded people who wish to follow a
particular occupation, and to reach a predetermined goal; in other words,
learning is both directed and purposeful. The professions - medicine, law,
accountancy - have retained the concept of apprenticing. Practitioners serve
what can be recognised as an apprenticeship for an agreed period to reach
agreed goals. The professions recognise that learning needs to be grounded
in a context that makes it meaningful.
People in non-professional roles have had a hotch-potch of programmes
imposed on them by training providers. These programmes, particularly in
construction, engineering and the service sector, rarely have a direct link
to specific occupations and contain only bits of skill.
This approach to vocational training has failed to meet current and future
demands for a skilled workforce. There is a need to develop a new
apprenticeship system in the UK to provide the skill mix required for
changing technology - for example, the introduction of computer numerically
controlled machine tools. Greater flexibility is required in combining the
types of skill taught, such as the practice adopted recently by a consortium
of companies and Wearside College in the north-east for the training and
education of electro/mechanical technicians. There is also a need for
flexibility in the allocation of time, currently between one and three years
depending upon the occupation.
In addition to time allocation, time of life should be considered. There is
no reason why someone should not complete more than one apprenticeship in a
working life as part of on-going learning.
While many significant changes are needed, there is a strong case for
keeping the concept of apprenticing intact. This has been done in Germany
where almost 2m apprenticeship places are filled, the highest take-up in
Europe. This is part of a dual system: in-company training places are
supported by technical education in vocational schools (Berufsschule).
Training continues to be strongly work-related, and adaption to the needs of
developing technology takes place within the framework of this system.
By contrast, training in the UK is a mess. It lacks structure, coherence and
purpose. The quantity and quality of training is low. With few exceptions,
this is true in absolute terms, as well as in comparison with overseas
competitors.
Government expenditure on training is considerable, as ministers point out
repeatedly. But it is being dissipated among a wide range of administrative
bodies responsible for the training and its measurement. These bodies
include the Department of Employment, the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Training and Enterprise Councils.
The resources are being misdirected. A strategy for apprenticeship renewal
must involve fewer agencies and government departments. The funding for
regenerating apprenticeships should continue to flow through the TECs, but
be more narrowly focused. Employers and unions can provide the necessary
instruction while ensuring that training is work-related.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Ugly roar from a young tiger: Unequal rates of economic and
political development have brought violence to the streets of Bangkok
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the enduring myths fostered by Thais about their country is that
there is a peculiar and subtle 'Thai way' of conducting business and
politics. The phrase is used to explain everything from compromise and
flexibility to corruption and hypocrisy.
Even in the face of evidence to the contrary, Thais have long been proud of
what they see as a unique system of avoiding confrontation and
unpleasantness. 'We Thai people hate violence,' said a shop owner on Monday
from a vantage point at the top of a Buddhist temple, even as gunfire echoed
through the capital and rioters set fire to a car in the street below.
The concept of the 'Thai way' has been shattered by the events of the past
few days. 'Welcome to Thailand,' said a Thai businessman when he spotted a
foreigner in a lift in a city centre office building yesterday. 'Land of
smiles - and bullets.'
The sight of soldiers shooting pro-democracy demonstrators - at least 21
people are reported to have been killed and hundreds injured in the past
three days - and of rioters ransacking government buildings, has appalled
local businessmen and foreign investors who once put their trust in the
'Thai way'.
Army brutality and the savagery of the rioters makes an ugly contrast to the
growing industrial and financial sophistication of Bangkok. Thailand has
undergone rapid economic development in the past decade, based on foreign
investment and export promotion, but the political system of military
influence, corruption and patronage has failed to evolve at the same pace.
The fact that this failure, which is shared to a greater or lesser extent by
the other dynamic economies of south-east Asia, has become such a critical
obstacle to stability in Thailand is disturbing news for foreign investors
in the region.
Japan in particular has been making unusually loud anxious noises. 'The
Japanese government is deeply concerned about the rising tensions in Thai
politics and wishes a peaceful and rapid return to order,' Mr Koichi Kato,
the Japanese government spokesman, said yesterday.
Foreign investors had been wary of Thailand since last year's coup d'etat
arranged by General Suchinda Kraprayoon, who was then armed forces chief and
is now struggling to retain his new post as prime minister. Net foreign
direct investment from Japan, Europe, the US and elsewhere fell to Dollars
1.2bn last year from Dollars 1.5bn in 1990, and investment in the stock
market was down to Dollars 68.5m from Dollars 455m.
But it has taken a series of pro-democracy demonstrations to convince many
Thai and foreign businessmen that there was a real danger of confrontation.
Less than two weeks ago Mr Olarn Chaiprawat, the senior vice-president of
Siam Commercial Bank, said he was telling worried foreigners businessmen
that 'there would not be anything violent and the situation should return to
normal soon'.
This week's events will compound the problems Thailand now faces as it seeks
continued investment. It faces stiff competition from industrial exporters
in south-east Asia, such as Indonesia, which have lower wage costs. Thailand
needs infusions of foreign capital and technology to shift the emphasis from
textiles and agricultural products to electronics and other high-technology
industries. It also needs to raise from local and foreign sources an
estimated Dollars 8bn over the next five years for transport projects in the
Bangkok area alone, as well as finding funds for other infrastructure
improvements throughout the country.
For the moment, the economy shows little signs of losing steam. After three
years of double-digit economic growth between 1988 and 1990, it expanded by
more than 8 per cent last year. While this has made Thais in general and the
inhabitants of Bangkok in particular increasingly prosperous, several
factors have undermined their sense of wellbeing: severe pollution, the
inability of chronically weak political institutions to reflect their
concerns, and the absence of the rule of law.
It is no coincidence that the violence has been centred on Bangkok, where
the dislocation between economic sophistication and national political
immaturity is so glaring. Bangkok is the only large city in Thailand; the
metropolis and the area around it account for three-quarters of the
country's industrial gross domestic product, and it is in Bangkok that most
of the educated elite and the middle class reside.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the ascetic Buddhist opposition leader arrested by
troops on Monday, is immensely popular among almost all sections of Bangkok
society. He opposed corruption during his two terms as the city's mayor and
his Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party won 32 of the 35 seats in the general
election in March this year.
Nationally, however, the election was won by a coalition of five
pro-military parties which used the traditional method of cash hand-outs to
buy the votes of millions of peas ants in the countryside. The Samakki Tham
(Justice Unity) party which won the largest number of votes was an
organisation established after the 1991 coup specifically to entrench the
influence of the military establishment in civilian politics.
The inadequacy of Thailand's corrupt, quasi-democratic political system and
its failure to meet the aspirations of Bangkok's middle class is a more
profound reason for this week's violence than the ineptitude of Gen Suchinda
himself.
After he arranged the 1991 coup which overthrew the elected government of
Gen Chatichai Choonhavan on the grounds that it was too corrupt, the
military surprised and delighted the foreign and local business community by
appointing Mr Anand Panyarachun, a respected businessman and former
diplomat, as interim prime minister.
It was an inspired choice, and the Anand administration was regarded as the
best that Thailand has ever had. Mr Anand built on the achieve ments of Gen
Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister for eight and a half years until 1988, by
pushing through a series of economic liberalisation measures and resisting
demands for more weapons from the military officers who had appointed him.
His tenure, which ended with this year's election and the subsequent
imposition by pro-military parties of Gen Suchinda as prime minister, now
seems like a pleasant dream compared to the horror of the past few days.
If Gen Suchinda had not underestimated the resentment felt by Bangkok's
increasingly educated citizens towards the heavy-handed involvement of the
military in politics and business, the country's adaptable and dynamic
economy would doubtless have muddled through as it has in the past. The
violent results of that miscalculation have now been seen around the world,
reducing Thailand's international image, in the words of the Bangkok Post,
'to nothing better than a banana republic'.
Foreign investors who used to shrug off Thailand's usually bloodless coups -
there have been 18 since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932 - are now
profoundly concerned, although they say it is too early to make accurate
predictions of the damage to the Thai economy.
'It's very bad news,' said one foreign banker yesterday. 'I told my staff
today that they won't get sacked tomorrow, but that they should have no
illusions: this is going to be bad for our business.'
Tourists - more than 5m visited the country last year and earned Thailand
more than Dollars 4bn in foreign exchange - have already begun to cancel
holidays. The impact on commerce and industry is more difficult to assess,
but rumours of renewed rioting prompted most shops and offices in the
capital to send their staff home and close early yesterday.
The head of one multinational company predicted that Thailand would find it
difficult to raise money on international markets and could face
difficulties with its balance of payments. Thailand might have lost a year
of economic development because of the violence, he said. 'It looks like
you're not talking just about something getting a bit out of control, but a
much deeper problem.'
Thai businessmen appear to be universally gloomy. After a holiday on Monday,
the stock exchange index fell nearly 9 per cent yesterday to its lowest
level this year, with many stocks falling to the lower limits set by the
exchange. Thais queued at banks to withdraw money from their accounts.
In an attempt to calm the markets, the central bank said it had prepared a
30bn baht cash reserve to provide commercial banks with standby baht funds
and was ready to draw from its Dollars 20bn foreign exchange reserve to meet
any heavy demands for US dollars. For the time being the responsibility for
containing the damage to Thailand's reputation as a haven for investors
rests with Gen Suchinda and his military colleagues.
The signs last night were not hopeful. In an abrasive statement on national
television, Gen Suchinda blamed the violence on com munist instigators,
while the citizens of Bangkok - few of them communists - seemed adamant that
they would continue to demand his resignation. Although young men with
motorcycles have been burning cars and smashing traffic lights in the city
centre, Bangkokians rich and poor generally blame Gen Suchinda and the
military rather than the rioters for the trouble.
These are the worst disturbances since the 1970s and one of the hopes
espoused by Thais is that their revered monarch, King Bhumipol Adulyadej,
will intervene to help change the government as he did when student
demonstrators confronted the authorities in 1973. Another possibility is a
split in the military and yet another military coup.
'Thailand,' wrote Joseph Wright in The Balancing Act, his history of the
country, 'is full of optimists. Thais like to believe that things, sooner or
later, will work out for the best.' Yesterday, however, Thais were
uncharacteristically pessimistic, knowing that they will need to call on all
their famed spirit of compromise to return the country to political and
economic stability after the disastrous events of this week.

Do the Body Shops really sell better, cleaner, ethically superior products
or do they have more to do with selling the feel-good factor to guilt-ridden
greenies? Dispatches investigates Anita Roddick's company and suggests that
while it claims to be greener, purer, and more opposed to animal testing
than the rest, in reality it 'falls well short of established best practice
in the cosmetics industry' (9.00 C4).
When Britain pays foreigners to join its fighting services they are
described in such terms as 'plucky little Gurkhas' and the BBC makes gung-ho
programmes about their daring exploits. But when foreigners pay British
soldiers to join their fighting services the BBC calls them 'mercenaries
licensed to kill' and says they are 'men attracted to violence'. Inside
Story has a go at what it calls 'The Dogs Of War' who have gone from Britain
to fight for the Croatian Army (9.45 BBC1). In ITV's relay from Covent
Garden, saying Welcome Back St Petersburg (10.40), the Kirov Opera and
Ballet provide a programme of lollipops including extracts from Swan Lake,
Prince Igor, Boris Godunov, The Nutcracker, Le Corsaire and more.

Following the reactions of the American gay lobby to the movie Basic
Instinct and now RAF widows in Britain to the BBC1 drama Friday On My Mind
we can, presumably, expect the formation of an organisation dedicated to the
banning of Coronation Street and EastEnders because they fail to show
publicans as saints. No doubt Danish aristocrats will get together and
agitate for the suppression of Hamlet on the grounds that it portrays a
Danish prince as verging on the barmy. The American homosexuals condemned
Basic Instinct because, they said, it depicted the supposed murderer as a
lesbian. Actually the whole point was that she was bisexual, hence the
torrid affair with the cop, but never mind that. Must all fiction henceforth
portray all lesbians (or bisexuals) as angelic upholders of the law? The
widows of four RAF aircrew killed in the Gulf have, we are told, 'bitterly
condemned' Friday On My Mind because it shows the widow of an RAF pilot,
killed in Wales, having an affair with the married man appointed as her
'effects officer'.
The widows complain that the drama is 'over dramatised and inaccurate' and
there were, indeed, some pretty silly scenes in the opening episode, notably
the widow's hysterical attack on the air traffic control officer and her
tearful night time run across the aerodrome, arms outstretched against
luscious blue backlighting, into the path of a taxi-ing jet fighter. It did
look as though someone had failed to get beyond the opening chapter of Teach
Yourself Psychiatry. Nevertheless, it is time that special interest groups
gave the general public credit for some imagination and common sense.
Everybody belongs to one group or another - rich, poor, black, white,
doctors, hairdressers - and if every group succeeded in demands to have its
members always portrayed in a flattering light, drama would cease
altogether. We do know the meaning of 'drama' and 'fiction'.
Today at Lucknam Park near Bath BBC governors and members of management
begin a three day conference on the future of the corporation. A deluge of
speculation has already inundated us, thanks largely to the inept handling
of the reports from 15 internal task forces set up to ponder the future of
the BBC from many points of view prior to the renewal of the corporation's
charter in 1996. Much of this speculation has been malicious, coming from
mass media organisations which are in competition with the BBC, and several
facts are notable for their absence from the deluge. First, compared with
almost any other major British undertaking in the past 50 years - from
education to textiles, from publishing to the motor industry - British
public service broadcasting has been an extraordinary success.
Internationally it has the very highest reputation, and nationally it is
immensely popular. Second, whatever form BBC financing takes, the viewers
and listeners will always pay for programmes, whether via the licence fee,
at the supermarket checkout, or through subscriptions. The licence fee has
so far proved much the cheapest way of financing a remarkable diversity.
Third, although it must be possible to make heavy cuts in BBC bureaucracy,
if you go further and reduce the organisation much more you will lose that
critical mass of talent and experience (and also the possibility of internal
cross subsidies) which have led to so many programme successes. To destroy
the BBC just for the sake of reinforcing the anti-collectivist dogma of
current political fashion would be a tragedy.
Which does not mean that the BBC should remain unchanged. In its staff, and
consequently its outlook and programmes, it has always been steeply inclined
towards the arts and humanities and away from science, industry and
technology. Since the BBC is much concerned with entertainment a bias of
some degree is inevitable, but it has always gone too far. Last week The
Late Show on BBC2 took up the once again topical subject of 'the two
cultures', and one of the scientists present pointed out that it had, as
ever, taken a major controversy before broadcasters invited scientists into
the studio. Admittedly there was, shortly after that Late Show, a splendid
Open University programme called This True Book Of Ours - The Human Body on
the history of human anatomy and especially the work of Vesalius. However,
this was the exception, not the rule, and the programme did not begin until
midnight.
It is significant that the funniest moments in the opening episode of ITV's
Root Into Europe came at the beginning when George Cole in the title role
was found writing some of the blimpish letters to celebrities which gave
rise to William Donaldson's book in the first place. Once away from that
pretence and into the realities of the Channel ferry and then Paris, nothing
was quite as laughable. It all seemed awfully dated. It is 26 years since
Johnny Speight brought us that unforgettable xenophobic male chauvinist Alf
Garnett, and even then the character seemed like something left over from
the thirties. Root is a middle class version of Garnett but today, with
millions of Britons having become seasoned Continental travellers, it feels
terribly old fashioned to be going through the 'frightful froggies' and
'randy Eyeties' routine again.
Does anybody understand why programmes about the environment are not subject
to the same requirements of evidence, balance, and journalistic rigour as
other current affairs programmes? Presumably it must be because, consciously
or sub-consciously, broadcasters regard environmentalism as more to do with
faith than facts; religion rather than science. That must be why you are not
allowed to point out on television that nobody knows how long the famous
hole in the ozone layer has been there, five years or five million.
Presumably it is why you are not allowed to say that one day's volcanic
eruption sends as much dangerous chemical matter into the atmosphere as a
whole year of aerosol use by the entire human race. No doubt it is why you
cannot tell viewers that 80 per cent (or is it now 90?) of those newspapers
driven to the dump in fossil-fuel guzzling motors is used for landfill
because the re-cycling industry only has the capacity to use 20 per cent.
Such revelations would offend against the faith; what matters is not facts
but the feel-good factor. How else can you explain the proud display of a
compost box to re-cycle organic waste in BBC2's Happy Families which must
have taken several trees-worth of timber to construct? How explain the
absence in Channel 4's How To Save The Earth of any evidence from the
millions who would, presumably, benefit from the water and power to be
provided by the Danube dam, and the monopolisation of airtime by the few who
opposed its building in their back yard?
The BBC's director-general in waiting, John Birt, is widely reputed to
favour more serious analysis and less trivial human interest material in
current affairs programmes. Maybe that why it is becoming standard practice
for any BBC programme which wants to do a story about the royal family to
present it in the form of analysis of the tabloid press as though television
itself would never stoop to such things. This is now habitual on Newsnight,
where Jeremy Paxman's snootiness about the tabloids is deeply comic, given
that he is reduced to feeding not from the same trough but secondhand from
others after they have done so. In last week's Public Eye on BBC2 the
reporter talked superciliously of 'gossip columnists and hacks feeding off
royalty' as though she believed herself to be working for god's gift to
intellectuals. This from someone whose own script told us that 'The family's
image has backfired'.

FT  20 MAY 92 / People: New directors for Southern Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
William Courtney, who has combined the roles of chairman and managing
director of Southern Water since the company was privatised over two years
ago, has announced the appointment of a new group managing director.
Martyn Webster, 45, the present group finance director, will take over his
new duties on January 1 next year.
The move acknowledges the wider role that Webster has progressively played
in the development of Southern Water since flotation, and ends an
embarrassing episode for the company.
The managing director originally appointed to lead the former water
authority into the private sector was found to be unsuitable shortly after
and left almost immediately, leaving Courtney to do both jobs.
Webster's role of group finance director will be taken by Raymond King, who
will join the main board on January 1, after joining the company as group
finance director designate on June 1. King, 39, has spent the past 14 years
at ICI in a number of senior finance posts both in the UK and overseas, most
recently as controller, corporate operations.
Another new board member from January will be Keith Tozzi, 43, the deputy
group technical director, who has been in the water industry since 1966 and
has played an important role in the development of Southern's water and
wastewater operations.

FT  20 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Bank rescue is tax deductible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWSON (HM Inspector of Taxes) v JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC
House of Lords (Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Emslie, Lord Templeman, Lord Goff
of Chieveley, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle): May 14 1992
MONEY contributed to the resources of an insolvent subsidiary by its parent
company as a term of the sale of all its shares to the Bank of England to
remove the threat posed by the insolvency to the parent's business, is a
payment to preserve the parent from collapse, not to procure the transfer of
shares, and is therefore a revenue, not capital, expense deductible from
profits for corporation tax purposes.
The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the taxpayer, Johnson
Matthey plc, from a Court of Appeal decision that its Pounds 50m injection
into an insolvent subsidiary was a capital expenditure.
LORD TEMPLEMAN said Johnson Matthey traded in platinum.
In 1984, it owned all the shares in Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB), a banking
company which assisted the financing of its trade.
On September 30 1984, JMB and Johnson Matthey realised JMB was unable to pay
its debts and that without further capital it could not open for business
the following day.
Johnson Matthey also realised that if JMB ceased business as a result of
being unable to meet its debts, creditors of Johnson Matthey, particularly
those who were also creditors of JMB, would demand immediate repayment and
withdraw credit facilities.
If JMB could not open for business the following day, Johnson Matthey could
not continue to trade.
In those circumstances, Johnson Matthey agreed to sell the JMB shares to the
Bank of England for Pounds 1 and to contribute Pounds 50m to JMB's
resources.
The Bank of England agreed to buy the shares on those terms.
The Pounds 50m repayment was necessary and was made to enable Johnson
Matthey to continue to trade. The objects were achieved and Johnson Matthey
continued to trade.
Section 74 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 provided that in
computing profits of a trade, no sum should be deducted for expenses 'not
being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of
the trade'.
The General Commissioners found, and it was not disputed, that the Pounds
50m was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of Johnson
Matthey's trade. It was made for the purpose of preserving that trade and
for no other purpose.
But that finding did not automatically enable Johnson Matthey to deduct
Pounds 50m in the computation of its profits. The deduction could only be
made if the Pounds 50m was a revenue, and not a capital expenditure.
The General Commissioners held that as a payment to preserve an existing
business, the Pounds 50m was of a revenue nature.
Mr Justice Vinelott and the Court of Appeal concluded the Pounds 50m was
paid to get rid of the shares. They held it was a capital expenditure.
In British Insulated and Helsby Cables v Atherton (1926) AC 205, Viscount
Cave said 'where an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with
a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring
benefit of the trade . . . there is very good reason . . . for treating such
an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital'.
In the present case the Pounds 50m payment did not bring an asset into
existence, and did not procure an advantage for the enduring benefit of the
trade.
So unless the payment was made for the transfer of an existing asset, namely
the shares in JMB, the Pounds 50m was not capital expenditure.
In Mitchell v Noble (1927) 1 KB 719, 737 Lord Hanworth MR, holding the
relevant payment to be an income expense, said 'a payment made in the course
of business with reference to a particular difficulty . . . was made not to
secure an actual asset to the company, but to enable the company to continue
to carry on'.
In the present case, the Pounds 50m was made in the course of business,
dealing with the particular difficulty which arose on September 30 1984 as a
result of JMB's insolvency; and it was made to enable Johnson Matthey to
continue to carry on business unimperilled by its association with JMB.
In Anglo-Persian Oil (1932) 1 KB 124, Lord Justice Romer pointed out that in
applying the test in Atherton 'enduring' meant 'enduring in the way that
fixed capital endures'. The advantage did not need to be positive, but might
consist in getting rid of fixed capital of an onerous character.
The item of fixed capital which was got rid of, the JMB shares, were not
themselves of an onerous character. The Pounds 50m payment had no enduring
effect on Johnson Matthey's capital. It prevented the whole of Johnson
Matthey's business from being brought to a grinding halt.
In Southern v Borax (1941) 1 KB 111, Mr Justice Lawrence, holding that
payments were revenue, said 'if no alteration is made in the fixed capital
asset by the payment, then it is properly attributable to revenue, being in
substance a matter of maintenance'.
By 'maintenance' he was taken to mean 'preservation'. In the present case
the expenditure preserved the whole business, though it did not preserve any
particular asset.
In Associated Portland Cement (1946) 1 ALL ER 68, a payment was held to be a
capital asset because the company had thereby improved the value of its
goodwill and brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of
the trade.
In the present case, goodwill was not improved, but saved from extinction.
In CIR v Carron (1967) 45 TC 18 the expense of a new charter which
facilitated administration and management of the company was held to be a
revenue expense because the object was to remove obstacles to profitable
trading.
The Johnson Matthey/JMB association was a formidable obstacle to trading at
all.
In Tucker (1979) 1 WLR 683, Lord Wilberforce said it was logical to start
with the assumption that money spent on acquisition of an asset was capital
expenditure. He said: 'Extensions from this are first, to regard money spent
on getting rid of a disadvantageous asset as capital expenditure and,
secondly, to regard money spent on improving the asset, or making it more
advantageous, as capital expenditure.'
In the light of the authorities, it seemed that if the Pounds 50m was paid
to procure the transfer of shares it was attributable to capital. If paid to
remove the threat posed by JMB's insolvency to Johnson Matthey's
continuation in business, it was attributable to revenue.
The Pounds 50m was paid solely to enable Johnson Matthey to be able to
continue in business. The shares were fully paid and worthless. They did not
constitute a threat to anybody.
JMB's insolvency was a threat to Johnson Matthey, and the Pounds 50m was
paid to remove that threat.
The Pounds 50m was not paid to persuade the Bank to take the shares. It was
paid to persuade the bank to rescue JMB.
The appeal was allowed.
LORD GOFF agreeing, said the payment did not become a revenue payment simply
because Johnson Matthey paid with the purpose of preserving its trade from
collapse.
The question was rather, whether on a true analysis of the transaction, the
payment was to be characterised as a payment of a capital nature.
That characterisation did not depend on motive or purpose.
It depended on whether the sum was paid for the disposal of a capital asset.
On a true analysis, the sum was not paid for the shares. It was paid as a
contribution towards the rescue of JMB.
It was a revenue payment.
Their Lordships agreed with both judgments.
For the Crown: Alan Moses QC and Launcelot Henderson (Inland Revenue
solicitor).
For Johnson Matthey: Andrew Park QC and Thomas Ivory (Taylor Joynson
Garrett).

FT  20 MAY 92 / People: Watkins heads exodus from Schroder Securities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Watkins, chief executive of Schroder Securities until he left last
week to set up his own Latin American investment banking group, has already
lured with him to the new venture two Schroders colleagues. They are
Swiss-born Pierre Mourgue D'Algue and Per-Arne Johansson of Sweden - two old
friends who were in New York when he was there for Hoare Govett in the
mid-1980s.
Mourgue D'Algue subsequently ran Schroders' Paris office and has spent the
last few months on 'sabbatical' - setting up his own safari park in Kenya.
He is likely to be based in Geneva to handle continental European clients.
Watkins, whose interest in the region was cemented by a spell in Caracas,
also before he joined Schroders, says LatInvest Holdings, initially
capitalised at Dollars 20m, will be run out of both London and New York in
the early days, selling the steady stream of Latin American equity issues to
US and European investors. One of the founding shareholders is Grupo
InverMexico, the Mexican financial services group, and Watkins is now
searching for a Brazilian shareholder.
In time, however, the bulk of the business is likely to be concentrated in
New York; US investors are far more familiar with the Mexican and emerging
Latin American markets than many of their European counterparts.
Watkins' parting from Schroder Securities is said to be amicable; the
latter's strengths are primarily in the Far East, whereas the current
opening offers Watkins the chance to put some of his own capital, as well as
all his time, the way of his Latin American enthusiasms. He hopes to have a
team of 12 executives in place by the end of the year.
He is not being directly replaced at Schroders. Instead, the new chairman of
Schroder Securities is Adam Broadbent, a main board director of Schroders
and group managing director of corporate finance. He has just returned from
two years in New York at Wertheim Schroder.

FT  20 MAY 92 / People: Humphreys and Birkdale: 'a good fit'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of Richard Humphreys as a non-executive director to The
Birkdale Group, the marketing and human resources consultancy, will probably
be viewed as the most interesting move in the UK marketing world this year.
The second occurred when Humphreys was fairly unceremoniously forced out
from Saatchi and Saatchi in February, where he had been president and joint
chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide, one of Saatchi's two
international agency networks. Saatchi's boss, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, decided
that Humphreys should make way for the American, Ed Wax, to take single
overall charge of SSAW.
Wax was in London last week to oversee two days of SSAW managerial
restructuring. Far from gloating at Humphreys' misfortune, Wax was
eulogistic in his praise. Throughout the advertising world - where open
compliments and concealed stilettos go hand-in-hand - there seems to be a
genuine consensus that Humphreys is one of the nice guys of the business.
Neil McClure, Birkdale's chief executive and also ex-Saatchi, and Simeon
Galpert, financial director, formerly with WPP, who have been trying to
tempt Humphreys to join since he left Saatchi, are cock-a-hoop.
Humphreys says he and Birkdale 'are a good fit' and that the intention is
for the company to grow 'fast and furious' by acquisitions. He has spent the
past two months 'travelling the world' looking at suitable purchases. He is
sanguine about the prospects for acquisitions, despite the wretched state of
those marketing services companies which also gobbled others up in the
1980s; 'everybody has learnt a lot since then.'
Humphreys is to take 814,000 new ordinary shares in the company for 42.275p
a share - a 5 per cent discount to the current mid-market price -
representing 4.76 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the company.
Under its new management Birkdale is beginning to pull itself into shape,
chalking up modest pre-tax profits - Pounds 64,000 - in the six months to
September 1991. And once Humphreys takes up a senior executive appointment
there later this year, we may hear more of the company - particularly if the
economy takes off.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Management: Making a strong case for getting physical -
Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I ask managers about the importance of exercise, most acknowledge that
physical activity can be beneficial, but the vast majority - more than three
out of four - view it as optional. Even managers who are committed to health
often have a hazy understanding of the basics of fitness.
Whenever a crunch comes at work and the schedule becomes too tight, exercise
is the the first activity to go. In fact, physical activity is even more
essential to your well-being than brushing your teeth. An extra drink or
two, a cigar or an extra few kilograms can all be forgiven. But the body
craves movement and will be unforgiving when it does not get enough.
The benefits of exercise are many. It increases bone density, reduces body
fat by increasing the use of fat stores for energy, and increases the heart
size, making it a stronger and more efficient pump. It raises the oxygen
supply to the heart by developing more capillaries and increases the number
of red blood cells which meet the higher demands of the body during
exercise.
Exercise reduces blood pressure by increasing the blood flow through muscles
and decreases the respiratory rate and the resting heart rate. It increases
the lung volumes, muscle strength and endurance. Above all it improves the
ability to deal with the stress of business life.
Your road back to physical (and mental) fitness should proceed according to
a few simple rules.
Enjoy the exercise you are doing. The obvious moral pleasure is not enough
to keep you at it.
Exercise frequently. That means about three times a week.
Exercise for a short, sustained period of, say, 30 minutes per session.
Exercise at the right intensity. Your training heart rate (THR) may be a
useful measure. To calculate it, subtract your age from 220, and multiply
this figure by 75 per cent. For example if you are 40, and fairly sedentary
your THR will be 135: (220-40) x 75 per cent.
Next, choose an activity you really enjoy - walking, gardening, rowing,
swimming - and do it three times a week for 30 minutes at 135 heartbeats a
minute.
Most people lead an active life when they are young, but as the demands of
business grow, they may find that the only exercise they get is an hour or
two of golf or tennis at the weekend - and often not even that. The
popularity of health and fitness clubs is playing an increasingly important
part in getting sedentary people 'back on track'.
If used properly, a good fitness club can help you get fit. But beware: many
managers have the membership card of a club in their wallets as their
passport to fitness, only to find constant excuses for not going.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: The bugs bite back - Clive
Cookson reports on the search for pesticides that kill insects but are safer
than conventional chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Residues from agricultural chemicals in crops and water supplies are a
growing environmental concern. But they provide a business opportunity for
biotechnology, which is set to play a big part in the world's Dollars 20bn
(Pounds 11bn) a year pesticide industry over the next decade.
Insecticides are leading the way in the emerging market for residue-free
biopesticides. Sales of biological insecticides were in the region of
Dollars 130m worldwide last year - only 2 per cent of the figure for
chemical insecticides. Industry predictions put the bio-insecticide market
in 2000 anywhere between Dollars 500m and Dollars 2.5bn.
The market has been dominated so far by two international companies, Sandoz
of Switzerland and Abbott of the US. They make bio-pesticides from Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt), a naturally occuring bacterium. Bt produces a protein
that kills some insects.
These natural Bt pesticides have been on the market for about 20 years.
Farmers have not taken them up enthusiastically, despite their environmental
appeal, because they do not kill most insects as effectively as conventional
chemicals.
Now a group of biotechnology companies, led by Ecogen and Mycogen in the US
and Agricultural Genetics Co (AGC) in the UK, is using genetic techniques to
develop a more powerful and more diverse range of second-generation
insecticides. Large chemical groups such as Monsanto, Du Pont and Ciba-Geigy
also have active bio-insecticide programmes.
Insects are the most tempting target for biological pest control, says John
Davis, Ecogen chief executive. One reason is that the chemical industry has
not developed a significant new class of insecticide since the synthetic
pyrethroids 20 years ago. Its recent innovation record is better against the
other main types of agricultural pest: fungi and weeds. As a result, some
insects are building up resistance to the long-standing chemical pesticides.
Another reason why biotechnology is attacking insects first is the wealth of
scientific and technical knowledge built up since the 1960s about Bacillus
thuringiensis.
Ecogen, based in Pennsylvania, has a bacterial library of 9,000 strains of
Bt collected from around the world. Each produces a slightly different toxin
and therefore has a different effect on insects.
The company's new products are based on Bt strains modified genetically
through a process known as transconjugation. This is different from the
standard genetic engineering technique of 'recombinant DNA' which alters the
chromosome, the bacterium's central store of genetic information.
Transconjugation involves moving plasmids - extra strands of DNA that some
bacteria carry outside the chromosome - from one strain to another. In Bt
the plasmids rather than the chromosome carry the insecticidal genes, so
scientists have been able to create super-strains with plasmids brought
together from different natural strains to have the maximum impact on
specific pests.
Ecogen is already selling three bio-insecticides made in this way and one
from AGC - to be marketed by Ciba-Geigy - will be launched later this year.
Their targets include various caterpillars, Colorado potato beetle and
European corn borer, gypsy moth and spruce budworm.
Mycogen, based in California, has most experience of recombinant DNA work on
Bt. Last year the US Environmental Protection Agency approved its first two
genetically engineered products, one for use on caterpillars and the other
aimed at the Colorado beetle.
Mycogen transfers Bt genes into another common bacterium, Pseudomonas, which
is then mass-produced and killed. The dead Pseudomonas cells act as a
'bacterial capsule' for the Bt toxins. They therefore persist longer than
the original Bt pesticides, which users have criticised because they break
down in the environment before they have killed their insect targets.
There has been little environmental opposition to Bt-based biopesticides in
the US, because the toxins biodegrade so quickly and leave no residues.
Compared with conventional chemicals they are very specific, poisoning the
target while doing little harm to other insects and none to birds and
mammals.
The Japanese, however, are wary, because current Bt formulations contain not
only the toxin crystals but also spores which could in theory give rise to
new bacteria. They fear that these could infect silkworms - which are
culturally if not industrially important insects in Japan.
'We see no harm at all in having the spores and we have made a Bt that is
not toxic to silkworms,' Davies says. But Ecogen is now talking to cautious
Japanese companies about developing spore-free versions of its products.
Although Bt leads the bio-insecticide field, some researchers are
investigating other micro-organisms as a source of toxins. For example Du
Pont, the US chemical group, is collaborating with Crop Genetics, an
agricultural biotechnology company, to develop insecticidal virus products.
All bio-insecticides are formulated so that growers can mix them with water
in a tank and spray on to the crops just like ordinary pesticides. Even so,
farmers need to be educated not to expect an immediate 'knock-down' as with
a chemical poison.
When a susceptible insect ingests Bt toxin, its stomach is paralysed
instantly and it stops feeding, but it may not die for three or four days.
This can mislead the user into thinking that the spray is working too
slowly.
'Once you get over that initial hurdle, growers get a kick out of using a
biological product,' says Roger Gilmore, chief executive of AGC. 'Many of
them feel instinctively that it's wrong to use a chemical spray.'
Eventually bio-insecticides may face competition from another feat of
biotechnology: transfering toxin genes directly into plants, so that the
crops then make the poisons in their own cells. Mycogen and Ecogen are both
collaborating with seed companies to do this with Bt genes, while AGC is
making use of insecticidal genes present in plants themselves.
It will be well into the next century, however, before many plant varieties
have been engineered to kill a wide spectrum of potential pests. By then
bio-pesticides are likely to have made many conventional insecticides
redundant.

A SMALL group of Labour backbenchers, led by Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for
Bolsover, embarrassed the party's leadership in the Commons yesterday by
opposing the award of a peerage to Mr Bernard Weatherill, who recently
retired after nearly nine years as speaker.
In accordance with custom, MPs were asked to approve a motion formally
asking the Queen to 'confer some signal mark of her Royal favour' on Mr
Weatherill.
With vociferous support from some of his leftwing colleagues, Mr Skinner
said he was opposed to the House of Lords and wanted to see the 'classless

The motion was approved by a majority of 232 (247-15).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO OFFICER from the West Midlands Police Serious Crime Squad, disbanded in
disgrace nearly three years ago, will be prosecuted, Mrs Barbara Mills, the
director of public prosecutions, decided yesterday.
The move led to expressions of disquiet about its implications for the
criminal justice system.
The Crown Prosecution Service's decision to close its files on the Serious
Crime Squad follows consideration of a report by the West Yorkshire Police
for the Police Complaints Authority.
The West Yorkshire Police spent two years delving into the activities of the
Serious Crime Squad between January 1986 and August 1989, examining
complaints from 97 people, more than a third of them Afro-Caribbean. Its
investigation is the most widespread of any made by one police force into
the activity of another.

The figure was slightly lower than expected but economists warned that
Britain was still heading for a record deficit in fiscal 1992-93. Most
expect the PSBR in the new financial year - which started in April - to

SHAREHOLDERS of quoted companies in the east Midlands have fared better over
the past year than the companies themselves, according to an analysis
published yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The analysis covered the published results of 74 companies, and showed that
while, on average, pre-tax profits fell 5.1 per cent and earnings
attributable to shareholders fell 19 per cent, shareholders received a 17
per cent increase in dividends.
KPMG says 11,500 people have lost their jobs in the region in the past year.
Turnover of the companies in the survey totalled more than Pounds 19bn, and
was 2 per cent higher than in 1990-91. 'By taking into account inflation,
sales have actually fallen in real terms', KPMG added.

THE Advertising Association, which represents 26 leading advertising trade
bodies, today steps up its lobbying of the government, MPs and members of
the European parliament for further and wider deregulation within the
European Community.
In a document, The Spirit of '92, the association urges the government to
promote 'the construction of a Europe without national restraints on trade
or services, and to reinforce progress towards the acceptance of freedom in
communications, and truth in advertising'.
It calls on the government, during its presidency of the Council of
Ministers, to press for:
A declaration on the importance of advertising within the single market.
Freedom to advertise across national borders.
Full application of the principle of subsidiarity (giving member states
leeway in implementing EC regulations).
Promotion of self-regulation in advertising.
Rationalisation of proposals affecting food advertising.
Reconsideration of national restrictions on advertising.
Continued resistance to a proposed EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRUG company yesterday confirmed that it was withdrawing its vitamin
supplement products for competition horses because they might be poisonous.
Three horses are said to have died and several are seriously ill, according
to Colburn-Dawes Nutrition, a subsidiary of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals
group. Those known to be affected are polo horses, hunters and eventers in
Suffolk and Hampshire.
The horses are alleged to have died after consuming excessive amounts of
selenium, one of the ingredients in the vitamin supplements that are given
regularly in feed.
The products are used by top horse studs around the world. Products have
been exported to Greece, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, the
Philipines and Taiwan.
The company said it was withdrawing all horse feed supplements made since
September and held by distributors and their customers in the UK. Overseas
customers were being warned but the company fears that most exports will
have been used already.
Tests by Ministry of Agriculture scientists have confirmed that the products
contain more selenium than they should. A spokesman from Medi Equus, a
Colburn-Dawes Nutrition distributor, said the tests disclosed 'huge
variations in the level of selenium and other potentially toxic minerals'.

<TEXT>
POST Office plans to improve customer service through a 'total quality'
programme encountered opposition yesterday from the UCW, the main postal
union.
The union voted at its annual conference in Bournemouth to oppose increased
job specialisation and team working, and to ballot on strike action over the
latter if necessary.
Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, has been trying for more
than two years to introduce into sorting and delivery operations a system of
self-regulating teams, headed by team leaders. This is part of a drive to
introduce 'total quality' principles, focusing on excellence of service and
customers' needs.
The UCW fears that managers will bypass shopfloor union representatives and
talk to team leaders.
Royal Mail said yesterday that it had 'no plans to introduce team working
overnight'. It would continue, by consultation and persuasion, to 'dispel
any misunderstanding' among the workforce. There was no intention to
undermine union representatives, it added.
The vote opposing teamworking was taken against the advice of the union's
leadership, so it is possible that talks between the UCW and Royal Mail may
continue.
Royal Mail, as part of its efforts to improve services, also wants each
household to have its own regular postman or postwoman. That would mean
workers having to become more specialised.
The UCW voted to oppose such specialisation, arguing that members prefer to
rotate hours and duties, and maintain work variety.

CHEVRON Corporation, the fourth largest US oil company, has finalised an oil
exploitation agreement with the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan worth
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) over the next three years, writes Neil Buckley.
It is the largest venture agreed between a western oil company and a former
Soviet republic. Over the 40-year life of the project the deal could be
worth as much as Dollars 20bn.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president, signed the deal with Mr Kenneth
Derr, Chevron chairman, in Washington this week, finalising details of a
protocol signed 10 days earlier. The speed with which the protocol was
finalised will be an encouraging sign for other companies involved in talks
with former Soviet states.
Chevron will acquire a 50 per cent interest in a joint venture to develop
the Tengiz and Korolev fields on the north-eastern Caspian Sea coast.
Work will begin in January next year on developing the two fields, whose
reserves are estimated at about 25bn barrels, of which between 6bn and 9bn
barrels may eventually be recoverable.

TWO of the world's top disk-drive makers, Matsushita-Kotobuki (MKE) of Japan
and Quantum Corporation of the US, are to open a factory in Ireland as their
base for the European market.
The two have a partnership under which MKE makes a range of 40MB to 240MB
hard disk drives (HDDs) in Japan, while Quantum designs and markets them to
personal computer manufacturers. European sales now top IPounds 250m (Pounds
227m) a year, and represent 35 per cent of Quantum's world market, Quantum
said.
European-based customers include Apple, Hewlett Packard, Unisys, Intel,
Brother and Sun Microsystems. The market is growing 'by 25 per cent a year',
according to Qauntum. The hard-disk device usually accounts for 15 per cent
of the cost of an average PC.
The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) will part fund the new IPounds
21m facility, which is expected to be on stream by autumn. HDDs for the
European market will be assembled in Ireland rather than Japan from
components sourced in the Far East. Ireland was chosen because of grant and
tax incentives, the skilled labour, and for the possibility of sourcing
components from within Ireland as its electronics industry grew, the company
said.

FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Hungary - robust little exporter in heart
of Europe / Comecon's failure has been a spur, Nicholas Denton in Budapest
and Anthony Robinson in London write
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST the odds, Hungary has emerged over the past 15 months as a modest
but robust export machine in the heart of depressed central Europe.
Exports to developed western markets rose an unprecedented 31 per cent last
year with a further 13 per cent rise in total exports over the first quarter
of 1992 compared to the same period last year.
This came despite a marked economic slowdown in the European Community, an
effective revaluation of the forint and 35 per cent domestic inflation.
The export drive which saw hard currency earnings soar to Dollars 10.2bn
(Pounds 5.7bn) last year from Dollars 6.3bn in 1990 is born out of
desperation. Like other former Comecon members, Hungary has faced depressed
domestic demand and the collapse of trade with the Soviet Union. The volume
of exports to eastern Europe fell by 60 per cent last year, giving many
companies a bleak choice: find new, western customers, or go to the wall.
Even Ikarus, the lumbering volume busmaker which supplied all of Comecon
from plants in Hungary and used to sell 80 per cent of its output to Moscow
alone, has turned further afield and won major orders from Taiwan, Turkey
and Iran.
Under the old Comecon division of labour, Hungary specialised in buses,
pharmaceutical products, foodstuffs, especially fruit, wine and vegetables,
and engineering products, including consumer goods such as lightbulbs and
electronic equipment.
The collapse of Comecon has forced exporters to try to upgrade this existing
product range where possible for western markets. For some, like the
Videoton consumer electronics enterprise, the competition proved
overwhelming. But between 1989 and 1991, the share of exports going to EC
markets doubled while the share going to eastern Europe halved.
Last year, the former Comecon states took only 19 per cent of Hungary's
exports, making it the least dependent on this once-dominant market. Many
Hungarian economists caution that overstretched companies have redirected as
much production as they can and argue that the pace of export growth to the
west is unsustainable.
For the past three years, however, hard-currency exports have far exceeded
expectations, pointing to a deeper, continuing transformation. Improved
access to western markets has played a part. The free trade accord at the
heart of Hungary's association agreement with the EC began to take effect
earlier this year. But EC trade barriers will be removed most slowly in
three areas where Hungary has the strongest comparative advantage: food,
textiles and steel.
A paper presented at the recent European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's annual meeting in Budapest even suggested that some exporting
sectors such as textiles could actually be worse off under the association
agreement than under the generalised system of preferences which previously
applied. Hungary calculates that export growth attributable to the
association agreement could be only Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a year.
It is foreign investment and the opening of Hungary to sophisticated EC
imports which is making the real difference. Foreign machinery and
investment have flowed into the country in response to liberalisation,
rapidly improving the competitiveness of Hungarian goods.
Finex, a small locally-owned foreign trader, shows how a little investment
can go a long way. The company exported about Dollars 125,000-worth of
frozen raspberries last year to a German wholesaler, earning more than the
Dollars 100,000 spent importing the nitrogen flash freezer equipment. This
year, the company plans to more than double deliveries and is trying to
diversify into selling frozen ready-cooked meals to Sweden, all from the
same machine.
Sometimes, investment has even greater leverage on exports. One of Mr Gabor
Varszegi's innovations at Ajka Crystal, the glassmaker he took over at the
end of 1990, was to publish a catalogue, the first in 40 years.
That little project helped Mr Varszegi, Hungary's leading entrepreneur, to
double Ajka's forint sales in the first year of private ownership, with
75-80 per cent earmarked for export.
Mr Bela Kadar, minister of international economic relations, estimates that
foreign investment, which reached Dollars 3.5bn by the end of April,
produces additional exports worth half that amount annually.
Production for export remains competitive despite poor transport links and
an approximate 10 per cent effective revaluation of the forint over the past
year largely because labour costs are, according to General Motors of the
US, a tenth of west German levels.
GE, the US corporation which became the first big foreign investor when it
bought Tungsram in 1989, complains that failure to allow the forint to
devalue in line with last year's 35 per cent domestic inflation rate has
badly affected its cost structure. But that has not stopped GE basing its
worldwide production of compact fluorescent lamps in Hungary or stepping up
its research and development activity to take advantage of lower costs.
Much new investment capacity will come on stream this year, as GM begins
production of engines, Ford starts producing motor components and new model
Swift compact cars start rolling of Suzuki Motor Corporation's new assembly
lines in western Hungary.
Initially, however only 30 per cent of Suzuki's output will be local content
because of the slowness of local enterprises in adapting to rigorous
Japanese quality standards.

<TEXT>
A UK-led consortium has won the right to operate one of Romania's two TV
channels, representatives of the group, led by Atlantic Television, said
after signing the deal yesterday, Virginia Marsh reports from Bucharest. The
new station, Channel 2 TV Romania, would be the first national commercial TV
channel in the former Soviet bloc.
Mr Robin Edwards, managing director of Atlantic Television, a
Canadian-registered company, said the new group would 'set the standard' for
other ex-Comecon countries still formulating their audio-visual laws.
The deal gives the new channel, a joint-venture company allocating a 20 per
cent stake to Radio Televiziunea, Romania's state broadcasting company,
broadcasting rights for 15 years, with option on a further five. Bucharest
had put no restrictions on the content of programmes, said Mr Edwards, a
non-executive director of Westcountry Television of the UK. The channel was
conceived as a high-quality, non-political station, to broadcast news, drama
and light entertainment.
It will import half its programmes from the west. The company's main
financial backer is Mr Minos Kyriakou, owner of Antenna, an Athens-based TV
station. The new channel, which Atlantic hopes will be functioning by the
end of the year, plans to recoup an initial Dollars 25m (Pounds 14m)
investment through advertising. The station is allowed to air up to nine
minutes of commercials every hour.

THE ARREST of Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of deposed
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was ordered yesterday by a Manila
judge.
Judge Teresita Flores issued the order after Mrs Marcos failed to appear at
an arraignment in connection with charges of failing to report foreign
exchange deposits abroad.
Mrs Marcos had been accused by the government of having conspired with her
late husband in looting the economy while they were in power.
She had declared she would defy the courts in protest against what she
described as 'systematic cheating' in the May 11 election where she ran as
one of seven presidential candidates.
She ranked fifth in the vote-counting yesterday. Analysts never gave her any
chance of winning despite her claim of residual support in the rural areas.
Last Monday, she also snubbed a hearing in another court. The judge in that
court gave Mrs Marcos until June 1 to explain why she was unable to appear
at the hearing.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Keating unable to dispel image of government in turmoil:
After the resignation of a key ally, Australia's prime minister must wonder
if his luck has run out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL KEATING, Australia's prime minister, offered no promises when Labor
MPs installed him in place of Mr Bob Hawke in December. Like everyone else,
Mr Keating knew that winning the next election would require at least as
much luck as leadership.
Until April, he appeared blessed with both as Labor's opinion poll rating
surged to within one percentage point of the conservative Liberal/National
party opposition, compared with a deficit of 18 points in December.
But the recovery has evaporated in the face of renewed debate over the
government's handling of the economy, and growing doubts about the prime
minister's political judgment. The latest Newspoll, for yesterday's
Australian newspaper, put Labor 12 points behind the conservatives.
Five months into his premiership, Mr Keating has sharpened Labor's image and
taken the attack to the conservatives. But he must be wondering if his luck
has run out.
His most pressing problem is the resignation of Senator Graham Richardson, a
key Labor power broker, over his relationship with an Australian businessman
facing forgery charges in the Marshall Islands.
Mr Richardson is a long-time political ally of Mr Keating, and was regarded
as one of the most influential members of the government. He denies any
impropriety over the Marshall Islands affair, but admits writing a reference
for the businessman and telephoning the Marshall Islands government on his
behalf.
The affair is especially damaging for the government because it has
refocused attention on the relationships between Labor leaders and failed
entrepreneurs such as Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell, head of the
collapsed Rothwell's merchant bank.
The opposition is now trying to prove that Senator Gareth Evans, the foreign
minister, was also involved in the Marshall Islands affair, which it claims
is a prime example of Labor cronyism, known in Australia as 'mateship'.
Mr Keating may also have been damaged by revelations that he blocked
attempts by a royal commission in Western Australia to investigate the tax
records of state politicians and local businessmen accused of corruption.
Mr Keating later backed down, but the public row with the commission left
the impression that he had been trying to shield state Labor leaders from
potentially embarrassing revelations in another example of mateship.
With hindsight, the turning point for Mr Keating appears to have been
Labor's defeat by a protectionist independent candidate in a by-election in
mid-April in Mr Hawke's former constituency of Wills, a down-at-heel
Melbourne suburb.
The government remains committed to opening Australia's economy through
tariff reductions, cuts in subsidies and deregulation. But the by-election
defeat showed how much the pain of economic restructuring is resented in
industrial seats like Wills, most of which tend to be held by Labor.
Wills also showed how much the government has been hurt by an 18 month
recession triggered by high interest rates. Mr Keating will get some credit
from voters for the recovery which is now under way, but many will also
remember that he was treasurer (finance minister) when the recession began.
Perversely, the recovery is also causing problems for the government because
it has been accompanied by a dramatic fall in inflation to a 30-year low of
1.7 per cent. Low inflation may be beneficial for the economy in the long
run, but falling interest rates have provoked squeals of anguish from the
large numbers of retired people living off the interest on their savings.
Low inflation has also put a question mark over the government's ability to
deliver substantial tax cuts promised after the next election, due by
mid-1993. The cuts were to be funded mostly from the proceeds of tax
indexation, commonly known as bracket creep. But the unexpectedly rapid fall
in inflation means the bracket creep windfall will virtually disappear.
The government cannot borrow to finance the cuts because the forecast budget
deficit for the year to June has already increased from ADollars 4.7bn to
ADollars 9.3bn (Pounds 3.97bn), leaving it little room to manoeuvre if it is
to achieve its target of returning to surplus by 1996.
Meanwhile, it looks as though an ADollars 2.3bn fiscal stimulus announced in
February may fail to reduce unemployment to below 10 per cent before the
election.
Mr Keating has had some success in distracting attention from the economy by
throwing his weight behind Australian nationalists seeking the abolition of
the monarchy and the removal of the British Union flag from the top left
quarter of the Australian flag.
However, he has been forced to drop the flag campaign in the face of signs
that it is proving counter-productive. In the latest poll in the Bulletin
magazine, support for change has fallen to 31 per cent, compared to 33 per
cent eight years ago.
Despite the setbacks, Labor remains better placed to fight the election than
it was under Mr Hawke, whose government had become directionless and
demoralised by factional infighting.
Party officials claim that most of the problems will be forgotten as the
economy recovers. If they are right, Mr Keating may yet pull off a record
fifth successive election victory.
But the danger for Labor is that he will be unable to dispel the image of a
government in turmoil. And that could permanently derail the party's
recovery.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday expressed satisfaction over a statement by the US that a
United Nations resolution asserting the right of return for Palestinian
refugees was not part of the terms of reference for the Middle East peace
negotiations.
The government had pressed Washington for such a public statement after Ms
Margaret Tutwiler, the state department spokeswoman, announced last week
that the US supported UN Security Council Resolution 194, adopted in 1948,
which included the right of return, or compensation, for Palestinian
refugees.
Although not a change in official US policy, Ms Tutwiler's announcement
aroused alarm in Israel. Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said Ms
Tutwiler's statement amounted to an obstacle to the negotiating process if
it was not 'clarified'.
Ms Tutwiler said on Monday that the only UN resolutions included in the
terms of reference for the peace process were resolutions 242 and 338, which
envisage Israel surrendering Arab territory in exchange for peace and a
'just' - but unspecified - solution for the 2.5m refugees.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW dimension was added to Hong Kong politics yesterday with the formation
of a pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong.
The party, which is headed by Mr Tam Yiu-chung, a vocal left-wing
legislative councillor, has been funded by pro-Beijing and mainland Chinese
companies. But a spokesman was adamant the party is 'in no way controlled by
China'.
Other politicians were less convinced but considered it a positive
development that pro-China interests were coming out into the political
forum, 'rather than just pulling strings in the background'.
Mr Tam, who is vice-chairman of the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions,
said the group was strongly committed to the reintegration of Hong Kong with
China, but it also supported the principle of 'Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong'.
One of the ultimate stated objectives of the organisation is 'the chief
executive and all members of the legislature being selected by popular
election', but there was some cynicism concerning the time-frame for such a
move.
Mr Lee Wing-tat, legislative councillor and spokesman for the United
Democratic party, described the claims of the new political group as 'just a
gesture'.
He said 'on general domestic policy they may have a free hand. But on
sensitive issues they will have to hear the voice of Beijing'. Under current
plans, only 20 seats, or one third of the Legislative Council, will be
directly elected in the 1995 elections.
The pro-Beijing lobby performed poorly in Hong Kong's first direct elections
in September 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kim Young Sam yesterday won the presidential nomination of South Korea's
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) but his victory was soured by the
possibility that his only challenger may launch an independent bid for the
post.
Mr Lee Jong-Chan, a popular MP from Seoul who withdrew from the nomination
race on Sunday in protest against alleged backroom dealing, indicated he was
planning to remain in the presidential race as an independent.
If Mr Lee stands, he threatens the chances of Mr Kim, a former opposition
leader who joined the ruling party in 1990.
Mr Lee could split the DLP's supporters in the presidential race, which is
expected to take place in December.
One measure of Mr Lee's popularity was that he received a third of the
nomination votes at yesterday's DLP convention.
Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Korean business group Hyundai and head
of the Unification National Party, is also threatening to attract
conservative voters from the DLP.
This would improve the chances of Mr Kim Dae-Jung, the leader of the main
opposition Democratic Party, gaining the presidency on his third try since
1971.
AP adds: Thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs clashed with
police in Seoul and elsewhere yesterday. They said Mr Kim's nomination would
mean a continuation of what they called the military-backed government of
President Roh Tae Woo. They said Mr Roh's DLP must be disbanded to bring
genuine democracy to South Korea.
Police firing tear gas blocked 2,000 students from marching toward Mr Kim's
house.

<TEXT>
Germany yesterday promised to find some new way to charge foreign lorries
using its road network for transit, after the European Court of Justice
ruled that its present tax plan was contrary to the Treaty of Rome, writes
Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, expressed disappointment at the
result, and promised to put forward a new plan which would be 'fair to
German interests and conform to EC law'.
He said the government's aim remained the same: to ensure that all road
haulage should pay directly for using German roads. This should reduce
congestion on the autobahn system, strengthen the competitiveness of the
railways, and make the whole transport system more environmentally friendly.
The tax would have required all heavy goods vehicles using the German roads,
with a permitted loaded weight in excess of 18 tonnes, to pay an annual
licence fee ranging from DM2,000 (Pounds 680) to DM9,000 (Pounds 3,060).
The European Court decided the tax contravened the article of the Rome
Treaty forbidding discrimination against road hauliers from other member
states.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST significant threat of further labour unrest in west Germany this
year evaporated yesterday with agreement on a 5.8 per cent pay rise for 1m
construction workers.
The settlement, which followed on the heels of a similar deal struck at
midnight on Sunday for almost 4m engineering workers and the recent 5.4 per
cent rise for around 3m public servants, effectively concluded this year's
pay round.
While strike action in other industries cannot be ruled out - traditionally
militant printers invaded arbitration talks yesterday to press their case
for 11 per cent - negotiations in the key sectors are now complete.
The results so far suggest a national average award marginally below the 6
per cent adopted as the most likely outcome by government and independent
forecasters in their 1992 economic predictions.
Yesterday's construction deal coincided with the release of an upbeat report
by HDB, the main industry association. The weakness in the overall economy
had slowed building development but could not stop it, Mr Hermann Becker,
association president, said last night.
He expected real growth in the west this year of 2-3 per cent, despite the
effects of a severe spending squeeze on the public sector. New orders in the
east in the first four months of the year were a real 55 per cent higher
than in 1991, Mr Becker added.
The nominal increase of 70 per cent had been eroded by the rapid rise in
labour costs, he said. Wages in east Germany would increase to 77 per cent
of western levels as a result of yesterday's pay deal.
Total construction output in the east, where the upswing was still
'unsteady', was expected to show a 17 per cent increase for the full year,
Mr Becker said. Longer term, new estimates showed that DM2,400bn (Pounds
816bn) would have to be spent on construction in the east over the next 15
years to bring housing, working and environmental facilities up to western
standards.

<TEXT>
A TEAM from the International Monetary Fund is to leave Moscow without
agreeing the first draft of a Russian economic reform programme which would
unlock the Dollars 24bn promised by the west because key details remain
unresolved.
The Russian government had hoped to agree a letter of intent with the Fund
by today so that the final standby programme could be ready in time for
President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with Group of Seven leaders in Munich on
July 6-7. (It usually takes about a month between the time the letter of
intent is approved by Fund officials and the conclusion of a standby
programme allowing an IMF member access to Fund resources).
The visiting IMF officials are understood to have told the Russian
government that despite progress - including moves to liberalise internal
oil prices - more work needs to be done. Gaps include a system to control
monetary policy with the other former Soviet republics which still use the
rouble as their currency. Despite an ultimatum by Russia for republics to
decide whether to keep the rouble, Latvia and Belarus have for instance
confused matters by deciding to issue surrogate currencies while remaining
in the rouble zone.
Russia's most senior crime prevention officer yesterday urged the government
to plan for the consequences of the large-scale unemployment it expects to
result from the reforms.
Major-General Boris Voronov said President Yeltsin was yesterday presented
with proposals for giving enterprises tax benefits for offering jobs to
unemployed teenagers, and for the creation of voluntary bodies to help deal
with drug and alcohol abuse.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Japan shows 'clear interest' in Community's energy tax plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has expressed 'clear interest' in the EC's proposed tax on energy to
combat global warming, while the US continues to rule out fiscal means to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, according to Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC
environment commissioner.
Mr Ripa di Meana said that at last weekend's informal meeting in Bonn of
environment ministers of the Group of 7 most industrialised nations, 'there
was clear interest from the Japanese side. It is not yet an agreement, but
not a refusal. They are studying (the tax) carefully without discarding it.'
The Commission proposal, for a Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent tax
by 2000, levied half on energy value and half on carbon content, depends on
the EC's main industrial partners following suit. Environment ministers of
the 12 are expected to endorse the thrust of this conditional plan on May
26.
At the Bonn meeting the US expressed 'a drastic refusal', Mr Ripa di Meana
said. However, he stressed the 'very powerful boost' to the plan in the
'unprecedented and unexpected support from the World Bank', contained in its
latest development report.
The commissioner believes concerted political pressure could lead Washington
to move further, now that in the run-up to the Rio de Janeiro earth summit
next month, the US has 'accepted the logic of stabilising' CO emissions for
the first time.
The EC's proposed carbon tax would have to be Dollars 36 rather than Dollars
10 per barrel of oil equivalent if carbon dioxide emissions were to be
stabilised in line with international recommendations, according to an
economic report published today by Ireland's Economic and Social Research
Institute (ESRI), Tim Coone adds from Dublin.
ESRI estimates that the costs of such a tax would be unevenly spread,
reducing real gross domestic product in the US and Europe by only 1 per
cent, but by over 7 per cent in many energy-exporting less-developed
countries.
If the industrialised countries were to act unilaterally to curb emissions,
'the costs to their economies would be virtually unchanged from what it
would have been under a global agreement. But global CO emissions would
continue to grow at around 1.5 per cent per year'.
It recommends that emission quotas be made internationally tradeable.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (11): Fleets take on
a greener shade - Janina Walker looks at the impact of environmental issues
on operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANINA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEING green was once the prerogative of people who wore flowers in their
hair - now it is a powerful, emotive issue which has become a crucial factor
for express and courier operators.
London's controversial red-route scheme to cut traffic congestion has raised
fears that it would affect deliveries if repeated nationwide.
Tougher environmental legislation has made carriers look at 'greening' their
fleets and increased public pressure against night-time activities at
airports has become a problem for some operators.
Lynx - a National Freight Consortium company, which handles more than 25m
parcels annually - was particularly vocal in their fears last year that the
red-route would hamper operations.
The scheme is in operation on an eight-mile stretch of road between north
and east London. Parking is banned at any time on double red lines, with
time restrictions on single red lines and designated loading and unloading
bays.
Mr Alan Soper, managing director of Lynx, said: 'The general view at the
moment is that it has not caused as many problems as expected because it is
in such a limited area.
'However, if it were the norm then it would certainly have an effect on our
deliveries and begin to have an impact on the cost.
'Really, this is about a whole host of issues and a balance has to be struck
between several competing interests. I think it is untenable that a road
should be separated from its shops.
'The real skill is to make a good, balanced decision taking pollution, the
free flow of traffic, business, and what people really want into
consideration.'
Noise pollution from jets has come under increasing fire from environmental
pressure groups - in Holland, Maastricht airport has been one of the main
targets for campaigners and the Dutch department of transport has recently
banned all night flights for the time being.
In March, express freight company Emery Worldwide finally pulled the plug on
their Maastricht hub and moved to Brussels airport following a deal with DHL
to share space on transatlantic and inter-European flights.
Mr Chutta Ratnathicam, Emery vice-president International, cited
increasingly restrictive night flight curfews as one of the crucial factors
in the decision to discontinue operations at Maastricht.
The company now operates from the DHL hub in Brussels and the DC8s which
were used at Maastricht are being deployed elsewhere.
XP Express Parcels Systems, who pulled out of Maastricht two years ago after
being acquired by TNT, also experienced problems with the green lobby.
Mr David Burton, general manager XP International, said: 'There was talk of
imposing a night flying ban which for an express parcel company is
tantamount to disaster.
'At the time we were using F27s and to get the fleet up to environmental
scratch would have been a significant investment by KLM who owned us at the
time and I think it was one of the reasons XP was put on the market.'
XP now operate from TNT's hub at Cologne airport using the BAe Quiet Trader
aircraft which represent a Dollars 400m investment in greening by the
company.
TNT's 20-strong fleet of BAe Qt 146s - known in the industry as the quiet
profit-makers - are said to be the quietest in the world and serve 17
European countries and 31 cities and converge at the Cologne hub every
night.
Mr Burton said there had been various attempts to lobby for at least an
examination of night-time activity at Cologne which is also used by leading
operator UPS.
Global express carrier UPS does not intend to be caught out over
environmental legislation and, according to company spokesman Mr Ken
Sternad, are making Dollars 4bn investment to ensure their aircraft meet
what he described as any regulations anywhere in the world.
Their DC8 fleet - some of which are used in Europe - have all been fitted
with new environmentally sound engines at the cost of Dollars 400m.
Mr Sternad said: 'It makes good business sense to have an engine on an
aircraft that is environmentally sound, fuel efficient and that will give a
tremendous new level of maintenance and reliability which is critical in our
industry.
'There is a growing awareness about the environment not only among
legislators and the general public but also among our customers who use it
in making a decision on their choice of carrier.'
In the UK, green policies are high on the agenda at the Royal Mail - by far
the largest domestic carrier. The Royal Mail has a 28,500-strong road fleet
with an annual mileage of 460m miles a year.
On May 14 three new vehicles which could be the prototypes for the next
generation of cleaner, greener transport fleets, were unveiled.
The vehicles, developed by the Royal Mail and Leyland DAF, use less fuel,
have equipment to cut out black exhaust fumes, make minimal noise and carry
the latest computer technology.
They will be road-tested this month and it is likely their must successful
features will be included in all new Royal Mail vehicles.
Mr Ray Bayfield, head of road transport at Royal Mail,believes that it is
important to do what they can to make the world a greener place.
The Royal Mail is no stranger to greening - they have already completed a
six-year programme of converting their vehicle fleet to unleaded fuel and
are still testing two 17-tonne 'green' trucks.
Express parcel carrier City Link have this month added the sixth
environmentally-friendly vehicle to their fleet.
The two-tier, 38-tonne trailer, can carry the load equivalent of almost two
conventional articulated lorries and has an engine which meets EC
regulations, including lower noise and exhaust and emission levels.
Mr Duncan Brazier, City Link national transport development manager, said:
'With any company today there is an across-the-board perception of the need
to be environmentally friendly. On a publicity basis, if nothing else, we
all accept that if we are going to operate effectively we must look at what
we can do to lessen our impact on the environment.
'It is not very often that you can reduce operating costs and be
ecologically friendly but we have been able to do just that with this new
vehicle.'
Mr Brazier added that City Link could possibly add more of the special
vehicles to their fleet in the future if volumes merited the need for them.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (10): Plans for
high-speed parcels train - The tunnel will open a new route to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANINA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALTERNATIVE route to Europe, which the Channel tunnel will eventually
provide for courier and express business, is the subject of intense
discussion and speculation.
Global express operator DHL has announced that it is seeking partners in a
venture to set up a European parcels train, to run through the tunnel.
The company has been negotiating with British Rail and its French and
Belgian counterparts, SCNF and SNCB, for some time, though DHL's chief
executive, Patrick Lupo, has refused to discuss in detail the nature of the
talks.
'We see a great opportunity in terms of express traffic going through the
tunnel when it is fully operational,' he said. 'It has to be a high-speed
rail link, but the critical factor is that it is the optimum speed to
provide the transit times customers require. If other parties are interested
in this, we would like to hear from them.'
Mr Lupo said the transport minister ought to encourage such export traffic.
The UK manufacturing base, he said, required a transport infrastructure that
would merge more effectively with that on the continent.
DHL is no stranger to letting the train take the strain. Later this year, it
plans to switch its air and road operations between its Brussels hub and
Paris to an overnight rail service. The company is investing Dollars 1m to
build its own terminal at Paris La Chappelle station, and to modify rolling
stock for air express sorting.
Neil Firth, network planning manager, Europe and Africa, said: 'A train
allows you to do something while you are in transit - sorting and
administrative activities. The move towards trains is also a defensive move,
to cover the geography that a truck can. There are also lots of pressures,
environmental and practical, in getting slots and operating out of airports
at the moment.
'The economics are that a train is roughly the same cost as an aeroplane.
There is a difference with a train, in that, as volume grows the incremental
costs become smaller in the longer term, which is strategically much
better.'
The European parcels train, which, according to Mr Firth, would be an
18-carriage TGV, purpose-built to run through the Channel tunnel, would
operate some time after the tunnel was opened.
Andrew Wilby, business manager for Channel tunnel parcels, European
Passenger Services, said British Rail envisaged two European parcels trains,
which would each carry 176 tonnes of express freight:
'They will contain roller beds for carrying containers, which is aircraft
technology - the trains, in effect, will be wingless aircraft. They will
make the journey to Brussels airport in around three hours, just the sort of
time-frame within which an aircraft works.
'However, a train is going to be considerably cheaper, and I understand they
are more reliable than aircraft. . . When an aircraft is grounded because of
fog or snow, it tends to be incapacitated for a long time, whereas a train
would probably be just an hour late.'
British Rail's Red Star, which handles 6m parcels a year, uses air and sea
to carry consignments across the Channel. It has a same-day service from
London to Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Rotterdam. When the Tunnel opens,
it plans to run a same-day scheduled service to Paris and Brussels, on the
back of passenger trains.
Roger Harrison, Red Star's public affairs manager, said: 'There is no doubt
that the Channel tunnel will be a boost. The capacity for sending light
freight and documents will be quite extensive. On top of this, an hourly
train service across the Channel will give flexibility - and, of course, a
train is reliable as it is less prone to the effects of adverse weather
conditions such as fog as aircraft are.'
Consignments on trains from London's Waterloo station will be carried under
bond, in total security until they reach Paris and Brussels.
'The train journey time will be three hours to Paris and under three hours
to Brussels, with customs clearance post-1992 making deliveries well within
a working day,' said Mr Harrison. 'The inter-city trains have to be a
winner, because they provide three key factors - reliability, capacity and
frequency.' Mr Wilby said the tunnel would give operators an alternative
international route in a market that was growing by about 20 per cent a
year.
He emphasised that the express services which would use the passenger trains
would not be an open system, and that Red Star would be acting as agent for
private operators.
'Security is of prime importance,' he added, 'and there will be a barrier to
couriers who want to just board a train with parcels. Regulations will have
to be strictly enforced.'
Paul Jackson, of Triangle, specialist management consultants to the freight
and transport industry, said the tunnel offered the industry much potential:
'The main advantage of using a train is being able to sort out packages
while they are in transit. There are also some congestion problems with jets
at various European airports and rail offers an alternative.'
The Red Star retail product would be given a great opportunity, but 'it is
worth remembering that you have to be as good as your railway partners on
the Continent. If the railways got their act together, I believe there would
be a real threat to the European parcels industry.'
'There is no doubt that this is an exciting time for the industry, but it
also could be a difficult one, because the difference between theory and
practice is one of the widest in the whole transport system.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (9): Bikes given a
rough ride - Motorcycle couriers hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANINA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION is continuing to give a rough ride to the motorcycle couriers.
Liquidation and consolidation are still key factors within what is
essentially a transient, fragmented industry business. It thrived in the
1980s and became the very essence of the free-enterprise culture.
It is difficult to put figures on this niche of the express market which has
always had its roots based locally. It is generally believed, however, that
what is happening in London could be occurring throughout the rest of the
country.
In the capital the very nature of a business, which anyone can enter, is
proving a headache for those left in the field.
While insiders estimate hundreds of enterprises up and down the country have
fallen victim to the recession there are still plenty of operators.
With customers cutting costs there is a shrinking market place. It is a
recipe for chaos as companies struggle for a slice of a much smaller cake.
'The situation is getting ridiculous, says Mr Malcolm Bluemel,
managing-director of express courier Rapid Despatch, which has a Pounds 4m
turnover and has offices in London and Birmingham.
'There is a massive price war going on at the moment which will get worse
before it will get better.'
'People are so desperate they are running non-profitable businesses because
they are cutting their prices to the bone. The problem is that the market is
just too easy for anyone to enter and is so fragmented.'
'Without a doubt there is a market for our services in legal, advertising,
accountancy, publishing and music businesses but there is a greater
awareness of costs and margins are being squeezed.'
Mr Bluemel has recently acquired another express courier company and sees
consolidation as the way ahead for the business.
'I believe that to have a future the industry should be in the hands of
maybe five or 10 major operators in a couple of years,' he says.
'What we need are economies of scale, more investment in technology to give
customer confidence and meet their requirements. We have to get away from
the idea that we are the poor relations of the courier and express industry
out to make a quick buck.'
Addison Lee, which has four London offices and a Pounds 7m turnover, handles
more than 2,000 customer accounts in the London market.
Mr John Griffin, its managing director, describes the London market -
generally believed to be the biggest and worth Pounds 150m a year - 'as
extremely tough.' He estimates that ithas shrunk by 28 per cent.
Mr Griffin says: 'Customers are spending less and I am back to the days when
I rolled up my sleeves and started up my business in an empty room.
'There is a price war going on. Competition is becoming suicidal as
companies as a last resort cut prices to unacceptable levels. It is just not
a sensible solution as these people will eventually go down.
'It is just too easy for people to start up who don't have the knowledge and
experience to run a business. I believe that in the end there will be a
polarisation within the industry of those who have managed to survive these
extremely tough times.'
Mr Paul Meunier, a director of north London express courier West One which
operates on a national and international basis through agents, believes the
business has changed.
He says: 'We still have a role to play but I think it won't quite be the
same as the heady days three years ago.
'Our figures are down and they won't get back to the same level -
alternative methods have been found for the service we provide. It used to
be a gut reaction to call for a bike but I don't think that is the case
now.'
Mr Meunier believes that, although there would always be room for the small
operator, the business would move in the direction of large companiesable to
make the necessary investment in technology.
'There is definitely a move among our clients towards using technology.
There are customers who would like to have a modem of their own in their
offices and asking if we can provide it - there is no doubt that it is
available but it is a new thing for us and we are looking at it.'
West One have also shifted ground by moving into the national overnight
service business which they started in October last year.
Mr Meunier says: 'This is a new venture for us. We always thought our niche
in the business was slightly different but our customers are availing
themselves of these services to save money so we felt it was right we should
break into them.'
Mr Paul Jackson, of Triangle, specialist management consultants to the
freight and transport industry, has no doubt that this niche of express
services is losing customers.
He comments: 'People have downtraded considerably because they are
questioning using 'same day' - they can always fax or arrange a delivery for
first thing in the morning.'
'There is also (the question of) economies of scale. Ninety per cent of
motorcycles go one way, it's ludicrous and certainly doesn't make sense  -
no transport business succeeds on a one-way basis.'
'I believe that unless the larger companies wrestle with this and other
things such as balancing loads, introducing track and trace systems and
computer mapping, they will just go on the same old merry-go-round.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (8): Playing it safe
on the front lines - Security is a crucial consideration for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH it has dropped out of the limelight since the Gulf War brought it
into a blaze of publicity security is now a crucial consideration for the
international courier and express industry. With many shipments travelling
in the holds of passenger aircraft, courier and express companies are in the
front line of the global battle against terrorist activity.
The risk of courier and express consignments being used by terrorists to
place explosives on board aircraft was highlighted at the 1991 World Express
Freight &amp; Distribution conference in Amsterdam by the chairman of the
Association of European Airlines security committee, Teun Platenkamp. 'There
seems no doubt that terrorist groups will attempt to conceal explosive
devices in cargo, express and courier packages or mail,' he warned.
The same packages can be - and have been - used for smuggling drugs and
other illegal items. For this reason, express operators are anxiously
waiting to see how EC countries organise their Customs checks once border
controls are abolished to create the Single Market. Shippers who fail to
declare dangerous goods are another problem.
However, the main thrust of current government air transport security
legislation around the world is predictably focused on combating the threat
of terrorist attacks on aircraft.
There has already been at least one documented terrorist incident involving
a courier and shipment. In 1989, an explosion in the lounge at India's
Calcutta International Airport was found to have been caused by a courier
parcel packed with explosives. The parcel was destined to be put on an
aircraft heading for Bombay. However, it was the earlier Pan Am Lockerbie
disaster at the end of 1988 which really started to concentrate
international attention on the urgent need to tighten up general aircraft
security.
Previous legislative moves by individual government and transport
organisations such as the United States Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) had proved
largely ineffective.
It took Lockerbie, and two other aircraft bombings in 1989 - a French UTA
aircraft over Niger and a Colombian Avianca flight near Bogota - to prompt
governments to consider new air transport security measures.
In the UK, it has led to moves to establish a register of couriers, express
companies and airfreight forwarders with recognised security clearance when
it comes to shipping goods by air. Representatives from the UK airline,
airport, forwarding and courier and express sectors, plus Customs, have met
Department of Transport officials on several occasions to discuss the sort
of measures companies must take in order to qualify for such registration.
Industry observers now expect an Approved Cargo Agent Register, as it will
probably be called, to be in place by the beginning of 1993.
The idea is that companies listed on the register will be given preferential
treatment by airlines when it comes to accepting shipments. Such companies
will be deemed less of a security risk in terms of possible terrorist
activity and will therefore generally find their shipments subjected to less
scrutiny by the carriers.
According to the most recent consultative paper on air transport security
presented by the Department of Transport, companies seeking 'approved cargo
agent' registration will have to set up security programmes covering three
broad areas of activity.
The first will centre on some form of pre-employment screening for new
personnel, probably along the lines of that already in place for airport
employees following the Pan Am Lockerbie tragedy.
The second area for attention will be the physical security of all
facilities and vehicles involved in the preparation and transport of goods
before being flown.
The third group of measures will centre on the use of screening systems,
both in terms of handling procedures and technology such as X-ray systems.
'The paper shows a very firm intention to move the legislative focus further
upstream. It implies there will be controls within air cargo operations from
airport security through to building and vehicle security,' said Mr David
Forbes, group security manager for TNT Express Worldwide. 'I think that
approach is right. We believe that everyone should be doing things to
relieve the pressure on the airlines when it comes to security matters.'
The UK Department of Transport has in the past been criticised by express
industry companies for failing to properly understand the needs of their
business, particularly when it comes to reconciling security requirements
with the need for fast transit. But, say industry sources, communication
between the department and the industry on that issue is improving.
Other governments around the world, however, seem to be moving rather more
slowly. Even the initially positive United States Federal Aviation
Administration became bogged down on the issue. It ran into problems with
the US Post Office which claimed that all mail carried on aircraft was
sealed against inspection and protected by law.
There has been considerable argument over whether consignments carried on
all-cargo aircraft should be subject to the same security checks as those on
passenger aircraft. The US FAA appears to have accepted that cargo carried
on freighter and passenger aircraft can be treated differently when it comes
to security.
The UK Department of Transport, on the other hand, has indicated it is not
prepared to make any distinction between freighter and passenger aircraft
freight. 'The last thing we, as a company and as an industry, need is to end
up with different sets of rules on security in every country where we
operate,' said TNT's Mr Forbes.
'There is a danger that could happen but there have recently been some signs
that governments around the world are starting to get it together more.
Certainly, the UK, US and Australian governments seem to be moving in the
same direction, although the rest of Europe does seem to be lagging behind a
bit.'
Another general problem confronting the courier and express industry and
other air transport organisations seeking to improve security is the lack of
suitable equipment for checking the contents of parcels and larger cargoes.
Both X-Ray machines and equipment employing Thermal Neutron Activation (TNA)
technology, which basically 'sniffs' the air for explosives particles, have
failed to prove particularly reliable in use. The latter also has quite a
high false alarm rate which slows down the checking process.
As a result, it has been estimated that London Heathrow airport, for
example, would need six TNA units, average length 34ft and costing USDollars
1m, just to check baggage.
Rather more practical, it appears, is the application of a concept called
the 'the known or unknown shipper'. The basic idea is that courier, express
and all other companies involved in moving goods by air should make a clear
distinction between the way they handle and check shipments originating from
shippers known to them and those coming from unfamiliar sources.
It is known, for instance, that the courier and package which exploded at
Calcutta airport in 1989 was originally collected from a man staying in an
hotel.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (6): Airlines aim for
a flying start - New opportunities are opening up in the airfreight industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID international expansion during the 1980s by new-style integrators
offering express door-to-door delivery services initially left airlines and
freight forwarders struggling to produce a positive response.
Much of the latter's intra-European air freight and general international
package/small parcel business soon disappeared into the hands of companies
such as TNT, DHL and Federal Express.
'The fast development of the new integrated transportation concept,
especially in Europe, dramatically altered a part of the traditional
airfreight scene,' said Mr Peter Somaglia, general manager of airline-owned
express company Skyracer.
Now, though, the freight industry is seeing growing demand for the same fast
door-to-door delivery of heavier parcels and general freight as that
available for smaller packages.
Observers say this is opening up opportunities for the forwarders and
airlines to fight back.
They argue that many of the early advantages claimed by the integrators are
being eroded as those companies are forced to expand already costly air and
truck networks to cater for larger freight consignments as well as documents
and small packages.
'The express companies defined the product for everyone else. What they did
was bring to the market delivery - as opposed to despatch - specifications,'
said Mr Paul Jackson, chairman of express industry research and consultancy
company Triangle Management Services.
'But now most people, including the forwarders, are selling all-in prices
covering door-to-door movements. And the speciality of the integrators,
owning their own equipment, is not a sufficient plus in terms of economics.
In fact, the bottom line is that it is not economic to own all that
expensive equipment.'
Early airline efforts to combat the competition from integrators proved
largely unsuccessful. Several ambitious attempts to set up in-house
door-to-door express delivery operations failed, mainly because of
opposition from forwarders worried about losing their business.
Internal conflicts over issues such as using the services of other carriers
for carrying consignments only added to the airlines' problems.
Such failures have not deterred some carriers from continuing to try to
develop express organisations. Swissair, with fellow Swiss carrier Crossair
and Austrian Airlines, has spent the last couple of years developing
Skyracer, a door-to-door parcel/document express delivery company. Mr
Somaglia explained why Swissair had chosen to set it up as an independent
business unit: 'The decision not to incorporate these (express) services
within the airline was based on the belief that the integrated
transportation concept requires overall control and an uninterrupted
door-to-door information flow with a dedicated and qualified express-minded
staff,' he said.
'It was also believed that any 'internal' airline express operation would
lack interest in using other carriers for linehaul purposes, making it
impossible to offer customers a complete product.'
German airline Lufthansa and Japan Air Lines have adopted a rather different
approach, apparently accepting that if you cannot beat the integrators, join
them.
The two airlines have each bought a five per cent shareholding in air
express company DHL with an option to increase it to 25 per cent in June
this year.
Since agreement on that deal at the end of 1990, the companies have taken
their time establishing external operational and service co-operation. But
synergies are emerging. 'In the US, for instance, DHL aircraft are being
used to carry Lufthansa and JAL freight during the daytime,' said DHL.
Most other large airlines are now concentrating on developing wholesale
express services for forwarders - and courier/express companies - rather
than seeking to build up retail door-to-door services. In that way, they
believe, they can continue to work with their main customers rather than
competing with them.
One such is British Airways. The carrier has developed a wholesale
operation, Speedbird Courier, to provide airport-to-airport services for
courier, express and forwarding companies. More recently, it has been
developing a wholesale airport-to-door product.
Other leading airlines with owned or affiliated wholesale courier companies
include Japan Air Lines (Jupiter) and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways
(Linehaul Express).
The latter airline, for example, offers an on-board courier service on key
routes such as London/Hong Kong; a systemwide parcel/freight express service
offering late cut-off at point of origin, fast retrieval of cargo at airport
of destination and tracking/tracing; and an enhancement of that service to
include clearance and delivery to the door.
Meanwhile, a host of smaller airlines have developed other niches in the
international express market. UK-based Channel Express and Air Bridge
Carriers provide aircraft for express service operators moving traffic
between the UK and Continental Europe/Scandinavia. The latter has also
developed its own wholesale express division, Air Bridge Express (ABX).
Among the best-known of the forwarder-run express delivery operations in
Europe are the Eurapid system run by Swiss-based Danzas and the Pandalink
operation of US-based airfreight company Air Express International.
Eurapid is road-based, offering fixed-schedule 24/48/72-hour delivery
services throughout the European Community and EFTA countries. 'We basically
promote Eurapid as a faster alternative to normal road groupage services -
the key is the guaranteed delivery aspect,' said Danzas.
AEI's Pandalink operation comprises two basic products. The air-based 'Red'
service, offers 24/48-hour door-to-door delivery and incorporates a
straightforward consignment charge and rate per kilo tariff. The 'Blue'
service uses road transport to reduce costs at the expense of longer transit
times.
Scandinavian forwarding group ASG provides an intra-European express freight
service based on nightly freighters linking the UK, Continental Europe and
Scandinavia. 'Those air links enable us to offer next day delivery of
virtually any size of parcel or freight throughout Europe and Scandinavia
and before 7am delivery in the capital cities,' said Mr Jim Shortall,
managing director of ASG (UK).
In addition to competing with integrators for heavier freight traffic within
Europe, forwarders are also looking to work with airlines in longer-haul
express markets.
Forwarders say information technology systems enable them increasingly to
match the ability of the integrators to electronically track consignments
around the world.
And, say forwarders, they have greater flexibility than the integrators when
it comes to handling larger consignments.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (7): Barcoded for
speedy recognition - Tracking technology is becoming increasingly
sophisticated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN AN industry where speed and reliability are vital, courier and express
operators' consignment monitoring would make Arnold Schwarzenegger's tracker
robot Terminator feel at home.
Automatic identification technology, which can pinpoint a parcel in a
network, whether it is travelling to Telford or Timbuktu, has always
provided customers with reassurance that the carrier is in control. The
trend is towards enhancement of this system.
Millions have been spent in this and other information technology (IT)
areas, as companies seek to gain the technological edge in a competitive
industry squeezed by recession.
Tracking and tracing is a simple idea. Consignments are given a unique
barcode by which they can be followed through a distribution system.
Mick Linsell, systems director of the top player in the UK express parcel
market, Royal Mail Parcelforce, describes barcoding as 'the integral
efficiency product'.
Parcelforce, which claims a 30 per cent share in the market, has just
invested Pounds 3m in an international distribution centre, one component of
which is interfacing with track-and-trace systems.
A further multi-million pound investment is planned for an new automatic
sorting centres in the UK, which will integrate track-and-trace using the
barcode technology.
'My personal view on track-and-trace in the domestic operation is that
consignments should be delivered so quickly you don't have time to find out
where they are,' said Mr Linsell. 'The trend is not away from
track-and-trace, but the enhancement of it - more is being done with the
barcode information, and we are getting more functions out of our investment
and there are huge incremental benefits in speed and reliability.'
Another UK domestic parcel operator, Parceline, is investing Pounds 2.5m in
IT, including the integration of parcel tracking and billing operations.
Parceline's hub and technical services manager, Chris Ogg, said: 'Added
value through technology, which gives the comfort factor to customers, is
becoming a major issue as operators are fighting for the same clients in a
similar market.
'We have witnessed an emphasis on confirmation on proof of delivery
information, and are bolting on technology to our track-and-trace systems to
deal with it. One major advance is that we now have the ability to give full
image reproduction of a consignment for POD purposes.'
DHL is investing Pounds 7.5m in IT in the UK this year. It currently has
EasyShip On Line - a tracking and tracing advance for high-volume shippers,
which means these customers can now trace worldwide movement of consignments
from their own offices.
'Most customers are saying now they want to track more pieces, and they want
information on them more quickly,' said Charles Brewer, after-sales manager,
DHL International (UK). 'There is more anxiety in business in this current
economic climate, and demands are higher than in the past.
'The comfort factor is still very important for customers, especially when
they are involved in the just-in-time method of operation, which involves
regular stocking of empty shelves.'
DHL is also looking to another track-and-trace advance, which has nothing to
do with sophisticated technology - improvement in personal service. In
November, the company introduced a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week tracking and
tracing service, which means it can contact international colleagues to get
immediate information on a consignment.
Mr Brewer said the company was also recruiting staff with foreign languages,
to reduce the margin of error when tracing consignments overseas.
UK player Securicor Omega Express, which delivers 1.5m parcels a week, has
completed the first phase of a five-year Pounds 25m investment in IT, which
includes enhancement of tracking-and-tracing technology. Here again, the
comfort factor comes into play, in the form of Signline, a nationwide
confirmation-of-delivery system based on scanning the barcodes on all
consignments which customers ring in to use.
The company's systems manager, Phil Whitlock, commented: 'Without
technology, a carrier is going to lag behind. The main impetus is for
carriers to communicate billing and receiving.'
Australian express giant TNT is also re-equipping systems within the UK
operation, at a cost of between Pounds 2.6m and Pounds 3m.
TNT Express UK's general manager, domestic development, Nigel Barton, said:
'Not only are we bolting on to our track and trace, we are completely
re-writing our systems.
'What we are doing effectively, from a commercial point of view, is adding
value to get a competitive edge. Reliability is the key. . . The systems
also enable us to monitor our own internal quality, which is extremely
important if we are to give the best service to our customers.
'There is certainly more and more demand for information as companies look
to operators as an offshoot of their own business, rather than just a parcel
carrier. Customers tend to regard us as their own fleet.'
British Rail Red Star express parcel division spent Pounds 750,000 on a
special system, which gives customers the technology to track their own
consignments' progress through the distribution chain.
The system - known as TRAC - is PC-based and provides customers with a live
on-line link to the Red Star Parcels' mainframe computer. It gives on-line
proof of delivery, and generates an invoice and manifest. It is currently
being used by high-volume customers, which include IBM, and is updated every
three months at the cost of Pounds 15,000.
IBM's storage services manager, Brian Fisher, said the company had been
using Red Star for a number of years, and the paperwork system used before
TRAC had been messy.
'It has certainly tightened things up, and the additional control it gives
us, of knowing where a parcel is, is a positive advantage,' he said. 'We use
Red Star for overnight emergency service, which means it is vital for
customers to know where their consignment is, if for some reason it does not
arrive on time.
'We look to our carriers to give us a good service, and this is certainly an
enormous leap forward in those terms.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (5): On track for a
faster service - Operators have found it costly to develop pan-European
coverage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT moves by giant United States-based parcels carrier Federal Express to
pull out of all European domestic and regional operations highlight a more
general problem for the international express industry.
Basically, it centres on the desire of carriers to develop full pan-European
delivery systems in a market where the traffic volumes are generally not yet
sufficient to support their large and costly service infrastructures.
That shortfall between capacity and freight volumes has been particularly
evident in the air express sector. During the 1980s, leading operators such
as Federal Express, TNT, DHL, United Parcel Service (UPS) and Emery
Worldwide all built up their own dedicated air networks in Europe. But in
many cases, their aircraft were either under-utilised or carried freight at
rates well below those necessary to make such operations economically
viable.
With the advent of economic recession at the end of the 1980s serving to
accentuate those problems, express companies realised they could not afford
to go on running so many different air networks. Increasingly, they started
looking at sharing line-haul capacity in an attempt to reduce costs.
The first big move in that context came towards the end of last year when
Australian-based integrator TNT Express Worldwide announced the formation of
a joint venture with postal services organisation GD Net. As part of that
venture, the five post offices belonging to GD Net are now putting their
express traffic on TNT's European fleet of British Aerospace 146-QT
freighters.
TNT claims it is already seeing significant cost savings as a result of that
co-loading and other features of the joint venture. The company says that in
northern Sweden, for example, where the local post office is now delivering,
the unit cost of delivery has been halved. And similar savings are expected
in rural areas of Canada, Germany and France.
The TNT/GD Net venture and the subsequent demise of the Brussels-based
International Post Corporation linehaul system - which had been used by some
20 post offices - at the end of last year has also led to a general shake-up
and restructuring of other post office express distribution operations in
Europe.
'We are in a period of transition at the moment as the whole market waits to
see how the TNT/GD Net system develops,' commented the director and general
manager of Brussels-based wholesale organisation Air Bridge Express (ABX),
Richard Johnston.
ABX, a division of UK-based airline Air Bridge Carriers, last year signed a
contract with the UK Post Office to linehaul Datapost traffic all over
Europe and has other similar contracts with the Irish and Portuguese post
offices.
Less dramatic than the TNT/GD Net and Federal Express developments but also
very much a sign of the times was an agreement earlier this year between air
express organisation DHL and airfreight company Emery Worldwide to atlantic
airlift.
Apart from sharing air linehaul capacity, express companies are also now
paying greater attention to the development of road transport operations in
Europe. In fact, many industry observers believe the pan-European road
freight market, a business now reckoned to be worth around Pounds 14bn a
year, will soon become the main battleground for express delivery companies.
Some of the opening salvos have already been fired. Late last year, UPS
launched a ground-based European delivery operation which, it claimed,
offered rates 'between 25 and 40 per cent lower than those of other
carriers'. And TNT relaunched its European road operations with two new
services.
Express industry executives admit their increased interest in European road
service development has been prompted by both negative and positive factors.
On the negative side is the realisation that operating aircraft is now so
expensive that air express services are really only viable for carrying
genuine premium-rated traffic. Shipments which do not attract that sort of
rate should therefore be transferred to road vehicles.
More positively, express industry executives say many of their leading
customers have indicated that while fairly fast delivery times are
desirable, reliability is more important. A reliable road delivery at a
lower price than air express is often better suited to their needs.
Looking further ahead, certain express industry companies are also beginning
to give more serious consideration to replacing - or at least supplementing
 -some of their expensive intra-European air capacity with rail operations.
DHL, for instance, plans to re-introduce a nightly Paris/Brussels train link
in the autumn. The company suspended a trial operation at the end of January
because of problems with French customs over documentation procedures for
higher value dutiable goods and for economic reasons.
The six-wagon, 60-tonne capacity train used by DHL cost Dollars 11,000 to
run, about the same as a 12-tonne capacity aircraft on the same route. Now,
says DHL, it has resolved the Customs difficulties. That means it can put
more traffic on the train, so improving the economic viability.
Meanwhile, British Rail parcels delivery organisation Red Star is firming up
its plans for the opening of the Channel Tunnel next year.
First new development will involve a same-day service between London and
Paris/Brussels. City-to-city transit time will be around 3.5 hours, with the
full door-to-door movement projected to be five to six hours.
Looking further ahead, BR is considering the introduction of dedicated
parcel trains running overnight between London and Brussels. BR will run the
train as a wholesale operation for Red Star and other parcels industry
users.
Predictably, much of the express industry's European market development
effort has been focused on the European Community and EFTA countries.
However, larger companies have also been strengthening their presence in
eastern Europe.
Mr John Monaghan, general manager network development for TNT, said his
company planned to develop a 'mirror image' of its Western express
operations in eastern Europe. 'Our aim is to introduce on an increasing
scale, scheduled overnight movements to the east with same morning
deliveries,' he added.
Facts and figures on the actual present size of the eastern European express
market, as opposed to much hyped projections of potential future business,
are difficult to come by.
However, DHL estimates that as far as the air express sector is concerned,
daily total volumes for eastern Europe, inbound and outbound, carried by all
operators towards the end of last year, were only averaging around 12.65
tonnes.
Biggest individual market in that region, says DHL, is Hungary which was
averaging around three tonnes a day, followed by Yugoslavia (2.5 tonnes),
Poland (2.4 tonnes), the then Soviet Union (two tonnes) and Czechoslovakia
(1.7 tonnes).

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (4): Carriers
struggle for profits - The express market in the UK has long been
oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMAL withdrawal of the US parcels carrier Federal Express from the UK
domestic market provides further evidence of the continuation of fierce
competition in the sector.
According to management consultants Rickard Johnson, who have been involved
in courier and express parcel services for a number of years, combined
figures for the 10 largest carriers in the UK actually show a loss.
'The economics of delivery services are highly volume- dependent. Thus, many
operators have focused on volume growth as a way of reducing unit costs -
yet they remain unprofitable,' says Mr Andrew Johnson, a director of Rickard
Johnson.
However, while many of the leading carriers are struggling to achieve
profitability in the UK Mr Johnson points out that some of the smaller
players are still reporting attractive levels of profitability.
'Our research shows that many of the major express operators dissipate their
economies of scale in delivery in other areas while some smaller operators
achieve economies without the scale,' he adds.
Similar observations about the viability of smaller express companies are
made by senior executives from the UK's largest parcels carrier, the Royal
Mail's Parcelforce, which claims to handle more than 30 per cent of domestic
parcels traffic.
Mr Peter Child, Parcelforce marketing director, observes: 'Small carriers -
and by that I mean companies handling less than 1 per cent of the market -
now account for around 55 per cent of the urgent parcels market and 45 per
cent of the non-urgent sector. And there is now almost a pattern of the
smaller companies doing better than the big integrators.'
He made that comment in the light of the decision by Federal Express to pull
out of the UK market and other European sectors.
Predictably, competing carriers have welcomed the reduction in capacity
resulting from that move. Typical is the reaction of Mr Robin Davies,
general manager commercial and marketing for the Mayne Nickless group's
domestic parcels carrier Parceline.
'The express market in the UK has been oversubscribed for some time due to
the presence of major international operators and the low barriers of entry.
Therefore, the elimination of one particular major operator is to be
welcomed,' he comments.
Federal Express is the second of the world's four leading global integrators
to pull out of the UK domestic express market. Last autumn, DHL effectively
did the same by disposing of its UK overnight delivery company Elan through
a management buy-out.
That leaves TNT Express as the sole global 'big four' player on the domestic
British scene, although rumours persist that the industry giant United
Parcel Service (UPS) may be about to make its long-awaited move into the
market.
Whether or not UPS does,few industry observers believe the rationalisation
of the UK domestic parcels market will have finished. Mr Johnson of Rickard
Johnson believes that 'as the recession, the willingness of operators to set
prices in the next-day segment closer to those in the two-three day segment,
and the negotiating strength of buyers continue to drive down prices, there
will be more casualties.'
Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Parcelforce, agrees there could be
more rationalisation to come as many operators remain under pressure. He
points out that recession caused the next-day sector of the UK parcels
market to contract by some 20 per cent in the 1990-91 period and the
non-urgent sector, where recession began to be felt earlier, by 40 per cent
in the 1989-91 period.
'That left a lot of spare capacity. The withdrawal of Federal Express has
helped that situation a bit but there is still a lot of excess capacity
around,' he adds.
Meanwhile, established carriers in the UK parcels market are scrambling to
capture Federal Express's share.
The most immediate beneficiary is the market's second largest carrier,
Securicor Omega Express (SOE), which bought the US company's UK domestic
parcels business. The deal involves SOE paying Pounds 2.6m in cash for
goodwill and a further Pounds 4.5m in cash for other assets, including
dispatch and labelling systems.
SOE formally took over the running of the Federal Express old operations
from May 5 and has also become sole contractor for handling its
international traffic, except for an area roughly within the M25 London
orbital motorway area which will continue to be serviced directly by the US
parcels company.
Prior to its decision to pull out, the Federal Express domestic parcels
business turnover in the UK was running at something over Pounds 40m a year,
about 2.5 per cent of the market. SOE's turnover is around Pounds 208m,
representing 12 per cent of the market, some 2 per cent ahead of the third
largest operator, TNT Express.
Mr Pat Howes, SOE chief executive, says his company is expecting to pick up
as many as 40,000 additional parcels a day following the Federal Express
deal, a 10 per cent increase on its present figure of around 400,000.
Rival companies have launched a fierce marketing drive to capture a share.
Parcelforce claims to have picked up some Pounds 2m worth of extra business
in the first few weeks after the Federal Express pull-out was announced and
is negotiating for more.
'Customers don't make instant decisions on whether to change their carrier
so it will take a few months before we see who have been the real
beneficiaries of the FedEx withdrawal - but we definitely expect to be one
of them,' says Mr Child.
In the meantime, Parcelforce is moving to complete its operational
separation from Royal Mail. It plans to take over the full end-to-end
collection and delivery of its domestic premium next-day service Datapost by
March 1993. Hitherto, much of that work has been sub-contracted to Royal
Mail.
Parcelforce is also looking to take over direct control of some 80 per cent
of its standard three to five day parcels collection and delivery activities
by the same date. But it will continue to sub-contract some rural area
operations to Royal Mail.
A new five-year strategic development plan just announced by Parcelforce
includes planned investment of Pounds 250m. Part of that expenditure will
include the acquisition of some 1,500 new vehicles.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (3): Monopoly likely
to end soon - EC post offices may soon be facing more competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANINA WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAIL services around the world, once the monopoly of national post offices,
are set to be opened to more competition.
The hugely profitable UK Post Office is awaiting increased deregulation of
the Royal Mail while abroad a group of state-controlled post offices have
joined forces with private Australian express operator TNT.
Meanwhile, a long-awaited EC Green Paper on the future of the community
postal services, which has taken almost two years to compile, has
recommended gradual liberalisation of cross-border and direct mail services.
This is a significant softening of tone compared with earlier drafts which
recommended the removal of mail services from post office monopolies.
However, five state-owned post offices - three of them from member states -
went ahead with liberalisation of some services before the Green Paper was
published.
The administrations of Germany, the Netherlands, France, Sweden and Canada
formed a new group, GD Net, and embarked on a joint venture with a
subsidiary of TNT - TNT Express Worldwide - to handle their international
express traffic.
GD Net has taken a 50 per cent stake in the venture with the other half
owned by TNT. The new company is autonomous and managed independently of
both shareholders. It is also structured to allow other postal
administrations to join.
It is a marriage of the utmost convenience which gives the post offices the
opportunity to compete equally in an international express market worth
about Dollars 2.5bn.
TNT, who had been suffering in Europe from excessive competition, now have
guaranteed volumes within a high-fixed cost infrastructure. In addition,
they have benefited from a substantial cash injection into the venture by
the post offices.
Mr John Mullen, chief executive of TNT Worldwide Express, said: 'The current
level of losses in the industry were unsustainable. It was a worldwide
issue; we needed volume for fixed-cost structure and we needed partners to
develop a strategy - it had to be someone who could bring something to the
table.
'The post offices felt they desperately needed an integrated worldwide
structure to give them what no post office could have - a full end-to-end
chain.
'Ninety per cent of our customer base is corporate while 80 per cent of the
post offices' business comes from over the counter - the small-users market.
If you put the two together there is a lot of potential.
'Some post offices have reserved their position while others said they don't
intend joining. At the moment we are involved in discussions with the UK
post office.'
Thousands of words have already been written on what the EC Green Paper
might contain and it had been the source of intense wrangling in Brussels
between Sir Leon Brittan's competition directorate and the post and
telecommunications directorate.
Sir Leon had spoken of his commitment to full liberalisation of the
international and express postal services while the telecommunications
directorate took an entirely different view - giving support to arguments by
post offices against wholesale liberalisation.
The post offices feared that the broad reform which stripped them of their
monopoly rights meant they could not afford to maintain universal services.
The Green Paper does reiterate the right of each member state to apply for
'a more restrictive solution' under the EC treaty in the interest of
preserving a universal mail service.
Sir Leon, launching the Green Paper last week, said he would not rule out
the use of special Commission powers to break open national monopolies
without approval of member states.
He stressed that the Commission would move quickly to turn its discussion
document into legislation.
Mr Colin Mitchell, chairman of the UK-based Mail Express Services Users'
Association, said private operators had looked to the Green Paper for a
level playing field between post offices and non-monopoly suppliers in
competitive areas.
While the rest of Europe digests the implications of the Green Paper the UK
Post Office, widely regarded as the most efficient and the best in Europe,
is flexing its muscles for increased deregulation within the Royal Mail
which will remove its monopoly for letters costing under Pounds 1.
Research suggests that opening the postal service to competition would
create a Pounds 500m market for letter services.
Post Office chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson said he would welcome what he
describes as sensible competition and de-regulation and believes the
corporation is in a strong position to compete successfully within the new
market place.
Certainly, the Post Office itself is in good shape. During the past 10 years
it has contributed more than Pounds 700m to central government financing.
It is also true that no private operator could hope to match the sheer scale
of an organisation which handles around 60m letters a day.
The Post Office is also no stranger to handling competition - Parcelforce
and Royal Mail International compete against private operators for business.
However, the situation may not be so cut and dried.
Mirroring some European fears about opening up monopolies to increased
competition Mr Alan Tuffin, chairman of the Union of Communications Workers,
has warned that deregulation could mean the end to the universal service
with private operators taking the most profitable parts of the letters
business.
Mr Tuffin said: 'When this happens we will steadily fall into loss-making
decline which I believe will lead to cuts in services.'
The government has always been adamant that the universal service would be
retained and Sir Bryan said the Royal Mail would continue to give what he
describes as a top-class universal service to customers.
He dismissed the ideal of a free-for-all which would disadvantage rural and
outer urban areas.
'We have a national mandate and it is clearly against the customers'
interest - competition mustn't undermine that.'
Looking to the future, Sir Bryan believes the industry will move towards
more partnerships. He is negotiating with GD Net and said he was 'looking at
what is best for us and keeping my options open'.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (2): Range of
services widens - Logistics are still a problem across European borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING demand from multinational companies for fast, high-quality
international delivery performance is creating important new business
opportunities for the providers of express services.
Manufacturers using JIT (Just-In-Time) logistics systems, for example, like
the ability of leading express operators to control the total door-to-door
movement of goods. And organisations developing centralised warehousing
systems in Europe want fast delivery services to ensure they can serve the
whole market efficiently.
'There is a major move in Europe to centralise stocks and distribute parts
from one, strategically-located site,' confirms Mr David Burton, general
manager of intra-European express delivery company XP Express Parcel
Systems.
'What is now wanted is a means of making this transition, with all the
apparent cost savings which can result, without any decline in the level of
service a company can provide to its customers.'
Responding to those changes, express companies which initially made their
mark on the international distribution scene by offering a set menu of fast,
door-to-door delivery services, are now refocusing much of their development
effort on the provision of custom-designed services geared to meet the often
complex requirements of modern logistics operations.
Among the big four integrators, for example, TNT and Federal Express have
established separate logistics divisions; United Parcel Service has set up
logistics teams all over the world; and DHL has this month announced the
formation of an 'Interface' team to work alongside leading customers.
Meanwhile, Emery Worldwide, one of the pioneers of international integrated
door-to-door express delivery services, is looking to transplant its US
Warehouse Inventory System Express (WISE) into Europe. And airfreight
forwarder Air Express International (AEI) is improving its intra-European
express delivery system Pandalink to meet customers' expanded logistics
requirements.
The reasons for that sort of express industry development become clear as Mr
Tony Keating, head of European logistics for UPS, explains why that company
has established its logistics teams.
'More than 35 per cent of the total potential package market UPS is
interested in is in the hands of the multinationals. Having established
that, we decided we had to do more about meeting the requirements of those
customers,' he said.
As an example of the sort of operation which has evolved, Mr Keating points
to a contract UPS has with Fujitsu subsidiary Poqet. Basically, the latter
brings computers from Japan and peripherals from the US into the Netherlands
for distribution throughout Europe.
'We handle the computers from Japan using our Japanese joint venture company
UniStar and the peripherals from the US using our expedited service. Once
the products arrive in the Netherlands, we move them under bond to a bonded
facility at Tilburg in the south of the country,' says Mr Keating.
'European customers transmit their orders electronically to the company in
the US and they then transmit the information back to us in the Netherlands
by 0800 hours. We then pick and pack, undertake certain simple quality
control procedures, carry out the customs export procedures and then
distribute the products throughout Europe by air and ground service.'
TNT and Federal Express have adopted a slightly different approach to
meeting the logistics demands of multinational companies. The former, for
example, runs TNT Contract Logistics as a separate operation.
'We may use other parts of the TNT organisation such as air express, road
express or courier services but we are not asset-driven. By that I mean we
are not trying to fill up TNT's aircraft or trucks - if that happens, it is
purely coincidental,' comments Mr Brian Bolam, managing director of TNT
Contract Logistics Europe.
'We basically start with a blank sheet of paper for the design of each
contract and select what are the best options for the customer. And every
customer is different. You cannot make any assumptions. You have to examine
everything in detail.'
Federal Express, too, has established a separate division - Federal Express
Business Logistics. Included in that development has been the establishment
of 'Partsbank' international distribution centres in the UK, continental
Europe and the US. Basically, Partsbank customers buy on a 'pay-as-you-use'
basis from a menu of services which includes collection, storage, stock
control, customs, forwarding and airfreight, plus delivery.
Federal Express Business Logistics is also developing dedicated logistics
operations. Recently, for example, the company announced the formation of a
'global alliance' with fashion and furnishings group Laura Ashley. Included
in that operation will be the sourcing of goods from all over the world,
supply of products to stores and home delivery.
Latest logistics-related development from DHL involves the launch this month
of a programme called Interface. Mr David Stewart, general manager key
accounts for DHL International (UK), describes Interface as 'a concept we
have developed to encourage dialogue and debate with our existing and
potential customers on a number of levels'.
Giving examples of that last point, he cites Interface Arena which 'offers a
means to exchange views and ideas among industry peers'; Interface Team
which 'guides individual clients through the project management process';
and Interface Desk which 'gives selected client sites an enhanced level of
day-to-day customer service'.
Emery Worldwide launched its WISE operations in the US some five years ago
and also now has a WISE-type set-up in Amsterdam specifically to service the
Dutch market. The wider ranging general intra-European operation under
consideration may be based in Brussels.
'WISE depots provide customised inventory management and expedited delivery
programmes for high-value or time-sensitive goods,' explains Mr Roger W
Curry, Emery's president and chief executive officer.
But express industry executives concede that they still have a lot of work
to do to fully provide the sort of distribution systems many of their
customers are looking for. 'Euro-logistics is something we are going to have
to work at. Anyone who says it is already here is probably guilty of
believing their own press,' commented Mr Robert Kelly, marketing director
for Federal Express Business Logistics.
'Companies seeking to operate logistics across European national borders
still face real obstacles - for example, local laws and regulations,
language, culture, customs and practise. They are all very important issues
which will continue to have enormous influence on how a company operates.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (1): Packaged for
more profits - With the emphasis on greater profitability, the courier and
express industry is now undergoing a rationalisation after a decade of
phenomenal expansion. Increasing demand for more sophisticated delivery
services, a need for greater security and environmental concerns are also
straining the cost base

A DECADE of expansion at almost any price for the courier and express
industry during the 1980s has now been firmly replaced by a strong focus on
bottom-line performance.
The harsh reality of increasing losses is forcing many companies -
international and domestic - to scale back ambitious network development
plans and pursuit of ever-larger traffic volumes to achieve better
profitability.
Increasing demand from customers for higher quality and more sophisticated
delivery services is putting an even greater strain on the cost base of many
courier and express companies. Issues such as security and environmental
concerns are also having an impact on costs and profitability.
Meanwhile, plans to liberalise the UK postal industry and that of the
European Community as a whole could substantially change market conditions
for couriers and other companies handing express parcels and document
traffic.
The best example of the rationalisation of the international express
industry was the decision, announced earlier this year, of US parcels
carrier Federal Express to pull out of all European domestic and regional
activities.
Reasons for the decision were not hard to find. In the quarter to the end of
February this year, Federal Express incurred international operating losses
of USDollars 387m (Dollars 126m excluding one-off European restructuring
charges) on revenues of Dollars 595m. That compared with a loss of Dollars
71m on international revenues of Dollars 672m for the same quarter of the
previous fiscal year.
Few express industry observers expect the Federal Express pull-out to mark
the end of rationalisation on the global scene. Mr John Mullen, chief
executive of GD Express Worldwide, the new joint venture organisation set up
this year by TNT Express Worldwide and five postal authorities, believes
there is only room for two or three global integrators at the most. 'We are
now getting nearer to that situation but there is probably still some more
rationalisation to come,' he said.
Much of the express industry's rationalisation has so far involved moves to
share expensive aircraft capacity. However, leading express industry
executives believe that, in Europe at least, the next round of changes could
well focus on the road transport side of the business.
Meanwhile, TNT Express Worldwide claims it is already seeing significant
cost savings as a result of its joint venture with GD Net, the express
org-anisation set up by the post offices of Sweden, the Netherlands, France,
Germany and Canada. For a start, the additional traffic is helping to fill
up spare capacity on its 20-strong fleet of British Aerospace 146-QT jet
freighters.
TNT says overall traffic volumes from the five post offices belonging to GD
Net are roughly equivalent to the European volumes of its former courier
organisation TNT Skypak. 'On some routes, we will without doubt be putting
on extra aircraft,' said a TNT spokesman. Still to be decided is whether the
UK Post Office will join the TNT/GD Net organisation or seek alternative
ways of developing its international express delivery service.
A decision had been expected by now, but Mr Peter Howarth, managing director
of the UK Post Office parcels organ-isation Parcelforce, said a number of
options were still under consideration, including the GD Express Worldwide
venture.
He said Parcelforce may opt to work with only one partner or with several
different ones. And they could be other postal authorities or private sector
companies. A final decision is expected by July.
The emphasis on reducing costs and improving profitability now evident in
the international express industry, is just as apparent in the UK domestic
sector.
Mr Colin Millbanks, chief executive of Mayne Nickless group carrier
Parceline, claims his company has deliberately not chased volume at any
price and as a result has remained in profit since November 1990.
'Costs have been held at the levels of 12 months ago, which in real terms
means a reduction. This will have a dramatic effect on our bottom-line
performance for the financial year ending June 1992,' he said.
Another trend in UK domestic and international express sectors is that
customers are demanding more sophisticated services. On the international
front, this has led to big global integrators such as TNT, Federal Express,
DHL and United Parcel Service establishing separate divisions or management
teams to concentrate on developing wide-ranging logistics services for
multinational organ-isations.
Other express operators are following similar paths. US-based Emery
Worldwide, for instance, has just announced that it will expand its
Warehouse Inventory System Express (WISE) depot programme in North America
to provide customers with three levels of service for time-critical
shipments, including a two-hour turnaround service for immediate delivery
needs. The company is also looking to expand its WISE operations in Europe.
The pressure on domestic express companies to expand the scope of their
services is highlighted by Securiguard group parcels carrier City Link. Mr
David Kennard, managing director, says that as many companies are forced to
rethink their operating hours - starting earlier or working round-the-clock
 -demand is growing for faster and more flexible delivery systems.
He also says that in an increasingly competitive business climate, companies
are attaching far greater value to the supply of information. 'They want
more management information from their express carriers to enable them, for
example, to analyse expenditure by departments and service levels used,' he
says
These sort of requirements, at the domestic and international levels, mean
courier and express companies are continually having to invest in new
information technology. Increasingly, this means using EDI (electronic data
interchange).
However, this creates two problems for the courier and express industry,
claim operators. First, many customers are unsure exactly what they really
want in terms of information technology. Second, the reluctance of customers
to pay for it means the main cost burden falls on the express operators.
Another problem is the continuing uncertainty over moves to establish new
rules for mail and other postal service operations in the European
Community.
The European Commission last week published its long-awaited Green Paper,
which puts considerable emphasis on the need for community-wide standards
for basic postal services. But the Commission has decided that some EC
postal sectors should still be reserved for the postal authorities and
suggests gradual liberalisation of cross-border services.
Meanwhile, the UK Post Office is planning to offer discounts to private
companies who want to consolidate and trunk their domestic mail. UK Post
Office chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson indicated earlier this year that a
general framework for such arrangements was expected to be in place by early
summer.
Initially, the Post Office is likely to offer discounts to large users who
trunk their own mail direct to the postal centre handling the final delivery
of that traffic. But such discounts may subsequently also be offered to
third parties acting as consolidators for the collection, sorting and
trunking of mail.
Under the general Post Office monopoly on mail services, private carriers
have to charge a minimum of Pounds 1 per item for their deliveries. Mr
Robert Andrews, a director of parcels carrier Securicor Omega Express, told
an industry conference earlier this year that research suggested a reduction
of the monopoly limit to 75p or 50p was 'unlikely to cause sufficient shift
of first class letter traffic from Royal Mail to tempt current express
service companies to put the profitability of their core business at risk'.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (16): Fees down, rewards still high
 -Andrew Freeman explains why global custody is in vogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT years, international banks have become increasingly enamoured of a
business they long regarded as a necessary evil.
Global custody, a cross-border securities settlement and administration
product, was traditionally seen as an extension of the back-office functions
banks offered to their investment clients. Now, with balance sheets groaning
under the pressure of provisions against loans gone bad, custody is in
vogue.
The reason is simple enough. Custody is a fee-earning business with a
relatively stable client base. The banks' income is derived partly from an
annual charge based on the size of the assets under custody, but the bulk of
custody revenues is earned from customers' activity. Custody requires
minimal capital, although it does require continuous investment in
technology.
Small wonder, then, that the market for custodial services has grown in
parallel with cross-border activity by investors. A recent survey by
InterSec, a US consultancy, suggested that the world's largest pension funds
will have Dollars 780bn (Pounds 437bn) of foreign assets by 1995, rising to
Dollars 2,000bn by 2003.
If that extrapolation is correct, the pool of foreign assets will have grown
by a hundredfold in a mere 25 years. As funds have sought investment
opportunities overseas, they have turned to their custodians to provide
essential support networks.
There is another reason for custody's new-found popularity among banks.
After the stockmarket crash of October 1987, senior bankers became concerned
for the first time about the risks of systemic failure of the world's
settlement systems. They realised that the smooth flow of financial and
securities transactions is crucial to the security of their business.
Leading think-tanks, notably the Group of Thirty, studied clearing and
settlement practices and discovered that, in many markets, they were
woefully inadequate. The G30's recommendations and timetable for improved
settlement efficiency were widely adopted after its influential report three
years ago.
Meanwhile, custody has become much more competitive in the last five years.
Prices have been squeezed to the point where custodians now describe the
basic product as a commodity.
Fees have come down sharply as the bigger providers have used their muscle
to put pressure on vulnerable competitors. Clients, too, have become much
more aggressive in demanding a better service. Custody has not turned out to
be the dream product some bankers predicted.
However, the rewards from activities associated with custody can still be
huge. In particular, the commercial banks have always made good returns from
handling the foreign exchange transactions required whenever a fund buys or
sells foreign assets.
But there are also big returns available to the banks which use their
clients' custodial assets for stock lending. In return, the custodian is
allowed to lend stock and keep a share of the income. That might sound
unexciting, but returns on lending in some of the smaller securities markets
can be as high as three percentage points. Some large and sophisticated
customers have sufficient muscle, in the shape of their assets, to demand
custody virtually for free.
That is the type of arrangement thought to underlie the appointment by the
two huge Californian state employees retirement funds of State Street. State
Street, which has vast assets under administration, won the business away
from the rival Boston Company with a bid significantly lower than any
competitor managed.
Mr Marshall Carter, president of State Street, told a recent conference that
custody has evolved from the days when it offered relatively simple services
like safekeeping, settlement, corporate actions, income collection and tax
reclamations.
'Today, services must include decision support such as consolidated
reporting, performance measurement, risk analysis and analytics. We must be
able to demonstrate to our customers that we can help them reduce risk,' he
said.
At the same time, it is arguable that the banks have not been particularly
successful at developing the custody product. Because it essentially
involves the processing of information flows, custody has been a natural
beneficiary of the revolution in computer technology.
In practice, banks have struggled to keep pace with that revolution and have
often been saddled with expensive systems which are out of date soon after
they are installed.
It is possible that specialist IT companies will seek to move into the
commodity end of the custody business and drive prices even lower. Banks
which rushed to swell the ranks of custodians in the late 1980s could be
forced into embarrassing retreats.
That risk is increased by the fact that some of the world's largest
institutions are not yet active competitors in custody. The Japanese banks,
for example, have been notably slow to look beyond their domestic market.
Were they to do so, their assets and their ability to learn from others'
mistakes would make them formidable competitors.
In addition, the custodian banks face a dilemma over the development of
three international institutions which, ironically, they own: Swift, which
runs the global interbank message system, and the two international clearing
houses, Euroclear and Cedel. Each of them has the business framework and
expertise to become a key player in global custody.
year Swift will allow fund managers to become users of its system, opening
up the possibility of eventual partial disintermediation of the custodian
banks.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (15): The time of their life -
Richard Lapper on the banks' increasing sale of insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS FROM Belgium and Switzerland are the latest European entrants into the
booming field of bancassurance or Allfinanz - the French and German terms
which describe the way banks are increasingly selling insurance to their
customers.
Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert, the country's second largest bank, which
has been courted by insurers such as Royal Belge and Internationale
Nederlanden Groep, announced in March that it would establish a new
subsidiary to sell motor and household insurance; while, in January, Swiss
Bank Corporation (SBC) unveiled a joint venture with Zurich Insurance, in
which each company will sell products and services of the other through
their existing branches and offices.
The launches are the latest of a string of ventures in which banks and
insurers are taking advantage of the deregulation of the continent's
financial services industry to tread on each other's turf.
The pace of rationalisation has been remarkable in some countries, including
the Netherlands. Nationale Nederlanden and NMB Postbank created one of
Europe's biggest bank insurers following their merger early in 1991.
The ventures have not been entirely trouble-free, but bankers in the US and
Japan - where regulations preventing link-ups are still very much in place -
are casting envious glances in the direction of Europe. Increasingly,
commentators are recognising that, from a banking point of view, the logic
of bancassurance is inexorable.
Allfinanz, or the 'integration of banking and insurance at the customer
level', is one of 'the most striking developments to have hit the financial
industry worldwide in modern times,' said a recent survey by the Lafferty
Group, the Dublin-based research group (The Allfinanz Revolution - winning
strategies for the 1990s).
Lafferty believes that European banks are now positioned to take between 20
per cent and 40 per cent of the market.
'There can no longer be debate about whether banks have a role to play in
the provision of life assurance,' Lafferty concluded decisively. 'Evidence
from around the world points to the fact that banks are now not merely
marginal participants in the sector, but are becoming increasingly important
in both the manufacture and distribution of life assurance.'
Salomon Brothers, the securities house, agrees. Citing the examples of
Credit Agricole, TSB, Deutsche Bank, Rabobank and Monte dei Paschi, Salomon
says: 'The big winners in the European distribution sweepstakes are a
limited number of major banks that have found the right management formula
for success.'
In the UK, National Westminster and Abbey National opted to form bank
insurance subsidiaries last year. NatWest, which had developed links with a
number of companies as an independent intermediary, has formed a new joint
venture with Clerical Medical, in which it owns a 92.5 per cent stake. Abbey
National, which had linked up in a joint venture with Friends Provident,
took over Scottish Mutual.
Salomon says in a recent note, European Insurance Distribution, that a
standard formula for success is 'a captive insurer staffed by recruited
professionals (which) provides product, training and support while the bank
network exploits the active or arm customer portion of its customer
population.'
Underpinning the rationale is increasing competition within the financial
services sector. European banks have seen operating margins get much tighter
over the last 10 years. In particular, as interest-bearing current accounts
have become more common, banks have faced a sharp increase in the cost of
their deposits.
Banks have also had to respond to the impact of the gradual ageing of
Europe's population, which has seen a greater proportion of the continent's
savings invested in the longer-term investments in which life insurers
specialise, at the expense of bank accounts.
Competitive pressures - in part, stemming from deregulation - have also
pegged back the rate at which banks can make profits from their core lending
activities, forcing banks to seek ways to increase productivity by making
greater use of their networks of bank branches.
Banks have also realised, however, that their branch networks represented an
opportunity. Early examples of bank assurance showed that life assurance
salesforces could achieve many more sales by working with a bank's captive
customer base. While insurers convert on average one out of 15 sales
prospects - what the industry calls 'warm leads' - into a policy, banks are
now converting into policies as many as five out of 20 prospects.
The successful experience of bank-owned life assurance subsidiaries - such
as Lifetime, the Bank of Ireland subsidiary, which converts one out of two
referrals into a policy, and Deutsche Leben, the subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank, which claims a one-in-four conversion rate - have underlined the value
of the bank customer base.
'Banks have found that branch-based customers represent an extraordinary
asset - of warm prospects for life insurance products,' says Lafferty. 'Life
insurers, on the other hand, have been forced to the shocking realisation
that their policyholders have more of a relationship with the intermediary
than with the company whose products they are buying.'
The development poses some awkward dilemmas for insurers, While banks have
proved to be adept at selling simpler insurance products, in France and
Germany - where insurers Union des Assurances de Paris and Allianz have
entered into joint-venture deals with BNP and Dresdner Bank - insurance
agents have been less successful at selling motor loans and mortgages.
Increasingly aware of the value of their distribution networks, banks are
unlikely to cede control of joint ventures established with insurers.
Indeed, talks between BAT Industries - which has two insurance subsidiaries,
Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar - broke down over this issue.
Spain's largest insurer, Mapfre, has addressed the problem by setting up its
bank from scratch and offering banking services from its hundreds of small
insurance agency offices.
But few European insurers have such a dense network of branches, and
ultimately acquisition may their only option - though, on cost grounds, that
could rule out all but the continent's biggest insurers.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (12): Thun closure raises questions
 -Ian Rodger looks beneath the pall that lies over the Swiss banking
community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS, in many respects, been a great year for the Swiss banking industry,
with most of the leading universal and private banks scoring handsome profit
increases.
But the decision by Moody's, in January, to remove its triple-A rating from
the long-term bonds of Credit Suisse, and, earlier this month, to do
likewise to Swiss Bank Corporation, has cast a pall over the whole
community.
One of Moody's main arguments was that the liberalisation of Swiss financial
markets in recent years was putting the stability of the banks' earnings
into question.
Certainly, liberalisation has already had a significant impact on banks at
all levels, and there are indications of more shocks and radical changes to
come.
The biggest shock last year was the forced closure of a regional bank, Spar
und Leihkasse Thun, something no one ever expected to see in Switzerland.
While the Thun bank was very small, with assets of SFr1.1bn (Pounds 411m),
its failure revealed many problems in the Swiss banking system arising from
liberalisation.
It undermined the assumption that one of the big universal banks would
always be a rescuer of last resort in such cases. Second, it showed that
traditional supervision procedures were no longer adequate in an era when
even small banks were free to compete as aggressively as they liked in
various financial markets. And it highlighted the need for consolidation in
a sector where 185 banks had combined assets of only SFr86.1bn, roughly a
third of those held by Union Bank of Switzerland alone.
It also suggested that Swiss banks, long accustomed to easy money, were ill
prepared to cope with the tougher conditions imposed by the falling
international popularity of the Swiss franc.
These problems have manifested themselves in different ways on different
sectors. The big universal banks, for example, have seen their balances of
traditional, low-cost savings deposits decline as customers headed for
higher yielding money market instruments.
Together with the private banks and the bigger cantonal banks, they have
also suffered from squeezed margins on securities trading since the
elimination of fixed commissions at the beginning of last year.
The private banks have had to sharpen their investment management skills,
realising that their Swiss names, courtesy, location and currency were no
longer adequate to attract and hold deposits from the world's rich
individuals. Better service comes at a cost, and most banks have been
trimming staff. Last year, two famous old Geneva names, Darier and Hentsch,
felt the need to merge, and others are likely to follow.
As costs rise, private sector banks have pointed angry fingers at the
cantonal banks, whose public sector owners would rather endure low returns
than face angry voters. But cantonal and regional banks have been losing
market share steadily to the universal banks, especially in their core
business of mortgage lending, and are fighting for survival.
Mr Robert Studer, chief executive of UBS, startled a Zurich audience in
March by predicting that 100 of the country's 630 banks could disappear in
the next 10 years.
Two weeks ago, Mr Hans Dieter Vontobel, chief executive of Bank J Vontobel,
a leading Zurich-based investment bank, retorted sharply, saying that power
in Switzerland's financial markets was already too concentrated in the hands
of the big three.
Liberalisation should not be pursued so vigorously as to reduce still
further the degree of competition, Mr Vontobel argued. But he agreed that
rationalisation in the next few years would be substantial, possibly
eliminating 20,000 jobs.
Mr Studer thought that one of the big three might even decide to give up
retail banking in the foreseeable future, because profits were so thin in
this area.
All this, plus the uncertainty over Switzerland's future relations with the
European Community, would seem to provide more than enough reasons to
question the stability of Swiss banks in the next few years.
The big banks argue that they are almost certain to emerge stronger from the
process, and this is probably true. But they also admit there could be a
long period during which many dying institutions lunge desperately at
business, keeping margins very low for everyone.
Thus, it is just as well that they have finally got their international
business in order. While many of the world's banks are still licking their
wounds from their misadventures in global banking over the past few years,
the big three Swiss banks have sparkled.
Aided by their strong balance sheets, and no doubt also by the retreat of
troubled Japanese and US banks from the key international markets, the big
three have found profitable pickings in international lending, foreign
exchange dealings and fund management.
Credit Suisse said 30 per cent of its net income came from foreign
operations; but Bank Julius Baer, in a recent study, argues that the figure
would be more like 66 per cent if income from the group's Luxembourg based
mutual funds, which are managed from Zurich, were included. UBS said the
foreign contribution to its earnings last year tripled to 25 per cent.
SBC said that its association with the derivative specialists, The O'Conner
Partnerships in Chicago, in which it invested about SFr90m a little over a
year ago, yielded net income of SFr107m last year, but overall foreign
earnings were depressed by large provisions on bad debts.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (13): Still towering above the rest
 -Profile: Deutsche Bank, whose 'feel good' factor has been under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWIN towers of the Deutsche Bank headquarters are no longer the tallest
buildings in Frankfurt. They are eclipsed by the recently built Messeturm
nearby. But metaphorically speaking, the bank still towers over the German
financial and industrial establishment.
This is despite the fact that Deutsche Bank's profits grew more slowly than
those of Germany's other big banks last year, and that analysts were
disappointed with an 18 per cent rise in total operating expenses. Trading
results alone helped the bank report total operating profits up 17 per cent
to DM5.97bn (Pounds 2bn) - strip out these, and underlying profits only rose
by 6 per cent.
Other banks - notably Commerzbank, which increased its non-trading profits
by 30 per cent last year - may have achieved better growth rates. But this
hides the fact that Deutsche and its subsidiaries managed to transfer to
their reserves more than the total transfers made by Commerzbank, Dresdner
Bank and the two big Bavarian banks (Vereinsbank and Hypobank) altogether.
The figure exceeded DM1bn, compared with the total sum of DM800m put away by
its four nearest competitors.
These transfers feed directly through to a bank's ability to take on board
new lending, meaning that the Deutsche Bank, unlike its smaller competitors,
has no current need to hold an expensive rights issue. It beats the other
big German banks hands down in terms of capital strength, too, with around 6
per cent of Tier 1 equity capital and 11 per cent capital altogether. Of the
big three banks, it was the only one to increase its dividend for last year.
Add in its network of shareholdings in Germany's largest companies
(including a 28 per cent stake in Daimler Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
group, and 10 per cent of Allianz, Europe's largest financial services
institution) and a market capitalisation of in excess of DM30bn. It is, in
the words of Mr Keith Brown, at Morgan Stanley, in London 'an animal all on
its own, a major industrial holding company, with immense financial
strength.'
It is also, as Mr Brown puts it, 'the ultimate feel-good bank.' There is
wide respect for the quality of the bank's management among international
investors 'who feel good whatever the bank does,' says Mr Brown, even if
this is at the expense of reported profits, as in 1990 when profits fell as
the bank made aggressive provisions against its exposure to the former
Soviet Union. The following year the competitors were obliged to follow
suit.
Mr Brown notes that, on a two-year view, net profits have shown only modest
growth, and earnings per share have actually declined. But investors appear
unconcerned and the shares still sit on a premium rating, yielding 60 per
cent of the market yield and sitting on an earnings multiple of 20 per cent
more than the market. This makes the shares expensive by comparison with
those of the other big banks, but investors appear willing to pay the price
of greater quality earnings.
It is true that the bank did not induce its usual 'feel-good' response when
it reported its figures for 1991 at the beginning of April: close
examination of the results revealed a sharp and unexpected increase in
costs, predominantly in connection with the bank's aggressive expansion in
the eastern part of Germany. The disappointment felt by investors was not
keen enough to make a dent in the bank's rating.
Like the other German banks, Deutsche seems set to benefit from another year
of strong loan demand at home, mainly tied to recovery and investment in the
east of the country.
Overseas markets already account for a quarter of Deutsche's total business
 -a share which is likely to show as the bank takes advantage of the
weakness of its American and Japanese rivals. North America, watch out - at
a press conference in New York this month, Deutsche declared its intention
to expand aggressively in the US capital markets and private banking.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (14): 'A job to make anyone mature'
 -Managing bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES MAY be hard for British companies, but one banker, Mr Bernard
Bradford, deputy head of advances at National Westminster, the second
largest UK bank, has never had so much work to do.
'This is my third recession and it is the worst in living memory. I don't
plan to see a fourth recession myself,' says Mr Bradford, at the offices in
the King's Cross district of London where he and a staff of around 200,
handle cases of customers who have become insolvent.
Mr Bradford will not give any numbers, but he concedes that there has been a
massive increase in the last three years in the number of cases in his
charge. Last year, NatWest chalked up Pounds 1.4bn of bad debts on its
commercial and personal lending in the UK, up from Pounds 655m in 1990.
Tottering corporate giants are handled by a small team in the 32-storey
NatWest Tower headquarters in the City of London, headed till last month by
Mr Derek Plummer. Other cases go on to be handled by Mr Bradford and the
teams under him at King's Cross and in other parts of the country.
'My portfolio is not 100 per cent provided for,' he explains, 'because we
have quite a lot of cases in which there is security against the lending.'
There are usually two things which need to be done immediately: first, find
out more about the company concerned and how it got into trouble and
secondly build up a better relationship between bank and manager.
'The chances are that relations between a branch manager and the company are
not at their best by the time a company comes our way, so we do try to
create a new relationship.'
Creating a good working relationship is very important. Mr Bradford's staff
are told that they must be sympathetic and humane at all times, and that
they must never forget that they are dealing with people in trouble. Some
staff handling troubled companies are still in their twenties,but: 'A spell
working with us makes anyone mature fast.'
Credit-watch staff must be trained to cope with all sorts of emotional
situations, ranging from aggression and abuse to heart-rending tears. There
is emphasis on finding innovative solutions. NatWest does not want staff to
emerge from credit-watch work too scared by what they have seen ever to lend
another penny.
On the other hand, it does not strive to keep companies alive which are not
truly viable. 'We do not intend to defer the collapse of a company if it is
inevitable,' says Mr Bradford.
The success rate is fairly high. Only about one third of the companies in
trouble end up in liquidation. Identifying the ones with a reasonable
prospect of recovery depends on understanding why they have gone wrong.
'You tend to find that companies about to get into difficulties have little
understanding of how serious their position is,' says Mr Plummer.
'They always believe that, with just a little more help with their cash
flow, they will get through their troubles.'
Signs of impending trouble which may trigger a branch manager or regional
director to take action and put a company on credit watch include: pressure
on a company's overdraft; a sudden fall in its turnover; a flood of status
enquiries about the customer; and repeated customer requests to stop payment
on cheques. Any of these will get a company's account watched closely from
an early stage in its troubles.
The average company will have debts of around Pounds 500,000. Finding out
just how it came to be unable to meet its commitments is then NatWest's
second main task.
When the accountants go in to a company in trouble, they almost always find
that its records are in a mess. 'It is a pretty harsh view to take, but at
the root of every company's troubles is management failure,' says Mr
Bradford.
At this point the bank assesses its options, ranging from immediate closure
to a debt into equity conversion. A support and monitoring operation, which
may last for up to two or three years, will get under way in hopeful cases.
'We think very carefully about what the bank is doing. We don't want to
increase its exposure, but it is in our mutual interest for our customers'
businesses to prosper,' says Mr Bradford.
Is the UK recession, and the flood of insolvent companies created by it,
ending? 'There have been some straws in the wind in the last two months. The
receivership figures for the first quarter of the year were down. Perhaps we
are at last starting to turn the corner.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (10): Life gets tougher in France -
Alice Rawsthorn looks beyond a disappointing results season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THESE DAYS there is a somewhat subdued tone to the grand old banking halls
straddling the streets around Boulevard Haussman in Paris.
France's banks may have been spared the same ravages of recession that have
haunted their counterparts in the US and the UK, but they have just emerged
from a second successive year of fierce pressure on profits and a worrying
rise in bad debts.
When the big French banks unveiled their 1991 results this spring, their
outpourings did not make pleasant reading. Paribas, the prestigious
investment bank, began by announcing its first ever loss, of FFr184m (Pounds
18.6m). Credit Lyonnais confirmed its critics' worst suspicions about its
aggressive expansion in the late 1980s by disclosing a decline in net
profits from FFr3.7bn to FFr3.2bn after doubling client risk provisions to
FFr9.5bn.
Societe Generale struck a brighter note by returning to profits growth,
after a fall in 1990, as did Banque Nationale de Paris. But neither group
managed to return to the same level of profits as in 1989, their last year
of growth.
The performance of the smaller banks was equally lacklustre. France's banks
managed to increase their collective net profits by just 2 per cent to
FFr15.23bn in 1991, according to the Association Francaise des Banques a
fall in real terms. The main reason was a steep increase in provisions of
nearly 22 per cent to FFr38.4bn.
'Last year was pretty tough for the French banks,' said Mr Sasha
Serafimovski, European banking analyst for Morgan Stanley. 'Their position
is not nearly as bad as that of the British or the Americans, but life for
them is getting tougher and tougher.'
The outlook for 1992 is little better. The French economy ought to improve,
provided there is a reduction in interest rates this autumn, which will not
only alleviate the pressure on the banks but should also provide a sorely
needed boost to demand for credit.
But the French banks still face fierce competition in some sectors of their
domestic market, notably deposits, where the government's SICAV scheme has
siphoned cash away from the banks.
The investment banks face continuing competition from the international
concerns that are continuing to expand in France. Morgan Stanley of the US,
Nomura of Japan and the UK's Kleinwort Benson have all recently announced
plans to extend their banking or broking operations in Paris.
Meanwhile, the retail banks are haunted by the French post office's plans to
start issuing cheques. The post office, helped by its huge network, could
become a daunting competitor as the AFB has recognised by mounting a
campaign against its plans.
Further, the banks seem set for yet another year of hefty provisions, given
that there is no sign of a fall in the rate of French business failures, nor
of a recovery in the property market to which some banks, notably Credit
Lyonnais, are heavily exposed. And, although the litany of international
corporate horror stories seems to be abating, there will almost certainly be
enough multinational traumas this year to add to their problems in France.
However, the French banks have made progress on some fronts, notably in cost
control. Credit Lyonnais, for instance, managed to offset its difficulties
with bad debts by the impressive performance of its restructured and
rationalised French retail network. Both BNP and Credit Commercial de France
(CCF), one of the leading private sector banks, managed to keep their cost
increases in France beneath inflation.
'The French banks have done very well at controlling costs,' said Ms Susan
Sternglass, European banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'They have also
managed to avoid the dramas of the massive job losses in the UK and the US.
The French have taken a more moderate approach by gradually shedding staff
through early retirement and relocation programmes.'
Such initiatives augur well for the future, given that, even after the
French economy recovers, the level of competition in French banking seems
set to get even more ferocious. Meanwhile, France's banks are still
struggling to strike a balance between the parallel pressures of their old
roles as state-controlled institutions and the commercial constraints of
operating in international banking.
This dilemma is most acute for the state-controlled banks, notably BNP and
Credit Lyonnais. But the legacy of government ownership affects all the
French banks. For instance, they are not allowed to charge their personal
customers for cheques given that owning a cheque book is seen as a citizen's
right in France.
The links between the state and the banking sector have lessened in recent
years. BNP and Credit Lyonnais still take large stakes in state-controlled
companies which, or so most banking analysts suspect, they would not have
done without the 'encouragement' of the French government. This is not,
however, entirely to their disadvantage. Credit Lyonnais financed much of
its controversial expansion by expanding its equity through such deals.
Moreover both banks claim that their links with the government are not as
strong as in the past.
Those links are likely to be even weaker in the future. The privatisation of
Societe Generale was seen as the beginning of the end of the era of state
ownership. The socialist government has already identified the insurers as
candidates for its partial privatisation policy. The banks may be next. Most
observers suspect that sooner or later both BNP and Credit Lyonnais will
join Societe Generale in the private sector.
In the meantime, the government's influence over BNP and Credit Lyonnais is
slowly being eroded by the commercial disciplines of modern banking.
'The reality of life is that the need to comply with international capital
standards is much more important to a bank than what the state tells it to
do,' said Ms Sternglass. 'The market is slowly taking over - even in
France.'

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (11): Risk and Mr Haberer - Profile:
Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN TEN years time, if the markets favour him, Haberer may be hailed as a
genius and the rest of us will look like idiots,' said one prominent Paris
banker to the FT, this time last year. 'But in the meantime, he gives me
gooseflesh.'
Less then a year later, gooseflesh looks like a rather mild reaction to the
plight of Credit Lyonnais, one of the biggest and by far the most ambitious
of France's banks, and its chairman, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer. At the time,
Credit Lyonnais' main problem was Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian
businessman with whom it was locked in a legal fight over the future of
MGM-Pathe, the stricken Hollywood movie studio.
The Parretti problem has since almost paled beside all the other traumas
that have developed around Credit Lyonnais. It won the legal battle over
MGM, but now faces the gargantuan task of salvaging the studio.
It has also been hit by heavy losses on loans to the late Robert Maxwell; on
La Cinq, the television channel which collapsed this spring; and VEV, the
troubled French textile group. It is also the second largest European
creditor of Olympia &amp; York, the precarious Canadian property group, although
its O&amp;Y loans are secured.
Credit Lyonnais totted up the cost of last year's bad debts in its 1991
results which were published last month. It was forced to make provisions of
FFr9.6bn (Pounds 972m), thereby reducing net profits from FFr3.7bn in 1990
to FFr3.1bn in 1991.
Mr Haberer's many critics in France have hailed the 1991 figures as proof of
the failure of his grandiose plan to turn Credit Lyonnais into a 'universal
bank' - with a wide range of international banking interests and extensive
industrial investments - along the lines of Deutsche Bank, in Germany.
Deutsche Bank, claim the critics, owes its structure to its roots in the
post-war reconstruction of western Germany. By the time Credit Lyonnais
began its expansion towards the end of the 1980s, it was too late and too
expensive to construct a universal bank.
The performance of Credit Lyonnais' loan portfolio over the last year or so
has seemed to justify the critics' concern. Whenever a new corporate horror
story has unfolded, Credit Lyonnais has been high up the list of creditors;
although it should be noted that its provisions as a proportion of loans -
roughly 1.6 per cent last year - are still low by international standards.
Other aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy have been more successful. The French
retail banking network, the original base of the business, has fared well in
an increasingly competitive market after stringent restructuring, as have
the recent acquisitions in other countries, notably in Spain and Italy.
Altus, the French banking subsidiary bought from the Thomson electronics
group in 1989, produced an impressive profit last year, as did the US junk
bond portfolio.
In spite of these successes, Mr Haberer's critics claim he has taken too
many risks with one of the grand old names of French banking. Their hopes
that he would be fired next month, when the Credit Lyonnais chairmanship
comes up for renewal, suffered a setback when Mr Pierre Beregovoy, one of
his staunchest supporters, was appointed prime minister.
But Mr Haberer may face another political hurdle after next year's general
elections if Mr Jacques Chirac returns to power as the head of a
conservative government. Mr Chirac has been prime minister before, and one
of his first acts in the financial sector was to fire the head of the
Paribas banking group - Mr Jean-Yves Haberer.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (9): Giving the banks a run for
their money - David Barchard profiles GE Capital, the US non-bank with its
eye on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'All over the world, banks love to use us as their whipping boy. When
talking to their regulators, they give us as an example of what they could
do if they had no regulation to contend with,'
THE SPEAKER is Mr Gary Wendt, chairman and chief executive officer of GE
Capital Corporation, and president and chief operating officer of GE
Financial Services, its immediate parent company, which also includes Kidder
Peabody, the investment banking and securities firm.
Last year GE Financial Services contributed Dollars 1.27bn (Pounds 711m) of
General Electric's Dollars 4.4bn profits, making it the most profitable of
its 14 subsidiaries. More than four fifths of GEFS's earnings came from GE
Capital.
Only the top half dozen US banks are larger. With assets of Dollars 80bn,
spread between 22 subsidiaries, including commercial real estate finance,
retail financial services, mortgage services, aircraft leasing, private
mortgage guarantee insurance, and the credit card and private label card
businesses, GE Capital operates businesses traditionally owned by banks and
insurance companies.
But although some of the subsidiaries it has purchased in recent years have
banking licenses, neither GEFS nor GECC is a bank. In the mid-1960s, General
Electric decided that it no longer needed a financial services organisation
to support the sale of its products, and decided to let GEFS go its own way.
Today, only 3 per cent of GEFS' business is linked to the sale of General
Electric products. The group has evolved into the second largest non-bank
finance group in the US (the largest belongs to General Motors), funding not
from deposits but by issuing commercial paper with a triple-A rating from
Moody's and S&amp;P.
'That means that the rating agencies are, in fact, our regulators,' says Mr
Wendt. 'We have no government protection and we have to compete in the free
market for our money.'
To be sure of doing this successfully, GECC maintains much stronger capital
ratios than it would do if it were a bank. About 12 per cent of its total
assets are kept in liquid capital, and it lends about eight times its
capital, about half what it would do as a bank.
In the last three years, however, GECC's return on equity has stayed above
15 per cent. 'We are not a single organisation, but 22 separate but
specialised organisations, each concentrating on its own important segment,'
says Mr Wendt. 'You get strength from diversity. When one business is not
going so well, the rest can pick up the slack.' This policy has sheltered
GECC from the risks of some of its chosen areas: commercial real estate,
aircraft leasing, and leveraged buy-outs.
It has also enabled GECC, in its selected niche markets, to expand steadily
further into overseas markets, starting with the UK. It now has 10 different
business subsidiaries in Europe, including store-card business in the UK,
which it virtually dominates after having bought out the financial services
arms of Harrods, House of Fraser and Burton Group; Mercantile, the car loans
business, purchased from Barclay's Bank last year; and a 3 per cent stake in
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, of Spain.
In February came an agreement to buy the vehicle leasing and fleet
management business of Avis Europe, the car rental company; followed on May
1 by the purchase of a 50 per cent state in United Merchants Finance (UMF),
of Hong Kong. On May 10, GECC bought 45 per cent of Finanzia, a specialised
financing company, as a first step to a joint-venture in retail leasing and
store-card businesses in Spain and Portugal.
Once purchased, provided good local management is in place, GECC makes only
minimal interference and keeps a low profile. At Mercantile, for example,
purchased a year ago, GECC has only one or two US citizens out of a
workforce of 2,000. All the new European businesses are, Mr Wendt says,
firmly in the black. 'We are able to do things on a less expensive base than
the retailers can themselves, and let them release (consumer) debt from
their balance sheets and reduce their interest rate risk.'
Where GECC encounters businesses that are unlikely to stay in the black, it
does not compromise. In the UK, it decided that about 1,800 small store-card
outlets were uneconomic and stopped their card-issuing scheme, to the dismay
of some smaller retailers.
Since April 1990, GECC has also become a significant issuer of
sterling-denominated commercial paper, in line with its policy of funding
operations in local markets as far as possible. It now accounts for about 6
per cent of the sterling CP market. It is also starting to emerge as a
significant CP issuer in other European markets.
For GECC's eyes are now on possible acquisitions in its chosen areas in
almost every western European market. It is a remarkable contrast to the
general picture of withdrawal from European retail operations by most large
US banks. Europe's banks may not enjoy living alongside a large US non-bank
finance group, but whipping boy or not, they are going to have to do so.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (8): Low inflation a mixed blesssing
 -UK clearers face two serious post-recession problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR was not one which UK bankers will care to remember. After
provisions against bad and doubtful debts of Pounds 6.8bn, the nine English
and Scottish clearing banks made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 2.3bn,
according to a calculation by the US investment bank Shearson Lehman.
It would be nice to think, that, as the economy starts to show signs of
recovery, management could now could sit back and look forward to better
times ahead.
Unfortunately life is not as kind as that. The clearing banks are emerging
from the recession with two serious problems on their plate.
One is their continuing troubles with loans to the property sector, which
may now take many years to sort out. The other is still more fundamental,
and has been thrown into sharp relief by the debate over the future of the
Midland Bank. The banks must somehow find a way of making a satisfactory
return in an overcrowded market where loan demand looks set to remain
sluggish at best.
The environment in which these problems must be resolved is not particularly
propitious. The prospect of low inflation, which should follow from the UK's
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, may be, as the
government claims, a prerequisite for sustained economic growth.
For a banking industry struggling to come to terms with the
over-indebtedness of its customers, however, it can be more of a hindrance
than a help.
Unlike previous recessions in the property market, inflation is not floating
the sector off the rocks. Property prices, both commercial and residential,
have actually fallen in nominal terms during the recession, exposing lenders
in an unaccustomed way. As real interest rates remain high, the chances of a
speedy turnround look remote. The consequence for the clearing banks looks
likely to be another year of high provisions in 1992, slowing their recovery
from the recession.
Though base rates have fallen by 5 percentage points from their peak of 15
per cent, they remain positive in real terms by some 6 per cent. That means
that loan demand is unlikely to revive strongly in the foreseeable future,
limiting the prospects for the industry to raise its profits from other
forms of lending to offset provisions on property loans.
In the admittedly recessionary year of 1991, the domestic loan books of UK
clearing banks grew by only 2 per cent. The recovery might bring some
improvement, though this may also be offset by a growing trend for large
companies - especially those with the best credit ratings - to re-finance
their debt at attractive fixed rates in the bond market.
The banks are also squeezed, in two ways, by the fall in nominal interest
rates.
First, it reduces the profit they can make by lending out their so-called
'free-capital', such as retained profits. Second, the determination of the
government to track falls in money market rates with politically attractive
cuts in base rates has limited the scope for interest margins to increase as
rates have declined. The situation in the UK is in stark contrast to that in
the US, where the federal funds rate has been cut far more sharply than bank
prime rate.
Worse still, the banks face a competitive environment which requires them to
pay interest on their current accounts. It is thus hardly surprising that
they are now scrambling for other ways of boosting profits and rebuilding
capital after the ravages of the recession.
One consequence is an obsession with boosting fee income, notably through
increased emphasis on life assurance products which can be easily
distributed through the branch network. The clearing banks' collective ratio
of non-interest income to total income rose to nearly 41 per cent in 1991
from 38 per cent in 1990.
There is a limit, however, the extent to which fee income can offset the
impact of a basically stagnant loan book. Clearing banks have come
increasingly under fire for imposing apparently arbitrary and heavy charges
on their retail customers, for example, for unauthorised overdrafts. Small
businessmen, too, have complained vociferously about higher charges.
The best scope for improving underlying profitability thus probably still
lies with further effort on cutting costs, which is where the debate on
Midland's future comes in. Both Lloyds and Midland managed to keep total
operating costs broadly unchanged last year, while those at Barclays rose by
14 per cent and at National Westminster by 7 per cent. As things currently
stand, however, there is not much scope for further cuts. Announcing its
annual results, Midland pointed to the need to spend to maintain and improve
the quality of its services.
The message for the industry is clear. A more radical rationalisation is
needed if efficiency gains are to be realised. The scope for savings could
be enormous, as the Lloyds bid proposal for Midland shows. Lloyds suggests
that annual savings of some Pounds 700m could be generated by amalgamating
the two banks, though 20,000 jobs and perhaps up to 1,000 branches would
disappear in the process.
Whatever the outcome of the LLoyds bid, it seems likely that the process of
rationalisation and branch closures will continue. That is one reason why
many senior executives, even among Lloyds' competitors in the industry,
privately admit to hoping the UK bank will win. A victory for Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation would strengthen one of the weaker players in
the marketplace, putting everybody else under even greater pressure to
rationalise.
That, more than anything else, is testimony to the sorry state of an
industry, which now sees cutting costs as its best hope for increasing
profits.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (7): Nordic players blame the new
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORDIC BANKS incurred heavy losses last year, and the events of early 1992
suggest that many are again likely to suffer from substantial credit losses
and a high level of non-performing loans.
With hindsight, bankers claim that the rapid deregulation of the Nordic
countries' financial markets during the 1980s is partly to blame for the
sector's woes.
Finland, Sweden and Norway led a sheltered existence, with strict controls
on lending. When restrictions were lifted in the mid-1980s, banks scrambled
to lend to companies and individuals, often paying little heed to
creditworthiness.
The consequences, particularly to the real estate sector, became only too
clear in the 1990s as the Nordic economies were hit by recession.
In Sweden, the government announced this month that it would nationalise
Nordbanken, as the bank faced mounting credit losses and was in danger of
failing to meet the capital adequacy requirements set out by the Bank for
International Settlements. Nordbanken, which was already state-controlled,
ran up credit losses of SKr10.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in 1991.
The government's SKr20bn rescue package came only a few weeks after it had
been forced to announce a SKr7.3bn rescue package for Forsta Sparbanken, the
troubled savings bank hit by heavy losses in the property and construction
sector last year.
So far, the credit losses have related mainly to the real estate and finance
companies. However, some analysts express concern that, as unemployment in
Sweden looks set to rise, the next wave of bad loans could arise in the
private sector as households find it difficult to repay their debts.
In Finland, the central bank was forced to propose a rescue package for the
banking sector in March, having already stepped in to take over Skopbank,
the country's main savings bank.
The rescue package consisted of measures to bolster the banks' capital
adequacy ratios and restore confidence in the sector by setting up a new
FM20bn (Pounds 2.5bn) government deposit guarantee fund.
The Finnish economy is suffering from a deep recession, due partly to the
collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union and the downturn in the
forestry sector. The government was worried that banks would have to cut
back their loans in order to meet the 8 per cent capital adequacy
requirement, leading to a credit crunch and hindering an eventual recovery
in the economy.
Last year was also a bad one for the Norwegian banks, with the big three -
Christiania Bank, Den norske Bank (DnB) and Fokus Bank - reporting combined
net losses of NKr16bn (Pounds 1.4bn). The government was forced to prop up
the ailing banks, nationalising Christiania after its capital had been wiped
out and providing a cash injection for DnB.
Moody's Investor Services, the credit rating agency, recently warned that
Christiania and DnB were unlikely to break even this year.
Compared with the catalogue of disasters in Norway, Finland and Sweden,
Denmark can boast that its banking sector is in a relatively healthy state.
There have already been signs of rationalisation, with the smaller financial
institutions being bought by larger concerns in recent years.
As in the other Nordic countries, analysts point to the need to reduce staff
and branches in these heavily overbanked markets if costs are to be reduced.
Even so, the worry is that many banks in the region will continue to be
plagued by credit losses and that recovery will be slow.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (5): A cloud over credit - Stefan
Wagstyl considers Japan's difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE BANKS face their most severe financial recession since the second
world war. Fears that they might not be able to cope with the strain are so
widespread that the authorities last month took the unprecedented step of
announcing estimates of banks' financial results, and gave an official
assurance about the health of the banking system.
The banks' main problem is a shortage of capital, compounded by an increase
in bad loans caused by the collapse of the financial boom of the late 1980s
when stock and land prices soared.
At the same time, a slow-down in the Japanese and world economy is reducing
openings for profitable new business, so limiting the opportunities for
banks to restore their balance sheets with increased profits.
Bankers say it could take five years to get over the difficulties caused by
bad loans. It is premature to talk of a credit shortage - since loan demand
is sluggish in Japan due to the economic slow down. But any recovery could
be stifled by the lack of credit. At the very least, borrowers at home and
abroad could find credit more difficult to secure than at any time since the
1970s, and more expensive.
The outlook is not wholly bad - banks have responded rapidly to the
challenge, weeding out unprofitable business and concentrating on boosting
profits. The stronger banks will remain formidable competitors in domestic
and international markets; the weaker are in danger of losing their
independence.
Also, even though deregulation has reduced the Japanese authorities' ability
to control the markets, both the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance
have made it clear that they will support the banking system. The
authorities are determined Japan should not suffer the ignominy of its first
post-war bank bankruptcy. 'Our banking system is very sound. Excessive
concern is unnecessary,' says a ministry official.
Furthermore, if Japanese banks are suffering, so are many of their
international competitors, as shown by the current cash crisis at Olympia &amp;
York, the Canadian property developer.
The finance ministry said operating profit for all 153 Japanese banks rose
26.8 per cent to Y3,659bn (Pounds 15.5bn), boosted by declining interest
rates. Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Y2,799bn, due to aggressive
write-offs for loans and investment loans, including those related to the
property market. Net after-tax profits fell 24 per cent to Y1,379bn.
These figures show how banks have exploited recent declines in interest
rates to increase their lending margins, and their success in cutting costs.
However, the results are historic. More important is the amount of capital
banks have for the future and the extent to which this will be eroded by
write-offs on bad loans.
The problem is to meet the international capital adequacy standards set by
the Bank for International Settlements, which come into force at the end of
March 1993. Most leading banks met the BIS standard of 8 per cent ratio of
capital to assets at the end of March 1992. But Japanese banks count as
capital a portion of their unrealised gains in securities - and these were
hit by the stock market's sharp fall since March.
Banks can improve their capital adequacy ratios either by boosting capital
or by cutting asset growth. Japanese banks have done both: they raised
equity until the stock market plunged in 1990, then they took out
subordinated loans, which for BIS purposes count as a form of capital.
Meanwhile, they cut asset growth sharply - from a peak of above 15 per cent
in the late 1980s, to an estimated 4 per cent in the year to the end of
March 1992.
Banks plan very small increases in assets this year - and little or no
growth in overseas assets. However, they intend to wait until the second
half of the year before they made any drastic decisions, such as turning
away needy borrowers. They hope that the current extreme weakness in the
stock market will prove temporary. Borrowers in some sectors, notably
property, are squealing for credit. But their problems do not stem from
BIS-imposed constraints, but from the worldwide plunge in property prices.
Fortunately for Japanese banks, BIS rules contain no sanctions. It will be
for the Japanese finance ministry to decide what penalties to impose  - and
it is unlikely to do anything which might undermine the banks' interests at
such a delicate time. US and European regulators are also unlikely to put
pressure on Japan for fear of the possible impact on international
confidence in Japanese banks.
Much depends on how much bad debt needs to be written off. According to the
finance ministry, write-offs for all banks rose sharply last year to
Y639.3bn. The ministry estimates leading national banks had
Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn in bad loans at the end of the fiscal year, that is loans
on which no interest had been paid for six months. However, all but
Y2,000bn-Y3,000bn was covered by collateral, said the ministry. Since, even
after recent stock market falls, banks had unrealised portfolio gains of
Y17,000bn, banks could easily cope with bad loans, said the ministry
official.
Industry analysts put total bad loans at up to Y20,000bn, sometimes more.
However, much depends on how such loans are calculated. Similarly, the value
of collateral is often difficult to establish, given that much of is
property and the property market is now weak.
Squeezed by the shortage of capital and mounting bad loans, bankers are
naturally cautious about new lending. They are seeking better security and
higher margins than in the high-growth years of the late 1980s. They are
also likely to favour old-established blue-chip Japanese companies over
other customers they may know less well. However, since blue-chip borrowers
pay lower rates of interest than most clients, even they may find credit a
little tighter. For example, banks have been asking customers with large
cash balances as well as borrowings to use a portion of these balances to
repay debt.
But with the Japanese economy still slowing and companies cutting
inventories, it is is too soon to forecast how severe any credit shortage
might be. Certainly, those who know they will need funds next year, to
refinance existing borrowings or bonds which fall due, are worried.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (6): Winners and losers in a
European game - Banking sans frontieres? Technology may help

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a single currency across the member states of the European Community - would
have profound effects on the banking sector. But the winners and losers are
far from clear at the moment, and the changes may well be gradual rather
than dramatic.
One impact would be on the foreign exchange markets. A unified European
currency would mean that there would no longer be any trading between the
various countries' monetary units - and thus on the foreign exchange profits
of banks.
Mr Christopher Ellerton, banking analyst at Warburg Securities, says this
point should not be over-emphasised. The bulk of foreign exchange trading is
currently on the dollar/yen, dollar/Deutsche Mark and sterling/dollar
cross-rates. Such trading would not be affected by a unified currency, save
that the D-Mark might be replaced (in name, at least) by the Ecu.
Nevertheless, some of the smaller currencies will have provided lucrative
niche markets for forex traders. And, of course, Europe's tourists will not
need to change their money every time they cross a border - and pay banks
commission income on each occasion.
One researcher set off from Brussels to visit all 12 Community nations with
BFr1,200. Rather than spend any money, he simply exchanged his cash for the
local currency in each place. By the time he returned, he was left with only
BFr596, less than half his starting capital.
A unified European currency would, of course, mean that the same level of
interest rates would prevail across the Community. Given that UK interest
rates have tended to be higher than the European average, this might affect
some UK banks, according to Mr John Aitken, banking analyst at County
NatWest. UK banks have been used to a high level of interest rates, which
creates an 'endowment effect' on their profits, by charging high rates for
loans and offering low returns on current accounts. (Although, as a
counterbalance, high interest rates normally lead to increased bad debt
losses.)
But what about the dream of a genuinely open European banking market, with
banks of all nations offering services to customers across national markets?
It may take a long time to appear, according to some experts.
It is difficult to imagine retail banking products being readily sold across
European boundaries within the next 10 years, according to Mr Aitken.
Products are difficult to compare, because of the different ways that banks
can charge - some via straight fees, some via higher rates for overdrafts,
and the subtly different services on offer. 'Most people will vote with
their national prejudices,' says Mr Aitken. 'Banking products are not
readily exportable,' according Mr Ellerton, at Warburg.
Technology may break down some of the barriers. Services such as Directline
insurance (a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland) may set a trend for
telephone-based financial services. The FirstDirect telephone banking
services is the kind of product which might be relaunched (via a different
name) in other EC countries.
But the sheer strength of the branch networks built up by banks on the
continent and in the UK means that acquisition and merger are much more
likely routes to cross-border banking links, than direct competition.
Even before monetary union, the prospect of the single European market, due
to come into force at the end of this year, had prompted a number of
cross-border banking deals.
Some deals have been unambitious, such as a five-bank deal signed in 1991
which allowed customers of Credit Agricole of France, Rabobank of the
Netherlands, Banco Ambrosiano of Italy, Lloyds Bank of the UK and Bayerische
Vereinsbank of Germany access to each other's branches.
The best known link is the Deutsche Bank takeover of Morgan Grenfell, but
there have been a number of deals in the field of fund management. Here, the
trend has been for continental banks to take over UK investment groups, in
search of the generally acknowledged equity management expertise that
London-based companies are perceived to have.
A single currency ought to put a premium on such skills. Investment
institutions have traditionally held the bulk of their assets in their own
markets, in part because of currency risk. With a unified currency, domestic
and other EC assets ought to be interchangeable; as a consequence,
institutions should shift a far greater proportion of their portfolios into
other European markets. They will need international managers to look after
those assets.
On the retail front, fund managers hope eventually to sell mutual funds
Europe-wide via the Ucits (undertakings for collective investments in
transferable securities) system. The 'international rich', who often live in
more than one country, are the ideal target market.
Banks have traditionally dominated the investment market on the continent,
and thus should benefit from any cross-border Ucits growth. But to date, the
bulk of Ucits money has merely moved to Luxembourg from other offshore
centres as investment companies have moved to centralise their cross-border
funds.
Again, a single currency ought to help the growth in Ucits investment. But
cultural differences, such as continental preference for bond over equity
investment (and the reverse bias in the UK), could mean that progress, as in
other financial services fields, will be slow.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (4): Merger wave continues amid
hopes for interstate reform - America's banking system is bloated with
excess capacity, and the need to streamline has become urgent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a time of reckoning for America's commercial banks, a time of
facing the realities of lean economic times, the mistakes of the past and
the need to restructure.
The past 18 months have seen huge loan losses at some of the largest US
banks, many of them caused by the crisis in the commercial real estate
market and the lemming-like plunge into such lending by many banks in the
latter part of the 1980s.
Yet bankers rarely seem to learn from their mistakes. Late in recognising
their problems, as they were in the sovereign debt crisis of the early 1980s
and in the leveraged buy-out lending a few years on, many American bankers
were last year forced not only to make record-level bad debt provisions, but
to confront a more fundamental and more structural problem: America's
banking system is bloated with excess capacity, and the need to streamline
has become urgent.
Until last December, there were many who thought that legislative reform
would provide some degree of speedy relief. They were wrong. The US congress
abdicated most of its responsibilities and approved a weak, compromise bill
that skirted the most urgent priorities, such as giving banks the right to
expand into equity, underwriting, insurance and other financial services
areas.
The biggest issue that US bank reform legislation ignored was the rather
reasonable and economically useful proposal to allow banks the right to open
branches across state boundaries.
Some big banks, most notably institutions such as Bank of America and Banc
One, are already expanding interstate. They are able to take advantage of
the varying state laws around the country. But the system is not uniform.
The US, with all its potential economies of scale, is thus one of the few
western countries that does not allow its high street banks the right to
operate nationally. This, in turn, can create enormous and excessive
administrative costs. For example, a bank must have separate boards and
administrative operations just to have branches on both sides of the Hudson
River in New York and New Jersey.
The interstate branching debate flared again recently, when authorities in
Washington gave savings banks the right to go national. Both complaints and
then lawsuits began flying at the savings bank regulators from smaller,
independent banks, while the big commercial banks simply became furious.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has expressed his
support for interstate branching on several occasions, most recently in a
speech in Chicago this month. The Fed chairman said there would be
'significant cost savings' in the mega-mergers that could follow the passage
of such legislation.
'Market forces will ultimately prevail,' Mr Greenspan argued, but he added
that he didn't think such banking legislation would occur in 1992. Rather,
he predicted that a helpful political climate would favour the legislation
in 1993.
Mr Greenspan's political instincts were, as always, fine-tuned. Few
Washington insiders expect interstate branching to be approved during a
presidential election year, when the White House is doing its best to
alienate as few special interests as possible.
Yet the wave of mergers that would undoubtedly expand with such legislation
is already under way. Last year saw three giant mergers, beginning with the
joining of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.
The Chemical merger not only created the third biggest US bank, with Dollars
136bn of assets, it also will result in more than Dollars 750m of annual
cost savings over the next three years. Already this year, Chemical is ahead
of its target, proving that one can slash back-office costs by a substantial
amount - and especially when the banks being merged are in the same market.
The marriage of Bank of America and Security Pacific in California - really
more of a rescue of the troubled SecPac - is another example of how costs
can be cut in a transaction in the same geographic market. The projections
from California call for Dollars 1.2bn of annual savings by 1995, with up to
12,000 of the combined bank's 91,000-strong workforce being made redundant.
The third big merger, between NCNB of North Carolina and C&amp;S/Sovran of
Georgia, was across state boundaries, but it would undoubtedly benefit even
more if full interstate branching laws were on the federal books.
Mergers are, of course, not the only solution to America's banking woes. The
strengthening of capital ratios is another priority for many regulators, and
banks have gone some distance to bolstering their bases by selling off less
strategic assets. The toughest challenge is faced by Citicorp, the biggest
US bank and ironically the weakest of the top 10 in terms of capital ratios.
Citicorp's problems, including its heavy real estate exposure, have been the
constant subject of speculation in the banking community. Mr John Reed, the
chairman of Citicorp, has been sharply criticised for sloppy management of
the bank by many of his peers.
Mr Reed, however, is determined to strengthen the bank's capital and clean
up the mess as soon as possible. And there have been signs he is making
progress.
Looking ahead, it seems fair to say that some of the worst of the problems
facing the US commercial banking sector are over. The skies, as Mr George
Salem, of Prudential Securities, put it recently, appear to be clearing.
A recent analysis of prospects for US banking, by Salomon Brothers,
suggested that perceptions of the real estate crisis have now shifted from
being 'life threatening' to being more in the 'nuisance' category. That may
be a trifle facile, because it is hard to generalise. Bad debt provisions
will still be very high this year at a number of US banks. But at least one
can begin to see recovery down the road.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (2): Pressure for leniency resisted
 -Regulators may use sanctions to enforce capital adequacy targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEADLINE by which international banks must comply with the Basle Accord
on capital adequacy has not even been reached, but central bankers are
already working on the next stage of prudential regulation.
Regulators are considering whether to enforce sanctions against banks which
fail to meet the Basle targets, whether the original Basle agreement should
be stiffened or slackened, and how new rules covering securities dealing
should apply to banks.
Most international banks have until the end of this year to meet the Basle
targets, with Japanese banks having until March 1993, the end of their
current financial year.
From this time, all banks must maintain a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of
8 per cent. Moreover, half of total capital must be tier 1 or core capital,
consisting of common equity and perpetual preference shares. The rest can be
tier 2, or non-core, capital, including dated preference shares,
subordinated loans and hybrid debt instruments.
Japanese banks may face the biggest problems in meeting the full 8 per cent
capital ratio by the deadline. The decline in the Tokyo stock market has
eroded unrealised gains on large securities holdings. Under the Basle
accord, 45 per cent of these unrealised gains can count as tier 2 capital.
In the early stages of the Japanese equity market crash, new tier 2 capital
was raised in the form of subordinated loans, often from institutional
investors such as insurance companies. However, this year the fall in equity
prices has been so swift that new capital cannot be raised fast enough to
off-set the erosion.
IBCA, the credit rating agency which has specialised in the banking sector,
estimated that the hidden reserves of the largest 20 Japanese banks shrank
from Y34,992bn (Pounds 148bn) to Y18,693bn last fiscal year. With the Nikkei
stock market average at around 17,000, most Japanese city or commercial
banks are close to, or below, the Basle target.
Japanese banks are not alone in facing problems. The recession has led to
increased provisions against bad debt. The full extent of write-offs  -
against the property sector in the UK and US, for example - may not be clear
for another year.
However, the Balse committee has so far resisted pressure to ease the
targets, either by changing the required capital ratio, extending the
deadline, or allowing new hybrid debt-equity instruments to count as core
capital.
Experience shows that capital ratios can be improved quickly, if the right
steps are taken. Citicorp, for example, had a full Basle ratio of just 6.52
per cent in 1990. At the end of March this year, the ratio had improved to
8.12 per cent.
The bank achieved this by raising new tier 1 capital, mainly by placing
preference shares, cutting back on new loans and selling assets. For
example, the sale of a controlling interest in Ambac, the financial
guarantee insurer, both netted Dollars 350m (Pounds 196m) in cash and
removed Dollars 25bn assets from the consolidated balance sheet.
Indeed, far from easing the targets, regulators are now asking what
sanctions should be imposed on banks which fail to meet the Basle targets.
No punitive measures were included in the original agreement, which is a
purely voluntary undertaking.
A committee of central bankers, headed by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is looking at measures which could be
taken against banks that are seen as inadequately regulated.
The committee was set up following the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International. National regulators feel that they have little
control over the branches of foreign banks operating in their jurisdiction.
Central bank sources said that inadequately-capitalised banks would 'by
implication' be subject to the same measures as inadequately-regulated
institutions.
The main proposal before the Corrigan committee is that host country
regulators should be able to assume additional regulatory powers over
foreign banks operating in their jurisdiction. This could be achieved by
forcing foreign bank branches to convert to separately capitalised
subsidiaries, fully regulated in the host country.
National regulators are also taking unilateral action, building the Basle
agreement into law. For example, the US congress last year passed
legislation giving the US regulators powers over under-capitalised banks.
The law allows 'critically under-capitalised banks' to be placed under the
control of the regulators, even though they are technically still solvent.
Under which circumstances these powers could be used has yet to be
described.
International regulators have also turned their attention to the securities
business - including the securities operations of banks. New capital rules
governing market risks such as underwriting, foreign exchange dealing, and
bond trading could impose an additional burden.
Regulators argue that new rules should not lead to banks having to provide
additional capital. Most securities holdings are already covered by the
'broad brush' approach of the Basle agreement. However, it is clear that
more detailed rules will encourage banks to become more sensitive to the
capital implications of types of securities business - running long
positions of non-government securities, for example.
Banks may also be more careful about allocating scarce capital resources
between different parts of the business.
Rules are being drafted by the European Commission, the International
Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), and central bank regulators
meeting in Basle.
The Basle committee and Iosco have co-operated and hope to publish a first
draft by the end of the summer. The EC capital adequacy directive has passed
through several drafts, but remains stalled by political wrangling.
Bankers are concerned that the rules should give them equal treatment with
non-bank securities firms. Some issues on this score have now been settled.
For example, banks will probably be able to raise short-term subordinated
loans - a type of tier 3 capital - as backing for positions, in the same way
as non-bank firms.
But several areas remain controversial, such as the treatment of large
securities exposures, capital backing for underwriting risks and the netting
of short and long bond holdings.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (3): Consolidation starts at home -
Acquisition or alliance? Peter Montagnon on a single-market dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVELOPMENT of the European single market has confronted bankers with a
dilemma.
On the one hand, they feel under pressure to expand across the national
frontiers that have hitherto divided the European Community. On the other,
they know that, even if the theoretical barriers to such expansion have
broken down, differences of market practice and tradition remain a
formidable obstacle.
The problem is less acute with specialised wholesale banking, which is more
or less a global business anyway, than with retail banking, which requires a
physical presence in the foreign market.
That raises the question of how such a presence should be established.
Should it be through acquisition and merger, or by collaborative alliances
which may involve an exchange of shares? Or should it come through a direct
attempt to establish a presence from scratch?
Of all these options, the latter is probably the most difficult of all.
Customer preferences are deeply ingrained in national retail markets, and
newcomers face stiff psychological resistance; but that does not mean the
alternatives are easy either.
Though the run up to the single market has seen some cross-border
acquisitions of retail banks, such as the purchase by Deutsche Bank of Banca
d'America e d'Italia, bankers generally reckon that such an approach has
many pitfalls for management unfamiliar with the territory into which they
are expanding. The trouble is that collaborative alliances can also prove
fragile and not particularly lucrative.
One of the older of such alliances is that between Banco Santander and the
Royal Bank of Scotland, which involves the Spanish bank holding a 10 per
cent stake in its Scottish partner. The relationship has allowed the Royal
Bank to develop and market an online service, giving its UK customers
effective access to Santander branches. This is now being extended to other
European countries as well. Yet it is difficult to detect ways in which the
relationship has been a dynamic generator of profits over the years. A
cynical view might be that the greatest benefit of the arrangement, which
also involves a Royal Bank stake of just over 2 per cent in Santander, is
that it discourages outsiders from bidding for the Royal Bank.
Last year, meanwhile, saw the failure of efforts by Credit Lyonnais and
Commerzbank to agree the terms of a collaborative alliance, apparently
following differences over strategic direction after German unification and
a clash over Credit Lyonnais' ambition to adopt a dominant role.
Negotiations on a share swap between Dresdner Bank and BNP are proceeding,
though this is clearly a lengthy process. In the meantime, the main thrust
of their collaboration has been in countries outside the EC, such as
Switzerland and Hungary.
It is thus ironic, but not surprising, that one of the main trends of
European banking in the run-up to the single market has been for the
industry to consolidate at national level. In this context, Lloyds' interest
in acquiring Midland scarcely seems out of place, even if it does pose
competition policy problems in the UK. According to the OECD, the number of
European bank mergers within national borders is running at nearly twice
those across borders within the Community.
The trend is clearly seen in the experience of Dutch banking. After the
failure in 1989 of the proposed merger between Amro Bank and Generale de
Banque, of Belgium - attributed in part to the difficulty of maintaining
separate identities for the two banks within their old home markets - the
Dutch bank turned instead to a merger with its compatriot, ABN. The result
is a bank powerful enough to deflect outsiders from harbouring ambitions in
the small Dutch market, while also being of a size large enough to expand
abroad.
The trend to consolidation is yet more marked in the countries of southern
Europe, where banking was less well developed before the single market
concept was launched. Having realised that its high margins made Spain a
juicy prospect for foreign banks, the authorities there actively promoted a
process of consolidation, starting with the merger of Banco Bilbao and Banco
Vizcaya in 1988. The process was far from easy, but has produced results in
the form of significant cost savings.
Under its Amato law, which confers tax privileges on banks which merge,
Italy is belatedly following suit. The prime motivation may be the
modernisation of the industry and financial system in a way that will
discourage predatory foreigners; but mergers in the home market also appeal,
because they create much greater scope for cost savings.
Lloyds, for example, has identified some Pounds 700m annually that could be
saved if it were allowed to amalgamate with Midland. The alternative offered
by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is a strategy of regional
synergies, whose benefits are harder to quantify.
A similar lesson emerges across the Atlantic, where mergers such as that
between Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank have as much to do with the
cost savings from rationalisation than with a desire to benefit from
liberalisation of interstate expansion. The US, it will be recalled, already
has the benefit of a single currency. Only when that comes to Europe, too,
are cross-border mergers of banks likely to make a great deal of sense.

FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (1): Danger at the frontier - In the
1980s, internationalisation led bankers from different countries to make
identical mistakes in lending. As national barriers continue to fall,
recession has forced most to cut lending as they reorganise, again in
similar ways, to raise profits by reducing costs. But have they learned from
their mistakes?

THE internationalisation of financial markets has for two decades been
viewed by bankers as presenting great opportunities for profitable
expansion. But right now bankers and bank regulators are concentrating
rather more on the pitfalls of bringing down barriers to doing business
across national frontiers.
of the past year are illustrations of such pitfalls. First there was the
closure, last summer, of the Bank for Credit and Commerce International,
which has caused huge losses for thousands of depositors.
Here was a bank mistrusted by the financial community that was nonetheless
permitted to continue trading fraudulently for years. Much of the blame for
this lies squarely with the international system for regulating banks.
BCCI cleverly put its domicile in a different country from those in which it
carried out the bulk of its business. The supervisor in its home country,
Luxembourg, did not have the resources to monitor properly its vast
international operations.
So BCCI continued to take deposits long after it should have been closed
down, had it been properly supervised. Thus the bank regulators of the
leading industrial countries, grouped in the Basle Committee for Banking
Supervision, are trying to come up with tough new rules, which would prevent
any bank from operating in the major industrial economies unless it subjects
its worldwide operations to proper scrutiny by regulators, among which one
regulator would play a leading role.
The second big event has been the attempt by Olympia &amp; York, the world's
biggest property developer, to restructure its Dollars 12bn of borrowings.
O&amp;Y was in theory the text-book case of a company reducing the risks of its
business by expanding across borders. If the inherent riskiness of the
business had been reduced, the risk of lending to it should also have been
reduced.
O&amp;Y's 100 banks each have a different tale of woe concerning how they
misunderstood the risks of lending to it. One example will suffice to show
how the internationalisation of a business can provide false comfort.
In November 1990, after months of trying, O&amp;Y succeeded in persuading a club
of 10 banks to provide it with Pounds 490m to finance the construction of
the Canary Wharf office development in London's docklands.
The banks had profound reservations about the Pounds 3bn project. They were
concerned that the sheer scale of the development was excessive. They were
convinced that the London property market was past its peak. They were
concerned that transport links between Canary Wharf and central London were
poor.
Yet they provided the money, because they obtained a guarantee from the
parent company in Canada. If Canary Wharf failed, the mighty O&amp;Y would bail
them out - at least, that is what they believed.
But the banks, like O&amp;Y itself, neglected one simple but crucial factor.
Some of the causes of the decline in UK property prices were not unique to
the UK alone. Recession was taking its toll not just of the London real
estate market but also of those in Toronto and New York.
Internationalisation - the linkages between the economies in North America
and Europe, and also between markets in the respective continents - had by
no means mitigated the risks of lending to O&amp;Y.
Another example of internationalisation bringing problems is the effect on
financial markets everywhere of Japanese banks' relative shortage of
capital. This is also an example of the costs incurred when bank regulators
try to create a level playing field between banks operating in international
markets.
By the end of this year, banks from all countries which are signatories to
the 1983 Basle Concordat, are supposed to carry in their balance sheets an
identical minimum amount of capital relative to their assets, known as a
capital ratio. Banks are required to maintain these minimum capital ratios
as a protection to their depositors.
However, many of the big Japanese banks have less than the required amount
of capital. In part, this is because the Bank of Japan, the Japanese
regulator, had for years set its banks different standards from those set by
regulators in other countries.
The other big problem for the Japanese banks is that a substantial
proportion of their capital is in the form of shares listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and these have fallen sharply in value as the stock market
has fallen.
This shortage of capital for the Japanese banks is not a little local
difficulty, because in the 1980s the Japanese banks were the biggest lenders
in international markets.
In order to try to meet the new capital requirement, the Japanese banks are
both trying to raise new capital - and this is proving difficult - and
calling in foreign loans and refusing to make new ones.
There is one positive effect for other banks. Without competition for loans
from the Japanese, the margin on international lending has widened.
But there is also a powerful negative effect. A shortage of liquidity from
Japanese banks is causing difficulties for some big borrowers. The UK's
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel and one of the world's biggest
borrowers with Pounds 8bn of banking facilities, is one potential sufferer.
It has breached its borrowing covenants, and therefore needs to get the
agreement of its banks to make drawings on its unused facilities. The
company freely admits that it expects difficulties in obtaining this
agreement from its Japanese banks - though it hopes that enough will give
the waiver to the relevant banking covenant to allow the project to
continue.
There is another aspect to the internationalisation of banking which is
proving more salutary, and that is the spur provided by international
competition to cost-cutting in the banking industry.
Though the competitive pressure from Japanese banks in lending to big
companies has reduced, most banking markets remain relatively competitive,
and cross-border competition is a factor in this. There is also a widespread
expectation that further barriers to cross-border banking will come down -
whether the borders are state ones in the US or national ones in the
European Community.
It is no accident, therefore, that banks in many different parts of the
world are reorganising their operations in broadly similar ways.
The thrust of the strategic moves which many of them are making is to
increase productivity by reducing costs. In the US, there has been a

misunderstood the risks of lending to it. One example will suffice to show
how the internationalisation of a business can provide false comfort.
In November 1990, after months of trying, O&amp;Y succeeded in persuading a club
of 10 banks to provide it with Pounds 490m to finance the construction of
the Canary Wharf office development in London's docklands.
The banks had profound reservations about the Pounds 3bn project. They were
concerned that the sheer scale of the development was excessive. They were
convinced that the London property market was past its peak. They were
concerned that transport links between Canary Wharf and central London were
poor.
Yet they provided the money, because they obtained a guarantee from the
parent company in Canada. If Canary Wharf failed, the mighty O&amp;Y would bail
them out - at least, that is what they believed.
But the banks, like O&amp;Y itself, neglected one simple but crucial factor.
Some of the causes of the decline in UK property prices were not unique to
the UK alone. Recession was taking its toll not just of the London real
estate market but also of those in Toronto and New York.
Internationalisation - the linkages between the economies in North America
and Europe, and also between markets in the respective continents - had by
no means mitigated the risks of lending to O&amp;Y.
Another example of internationalisation bringing problems is the effect on
financial markets everywhere of Japanese banks' relative shortage of
capital. This is also an example of the costs incurred when bank regulators
try to create a level playing field between banks operating in international
markets.
By the end of this year, banks from all countries which are signatories to
the 1983 Basle Concordat, are supposed to carry in their balance sheets an
identical minimum amount of capital relative to their assets, known as a
capital ratio. Banks are required to maintain these minimum capital ratios
as a protection to their depositors.
However, many of the big Japanese banks have less than the required amount
of capital. In part, this is because the Bank of Japan, the Japanese
regulator, had for years set its banks different standards from those set by
regulators in other countries.
The other big problem for the Japanese banks is that a substantial
proportion of their capital is in the form of shares listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and these have fallen sharply in value as the stock market
has fallen.
This shortage of capital for the Japanese banks is not a little local
difficulty, because in the 1980s the Japanese banks were the biggest lenders
in international markets.
In order to try to meet the new capital requirement, the Japanese banks are
both trying to raise new capital - and this is proving difficult - and
calling in foreign loans and refusing to make new ones.
There is one positive effect for other banks. Without competition for loans
from the Japanese, the margin on international lending has widened.
But there is also a powerful negative effect. A shortage of liquidity from
Japanese banks is causing difficulties for some big borrowers. The UK's
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel and one of the world's biggest
borrowers with Pounds 8bn of banking facilities, is one potential sufferer.
It has breached its borrowing covenants, and therefore needs to get the
agreement of its banks to make drawings on its unused facilities. The
company freely admits that it expects difficulties in obtaining this
agreement from its Japanese banks - though it hopes that enough will give
the waiver to the relevant banking covenant to allow the project to
continue.
There is another aspect to the internationalisation of banking which is
proving more salutary, and that is the spur provided by international
competition to cost-cutting in the banking industry.
Though the competitive pressure from Japanese banks in lending to big
companies has reduced, most banking markets remain relatively competitive,
and cross-border competition is a factor in this. There is also a widespread
expectation that further barriers to cross-border banking will come down -
whether the borders are state ones in the US or national ones in the
European Community.
It is no accident, therefore, that banks in many different parts of the
world are reorganising their operations in broadly similar ways.
The thrust of the strategic moves which many of them are making is to
increase productivity by reducing costs. In the US, there has been a wave of
mergers and takeovers. In simplistic terms, the aim of the merger of
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover in New York - and of the takeover of
Security Pacific by Bank of America, in California - is to feed the revenues
of two banks through the cost structure of just one. Lloyds Bank's attempt
to buy Midland in the UK has similar aims.
In all these cases, the merger or takeover has foreshadowed enormous cuts in
the workforce of the combined banks to reduce costs. Banks in many countries
are more vulnerable to takeover than they have ever been, due to legislative
and regulatory changes. But even banks choosing not to combine with others
are shedding vast numbers of employees and endeavouring to become more
productive.
All of which is good news for bank shareholders, who over the years have had
reason to fear that banks' executives put too low an emphasis on earning a
respectable return on capital. But if shareholders had one wish, it would be
that the managers of their banks could become better judges of the risks
inherent in different forms of lending.
Internationalisation in the 1980s often seemed to mean that bankers from
different countries made identical mistakes in lending to highly borrowed
companies and to property businesses.
Recession has forced most banks to reduce lending, so it is too early to say
whether bankers have learned from their mistakes and have become better
evaluators of risks. If there were a widespread improvement in bankers'
basic lending skills, 'internationalisation' would no longer be a dirty
word.

FT  20 MAY 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: ICS's Pounds 15m share
placement is 'comfortably oversubscribed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Correction (Published 21st May 1992) appended to this article.
INTERNATIONAL Control Services, the electronic safety systems manufacturer
which is seeking a full listing on the London stock market, said yesterday
its Pounds 15m share placement had been 'comfortably oversubscribed'.
At the placing price of 110p, the company will have a market capitalisation
of Pounds 43.9m. Dealing will start on Thursday, May 28.
ICS Group claims around 12 per cent of its targeted market for safety
systems for the oil, gas and petrochemical industry.
Worldwide, the safety market is estimated at around Dollars 750m, and
expected to grow by up to 12 per cent a year in the next three years.
The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m for the year to May 1991, on
turnover of Pounds 51.4m.
This year the directors forecast profits before tax of at least Pounds 4.5m,
putting earnings per share at not less than 8.9p.
Founded in 1966 as a maker of electronic alarm systems for industry, the
company was quick to spot the potential in the North Sea market, and in the
words of chief executive Mr Peter Hall has 'grown up together with the North
Sea fields'.
It was, however, tougher safety requirements in the North Sea in the wake of
the Piper Alpha disaster, enshrined in the Offshore Safety Act, that led to
a four-fold growth in profits in the past four years. The group has built up
a client network including BP, Shell, British Gas, Agip, Total, and Chevron.
The company specialises in integrated safety and control systems for
industrial processes which detect hazards, and automatically take corrective
action, including shutdown where necessary.
While considerable retro-fitting work remains in the North Sea fields, with
the provision of safety systems for the new generation of highly-automated
offshore platforms, the company is looking for growth in the overseas
market, which already accounts for around 30 per cent of turnover.
'The North Sea, and the kind of systems we have developed there, are setting
the standards for the rest of the world,' Mr Hall said.
ICS is already working in Saudi Arabia, where an extensive retro-fitting
programme is under way, and in Kuwait. It has also supplied Singapore,
Indonesia and Korea, and has four overseas sales offices.
The placing will raise around Pounds 6.6m, net of expenses, to be used to
reduce current bank borrowings - leaving the company with gearing at around
25-30 per cent - to repay a Pounds 1m loan from 3i, and to redeem certain
preference shares held by 3i, the venture capital group.
The directors will control 53.8 per cent of the enlarged share capital; 3i
will control 11.99 per cent.

manufacturer, was wrongly referred to as International Control Services in

FT  20 MAY 92 / Italian government approves administrative measures for
Bosnian refugees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday approved a series of administrative
measures to cut red tape in the handling of refugees from the fighting in
Bosnia. At the same time, the government stressed the problem should be
dealt with by the entire EC.
Yesterday's measures will enable the local authorities to react quicker to
any influx of refugees. Italy continues to be haunted by the spectre of the
chaos last summer in southern Italy, when the authorities tried to cope with
the invasion by boat of thousands of Albanians seeking aslyum.

ELECTRICITE de France plans to tighten links with the Spanish state-run
utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa) but a share swap is out of
the question, according to Mr Pierre Delaporte, EdF chairman, AP-DJ reports
from Madrid.
Mr Delaporte said the state-owned EdF had signed an agreement with Endesa to
collaborate in coal production centres in the Spanish towns of Puertollano
and Teruel.
Endesa, meanwhile, would contribute to the operations at EdF's nuclear
energy plant in Civeaux. However, the chairman denied speculation that a
share swap took place.
Endesa and EdF are also discussing making a joint bid in the privatisation
of the Argentine energy distributor Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos
Aires (Segba).
*****
Telefonica, Spain's state-run telecommunications monopoly, announced
yesterday that net profit rose 12.9 per cent to P12.2bn (Dollars 119.6m) in
the first quarter of 1992, Reuter reports from Madrid.
Telefonica attributed the rise to efforts to contain costs and to a strong
increase in operating income.
*****
Wella, the German haircare and cosmetics group, saw a sharper rise in net
profit than in sales in 1991, but it remained a long way from its stated
goal of a 4 per cent return on turnover, Reuter reports from Darmstadt.
The company said its group net profit had risen 7.2 per cent to DM81.7m
(Dollars 49.8m) while sales had gained 5.6 per cent to DM2.71bn. This made
the return on sales just above 3 per cent.

LAFARGE Coppee, the French building materials group, expects to continue to
rein in investments in 1992, according to Mr Bertrand Collomb, the chairman,
Reuter reports from Paris.
He said the group anticipates that its net debt will grow modestly this
year. The company can finance development without turning to the bourse for
new equity capital.
Mr Collomb said that the group had set itself a goal of 'a more modest pace
of development than in recent years ..without sacrificing expansion.'

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA yesterday launched its voucher privatisation programme as
Czechs and Slovaks began bidding for the future shares of over half the
country's enterprises.
The 8.5m citizens who earlier this year subscribed to the scheme by buying a
book of vouchers for a nominal sum will have until June 8 to choose the
enterprises in which they want to invest. They will receive their shares
later this year.
A total of Kcs292.6bn (Dollars 9.7bn) worth of equity, calculated on the
book value of some 3,000 enterprises, will be distributed.
The launch of the voucher scheme before next month's general elections is a
success for Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister and leader of the
most popular party in the Czech republic.
The launch was originally scheduled for February and Mr Klaus has waged a
battle with government officials to ensure that bidding would start before
the elections on June 5. His last-minute victory over bureaucratic delays
will allow him to flag the voucher scheme as a personal triumph during his
electoral campaign.
Dazzled by the sheer choice of enterprises, and often lacking basic
information about them, two thirds of the future shareholders have opted to
entrust their vouchers to private investment funds which will select
enterprises for them. Vouchers are expected to be converted into shares by
the autumn, once the selection process is completed.
The initial allocation of shares will be done in the two weeks following
June 8. But enterprises which are over-subscribed will be re-offered for
higher bids.
The process will be carried through five rounds which, government officials
say, will establish a 'valuation' mechanism in voucher terms for the shares.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Pay deal boost for D-Mark and shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, JAMES BLITZ and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN share prices and the D-Mark were boosted yesterday by news that the
German government had reached agreement on a 5.8 per cent wage package with
metalworkers. But market relief was tempered by uncertainty over the impact
of the settlement on the rate of inflation.
The DAX index of 30 leading German shares closed about 2 per cent higher
yesterday, gaining 34.6 points to 1,758. The D-Mark also gave its first
strong performance on currency markets for several weeks. By the end of
European trading yesterday, it was at a three-month high against the dollar
at DM1.5955, and had gained against most currencies in the European Monetary
System.
The markets' bullishness reflected a positive, but not jubilant, response to
the settlement. Markets had been expecting a strike and were pleasantly
surprised at the last-minute turn of events. 'It was a lot better than it
could have been,' said Mr Gunter Kirchhain of Deutsche Bank's
Dusseldorf-based institutional equities team. 'It suggests that the
much-heralded German disease may have turned out to be no more than a viral
infection after all.'
Others attributed the zest in the foreign exchanges to technical factors.
Some D-Mark traders believed the currency's strength yesterday resulted from
continuing uncertainty about the dollar rather than the pay settlement.
Foreign exchange traders fear that the Federal Reserve in Washington might
cut rates at its Federal Open Markets Committee meeting today, widening the
differential between US and German rates still further.
Traders in all markets agreed the settlement was positive for the economy,
but they said the complexities of the deal made immediate assessment of its
impact on inflation difficult.
Mr Hans-Peter Hodniock of James Capel in Frankfurt was emphatic that the
settlement removed the threat of a 'wage-price spiral' in Germany. He hoped
the Bundesbank would take the same view and consider relaxing monetary
policy.
The Bundesbank itself was relatively sanguine. Mr Otmar Issing, the
Bundesbank directorate member responsible for economics, said in London that
the deal was 'a step in the right direction'.
Although wages were still rising by more than the country could afford, Mr
Issing argued that a settlement in the region of 5.5 per cent was in line
with mainstream wage-rise forecasts at the beginning of the year.
Others were less convinced that the deal - which would give an average rise
of 4.8 per cent over 21 months if a previously agreed reduction in the
working week is taken into account - was so positive.
Brokers in equity markets agreed that investors are unlikely to become
enthusiastic buyers until there are clear signs that the Bundesbank has
decided to cut interest rates again. The wage settlement is only one factor
influencing this decision.

The British government was under strong pressure last night to extradite US
pilots involved in the deaths of nine British servicemen during the Gulf
war. A UK inquest ruled they had been 'unlawfully killed' in an incident
involving so-called 'friendly fire'.
The jury's surprise decision may force government law officers into a choice
between souring relations with the US or facing a backlash from the victims'
families and MPs.

FT  19 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG BUYING by 'locals', independent dealers trading on their own account,
drove stock index futures higher after an uncertain start, writes Steve
Thompson.
The June contract on the FT-SE moved from an early low of 2,695 to a high
for the session of 2,730, and was responsible for pulling the underlying
cash market higher. June finished fractionally off its best at 2,729, a
premium of around 15 to fair value and some 30 points above Friday's closing
level.
The upturn in demand for the June contract came with news that German
engineering workers had agreed a pay deal, thereby averting a national
strike.
Turnover in the June FT-SE future totalled around 7,500 lots. The news from
Germany also resulted in exceptionally heavy activity taking place in the
Euro FT-SE option, where volume of 1,731 contracts included 952 calls and
779 puts.
In traded options, turnover of 19,926 lots was sharply down on recent levels
 -last Friday saw 31,994 contracts dealt. BP was the busiest stock option,
with turnover of 2,863. The July 260 calls were the most actively traded
series.
Thorn EMI also emerged as one of the keenly traded stock options, the
September 850 calls providing the lion's share of activity.

FT  19 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in technical retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A STRONG day in the London market, Thorn EMI attained the dubious honour
of being the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 Index in pence terms. The
shares retreated 13 to 870p, with technical factors blamed for the fall.
These included the ending on Friday of dealings in the company's partly-paid
shares. Dealers also pointed out that the second call on the rights issue
stock priced at 390p is due next week, coinciding with the release of the
group's annual figures.
The shares are on County NatWest's buy list, and the broker is predicting
full-year profits of Pounds 253.8m and earnings per share of 50.2p.
BP supported
US support appeared to be the main boost for turnover in British Petroleum,
the most heavily traded stock in London yesterday and which advanced 6 1/2
to 257p. Volume of more than 14m shares was particularly good considering
the low level of business in the general market. BP was also at the top of
the actives list in the London Traded Options Market.
The stock was drifting a couple of pence in the morning but received support
after Shearson Lehman Brothers bought 1.1m shares on behalf of a client.
Also, a 'mildly enthusiastic' note from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken landed on
clients' desks yesterday. Carr believes there is a chance that the dividend
will not be cut this year.
Courtaulds active
The market was attracted to Courtaulds, which is expected to have weathered
the recession and chemicals downturn sufficiently to report a near 7 per
cent rise in annual profits tomorrow. Profits for the year to the end of
March are forecast to come in at around Pounds 197m to Pounds 200m, against
a previous Pounds 186.3m, and the shares recovered 14 to 581p following a
period of slackness.
However, some securities houses decided that the stock had run too far.
Smith New Court was advising clients to take profits yesterday. Mr Richard
Henderson, Nomura's chemicals analyst, was reiterating his belief that the
stock is a sell. He said: 'There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the
company, but the stock does better in bear markets and should probably be on
a 10 to 15 per cent discount to the market.'
Brewer Whitbread bucked the market trend after the company reported annual
figures at the bottom end of market expectations. Profits dropped by 24 per
cent to Pounds 222.1m, the group's first fall in full-year figures in 16
years.
The shares rose initially in response to the company's comment in its
trading statement that it had seen a pick-up in business in the first two
months of the financial year. However, a more sombre analysts' meeting led
to a retreat in the stock, eventually a penny down on the day at 474p after
light turnover of 1.3m.
County NatWest left its current year forecast at Pounds 262m, and pencilled
in Pounds 284m for the following year.
Glaxo was marked down some 15p before the market opened, following a weekend
press report that rival drug group Astra had developed a new ulcer therapy.
The report said the therapy could seriously hurt sales of Glaxo's Zantac,
the world's best-selling drug. However, analysts decided that the report
covered no new ground and the shares opened 6 off and then recovered to
close just a penny down at 735p.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson picked up sharply on press reports that it is
about to negotiate for a link with Banque Nationale de Paris and Dresdner
Bank. The shares were ahead 24 at one stage, but slipped back to close 17 up
at 298p after Dresdner said it was not involved in co-operation talks.
Barclays responded to a Kleinwort Benson recommendation and the view that
Olympia &amp; York debt exposure worries have been overdone. The shares rose 7
to 387p.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton remained weak ahead of today's annual meeting,
declining 5 1/2 to 256p.
Market research company Addison Consultancy saw heavy turnover after a chunk
of the stock that had been left with underwriters following the recent
failed rights issue finally found a home.
The Pounds 16.3m cash call, priced at 12p a share, had been only 2.4 per
cent taken up after principal stakeholder MAI had decided not to take up its
rights. Yesterday, Peel Hunt, Addison's broker, sold 5.6m shares left with
the underwriters for 11 1/2 p apiece. The stock firmed a penny to 11 1/2 p
and turnover reached 13m shares.
Bid speculation surfaced around Croda International, pushing up the
chemicals company's stock 8 1/2 to 191p on turnover of 2m shares, compared
to the weekly average of 3m. The predator was said to be Wardle Storeys, but
the rumour did not appear to have much behind it and Wardle's rise of 23 to
428p was attributed to a stock shortage.
Fading bid hopes were said to have pushed foods group Dalepak down 20 to
393p. In March Dalepak announced it was in talks, but a month later the
talks foundered. It had been hoped that interest would spring from elsewhere
but so far it has not materialised.
Allied-Lyons hardened 8 to 660p ahead of today's results.
Weekend press reports of further connections between Lonrho and Libya saw
the shares down 7 at one stage. However, a firm denial of the reports by the
company helped the shares recover to finish unchanged at 97p.
Among transports, Eurotunnel stood out, the shares advancing 15 to 385p,
boosted by Friday's news that it would not need extra funds to complete the
tunnel, and a decision allowing the operator to use semi-open shuttle wagons
to carry goods, a decision which could save the company around Pounds 100m.
Automated Security Holdings was the market's best performer, the shares
jumping 10 to 18p on speculation that Tomkins could bid for the company.
Tomkins closed unchanged at 515p. Williams Holdings was also mentioned as a
possible suitor and finished 9 stronger at 354p, buoyed by a County NatWest
buy recommendation.

FT  19 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities concentrate on positive news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITY market moved into the second week of the long three-week account
in confident fashion. It shrugged off lingering worries caused by last
week's news that Olympia &amp; York, the international property development
group, had filed for insolvency protection, preferring to concentrate on
good news emerging from Germany and the UK.
In Germany, the threatened strike by engineering workers was called off,
while in London, the market was cheered by an encouraging report issued by
the Confederation of British Industry.
The one slightly disturbing piece of news on an otherwise splendid day for
the equity market came from share turnover revealed by the Stock Exchange.
Volume yesterday - 442.8m shares - was well below recent levels of activity
and may well see the value of customer business carried out for the day drop
below the Pounds 1bn mark. Customer business has only fallen below the
Pounds 1bn figure on two occasions since the general election.
There was no real mood of optimism at many of the morning meetings held at
leading London broking houses, and the FT-SE 100 Index opened in negative
territory, down around 3 points at about 2,680.
Traders were only partly mollified by Wall Street's performance last Friday
evening, and other international markets had wobbled on the Olympia &amp; York
situation.
However, a strong opening by the Footsie future; news that Germany's
engineering unions had accepted a two-year pay deal, thus avoiding a
damaging strike; and the mildly bullish news from the monthly CBI survey,
which provided some evidence that high street sales had risen to their
highest levels for around two years, quickly lifted share prices.
The Footsie was showing a rise within an hour of the start of trading, and
thereafter accelerated to move confidently back above the 2,700 level before
encountering a bout of profit-taking as the session drew to a close. At the
finish the Footsie was 21 points ahead at 2,703.6, having earlier reached a
day's peak of 2,704.5.
The German news, seen by many as removing any near-term threat that the
country's interest rates would move higher, was viewed by leading
marketmakers as providing the real momentum for the UK stock market to
resume its upward push. Sterling performed well all day, especially against
a rapidly appreciating D-Mark, and climbed sharply against the dollar.
Long-dated gilts improved by around  1/4 .
In a day singularly lacking in strong stories, it was left to broker
recommendations to provide much of the impetus for individual stocks,
although there was said to have been some interest in the blue chips due to
report this week.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper and packaging group, was again the weakest
member of the FT-SE 100 constituents in percentage terms, the shares still
feeling the effects of the departure of the company's chief executive.
Suggestions that one of the big US investment banks had extolled the
attractions of the power generators left National Power and PowerGen as the
Footsie's best individual performers.

Wall Street
US STOCK markets took their cue from overseas yesterday, share prices rising
with relief that the Olympia &amp; York bankruptcy situation did not do more
damage to international financial markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed an improvement of 22.94
at 3,376.03.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index moved forward 2.72 to
412.81, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose
2.10 to 576.53. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 151.4m shares.
No one factor dominated market sentiment yesterday, although the mild
reaction of international markets to O &amp; Y's troubles helped US equities
bounce back from two consecutive days of losses.
The market was also helped by yet another fall in bond yields, and by
growing hopes of an interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve's key
policy-making Open Market Committee meets today, and if a decision is taken
to ease monetary policy once more, it is likely to be agreed upon at the
meeting, said analysts.
Among individual stocks, Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 74
3/8 in turnover of some 1.3m shares after the computer group posted fiscal
second-quarter net income of Dollars 1.28 cents a share, up from 93 cents a
year ago.
The market was not unsettled by the figures, but by the company's expression
of concern about the sluggishness of economic conditions and its effect on
earnings.
Hewlett-Packard's warning appeared to trouble other computer stocks,
probably contributing to IBM's poor performance on a day when other leading
stocks shone. IBM finished Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 90 5/8 .
Elsewhere in the sector, Motorola retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 ,
Compaq lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 and Digital Equipment slipped
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 , but Unisys steadied at Dollars 9 1/4 .
Clothing retailer The Gap rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34 3/4 as the market
began to claw back some of the fall incurred last week in the wake of
disappointing first-quarter profits.
Deere &amp; Co weakened Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/2 in heavy trading after
analysts at two broking houses, Smith Barney and Prudential Securities,
reduced their estimates of the agricultural equipment maker's fiscal 1992
earnings.
McDonnell Douglas was down a sharp Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 on
reports that Taiwan Aerospace will propose altering the terms of a joint
venture with McDonnell which will involve the elimination, at least for now,
of a planned equity infusion.
Barnett Banks lost Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 after announcing it will
take a charge to cover the costs of its Dollars 885m stock swap merger with
First Florida Banks. The news sent First Florida shares rocketing Dollars 13
7/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 on the Nasdaq market.
Airgas climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/4 after reporting fiscal
fourth-quarter net income of 33 cents a share, reversing last year's final
quarter loss of 51 cents a share.
On the over-the-counter market, Stokely declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 6
1/8 after the company suspended its dividend on common stock in the wake of
a fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
Toronto was closed yesterday for Victoria Day.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses to strong D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR sank to three-month lows against the D-Mark and the yen
yesterday, as a wave of news from both Germany and Japan undermined traders'
confidence yet again in the US currency, writes James Blitz.
The news that German employers had reached a pay agreement with metalworkers
boosted confidence in the D-Mark after several weeks in the doldrums. A
currency analyst in London said: 'It had been universally expected that
there would be a strike and that the unions would be settling for 6 per
cent. The slightly firmer settlement agreed by the German employers and
unions dispelled fears that the country might not have inflation under
control.'
Simultaneously, dollar holders could not get out of their heads the fear
that the Federal Reserve might cut rates at the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting today. The combination of factors forced the dollar down
to a low of DM1.5930 in European trading, before closing at DM1.5955. In US
options trading, Dollar/D-Mark volatility was being quoted at 10.7/10.9 per
cent for one to three-month options, up from Friday's 10.4/10.7 per cent.
Yesterday's figures for Japan's trade surplus also knocked the confidence of
dollar investors. Traders were still suffering a hangover from comments made
by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for international
affairs, who stated last week that the US administration would like to see a
strong yen to keep Japan's trade surplus low. The news yesterday that
Japan's trade surplus for April had risen 13.4 per cent compared with the
same month last year further undermined their confidence. In European
trading the US currency ended at Y128.75, only slightly above the day's low
of Y128.65.
Analysts believe the odds are still against a cut in US interest rates today
because there were good figures for April's retail sales and industrial
production last week. The feeling is these figures lessened the need for the
Fed to stimulate production with another rate cut. In New York the dollar
ended at DM1.5956 and Y128.80.
The D-Mark's stronger performance against the US unit gave it some leverage
against other European currencies too. It ended a pfennig stronger against
sterling, which stood at DM2.9275. An analyst suggested that sterling's
weaker performance may partly reflect disappointment that recent UK
indicators have not shown a stronger upturn in the economy.
The German currency firmed modestly to around FFr3.3579 from Friday's late
FFr3.3566. However, the Swiss franc gained slightly after Switzerland said
it plans an application for EC membership, and the D-Mark eased to SFr1.4695
from SFr1.4714.

PRUDENTIAL Securities Japan plans to switch from speculative market segments
and concentrate on institutional investors and large corporations, Reuters
reports.
The US group's Japanese unit, a member of the Tokyo Stock Exchange since
1988, did most of its business in Japan with small companies and individual
investors who pursued aggressive investment strategies financed on margin.
These markets have been hit by the decline of Japanese equity values from
their December 1989 high point, the Japan unit said.
The unit named Mr Michio Wakizono a managing director to oversee this shift
in Japanese equity products.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: German bunds advance as engineering
dispute ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds rose strongly through the morning session yesterday
following the announcement of a 5.8 per cent pay settlement in the dispute
between engineering employers and unions.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing 2002 closed at 100.26-34 for a
yield of 7.96 per cent. On Friday the benchmark closed at around 99.97,
where the yield was 8 per cent.
On Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, the June bund futures
contract opened at 87.41 but rose rapidly to hit a high of 87.69. Later in
the day the contract settled to 87.61 and closed at around this level.
Volume was heavy at 79,000 contracts.
While analysts were encouraged by the break-through in pay talks, which
could avert damaging industrial action in key sectors of the German economy,
economic data released later this week could dampen enthusiasm.
Producer price inflation data for April is expected this week and is
believed to show only a slight slowdown in the annual rate of increase from
2.5 per cent in March.
The Bundesbank council holds a regular meeting on Thursday, at which it
could decide to tighten monetary conditions.
However, most analysts thought it was unlikely the central bank would act
ahead of the release of money supply data, which is scheduled for next week.
The Bundesbank's favoured monetary indicator is M3, a broad measure of money
supply. In March, M3 grew at a year-on-year rate of 9.7 per cent, against a
target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. If money growth is higher in April, the
Bundesbank may raise rates.
THE UK government bond market was swept higher by the buoyant mood in
continental Europe and optimism over the outlook for UK inflation, following
the release of better than anticipated retail prices data on Friday.
The June gilt futures contract on Liffe opened at 99.12, having broken the
psychologically important barrier at 99.00 on Friday.
The contract rose to 99.16 during the day, the next significant resistance
barrier according to analysts, before settling to 99.14 by the close of
trading. Volume was sluggish at 24,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the benchmark 9 per cent long-dated gilt maturing 2011
closed at 100 7/8 , for a yield of 8.896 per cent, from an opening level of
100 1/2 .
With the market in a positive mood, the Pounds 850m new gilts launched by
the Bank of England on Friday were quickly exhausted. The bank sold stock in
maturities ranging from 1994 to 2008.
Analysts attributed the positive tone to improved expectations on inflation
following RPI data released on Friday which showed prices rising at a year
on year rate of 4.3 per cent, better than anticipated.
The positive outlook on inflation was reflected in the money markets, where
inter-bank rates remained below the 10 per cent base lending rate for the
first time since rates were cut on May 5. Interbank funds from one month to
one year were trading at around 10 - 9 7/8 per cent.
Tomorrow, the market will be watching retail sales figures for April, hoping
for a post-election improvement in consumer spending.
Retail sales showed a year-on-year fall of 3.7 per cent in March in the run
up to the election. Analysts are hoping for positive annual growth of at
least 2 per cent for last month.
US Treasury prices firmed slightly in quiet trading yesterday as investors
turned their attention to today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's
policy-making Open Market Committee.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 102
7/32 , yielding 7.801 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/32
at 100 9/16 , to carry a yield of 5.050 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic data, prices edged higher on hopes that the
FOMC will authorise an easing of monetary policy. Analysts are divided as to
the likelihood of another cut in interest rates. Last week's
bigger-than-expected growth in money supply dampened expectations of an
ease, but there are enough optimists in the market to keep prices on an
upward bias until after the FOMC meeting.
If the Fed does agree to ease, observers believe it would act promptly,
probably before tomorrow's two-year note auction.
JAPANESE government bond prices were firmer overnight in Tokyo, with the
strength of the yen on the foreign exchange markets and the buoyancy of
equity prices boosting confidence.
The benchmark government bond issue No. 129 closed the Tokyo day on a yield
of 5.515 per cent, sharply better than the 5.535 per cent seen at the close
on Friday.
Bond prices slid at the end of last week as the equity market slumped and
traders focused on the exposure of Japanese financial institutions to
Olympia and York, the troubled property development company.
However, yesterday the Nikkei 225 stock market index rose 368 points to
close at 18,443.
The yen also strengthened against the dollar, breaking through Y130
overnight and consolidating gains in European trading. By late afternoon in
London, the Japanese currency was trading at Y128.75 against the dollar.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIYO Fishery, the Japanese fishing company attempting to transform itself
into a general food producer, reported a pre-tax loss of Y3.6bn (Dollars
27.6m) for the year to the end of March, reduced from a Y6.1bn loss in
fiscal 1990.
The company said streamlining its trawler operations led to a 3 per cent
fall in sales to Y525.9bn, but the success of its restructuring programme
would create a pre-tax profit of Y1bn in the current year on sales virtually
unchanged at Y526bn.
Mainline fish products fell from 57.1 per cent to 54.1 per cent of total
sales, but sales from other types of processed foods rose from 8 per cent to
only 9.4 per cent of the total, reflecting tough competition in the Japanese
food industry.
The company said the downturn in the Japanese economy had affected sales,
although consumer demand for daily goods, including fresh and processed
foods, had remained healthy, with a 4.8 per cent increase in chain store
sales last year.
Taiyo said capital spending for the current year would fall to Y4.1bn from
Y5.3bn, and the company revised forecasts for consolidated returns, with a
pre-tax loss now expected to be Y2.6bn, up from Y1.5bn.

SONY Music Entertainment, the music arm of the Sony group, saw
unconsolidated pre-tax profits fall just over 3 per cent to Y16bn (Dollars
122m) for the fiscal year to March because of the costs of its new listing
on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Investors were pleased that the drop in earnings was limited to 3 per cent
and bid up the price of Sony Music shares by Y130 to Y4,830 yesterday.
The company which last year signed a contract with pop star Michael Jackson
recorded an after-tax profits decline of 8.8 per cent to Y8.5bn.
But the company saw a strong 10.9 per cent rise in sales to Y92.9bn, thanks
to a 13 per cent increase at its domestic record division to Y52.3bn, and a
16 per cent advance at its international record division to Y12.3bn.
For the year to March 1993, Sony Music expects a 3.8 per cent increase in
sales to Y96.4bn and a 32.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y21.4bn.
Sony Chemicals, the videotape manufacturing affiliate, suffered a sharp fall
in earnings due to sluggish demand from the electronics industry.
The company posted a 22.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y3.1bn on a
5.4 per cent fall in sales to Y36.1bn. After-tax profits fell 21.8 per cent
to Y1.6bn.
Sales of magnetic videotapes, the company's mainstay, fell 13.8 per cent to
Y16.5bn.
Bonding materials, such as industrial glues and tapes, fell 5.9 per cent to
Y8.5bn due to the slowdown in the electrical and construction industries.
Sales of electrical parts grew 20.6 per cent to Y7.3bn, thanks to increasing
demand for camcorders and compact disc players.
For the current year Sony Chemicals expects a slow recovery in demand due to
sluggish capital spending by companies. The company forecasts a 4.2 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y3bn on a 7.2 per cent rise in sales to Y38.7bn.

</DATELINE>

HEWLETT-Packard reported a 40 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings as
the computer and electronic equipment manufacturer continued to outperform
competitors in key market segments, including printers, minicomputers and
computer workstations.
Although earnings were at the high end of Wall Street estimates, HP's stock
price declined yesterday amid concerns that poor economic conditions in key
international markets may affect future earnings. The company's shares
closed down Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 74 3/8 .
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 326m, or Dollars 1.28 a share, up
from Dollars 233m, or 93 cents, in the second quarter of 1991.
Net revenue totalled Dollars 4.2bn, up 12 per cent from Dollars 3.7bn in the
same period last year. US revenues grew 14 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, while
revenues from outside the US rose 11 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn.
Company officials said that second-quarter sales in Japan had declined 20
per cent from the same period last year, primarily affecting sales of
analytical instruments and computer workstations.
However, in addition to the strengthening of business in the US, the company
saw a rebound in UK sales, after a period of slow growth.
New orders booked during the quarter rose 16 per cent in the US, while order
growth overseas grew 8 per cent, for overall growth of 11 per cent.
'We turned a reasonable revenue increase into outstanding profit growth,
thanks to our ongoing efforts to manage expenses,' said Mr John Young,
president and chief executive.
'We are concerned about the near term because of uncertainty over the US
recovery as well as sluggish conditions in some key economies around the
world,' he added.
For the six-month period, net earnings increased 44 per cent to Dollars
632m, or 2.49 a share, from Dollars 438m, or Dollars 1.76, in the first half
of fiscal 1991.
Net revenue increased 13 per cent to Dollars 8bn including Dollars 3.4bn in
US sales and Dollars 4.6bn from outside the US.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Taiwan proposes new Douglas deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN Aerospace has proposed a new deal with McDonnell Douglas, the US
aircraft manufacturer, which would initially rule out any large equity
investment by Taiwanese investors.
However, McDonnell Douglas, which needs cash from an equity sale to fund the
development of its new MD-12 jumbo jet, indicated yesterday the plan would
not be acceptable.
The Taiwanese proposal would involve setting up a third company to act as a
financing arm to buy aircraft from the US group.
Last year the US company unveiled a plan to hive off its Douglas commercial
aircraft operations and sell up to 49 per cent of the business to Asian
partners. The plan was designed to help it launch the MD-12 programme.
McDonnell Douglas in November signed a memorandum of understanding with
Taiwan Aerospace in which the 29 per cent government-owned company would pay
Dollars 2bn for a stake of up to 40 per cent in the Douglas commercial
aircraft business.
However, the venture has been criticised by Taiwan legislators concerned by
the US company's financial position and declining share of the commercial
airliner market. A recent study by Taiwan said the deal was 'high risk", but
offered a 'great opportunity'.
The new proposal appears to be a compromise aimed at managing the risks
while attempting to reassure potential investors and critics. Under the
scheme, Taiwan proposes to acquire a large number of MD-12 aircraft, with
the option of investing in an equity stake later.
However, McDonnell said yesterday: 'What both parties have understood from
the beginning of our talks are the basic requirements for an equity
partnership. McDonnell Douglas will insist that partners take an equity
position to insure the long-term success of the new company.'
It said there were different ways a final deal could be structured, and this
could include the purchase of a number of the aircraft Taiwan Aerospace
would be involved in producing.
Mr Denny Ko, Taiwan Aerospace president, outlined the new proposals at a
meeting held to attract private investors to the deal. He said the deal
would set up a separate finance company with government and private backing,
which would place an order for up to Dollars 2bn worth of MD-12 aircraft. It
would provide McDonnell Douglas with a standby letter of credit for the full
cost of the aircraft, but conditional on the US company booking orders for
up to 30 new aircraft with airline customers.
Mr Ko said another option under consideration would involve granting
McDonnell Douglas government-backed loans convertible to equity at a later
date if the company performed on target.
Taiwan might initially also make a token equity investment as a gesture of
good faith. Taiwan Aerospace is still hoping to attract to Taiwan the
production of the wings and fuselage of the MD-12.
McDonnell Douglas has been anxious to reorganise its commercial aircraft
business and find equity partners to help support development of the MD-12.
This month it unveiled the proposed design for its new aircraft, a
four-engine double-deck jumbo which challenges Boeing's 747.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Goldman, Sachs buys Omni's stake
in Sulzer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN, Sachs, the US investment bank, has acquired the 20 per cent stake
in Sulzer Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, formerly held by Omni, the
collapsed Swiss investment group.
Goldman paid about Dollars 180m for the shareholding, which will be broken
up and placed through the market.
The transaction marks a victory for Sulzer in a long, but discreet, tussle
with the Omni administrators over disposition of the shares.
The administrators, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, wanted a quick sale and thought they
could get a premium price by finding an industrial partner who would be
interested in participating in Sulzer's business.
Sulzer directors agreed in principle, but were unable to come to terms with
any of the candidates brought forward. In particular, it turned out that
they were determined to remain independent and were unwilling to concede a
significant share of decision-making in the group with the shares.
Although the block constituted 20 per cent of the shares, Sulzer has a
clause in its bylaws enabling it to restrict the proportion of shares voted
by any one shareholder to 2 per cent.
In March, the directors said the failure to reach an agreement was due to
the insistence of interested parties in a majority holding in Sulzer or in
domination of certain business sectors. Privately, they said it was not
their problem, and the best solution would be to sell the shares in the
market.
Goldman acquired 44,000 shares in Sulzer yesterday morning. The transaction
was completed before a 10-for-one share split, separately designed by Sulzer
to make its shares more marketable.
Goldman said it would place the shares in blocks 'not to exceed' 2 per cent
with Swiss and international investors. A spokeswoman for the investment
bank said last night the placing was going well.
While no terms for the sale were revealed, a guide for the value of the
block was established in early March with the sale of another 5 per cent
block associated with the Omni bankruptcy.
At the time, Sulzer Brothers and Ebara, the leading Japanese pump maker,
agreed to take 5 per cent share stakes in each other. The Sulzer shares for
the transaction were valued at SFr66m (Dollars 43.40m).

Shares in South Staffordshire Water Holdings leapt 62p to 905p last Friday
as the water utility revealed a 36 per cent advance in profits for the year
to March 31. The shares continued their rise yesterday, putting on a further
28p to close at 933p.
The pre-tax surplus of Pounds 8.74m (Pounds 6.43m) was struck on turnover 11
per cent ahead at Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 43.4m).
Mr Edwin Thompson, chairman, said the company's strong financial performance
over the year had enabled it to restrict the increase in charges to below
the maximum available for both domestic and commercial customers.
The final dividend is 26.7p, which together with the average statutory
dividend and the interim, makes 40.2p for the year - covered 3.7 times by
earnings of 148p (104p).

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Small businesses will see merger benefits -
Lloyds' claim to a sector critical of high street banking services / The
Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE bank with the stiffest charges for small business customers
proposes making a takeover bid for its rival with the lowest, eyebrows are
bound to be raised
Nonetheless, Lloyds is now claiming that small businesses would eventually
benefit if it was to buy Midland.
Lloyds says it will offer Midland shareholders much better terms than the
rival Hongkong Bank But now it has to convince its customers and also the
competition authorities of the benefits a takeover of Midland would bring.
It has a great deal of scepticism, in the City as well as among the general
public, to overcome. 'Lloyds has got an awfully long way to go to convince
people that its customers will benefit,' one stockbroker analyst said.
So Lloyds has begun a charm offensive to persuade the world that the merger
will mean enormous benefits to bank customers.
Those chiefly in its sights are small businesses, a politically powerful
group whose discontent with existing high street banking services has been
voiced repeatedly over the past year.
As Lloyds and Midland each have about 15 per cent of this market, any
combined bank would immediately take its place alongside Barclays and
National Westminster as a new market leader.
Lloyds has not been enormously popular with small businesses. Last year its
new package for them was described as 'weak and one-sided' by the Forum of
Private Business, a lobby group with nearly 20,000 members.
More recently, a study by Rochester Research has shown that Lloyds charges
its small business customers sub-stantially more than the other Big Four
clearers, while Midland costs the least.
Some small businesses would save about 20 per cent in charges if they kept
their account with Midland rather than Lloyds.
Lloyds claims this picture would change dramatically after the merger. It
says the economies to be achieved by merging with Midland would enable it to
make a quantum leap in its small business services, thereby helping
stimulate long-term economic growth.
There is no doubt that several of the new services Lloyds says it envisages
offering are certainly very enticing by comparison with anything offered by
it or its main rivals at the present time.
To start with, new businesses would not have to pay any tariff charges for
their first two years. 'This is something no other bank offers,' says Mr
Brian Pitman, the chief executive at Lloyds.
Small businessmen everywhere should find other ideas being floated by Lloyds
mouth-watering, even if they cannot help noticing that the bank has not been
very forthcoming about what it would charge.
Even the smallest new businesses would be able to tap equity capital, in
amounts as low as Pounds 5,000, from a new Pounds 100m venture capital fund.
Businesses would also be able to borrow on fixed rates for up to seven
years.
Small businesses would be given help with cash flow when large companies
paid them late, through a new invoice discounting service.
They would also be able to get specialist advice on computer services and
more advice in co-operation with the Department of Trade and Industry.
So instead of there being less market competition in the UK after the
merger, Lloyds believes there would be more intense rivalry, as the two
other large banks, Barclays and NatWest, would be forced to improve their
services.
Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, last week
welcomed the package from Lloyds, but pointed out that Lloyds and Midland
have distinctly different approaches to their small business customers and
merging their operations could be problematic.
His reserve is based partly on the close relationship that Midland has
forged with its small business customers. The clearer's business branch
managers are trained at seminars at which Mr Mendham and other leading small
businessmen teach.
Last week the FPB - whose policies are based on periodic polls among its
membership - swung behind the Hongkong offer for Midland, saying that it
would bring more benefit in the long term to small businesses through the
injection of new ideas into the British banking system.
Against this Mr Pitman points to the Pounds 700m cost savings which Lloyds
expects to achieve, compared to only Pounds 150m envisaged in the Hongkong
bid.
He foresees powerful synergies springing from a Lloyds merger with Midland,
and small businessmen taking their place alongside shareholders as the
principal beneficiaries.
Time will tell whether this argument wins general acceptance, especially
where it counts, at the Office of Fair Trading and at Westminster.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ian Maxwell sued in High Court for
unspecified damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN MAXWELL, the son of Mr Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, and
director of the company that was supposed to have managed most of the
Maxwell empire's pension funds, has been sued in the High Court.
The writ claiming unspecified damages was issued on May 8 by provisional
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management where more than half the
Pounds 886m of pension money may have disappeared.
The action lists a series of transactions worth more than Pounds 400m where
Mr Maxwell is accused by Robson Rhodes, the liquidators, of breaching his
fiduciary duties as a director of BIM.
The new proceedings follow a similar writ brought last December against his
brother, Mr Kevin Maxwell, in which the liquidators sought damages of Pounds
450m.
Mr Cooper said yesterday that about Pounds 448m of the pension fund money
had either disappeared or had been wrongly transferred from BIM.
The black hole in the pension fund has hit more than 30,000 employees and
pensioners in Mirror Group Newspapers and the private companies who until Mr
Robert Maxwell's death last November had assumed their pensions were safe.
Some Pounds 238m are in the liquidator's hands although many of the
underlying investments were highly illiquid, Mr Cooper said.
Unlike in the earlier case against his brother, Mr Ian Maxwell has not been
required to surrender his passport nor have any of his assets been frozen as
a result of the writ.
Robson Rhodes is currently trying to establish whether the liquidators on
behalf of pensioners have a right to investments transferred to banks as
security for loans to the Robert Maxwell Group and other private Maxwell
family companies.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Bank of England warns against dangers of excessive
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public's growing expecta-tion that it should be protected against all
loss caused by the failure of a financial institution could hurt the
long-term health of the financial system, Mr Eddie George, deputy governor
of the Bank of England, warned yesterday.
In a speech to the Royal Institute for International Affairs, Mr George said
politicians and investors must understand the trade-off between the benefits
of free, competitive financial markets and the social benefits of
regulation.
Cautioning against the constraint on competition of excessive regulation, he
said minimum standards should not be so demanding that financial
institutions - such as banks, building societies, securities houses and
insurance companies - could never conceivably fail. Nor should people expect
to be fully compensated by the government.
'I have a sense that society is coming to expect an awful lot, including all
the benefits of free markets on the one hand, and increasingly high
standards of protection against a widening range of financial risks on the
other,' he said.
Regulation was not a 'free good' available without limit, but a cost which
the consumer ultimately had to bear. Regulators could not reasonably be
asked to guarantee 100 per cent success in consumer protection.
A situation where depositors and investors felt they were relieved of all
responsibility for counterparty risk would place an intolerable burden on
regulation.
On fraud, Mr George said it was no more possible for regulation to prevent
all abuse of the financial system than it was for the police to eradicate
all crime.
The Bank of England has been criticised for failing to intervene earlier in
the activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Mr George did not say where the line between conflicting objectives should
be drawn. 'There has to be a balance, but that balance is difficult to pin
down,' he said.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK government pressed to act against US 'friendly fire'
pilots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced calls last night to take action over the involvement of
US pilots in the deaths of nine British servicemen during the Gulf war,
after a UK inquest ruled the victims had been 'unlawfully killed'.
The jury's decision could force government law officers to choose between
souring US-UK relations or facing a backlash from the victims' families and
MPs.
However, indications were that British law officers have little jurisdiction
over a 'friendly fire' war incident outside the UK and allegedly committed
by foreigners. The government may be able only to complain to the US
government - which would fall far short of some demands for the possible
extradition of the pilots.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson, QC, counsel for the families, said there was no
defence for the pilots' actions under international rules of war. The jury
had found they had behaved recklessly in not checking the target
co-ordinates before opening fire.
According to a jury statement, 'there were clear errors and failure to
observe recognised procedures for engaging the enemy'.
Labour called for a Commons statement and for Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, to give extradition proceedings 'serious consideration' if
the US authorities did not co-operate.
Last night the Ministry of Defence said only that the government would be
'considering the implications of the jury's findings and verdict'.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told the US government last week of
the victims' families' concern about the US pilots' refusal to give evidence
to the Oxford inquest. But ministers have shied away from public protests
against the US.
Mr John Major is likely to face questions on the incident in the Commons
this afternoon.
The soldiers, six Royal Fusiliers and three Queens Own Highlanders, died
when two US A10 aircraft fired Maverick missiles at their Warrior armoured
troop carriers in the Iraqi desert on February 26 last year.
Mr Mark Stephens, solicitor for the families, said the verdict meant the
jury had found US pilots had committed manslaughter. 'We will be asking for
the papers to be handed to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view
that criminal proceedings could be contemplated,' he said.
Mr Nicholas Gardiner, the Oxford coroner, told the jury that to bring an
unlawful killing verdict it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
the pilots acted in a way that would have created an obvious and serious
risk to friendly forces, and that either they gave no thought to the
possibility of that risk or, if they did, they chose to ignore it.
Last night the US Air Force in Washington said it had yet to receive the
detailed findings of the jury and it would be inappropriate to comment. But
it added: 'It is obvious that a terrible accident occurred in the fog of war
on the battlefield, and that the questions raised in this inquest and in
other forums may simply never be resolved. We reiterate our deep compassion
for the families.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Gas market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Sir James McKinnon of Ofgas was quick to point out, yesterday's launch of
Alliance Gas marked a welcome development in the UK gas market. The joint
venture between BP, Statoil and Norsk Hydro has its own gas field from the
start. Most previous entrants have set up as intermediaries, aiming to
profit from the enforced reduction to 40 per cent in the industrial market
share of British Gas. Although they may make fast inroads initially, their
profit represents an additional cost for users which they may ultimately be
unwilling to bear.
In the short term, Alliance is well placed to buy supplies from British Gas.
After 1996, the Norwegians will bring significant long-term supplies of
their own to the table. Add in BP's marketing skills and the agreed venture
with East Midlands Electricity, and Alliance should offer steady competition
to the monopolist: hence the regulator's pleasure.

FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Total
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the French government's decision to reduce its stake in
Total looks curious. The world market for oil assets is severely depressed,
European refining margins are weak and Total's first-half results are
expected to be poor. All the same, its shares have performed well in recent
years, supported lately by overseas demand on hopes for the Cusiana field in
Colombia.
Like the recent sale of 2.3 per cent of Elf, selling most of the Total stake
fits the policy of tidying up holdings as part of a wider privatisation
programme. Were it not for the group's complicated share structure, the sale
might raise FFr9bn (Pounds 900m). The more likely figure is nearer FFr6bn,
which will scarcely ease the budget deficit.

FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread's 24 per cent drop in profits may partly reflect the concentration
of its business in recession-bound south-east England. That does not
automatically mean, however, that it is particularly well positioned to take
advantage of recovery. With a beer market share of just over 13 per cent, it
is hardly a top league player: even the much-vaunted Boddington brand still
only accounts for about 10 per cent of its beer business. Moreover, the
government's insistence on a reduction in its pub estate has led it into
lease arrangements which seem bound to reduce the price it obtains for beer.
Granted, Whitbread is not the only brewer grappling with this problem, but,
even in a recovery, there is no guarantee that beer will generate the cash
needed to support the company's unwieldy collection of retail businesses.
The only real justification for Whitbread staying in hotels is that it would
currently be too expensive to exit. It may now be the largest off-licence
retailer in the UK, but this is a low-margin activity whose growth potential
must be in doubt.
It would help if Whitbread had more of an international dimension, but its
decision to abandon the European Pizza Hut franchise suggests it has turned
its back on this priority. Perhaps the strategic direction will be redefined
after Sir Michael Angus takes over as chairman this summer. In the meantime
there is little reason for the shares to outperform, although they are
underpinned by a gross yield of nearly 5 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only have German engineering workers struck a pay deal of less than 6
per cent without a strike. They are also committed to an increase of only
3.4 per cent next year. That should go a long way towards breaking the
wage-price spiral. Add in expectations of a downward lurch in inflation
during the summer as last year's energy tax increases fall out of the
equation, and it becomes easy to see why financial markets are speculating
about easier Bundesbank policy.
The snag remains the rate at which M3 money is expanding. Though there are
technical reasons why increasing interest rates would make the problem
worse, the Bundesbank would surely suffer a serious loss of credibility if
it eased while money growth was nearly twice the target ceiling. Besides, if
its worry about the wage round has diminished, it still has to keep up
pressure on the government to curb the budget deficit. Money may soon start
to move out of cash in anticipation of an eventual rate cut, but equities
are unlikely to maintain the pace set by yesterday's 2 per cent rise of the
DAX index.

FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: House view at the Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This time almost exactly a year ago builders and mortgage-lenders were
queueing up to trumpet a revival in the UK housing market. Now they and
other commentators are understandably more coy, which is why an article in
the May issue of the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin makes interesting,
not to say provocative, reading. With the help of a little econometric
modelling its authors conclude that reduced repossessions are likely to have
more impact on house prices than an interest rate change, and that prices
could rise by as much as 5 per cent given a 20,000 fall in the number of
houses repossessed.
Unfortunately events in the real world look less encouraging. All those
politically inspired rescue schemes which hit the headlines after Christmas
have gone quiet, though to be fair to building societies attempts to
persuade borrowers to become overnight tenants have met with a frosty
response. First-quarter county court statistics and Halifax figures from
November to April imply that the problem may have eased - but the evidence
of other building societies is mixed and few would bet on this year's
repossessions total ending much below 1991's 75,000-80,000.
Lenders are no doubt taking a more constructive stance: but it is a moot
point whether they, with or without government help, can afford to be more
lenient. As the Bank study points out, that might encourage others to
default or engage in reckless borrowing, thinking they could escape any
adverse consequences of their actions. The grim reality remains that there
is no quick fix to a repossessions crisis caused by the first fall in
nominal house prices since the 1950s and the high loan to house value ratios
of recent years. Buyers will expect discounts and incentives for some time.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Surge in support for Perot shakes Bush and Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROSS PEROT, buoyed by the first national opinion poll to put him ahead in
the race for the presidency, said yesterday that 'grassroots America' was
less interested in his stand on various issues than in his promise 'to take
out the trash and clear out the barn' in Washington.
Mr Perot brandished a large shovel emblazoned with the American flag to
prove his point in the course of an extraordinary breakfast television
interview. He said he would formally declare his independent candidacy
'whenever the time feels right'.
The Texas businessman's surge in the polls has clearly shaken the campaigns
of both the Republican and Democratic candidates. The latest Time-CNN poll
gave him 33 per cent against 28 per cent for President George Bush and 24
per cent for Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Mr Perot was sufficiently emboldened to break what was to have been a 60-day
purdah devoted to boning up on policy issues. Asked if that time had been
well spent to date, he responded in a way that goes to the heart of his
appeal.
'Well, it's interesting. As soon as I said that I was going to spend some
time, the phone banks went crazy. The volunteers said: 'We're not interested
in positions. Everybody has detailed positions. Nobody implements them.'
Then the next wave I got from informed people, kind of close to the
(Washington, DC) Beltway, says: 'Perot, there are good positions all over
the place. You don't need to create new ones.' So I started reading the
positions that exist. They've got an interesting point. There are great
ideas that could fix most of the problems our country faces.
'Everybody sits around and talks about them. Nobody does anything about
them. So getting the good positions is not the problem. Taking action in
Washington is apparently an unnatural event. But that's what the people
want. If they put me there, that's what we'll do. We'll have action.'
In another interview yesterday, Mr Perot attacked Mr Bush for his earlier
support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 'My position is, if you don't
like guys like Saddam Hussein - and obviously the president didn't in the
end - don't spend 10 years and billions of dollars creating him.
Vice-president and President Bush made Saddam Hussein what he is today.'
Both the Bush and Clinton campaigns hope the Perot bubble will somehow burst
of its own accord, or be punctured by media scrutiny.
Neither candidate has yet worked out a way to attack Mr Perot. Both suffer
from the difficulty that national interest in the remaining primaries, in
which Mr Perot is not taking part, has declined with the respective party
nominations assured. The public already seems to be looking ahead to the
election proper in the autumn.
The president, additionally, has made little impression in his many public
appearances since the Los Angeles riots. This is been tailored to different
audiences and lacked coherence, and partly because, after a brief truce, the
old political divisions are resurfacing in Washington about how to deal with
inner city deprivation.

Prospects may look bleak for Olympia &amp; York, but they could be worse. Take
the Jubilee line extension, for example. Notwithstanding the government's
tough public stance, the chances of it finding the Pounds 400m that O &amp; Y
was supposed to contribute to the cost of the project are pretty high.
One reason lies in Westminster tube station, which would need to be adapted
as part of the extension. Plans for new suites of offices for MPs on top of
the tube station are governed by the proposed changes to it; a decision to
abandon the extension would mean going back to the drawing board.
By the most optimistic estimate the offices will not be ready for use until
1997, and a motion complaining about working conditions for MPs and staff
has already attracted support from 110 MPs, O&amp;Y may find it has more friends
at court than it expected.

The director of The Spectator magazine was running a few minutes late when
he arrived for Thursday's board meeting at the St James's headquarters of

The problem was the door was shut. And there was no sign of a bell that

raised a response. As a last resort he turned to his car phone. That ought
to get someone to the door.
There was no answer.
In the end Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, owner of The
Spectator, gave it all up as a bad job and went off to dinner. The
experience will do little to temper Black's long-held view that journalists,

It was at the expense of his British colleague, Douglas Hurd, and his visit

through which all diplomatic visitors have dutifully traipsed for the
greater glorification of one Hans-Dietrich.
On this occasion, Genscher reminded Hurd that it was also the home town of
that great composer, so beloved of the British, Georg Friedrich Handel.
Indeed, Handel had actually composed a hymn of honour to his home town,
Genscher told Hurd.
It was only later as the two listened to a local church performance of
Handel's Messiah that the pfennig finally dropped, Genscher giggled.
Understanding finally came to Hurd during the Halle-lujah chorus . . .

If any captain of industry needs reminding how important it is to cultivate

who picked up another prestige job yesterday - the chairmanship of Inchcape.
He is already deputy chairman of the TSB and Guinness and has collected an
impressive list of other non-executive directorships.
Sir David's career at the helm of Vickers, one of the grand old names of
British engineering, is said to have been a great success. He rescued
Rolls-Royce Motors from bankruptcy, merged it into Vickers and tried to
knock some sense into a company which had long since lost its way. He has
campaigned against geriatric chief executives who hang on well past
retirement age, so there is no surprise that he is leaving Vickers this
month.
Even so he is leaving a company which has just cut its dividend and where
there is a question mark over its future strategy and untested leadership.
Some investors might wish that Sir David had waived his own retirement rules
and stuck around to pilot Vickers out of its current problems.
The chairmanship of a successful company like Inchcape should pose a less
daunting challenge.

It may have taken US business tycoons such as the Rockefellers several
generations to move into politics, but in Russia it all seems to be
happening at once. Konstantin Borovoi, who founded the Russian Commodities
Exchange and the Russian Stock Exchange, has now started his own political
party.
The Economic Freedom Party, dedicated to 'protecting economic liberty', was
founded at a meeting of 3,000 brokers in his exchange. Not surprisingly, it
unanimously voted Borovoi chairman.
The chairman, a former maths professor, denied his move was prompted by
falling profits in his exchange since the January price rises made commodity
dealing less profitable. Instead, he said, he had finally succumbed to two
years of pressure from 'famous political and public leaders of liberal
orientation' who had consistently nagged him to found a party.
There is now, he said, 'a vast social group, people who represent a new
economy'. Altogether it numbers around 40m people and 'so far it has no
political power,' he says.
The desideratum for those who wish to be associated with the party? 'High
moral standards,' says Borovoi, who claims he never pays bribes.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Partners pull back from the brink: Germany's social contract
is intact despite a bruising pay round and unification costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gasp of relief that reverberated across Germany yesterday morning was
almost audible. Against all the odds, and literally at a few minutes to
midnight, trade union leaders and employers in the mighty engineering
industry stepped back from the brink of outright conflict and agreed a new
pay deal.
Two days of painstaking, snail's pace negotiations, much of it behind closed
doors between just two key negotiators, and for most of the time looking
condemned to failure, brought an agreement for Germany's 4m engineering
workers which both sides can present as a sensible compromise.
It is below 6 per cent, close enough to the 5.4 per cent awarded to public
sector workers 10 days ago. It is also a 21-month deal, buying the employers
sorely needed breathing space at a time of growing cost pressures and
economic uncertainty.
Just when everything looked gloomy, after a bruising 11-day public sector
strike, public squabbling within the ranks of the government, the economy
slowing and the budget deficit bloated, and a worrying growth in support for
the extreme right in the polls, Germany's famed social contract held intact
and a deal was done. The Frankfurt stock exchange took the cue with a leap
of 34.36 points (almost 2 per cent) in the DAX index.
The first good news for the German political and economic establishments in
months coincided with a second apparent victory for good sense: the
confidently predicted recommendation by the Ministry of Defence to pull out
of the multi-national European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project with Britain,
Italy and Spain. Although the decision has yet to be finalised, it is taken
for granted in a wave of virtual euphoria in the German press and much of
the political establishment.
With the notable exception of Die Welt, the conservative daily newspaper,
editorials across the country congratulated Mr Volker Ruhe, the new defence
minister, for cancelling the government's most glaring prestige project.
They praised him for reaping a tangible 'peace dividend' from the end of the
Cold War, and giving an example on how to save money for the far more urgent
reconstruction of east Germany.
The trouble with this double dose of good sense is that things may not be
quite so simple. For German industry, at least, the events of the past two
days contain both good and bad elements.
In the short term, the pay deal and the EFA decision may be good news: on
the one hand a bloody strike has been avoided, and a relatively modest pay
deal agreed. On the other, a headline-grabbing gesture has been made to
prune government spending, and show prudence to the rest of the economy.
In the longer term, both developments are more worrying. The engineers' deal
is still expensive, and it confirms an agreed cut in working hours next year
from 37 to 36 hours a week - in a country where the working week is already
the world's shortest. A decision to pull out of EFA will leave German
industry on the sidelines in a crucial area of high technology, and
seriously damage the country's reputation as a reliable international
partner.
As far as the engineers' pay deal is concerned, the clear majority of
commentators clearly believes it is good news. Gesamtmetall, the engineering
employers' association, welcomed above all the duration of the deal. Mr
Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the president, said it was 'an important step away
from the false wage moves of the current year', indicating a gradual return
to stability.
The one dissenting voice was that of Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the
German chamber of commerce and industry. He said that this particular wage
award was still far too high. 'This agreement will lead to further
rationalisation, and the scrapping of yet more jobs.' He was distressed that
the two sides had not agreed to postpone the cut in working hours.
Economists had mixed, but generally positive feelings. 'The German economy
has come out of this with one black eye,' said Mr Willi Leibfritz, head of
the macroeconomics department at the Ifo economic institute in Munich. He
agreed that if IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, had hung on and
gone on strike for 6 per cent or more, the combination of upward pressure on
parallel pay negotiations (for printers, building and textile workers, for
example) and the loss of production from the strikes would have left the
economy with two black eyes and a bloody nose to boot.
Instead, the economy has emerged bruised but unbowed. In any case, most
economic forecasts allowed for wage increases of between 5.5 and 6 per cent
this year - compared with an average of 7 per cent last year - and still
expect at least 1 per cent growth in gross national product (in west
Germany) this year, or 1.5 per cent in gross domestic product.
But why were the engineering workers prepared to settle for so much less
than their original demand of 9.5 per cent? 'One political strike is
enough,' Mr Leibfritz said, reflecting a widely held view that after the
public sector stoppage they would have attracted little public sympathy.
On the positive side, too, is the conviction that the IG Metall deal is the
key to the current annual wage round: 'No trade union will dare call an
extended strike now,' says Mr Jurgen Pfister, chief economist at Commerzbank
in Frankfurt.
'The wage round is as good as over,' said a trade union researcher. 'The one
person who must be really relieved is Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies (leader of the
OTV public sector workers' union). She is facing a revolt from the grass
roots over her 5.4 per cent deal, and now she can say that the mighty IG
Metall has scarcely done better.'
The worry is nevertheless that the rate of pay rises is well above the 4 per
cent target recommended by the five wise men (the government's independent
economic advisers) in their last report - a target seen as essential to cope
with the greatest challenge of all, the reconstruction of the east German
economy.
'German wage rounds, by and large, used to be not too far distant from the
macroeconomic needs of the country,' Mr Leibfritz said. 'We are also used to
relatively high increases in productivity. But for the coming years we need
to avoid inflation, or the financing of the east will become very
difficult.'
That is certainly a view shared by the German Bundesbank, whose president,
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, also cautioned yesterday against excessive euphoria.
'The Bundesbank doesn't have any new room for manoeuvre,' Mr Pfister of
Commerzbank said. 'But in the second half of the year, if the money supply
comes down towards the target zone (3.5 to 5.5 per cent growth), there is a
better chance of an interest rate cut.' At least it removes the pressure for
another increase in interest rates, Mr Leibfritz believes. Mr Schlesinger
simply says that the monetary brakes will remain on until money supply is
under control.
One of the Bundesbank's abiding complaints is that the government in Bonn,
and those in the 16 Lander, have failed to make adequate budget savings
since unification, to make room for spending in the east. The public sector
borrowing requirement is a crucial factor behind excessive credit expansion,
in turn a key element in the current 8 per cent-plus growth in broadly
defined money supply.
In the light of that argument, the decision to pull out of the EFA project -
or the Jager 90 as it is known in Germany - should be seen as a good move in
Frankfurt. The long-range budget to 2005 has DM12bn set aside for the
fighter. It is also seen as a very shrewd political move by Mr Ruhe, former
secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU). Press response suggests it will be overwhelmingly popular with the
voters, except in Bavaria where most of the jobs will be lost.
The most immediate political problem is that it will alienate the
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), whose leader Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister, yesterday demanded a top-level meeting with Mr Kohl on
the issue. Mr Waigel is already feeling uncomfortable in the coalition, with
the right-wing Republicans breathing down his neck in Bavaria, and the snub
to his party over Jager 90 can only make matters worse.
The debate over the aircraft has been thus far one-sided and ill-informed.
It has become a byword for government extravagance on a Cold War project.
Yet there is no serious alternative aircraft available for what the
Luftwaffe wants - air-to-air defence - beyond 2000, and the savings gained
by opting out will be very largely concentrated at the end of the century,
when the current budget crisis should be past.
More than that, Germany will almost certainly have to pay substantial
compensation to its erstwhile partners, while at the same time sacrificing
possibly as many as 20,000 jobs in its aerospace industry.
Die Welt put its doubts in a front-page editorial yesterday. 'So the Bonn
coalition will say 'no' in a few weeks' time to buying (the aircraft). It is
already perfectly obvious how great will be the jubilation in the land. But
the ruling parties will simply be demonstrating just how worn out they are,
unable to do the very things which they know are right. And what then?'
The probable cancellation of the EFA in Germany is a political move far more
than a financial one. But it does show just how great are the pressures on
the government, above all the need to be seen to be coming to terms with the
soaring costs of unification. Mr Ruhe knows the depth of that public concern
and is responding to it.
None of the long-term problems have gone away, despite the temporary relief
at the settlement in the engineering workers' dispute. The east German
economy is still in a state of collapse, if not in free fall, and
unemployment in the east often reaches a real 50 per cent (disguised by job
creation schemes, short-time working and early retirement) in key areas.
Transfers from public funds this year from west to east Germany are expected
to reach DM180bn (Pounds 61.2bn), and many suspect that Mr Waigel is wildly
optimistic to believe he can almost halve his budget deficit from DM45bn to
DM25bn by 1995.
On the other hand the strike settlement may have proved two things. First,
it suggests that Germany's trade unions are beginning to realise the
inevitable belt-tightening which unification means for everyone. And second,
it indicates that the social contract in the west is still alive and well,
even when the desire to fight for a shrinking cake is almost overwhelming.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Privatisation plus for BR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a small step towards the privatisation of British Rail, but last
week's introduction of privately-operated carriages on BR's night trains
between London and Aberdeen is significant in at least two respects.
The obvious one is that this is the first time since the nationalisation of
the railways in 1948 that a private company has been allowed to break BR's
monopoly on the operation of regular passenger services.
But perhaps more important, it exposes the fallacy of the argument that
privatisation necessarily implies reductions in railway services as
private-sector companies trim back loss-making operations to a profitable
core.
In this case, the reverse has happened. BR had been about to axe the
seat-only carriages on its London-Aberdeen sleeper trains because not enough
people were using them. Now, a private bus company called Stagecoach,
convinced that it can fill the empty seats, is backing its hunch by
investing Pounds 1m a year in taking over the operation of the carriages.
Result: the provision of a rail service which, under state ownership, would
have ceased to exist.
Sometime before parliament breaks up for the summer, this hesitant start
should be followed by a white paper setting out the government's plans for
stimulating private sector involvement in the railways on a far larger
scale.
Details are still hazy, but the framework is clear. After months of
embarrassing bickering in the run-up to the general election, ministers have
at last settled on a cautious approach: a form of creeping denationalisation
rather than any 'big bang' break-up and sale of the network.
Franchised trains
Although the freight and parcels operations are to be sold off, along with
the commercially attractive stations, the track network and all the
passenger services will stay in BR's ownership. But private companies will
be allowed to run their own trains on BR's tracks, and the operation of BR's
passenger trains will gradually be franchised to the private sector.
Eventually, those franchises may be converted to outright sales, reducing
BR's role to that of a state-owned track authority.
Insofar as the first priority of privatisation should be to give Britons a
better railway, this formula represents a triumph of sanity over dogma. BR
is so vast, so complex, and above all, so unprofitable that any 'big bang'
break-up and sale of the railways would have been fraught with risks of
chaos and possible cuts. It is by no means clear, in any case, that the
government would have found any buyers.
Reduced risk
Under the current, less ambitious proposals, the risks are vastly reduced.
The private sector has so far shown little enthusiasm for assuming the
massive costs involved in the ownership and operation of track
infrastructure. The government's decision to leave responsibility for the
tracks with BR has resulted in private sector companies like Stagecoach
exploring opportunities to providenew train services or to take over and
improve existing ones.
Conceivably, the result might be that rail plays a far more prominent role
in feeding the nation's insatiable demand for more and better transport, to
the greater benefit of all. But if that desirable objective is to be
achieved, one crucial condition will need to be satisfied: that the price
charged to private sector operators for the use of the tracks is competitive
with that charged to private sector users of the roads.
At present, the two modes are in disequilibrium because users of the
railways have to pay for the use of the track infrastructure while roads are
free at the point of use. The result is that rail can rarely compete with
road on price.
If the rail privatisation process is to achieve its full potential, this
disequilibrium must be redressed. Privatisation will never succeed if users
of state-owned railway tracks endure charges while users of state-owned
roads go free. The government must either face the need for a system of
charging road users the full social costs of road use, perhaps through some
kind of electronic pay-as-you-go system, or make the use of the railway
tracks free. If it does neither, railway privatisation will be an
opportunity missed.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Arts: Landscapes wild, rural and grand - Fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contrary to the impression given by the evident fatuity of so much that is
called modern art, there really is a great deal of serious and creditable
painting still be done and shown, not in the Tate, perhaps, but in other
galleries.
Maurice Cockrill is now 55, a painter of long-delayed but now burgeoning
reputation, and deservedly so. He was always an expressionist and figurative
painter when to be so was to put oneself beyond the critical pale.
But a move to London from Liverpool ten years ago has brought a change of
fortune. With these new works, and with the tondo sequence of The Four
Seasons especially, he seems to have entered not a new phase of development,
so much as a period of renewed imaginative confidence and technical
assurance.
The surface is open, the paint free and active in the handling, the colour
clean and strong, the work overall dramatic, theatrical in the best sense.
The subject is landscape for the most part: the landscape of romantic
imagination and invention. My only reservation is that given such an
approach, the tendency is always to simplify and formalise the particular
element, even to decorate it arbitrarily. The closer the engagement, sur le
motif, so rich and various is the reality that such necessities of pure
invention simply fall away.
So it is with John Monks, who takes as his subject the interior as a kind of
still-life. The interior is grand rather than domestic, defined by the bare
walls and the door opening through to the space beyond. The composition is
frontal, insistent in its repetition and reinforcement of the architecture,
at once formal and descriptive. The paint is thick, laid on with a free but
disciplined confidence, the tone dark, the mood intense and sombre, again
theatrical.
The suggestion, maybe unwitting, is of the Edwardian interiors of Sargent,
of Lavery, of James Pryde most of all. And yet for all the strength and
vigour, there is a subtlety and delicacy, the atmosphere romantic and
suggestive. It is intuitively established and fraught with imaginative
possibilities.
Monks, who shares this show with Julie Major, is barely 40 years old and and
by no means as well known as he deserves to be.
Len Tabner is another landscape painter, another expressionist of 40 or so.
He, too, set his early career away from London, and although by the late
1970s his wild Turnerian paintings of the North Sea and the Durham coast
were attracting some attention in mixed shows, it is only lately that he has
been shown substantially and regularly in London. This latest exhibition
comes by courtesy of Rosehaugh Stanhope, the developers of Broadgate complex
on the fringe of the City.
The subject is still the shore, the sea and ships, and wild weather. In 1990
Tabner made a voyage to the South Atlantic, to Ascension, South Georgia and
the Falklands, and this quite remarkable series of paintings and studies is
the result. It would seem they were all done on the spot - the painter
perhaps even tied to the mast on occasion, in true Turner fashion.
These sunsets, storms at sea, cliffscapes and hulks rotting at the whaling
station, worked in an active mixture of paint, charcoal and pastel, come in
for the same expansive treatment. They are as free and expansive as we
suppose the South Atlantic to be, and quite as positive and impressive.
Mary Newcomb, who makes up a rural trio with Mary Potter and Winifred
Nicholson, might seem a world away from such strong stuff, but yet these
latest landscapes, lyrical and undemonstrative as they are, bear the
Turnerian comparison no less.
Now nearly 70, Miss Newcomb has never received her manifest due, perhaps by
that very English trait that indulges a taste for charm while discounting it
as unserious and self-indulgent.
She is, in short, a victim of her material, found in the incidents and
visual occasions of rural life, and the subtle delicacy with which she
treats them. What is overlooked is the free and radical qualities both of
her pictorial wit and invention, and the freedom and scope of her actual
painting.
In such things as the large, elegiac canvas of a bird singing in a hedge at
dawn, such qualities are inescapable.
Finally, Bruce Tippett, in his first British show in more than 30 years,
offers a small retrospective of his work in that time. Now nearly 60, he has
consistently trod the narrow line between representation and abstraction,
the landscapes always teasing the one way, the abstract works the other.
The earliest works show a clear interest in the abstract expressionism and
British neo-Romantic landscape then current, Hoffman on the one hand, Alan
Reynolds or Middleditch on the other. But all were moderated, even then, by
an overriding interest in the oriental tradition, in calligraphy in
particular, that continues to this day.
It is the nicest paradox that his most distinctive and personal work, even
though he is so clearly a western artist, should be that which is steeped
unself-consciously in that tradition.
Maurice Cockrill: Bernard Jacobson, 14a Clifford Street W1, until June 13;
John Monks: Paton Gallery, 2 Langley Court WC2, until June 6; Len Tabner:

FT  19 MAY 92 / Arts: 'Don Carlo' in Genoa - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Genoa's lovely neo-classical opera house, the Teatro Carlo Felice, was to a
large extent destroyed by bombs in 1943. In 1946 the ensnarled discussion of
its reconstruction began: competitions were announced, projects submitted,
rejected, revised, bitterly debated. Bureaucratic and political - as well as
aesthetic - dissension blocked all work until March of 1987. Meanwhile, the
handsome ruins dominated the city's main square, a funereal, useless
monument, while opera performances of varying merit were heard in a
converted cinema.
Last year, perhaps spurred in part by the approaching Columbian
celebrations, the work was finally completed; and this season, the Carlo
Felice opens again. The new house was designed by a trio of architects
headed by the brilliant Aldo Rossi. Incorporating some of the remaining
exterior of the old house, it is once more a focal point of Genoa. During
the day, people stroll or meet under the elegant arcade. In the evening, if
there is an opera or a concert, the theatre attracts the leading citizens of
the Ligurian capital.
The season is fully subscribed, houses are regularly sold out. The interior
(capacity 2,000) has been much criticised; to emphasise the civic nature of
the theatre, Rossi, in a sense, brought the outdoors into the hall, where
doors and windows are to be seen in the walls, and a wooden railing runs
along the gallery; but even Rossi's enemies have to admit that the acoustics
are excellent, the sightlines perfect, and the seats comfortable. A
between-acts drink at the bar does not involve much waiting. On fine
evenings, the terraces overlooking the square receive a refreshing breeze
from the nearby, but invisible sea. It is, in sum, a happy house, and people
enjoy just being in it.
But what about the music? Arriving late on the scene, the general manager
Francesco Ernani - imported from La Scala - had to use his wits to cobble up
a programme; and, considering the lack of time and the tightness of his
budget, he has served his public well: a Freni Boheme, a Barber, a Carmen,
some visiting ballet troupes, foreign orchestras (including the Philadelphia
with Muti, who appropriately conducted the Wagner 'Columbus' Overture), and
 -currently - an interesting new production of Verdi's Don Carlo. A
co-production, actually, conceived in conjunction with the Maryinsky Theater
of St. Petersburg and the Tblisi Opera (responsible for the sets).
This was the four-act, Italian version of the opera, which Verdi prepared
for La Scala in the early 1880's, at the time when he was first brooding
over the suggested Otello. Verdi himself said that this redaction had 'more
sinew' than the original five-act French opera. Some things are lost in the
revision - the love duet, Filippo's lament over the dead Rodrigo - but much
is gained. The Don Carlo, as heard in Genoa, though far from brief still,
has a unique urgency and tight coherence.
It is a dark opera, and the staging by Teimouraz Chaidze, along with the
sets of Teimouraz Mourvanidze, accentuated the gloom. Basic structures,
delicate black columns with gilt ornamentation, suggested Spanish baroque as
if revisited by Viollet-le-Duc. Though they were easily moved, the sets
still maintained a prison-like air, even when, beyond the bars, a fountain
purled in the garden scene.
Sometimes Chaidze was over-inventive: a roving spotlight at the act's
beginning seemed to be searching for a singer to illuminate (too much like
what really happens in some of our opera houses); even more restless, a
super dressed as Charles V was too often in evidence. He actually entered
Filippo's cabinet and confronted him at the beginning of the great
monologue.
For the rest, the direction was sober and inoffensive. The music was allowed
to speak for itself. Originally, the conductor was to have been Valeri
Gergeiev; but in the event, he was unable to reach Genoa, and the work was
left in the hands of his colleague Alexander Anissimov, who had prepared the
singers and conducted the rehearsals. Anissimov proved to be an excellent
musician, supporting the singers without indulging them, setting the
orchestra's pace, unhurried but fluent, from the tormented beginning to the
mysterious finale. The Carlo Felice orchestra played well, promising even
better in the future, as it settles into the hall.
Alberto Cupido was cast in the title role. An uneven singer at best, on
opening night he was also indisposed and, after a rocky first act, was
replaced by the veteran Carlo Cossuta. The voice no longer has the ring and
authority of former days, but Cossuta turned in a sturdy, acceptable
performance. The young Roberto Frontali, a baritone obviously on the way to
a notable career, was an appealing Rodrigo, of soldierly bearing and lyrical
voice.
The bass Roberto Scandiuzzi is known to the London audience; he, too, is
young, and his undisguisable youthfulness sometimes worked against his
characterisation of Filippo, but vocally he was ever convincing and, in his
monologue, deeply moving. Elizabeth Connell sang Elisabetta with warmth and
authority; she moved regally, her gestures were expressive. Giovanna
Casolla's Eboli had plenty of dash and allure. The Veil Song seemed to try
her voice, but she brought it off with panache, and was impressive in the
later trio and in the scene with Elisabetta.
All in all, this was a worthy Don Carlo, an occasion of interest, pleasure,
and good omen.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten firm on selective schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, signalled his determination
yesterday not to give in to Tory calls for the widespread return of pupil
selection by secondary schools.
His forthcoming education white paper will instead emphasise parental choice
and leave parents and school governors as prime movers in changing the
character of schools.
Mr Patten emphasised that the white paper would be a 'radical document',
outlining the shape of the education service for the next 25 years on the
assumption that most schools will in due course opt out of local-authority
control. Opting-out and selection, he said, would be 'parent-driven, not
Whitehall-driven'.
Mr Patten, who was briefing correspondents for the first time since taking
office last month, noted that although 86 per cent of secondary schools in
England were non-selective comprehensives, 24 of its 109 local education
authorities had at least one selective school.
Mr Patten said that rather than formal selection, specialisation by schools,
on the model of the government's 15 city technology colleges, was his
preferred way forward.
He added: 'The national curriculum is the best way of delivering equality of
opportunity to our children.' He refused to be drawn on the fate of children
unable to secure places in such specialised schools.
The government is determined that its white paper should give added momentum
to its campaign for schools to opt out. Mr Patten welcomed reports that
Labour was preparing to shift its ground on grant-maintained schools and
expressed 'surprise' that few schools had applied to leave Labour-controlled
authorities in London.
The white paper, likely to be published before parliament goes into recess
in July, will determine the future shape of local education authorities.
The university sector should not seek to increase student numbers at the
cost of downgrading research, Mr Patten warned in the same briefing. He said
that while it was natural that some institutions would wish to concentrate
on teaching extra students, he hoped that, across the sector, there would
not be 'academic drift' away from research.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Civil servants reject 4.25% pay
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PACE-SETTING pay offer to more than 120,000 civil servants ran into
difficulty yesterday when the annual conference of the Civil and Public
Services Association voted to reject it.
The vote against the offer, which provides for a rapid increase in
performance-related pay and a basic rise of 4.25 per cent, came in spite of
a recommendation by the executive for acceptance.
Last week, the annual conference of the National Union of Civil and Public
Servants, the second-largest Civil Service union, voted to ballot members on
striking over a similar offer.
Yesterday's vote on an emergency motion at the CPSA conference will not
necessarily lead to the union's rejecting the offer. Members will vote on
the offer next week.
Although the motion instructed the executive to reverse its recommendation
decision, Mrs Marion Chambers, president, said an inquiry would be held into
the conduct of union branches that submitted emergency resolutions opposing
the pay offer.
That might delay implementation of the reversal instruction, possibly until
after the ballot is concluded.
Under the offer, the pay bill of CPSA grades, mainly junior civil servants,
will rise by 4.75 per cent, with the extra 0.5 per cent accounted for by the
introduction of performance-related pay.
NUCPS grades have been offered basic increases of 4.1 per cent, although
their pay bill for the year will rise by 4.5 per cent.
The unions object to the level of the offers and some delegates oppose the
extension of performance-related pay which until this year has been
restricted to only a handful of civil servants - those at the top of their
grade.
Under the agreements proposed by the Treasury, civil servants will have to
earn payments above the standard rises. Previously increments were paid as a
matter of course.
Similar extensions of performance-related pay are being planned for all of
Britain's more than 500,000 non-industrial civil servants.
During the CPSA debate, Mr John Ellis, retiring general secretary, launched
a scathing attack on 'crackpot' activists and said the deal was the best one
that could be negotiated.
Union leaders of 37,000 white-collar workers at British Gas yesterday
rejected an offer to increase pay by 4 per cent. The company had previously
offered 3.9 per cent.
Mr Dave Stirzaker of Nalgo said it was a skinflint offer which would damage
staff morale.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet committee list due for
release
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS will today start to unravel the secrecy surrounding Whitehall by
listing members of the Cabinet committees at an unprecedented press
conference with Sir Robin Butler, Cabinet secretary.
Sir Robin will set out at an 'on the record' press conference the
composition of 26 committees and publish 'Questions of Procedure for
Ministers' - the official document setting out responsibilities and
requirements of ministers.
He will be joined by Mr William Waldegrave, the Cabinet minister responsible
for the government's Citizen's Charter.
However, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were last night unclear about
whether the setting up of future ad hoc committees, set up to resolve
particular issues, would be announced immediately - or wait for an annual
review.
If the existence of ad hoc committees is admitted only periodically, much of
the impact of the greater openness would be lost. Controversial issues could
be deferred to a undisclosed committee.
In the Commons, Mr Waldegrave admitted yesterday that there was room for
'very great improvement' in government's attitude to secrecy. In the past,
secrecy had been used for 'reasons which this House does not want to see in
the future,' he said.
The present government's presumption would be that information should be
released unless there were 'pressing' public interest reasons for it not to
be, Mr Waldegrave said.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Left aims to make gains from low
base - The balance of political forces inside the union movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S biggest Civil Service union, the Civil and Public Services
Association (CPSA), may today elect as general secretary a leading member of
the far-left Militant group.
That should not be taken as a sign of a shift to the left in the unions,
with activists looking to militant syndicalism to defend them in the wake of
Labour's election defeat.
After Labour's 1979 defeat there was a leftwing backlash both in the party
and the unions. With increasing confusion about what is 'left' and 'right',
there is no evidence of the Labour party repeating that reaction now.
The picture may be more complex in the unions. With the unity of the
election campaign no longer required, and moderate, Kinnockite activists in
the unions even more depressed than leftwing activists, the left may
increase its representation on a few union executives.
But, in spite of some movement to the left in the past year, the left is
starting from a low base. Even in unions that are called 'left-led', such as
the TGWU general union, the left is often no more than an election machine
with little ideological coherence.
While the left may celebrate the odd victory, it is also losing leaders. Mr
Roger Lyons, a pragmatist, will take over the leadership of MSF, the general
technical union, from left-winger Mr Ken Gill in August.
Most important of all, the old backbone of the left in the unions, the
Communist party, has collapsed along with its traditional paymaster, the
Soviet Union. The collapse of communism and the smothering effect of
'Kinnockism' - beyond left and right - has reduced the left in the unions to
a rump.
In the early 1980s the Broad Left groupings in the unions were genuinely
broad - ranging from the left of the Labour party, through the Communist
party, to various Trotskyist splinter groups. Now most Broad Left groups are
synonymous with the Militant group, which appears to have shifted its
'entryism' efforts from the Labour party to unions such as the CPSA.
A revival of the left depends on having issues to regroup around. No obvious
issues are in sight. On bread-and-butter industrial issues, all unions, and
all factions within them, are on the defensive.
On political issues, the debate will be between the reformers who want to
revise, if not sever, union links with the Labour party, and the
conservatives who want to preserve as much of them as possible. The left is
in the conservative camp on that issue but is accompanied by a fair number
of moderates.
In the sectors that face big, politically inspired shake-ups, the picture
may be slightly different. The Civil Service is high on that list and if Mr
John Macreadie, the Militant-backed candidate for the CPSA's top job, wins
the election today it will be partly because many civil servants fear for
their jobs and believe that a radical would defend them better than a
moderate.
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, the moderate candidate, said it would be
'catastrophic' if the left won - either the top job or in the executive
elections which are taking place simultaneously - and would 'give the
government the excuse it needs to end collective bargaining entirely in the
Civil Service'.
The CPSA, 'a bed-sitter activist paradise' according to one Labour MP, has a
history of violent political swings and Mr Macreadie has a higher profile
than his opponent and a reputation for competence. He is offering to do the
job for no more than the average skilled wage - a good populist gesture in
any union election.

TOUGHER service standards for water companies and increased compensation for
customers suffering through a failure to comply have been suggested by the
Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the industry's regulator.
Mr Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, has sent a series of proposals to
the industry to upgrade the current guaranteed standards scheme introduced
when the companies were privatised in 1989, and for a new code of practice
about compensating customers in areas of sub-standard service.
Mr Byatt has asked for responses by July 1, after which specific proposals
will be brought forward.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL investigation requests made to the Department of Trade and
Industry rose sharply in the fiscal year ended March 31 to 811, up from 723
the year before.
The rise was attributed to the increased number of corporate failures as
well as greater public awareness of the DTI's investigations unit.
The number of convictions stemming from those investigations rose to eight
in the first quarter of this year, compared with three in the previous
quarter.
Some of the convictions stem from investigations which were opened as long
as four years ago.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gould sees need for closer EC
defence ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN should back greater European Community co-ordination of foreign and
defence policies and ally with France to press Germany to reflate, according
to Mr Bryan Gould, now contesting the Labour leadership with Mr John Smith,
Ivo Dawnay writes.
Speaking out in the week of the Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty
changes, the shadow environment secretary is clearly determined to stamp on
repeated charges by his rivals that he is on the Euro-sceptic wing of the
party.
He goes on to add, in an article in today's Guardian, that Labour has
succumbed too often to the 'temptation' to be reactive on EC issues by
supporting the Brussels majority wherever their views clash with the
Conservatives.
As an alternative to 'unthinking support' for the predominating community
view, he says Labour needs a distinctive and constructive voice, calling for
stronger local and regional power and allocating responsibility at the most
appropriate level.
Differing from the Labour leadership's official position, he argues that at
a supranational level there should be greater EC co-ordination of defence
and foreign affairs. He also advocates a common energy policy and a level
playing field in each country's management of multi-national companies.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour moves on selection reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEVEN-year battle by Mr Neil Kinnock to reduce trade union influence over
the selection of Labour MPs advanced significantly yesterday when a key
party committee voted to replace an electoral college with a one-member,
one-vote system.
The decision, agreed by 11 to two votes of the national executive's
organisation sub-committee, looks certain to be endorsed by the full
executive later this month in a final gesture of support for the outgoing
party leader.
The move is also likely to stir controversy and opposition among party
traditionalists on the left and in the union movement when it comes up for
ratification at Labour's annual conference in the autumn.
Yesterday there were a number of abstentions and absences among important
union members of the 24-strong committee, including the GMB general union,
usually a firm supporter of the leadership.
Under the present arrangements, union branches affiliated to constituency
parties (CLPs) can command up to 40 per cent of the vote in an electoral
college, with the rest going to individual members.
A compromise reform proposal, broadly endorsed by conference last year,
allowed CLPs management committees to opt for one-member, one-vote or to
allow unions a role based on a third of a vote each for each affiliated
political levy payer. To avoid unnecessary contests, CLP committees would
first vote to decide whether to hold a contest at all.
Under Mr Kinnock's proposal, first mooted by the leader in 1985 and agreed
yesterday, that formula would now drop in favour of a straightforward
one-member one-vote
Doubts are continuing to linger, however, among some unions, with Mr John
Edmonds, the GMB leader, proposing that changes should be made only as part
of coherent overall review of Labour's union links.
Mr Kinnock was careful to emphasise that it did not represent an attack on
the unions but merely a necessary step to allow CLPs to begin the
reselection procedure next year.
Even before yesterday's meeting, though, Mr John Prescott, a candidate for
the deputy leadership, expressed serious reservations about the speed and
timing of the move.
Acknowledging in a BBC radio interview that the topic was sensitive during a
leadership contest in which union votes were being solicited, he warned
against a 'quick fix' that might be regretted later.
Mr Prescott said he had always been a supporter of one-member, one-vote, but
called on Labour to 'step back a little bit' to consider the unions' future
role in party affairs.
Later, the committee agreed to hold a special conference on European topics
in November. Discussion of changes to the system for electing the party
leader and deputy leader were postponed, however, leaving it unclear whether
any proposals will be submitted to this year's conference.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tory seeks key Euro post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PETER HORDERN, MP for Horsham, is to be the 'elder statesman' candidate
for chairmanship of the Tory backbench European affairs committee, and many
colleagues are tipping him to get the post even if the election is
contested.
Elections to the Tory backbench committees are usually low-key, but the EC
affairs committee rose to unprecedented prominence last November when Sir
Norman Fowler, now the Tory party chairman, stood and won against the former
incumbent, Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford and a noted Euro-sceptic.
Downing Street officially played no part in the contest, but was clearly
satisfied with Sir Norman's victory.
Mr Cash is said to be considering whether to stand in the forthcoming
contest, which will take place on June 3.
Although the present election is most unlikely to reach last November's
dizzy heights of activity and notoriety, Sir Peter would certainly be a
reassuring presence as the official voice of backbench opinion so far as the
government is concerned.
The Maastricht bill will have received its second reading by the time of the
elections, but the future of European union will still be in front of MPs
during the summer, as the legislation is considered in detail.
Sir Peter has been an MP since 1964 and is a long-standing member of the
1922 committee of Tory backbenchers. In the last parliament he was chairman
of the Public Accounts Commission, a cross-party committee that oversees the
National Audit Office's spending plans.
He describes himself as a convinced Maastricht supporter who is very anxious
to keep the party together. He said that the committee has to be 'a very
reasonable one, listening to every point of view, and making sure that it is
not taken over by one faction or another'.
The elections will not take place until the Commons re-assembles after the
Whitsun break, but the preparations are in hand now as MPs disperse for the
recess on Thursday.
One Euro-sceptic suggested yesterday that they should not bother putting
forward a candidate on the ground that they were likely to lose, and would
be better employed organising themselves for the rest of the bill's passage.
The government yesterday signalled that it might accept the European
Community's controversial proposal for a 48-hour maximum working week - if
individuals are given the right to choose to work longer hours.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said a proposed EC directive
should include a clause allowing people to work more than 48 hours 'on their
own free will and in agreement with management and workforce'.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press Bank over Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is coming under further pressure from MPs over its role
in the Maxwell pensions affair.
Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, has tabled a Commons motion calling on the
Bank to carry out and publish an inquiry into the commercial banks' lending,
currency and share-dealing transactions with Mr Robert Maxwell.
The Bank's attitude will also be raised with Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, by Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, who are meeting
him this morning on behalf of a cross-party group of MPs concerned about the
plight of the Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Shaw said that unless the Bank carried out an investigation and published
its results, the public - as well as the Maxwell pensioners - would feel the
whole issue had not been properly scrutinised.
'The public will be left with a nasty taste in the mouth if we don't get to
the bottom of it,' he said yesterday.
He also called for government action against the government and financial
institutions of Liechtenstein - where Mr Maxwell held a number of trusts -
through some form of economic sanctions, perhaps by refusing to allow
transactions to take place with them.
MPs campaigning for the Maxwell pensioners have become increasingly
frustrated that in the six months after the state of the pension funds
emerged there has been little progress in finding solutions to the
pensioners' difficulties.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plan to expand rail freight level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES to expand the amount of freight carried by rail were signalled by Mr
John MacGregor, the transport secretary, in the Commons last night.
He is expected to make an early statement on whether the Channel tunnel link
will carry freight as well as passengers.
But Mr MacGregor said that whatever the the expansion in freight traffic
carried by rail the bulk will continue to be transported by road.
The minister, moving the second reading of the British Coal and British Rail
(Transfer Proposals) Bill, said 81 per cent of all freight traffic was
currently moved by road.
The bill was given a second reading by 69 votes (325 - 256).
He faced demands from both sides of the House to ensure that the
introduction of rail services by private-sector operators is not limited to
British Rail's most profitable routes.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's shadow transport secretary, led the calls for
restrictions to prevent 'cherrypicking' by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group
and other interests keen to secure access to BR's tracks.
Railway enthusiast Mr Robert Adley (C Christchurch), who has warned that the
privatisation of BR might become a 'potential poll tax on wheels', also
insisted that in order to protect BR's position, private-sector operators
should not be allowed just to 'pick the bit they like'.
Mr MacGregor confirmed that the principal measure dealing with BR would be
introduced in the autumn.
It would be preceded by a white paper outlining proposals for the
franchising of passenger services, the sale of BR's freight and parcels
businesses, and preparing the way for the sale of stations.
The minister said decisions on the timing of the privatisation of the coal
industry had yet to be made. Mr Prescott argued that the bill reflected the
government's 'ideological obsession' with privatisation.

FT  19 MAY 92 / ITV's squad outgunned by tough competition: Premier soccer
deal breaks new ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEVISION football entered a much tougher, more commercial division
yesterday with the BSkyB-BBC Pounds 304m deal for exclusive rights to show
live games from the Premier League.
Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of LWT, who four years ago held back the
advance of satellite television with a Pounds 44m Football League deal, was
simply outgunned this time.
Even spending the weekend ringing round his ITV colleagues persuading them
to add another Pounds 5m a year to their bid was not enough.
Mr Dyke's bid, Pounds 49m short over five years, was the highest he thought
he could justify. It was the equivalent of 50 to 60 hours of high-quality
drama or buying the rights to a year's worth of Hollywood films.
For BSkyB it is a calculated gamble that exclusive rights to top-class
football is just what is needed to increase the rate at which British
consumers acquire satellite dishes.
There is already some evidence that exclusive sport works. There was a
marked surge in satellite dish sales when Sky Television won the rights to
World Cup Cricket.
In February, sales of dishes were estimated by Continental Research to have
exceeded 78,000, compared with 41,000 in the same month last year. In March
the monthly increase was 78,000.
Attracting new dish owners is only one part of the equation for Sky. Its
strategy will almost certainly be to allow all dish owners to see the live
games initially before moving on to showing the games on a subscription
channel and then charging for each game viewed. The technology for
pay-per-view already exists.
According to Continental Research, there are 2.4m satellite homes in Britain
 -although some specialists believe that overstates the market.
If live football increases the rate of dish installation and a sizeable
proportion of that audience is prepared to pay to watch each game, large
sums of money would flow towards the satellite company, which has recently
broken even at an operational level.
Once a new stream of subscription or pay-per-view cash is established, the
dominance of the satellite consortium in buying sports rights would be
reinforced and traditional broadcasters might have to be content with
crumbs.
Sky has been astute in taking the BBC with it in return for a contribution
of Pounds 4.5m a year. Edited highlights for the BBC will reduce the impact
of any political row over live football being taken off the screens of the
vast majority of viewers.
ITV is both surprised and angry that the BBC has decided to join Sky. Senior
ITV executives point out that BBC viewing figures are particularly poor in
satellite homes.
It is believed that until two weeks ago the BBC was prepared to pay for
highlights, whoever was the winner. But in the past two weeks Mr Marmaduke
Hussey, the BBC chairman, and Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC
director-general, made clear that they wanted to do a deal with Sky.
The final irony for ITV is that the Premier League was advised by Mr David
Plowright, who was forced earlier this year to resign as chairman of Granada
Television.
Mr Plowright's advice was that by 1995 the present 15 ITV regions would have
come down to five and that satellite television was a better bet financially
in the long term.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Stand and deliver call from mail union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAW designed to punish highwaymen for holding up stagecoaches and stealing
the Royal Mail is being used today to dismiss postal workers who fail to
deliver letters on time, according to the Union of Communication Workers,
the main postal union.
'Wilful delay of the post' has been a criminal offence since the 1640s but
Post Office supervisors have only recently started invoking the ancient law
as part of an efficiency drive, the UCW says.
One postman in Dumfries, Scotland, for example, failed to note on the front
of a letter that it could not be delivered because of dogs loose in a front
garden. The UCW says that it was raining hard at the time, which made it
particularly difficult for the postman to get out his pencil.
The letter went back into the system and the postman was suspended from duty
for wilful delay. He was later reinstated and given a written reprimand.
The union says the case is just one of many and claims some supervisors are
using the law to victimise individuals. Its conference in Bournemouth will
today call on Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, to introduce
separate disciplinary offences of 'malicious delay' and plain 'delay'.
It wants the criminal offence of 'wilful delay' to be reserved for clear
cases of theft.
Royal Mail said yesterday that the rules and disciplinary procedures were
clearly laid out. Best efforts were always made to ensure they were applied
in a fair way. If a postman was taken ill, for example, and 'staggered back
obviously ill', that would not be regarded as wilful delay.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Cheese factory faces clash over business culture: Rival
plans for the future of a Wensleydale creamery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIDAY is the day of reckoning for Dairy Crest's Hawes creamery in Upper
Wensleydale, a cheese factory at the centre of a clash of business cultures.
On one side is Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary that is
closing the North Yorkshire creamery at the end of this month and moving
production of Wensleydale cheese to its Longridge plant in Lancashire.
Opposing the closure is the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee, led by local
businesses convinced that by saving Wensleydale's last commercial
cheese-making site they can create a viable small business and an employment
lifeline for the remote upper dale.
Backing the rescue committee are Yorkshiremen, both born and adopted, who
are scandalised at Dairy Crest's assertion that Wensleydale made in
Lancashire will taste just as good.
On Friday, when the committee presents its buy-in bid for the creamery to
Dairy Crest, it will be hard economics, not sentiment, that decides whether
there is a future for the cheesemaking tradition brought to Wensleydale by
French monks 800 years ago.
The committee's bid is being formulated by Mr Keith Johnson, financial
director of Thomas Weatherald, Wensleydale joiners with a Pounds 15m annual
turnover.
He says: 'I think Dairy Crest thought we would just lie down and play dead.
Now they realise we aren't that sort of people.'
When the creamery's closure was announced three weeks ago, Hawes' population
of 1,100 was stunned. The town is 25 miles from any other town and without
the creamery jobs young people are likely to leave.
Mr Peter Annison, chairman of the local chamber of trade, estimates that the
creamery, which employs 59 people and is Hawes' largest private-sector
employer, provides a quarter of jobs for men in Hawes.
Local authorities and job creation agencies are also worried. A decade of
establishing small factories by the government-funded Rural Development
Commission has so far generated only 30 jobs.
Mr Richard Harvey, the Yorkshire Dales National Park officer, says any
development of the creamery site for non-industrial use - such as housing -
would be blocked.
The commission and local councils are supporting the rescue plan. Local
people have promised finance, from small sums to more than Pounds 20,000.
'It's total 100 per cent commitment,' says Mr John Blackie, rescue committee
spokesman.
Feelings are running high in Hawes. Fourth-generation grocer Mr Basil Allen,
who in summer sells 1,000 pounds of Wensleydale a week, insists that nothing
compares with cheese made from the milk of cows grazing on limestone
pastureland full of dales flowers.
Jim Metcalfe, who eats Wensleydale in traditional style, roasted in a tin
with milk, says: 'It's one of the best cheeses there are. It must be when
the Queen Mother likes it best.'
Everybody agrees the rescue bid must be a viable business but it is evident
that Dairy Crest is unconvinced it can be.
The creamery was bought by the Milk Marketing Board in the mid 1960s for
Pounds 500,000 from Wensleydale entrepreneur Mr Kit Calvert, who had rescued
the business in the 1930s and made it a commercial success.
Dairy Crest says the creamery needs a 'massive injection of capital' to make
it cost-competitive and to satisfy the stringent requirements of the
supermarket chains, its key customers. Investment, it argues, cannot be
justified as consumption of regional English crumbly cheese has fallen by 33
per cent in the past five years.
The creamery, it concedes, is operating profitably, but switching production
to Longridge will maximise the profitability.
The campaigners believe, however, there is a niche market for a creamery,
employing about 20 people at first, to produce and promote Wensleydale for
smaller outlets as a specialthe parallel with Hawes ropemakers Outhwaite &amp;
Son which he and his wife bought in 1975. Although tiny in rope industry
terms, it has grown to employ 22 people with an annual turnover of Pounds
500,000.
The rescue committee says Dairy Crest has been obstructive by failing to
provide figures needed to formulate a bid and insisting on removing
virtually all cheesemaking equipment. Mr Blackie says: 'Clearly Dairy Crest
doesn't want us to have a chance to buy the dairy, to set up a trading
company.'
Dairy Crest insists that it is not trying to stifle a bid but wants to
ensure that the campaigners realise the stakes in a competitive marketplace
are high. It says: 'We are Dairy Crest, we are used to making cheese, we
have decided to pull out.'
Any rescue attempt also faces the issue of milk quotas. Sometimes there are
national milk shortages and the proposed abolition of the present Milk
Marketing Scheme was announced in the Queen's Speech.
The campaigners, formulating a buy-in financed mainly by Dalespeople, are
undeterred. Mr Johnson predicts: 'I'm confident we can rescue something out
of the situation.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / High bids for Welsh ceramics: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S has disposed of the finest collection of Welsh ceramics to appear
on the market. It was assembled by the late Sir Leslie Joseph, for many
years vice-chairman of Trusthouse Forte. The sale was held at Margam Park
near Port Talbot and the 900 lots brought in Pounds 1.12m, far above the
Pounds 750,000 estimate. Virtually everything sold.
There was strong local buying and Michael Heseltine, Swansea-born trade and
industry secretary, was believed to be among the successful bidders. The
National Museum of Wales, which is establishing a Welsh ceramics gallery
this year, spent more than Pounds 90,000 and Swansea City Council Pounds
27,000.
The top price was Pounds 15,400 that secured a pair of candlesticks
decorated with wild flowers, made at the Swansea factory between 1814 and
1826. It was a record for Welsh porcelain. A fruit basket of the same period
realised the same sum. The short-lived Swansea factory is regarded as having
produced soft-paste porcelain equal in quality to that created at Sevres.
There was also a record price of Pounds 9,350, paid by the US dealer Jim
Maben, for porcelain produced at the same time at the Nantgarw factory. This
consisted of a trio of pieces decorated with a floral bouquet.
Other high prices were the Pounds 13,200 for a Swansea tureen and cover  -
an identical tureen is in the Queen's collection - and Pounds 12,100 paid by
the National Museum of Wales, for an ice pail, cover and liner.
Christie's yesterday sold British ceramics for Pounds 234,916, with 86 per
cent sold. The top price was the Pounds 10,450, double the estimate, for a
pair of Bristol hexagonal tapering vases and covers made at Richard
Champion's factory about 1775.
A Bow group depicting The Fortune Teller, by the Muses Modeller, sold just
on target at Pounds 9,900. In 1986 at Sotheby's, as part of the famous Rous
Lench auction, it made Pounds 13,200, underlining just how lacklustre demand
for British ceramics has been in recent years.

A REDUCTION in the number of house repossessions would give a strong

According to the Bank's economics division, a reduction in the number of

year) would increase house prices by about 5 per cent above rises that would
otherwise have occurred.

MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has warned that there will inevitably
be 'fallout' among electronics companies operating in Scotland because of
technological change and recession, James Buxton writes.
His warning echoes widely held fears in Scotland that Silicon Glen, as the
Scottish electronics industry is sometimes known, is vulnerable to the
changes sweeping the computer world. 'There has to be fallout among some of
the electronics industry in Scotland as a consequence of the changes that
have taken place,' Mr Lang said.
The world computer industry is in turmoil as advances in microprocessor
technology have reduced the cost to new companies of entering the industry,
while demand in many markets has slowed.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Dr Theo Williamson: innovative engineer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DR 'Theo' Williamson, one of Britain's most eminent and innovative
engineers, has died aged 69.
During the 1950s and 1960s he was at the forefront of the development of
automated manufacturing techniques in Britain. In later years he was
critical of the leadership of industrial companies, which he believed had
failed to take advantage of innovations that should have given the country a
commercial lead over its competitors.
In 1971 he wrote a significant paper for the National Economic Development
Office. It was called The Trade Balance in the 1970s: the Role of Mechanical
Engineering; and in it Dr Williamson gave a warning that Britain's trade
balance would continue to worsen if industry failed to give long-term
support to development of high-value-added engineering products.
He was one of the first critics of the short-termism of institutional
investors, which he believed were pursuing short-term financial gains at the
expense of the long-term investment in British industry.
Dr Williamson joined MO Valve in 1943 from Edinburgh University. During his
three years with the company he developed the Williamson amplifier, which
was subsequently used by thousands of hi-fi enthusiasts.
Between 1946 and 1961 he worked for Ferranti, pioneering the development of
numerically controlled machine tools, an area in which Britain then held a
world lead.
He later joined Molins, manufacturer of cigarette-making machinery, where he
developed an automated, centrally controlled manufacturing process. Known as
System 24, this linked tasks previously carried out by separate machines.
Dr Williamson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 for his work
at Molins.
He became a director of Rank Xerox Research in the UK before retiring in
1976.
He leaves a wife and two sons and two daughters.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Lloyd's agents may back plan to help Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for a deal to help Names suffering worst in recent losses at Lloyd's
of London is growing among the agencies that organise the insurance market's
syndicates and handle the affairs of Names.
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association,
which represents more than 100 agents, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind
that a large majority of agents think there ought to be a plan.' At a
meeting today, the association will consider a series of ideas, including a
cap on some of the losses already suffered by Names - the individuals whose
assets back underwriting at the market.
The meeting will also examine progress made by Lloyd's in implementing
various recommendations of the Rowland task force, which in January
completed a review of business practices at the market.
The task force was led by Mr David Rowland, chairman of Sedgwick
international insurance brokers. It advocated the creation of a cap on
Names' losses from next year onwards but rejected retroactive action on
legal as well as practical grounds.
Subsequently, however, as the scale of losses faced by Names on catastrophe
reinsurance syndicates in the 1989 and 1990 years has become clear, there
has been a rethink.
Although many Names unaffected by losses oppose helping finance any rescue
plan, agents are confident that their objections can be overcome, especially
if others in the market are persuaded to contribute to such a fund.
One prominent members' agent said: 'There will be a rescue scheme. Names
will accept the idea provided that agents and brokers are also putting their
hands in their pockets.'
Within the market, some agents who were initially sceptical about a deal for
the hardest hit Names are being won round to the idea. Mr Nigel Rogers,
managing director of the Octavian Group agency, said that the idea had
initially received 'a mixed response from the market' but that support was
growing. He added: 'I hope a successful proposal is formulated. I believe it
to be in the market's interest."
Some agents fear that unless a scheme is put in place Lloyd's may not
survive. One agent said: 'There is now a widespread view that there has to
be a settlement. Otherwise litigation will smother the market.' Lloyd's is
likely to insist that, in return for help, Names would have to agree to
solve any disputes through arbitration.
In a separate development, it emerged yesterday that solicitors acting on
behalf of the Feltrim Names Association are expected to issue protective
writs this week on behalf of 872 Names who were members of the syndicate in
its 1987 underwriting year.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, said a number of
events that may have contributed to the syndicate's heavy underwriting
losses occurred in 1986. Unless the protective writs were issued, potential
litigation would be time-barred.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Manchester submits Olympic proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISERS of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games submitted
outline plans yesterday for the proposed facilities and said the development
would create up to 3,500 permanent jobs.
According to the organisers, the contract to run the main Olympic sites has
drawn interest from Manchester United Football Club, Wembley Stadium and
Spectacor, a US sports management group.
Outline plans were submitted for a stadium, a cycle track, a national sports
training centre and nearby retail and commercial development. Formal
consultations will now start with about 50 businesses that will be displaced
by the plans. Financial packages to help them are being prepared by
Co-operative Bank.
The aim is to get early planning permission so that construction of at least
the Pounds 9m cycle track is well under way when members of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) visit the city next year.
By then, the site of the stadium should be ready for construction to start.
The size of the stadium will depend on the IOC decision - 80,000 seats if
Manchester is chosen, 60,000 if not. It is expected to cost Pounds 100m to
Pounds 120m.
The government, which gave Pounds 53m towards the bid in February, still has
to be persuaded to back a national stadium if Manchester fails to get the
Olympics. Mr Bob Scott, chairman of the bid, said: 'As things stand, the
stadium will only be built if the games are awarded, but we hope to persuade
the government to adopt a more positive view in the coming months.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / BP in joint venture to challenge British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION in the industrial gas market intensified yesterday with the
launch of an Anglo-Norwegian joint venture that aims to be the 'major rival
to British Gas'.
Alliance Gas is a UK-based venture between British Petroleum, the oil and
petrochemicals producer; Statoil, the state-owned Norwegian oil and gas
company; and Norsk Hydro, the energy and chemicals group in which the
Norwegian government also has a 51 per cent share.
The company brings together the UK's biggest North Sea gas producer and the
two companies that have the largest Norwegian gas reserves.
Alliance aims for a 15 per cent market share of the industrial and
commercial supply sector by the second half of the decade, when British Gas
will have been forced to cut its share to less than 40 per cent.
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the industry watchdog, said
the company was a 'heavyweight entrant into the market'.
He said: 'I think it is an important milestone in opening up competition.
For the first time we have got Norwegian companies in the marketplace, which
is very important, considering Norway's extensive supplies.'
The company plans to supply customers of all sizes from the small commercial
sector through to power generators.
One of its potential strengths will lie in its access to long-term supplies.
Alliance announced yesterday that it had purchased the entire output of the
Hyde gas field, off the Humberside coast in the North Sea, due to come on
stream in October next year. The field, with proven reserves of 143bn cu ft,
will supply 55m cu ft a day.
In addition, Alliance has 50 per cent of the Ann field, operated by Phillips
Petroleum, the US energy and chemicals group, and interests in other North
Sea fields including the Anglia, Welland and Beryl fields. It will also bid
for a share when British Gas sells part of its contracted gas later this
year.
From 1996 onwards Alliance will be able to draw on substantial Norwegian
reserves, guaranteeing supply well into the next century.
Another strength will be a marketing arrangement announced yesterday with
East Midlands Electricity, similar to that already announced by five
regional electricity companies with Utilicorp, the second-largest US gas
producer. That will enable it to supply new and existing customers with both
electricity and gas.
Alliance is in discussion with several other regional electricity companies,
and Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director, said the company hoped to sign
at least one other similar deal.
Mr Maroe emphasised that in spite of its strong links with producers,
Alliance will buy gas and operate on an 'arm's length basis'.
He said: 'We aim to be a downstream-led, market-oriented supplier. If you
open our brochure you won't find pictures of North Sea platforms and
pipelines, but instead people talking to customers.'
Alliance aims to outperform British Gas on price, flexibility and standards
of service.
Significant question marks still hang over the deregulation process,
however. In spite of its size, Alliance faces difficulties similar to its
competitors'.
First, Mr Maroe admitted yesterday that an initial shortage of gas might
slow its entry into the commercial market in the early stages. The company
is reserving judgment about moving into the domestic market for the same
reason.
It also has to use British Gas's existing pipeline system, which the company
has agreed to hive off into an arm's-length subsidiary by the end of the
year.
But fears of a dispute over tariffs were fuelled last week by the insistence
of Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, that the 4.5 per cent margin it is
permitted by Ofgas on carriage charges is insufficient.
Sixteen companies have now entered the challenge to British Gas. This was
made possible by the requirement of the Office of Fair Trading for British
Gas to halve its share of the industrial market - those users above 25,000
therms a year - to 40 per cent by 1995.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, recently announced that he would lay an
order before parliament in June lowering the threshold for competition from
25,000 to 2,500 therms. That will increase the number of businesses open to
competition from 20,000 to more than 200,000 from October.
Mr Eggar said he would review the threshold again next year, raising the
prospect of competition in the household market three years earlier than
previously envisaged.

<TEXT>
Older generation: the Liberty watermill on the river Wandle in south London
started generating electricity for the first time for 50 years at the
weekend, Bethan Hutton writes.
Platform, an arts and ecology group, refitted the mill at Merton, which was
originally used by a factory making Liberty fabrics, to supply power for an
exhibition on London's historic water resources. The mill can generate 650
watts, but only a quarter of that is used by the exhibition.
The mill has been reopened as part of the Still Waters project, a series of
arts events and installations being held this month which aims to remind
Londoners of the capital's small rivers, now mostly heavily polluted or
hidden underground.
As part of its long-term goal of making London an ecologically sustainable
city, Platform is also working with the National Rivers Authority and the
Intermediate Technology Development Group to install a micro-hydro turbine
at the mouth of the Wandle. The turbine would be a demonstration project
that would generate up to 1,000 watts to help light a local school or health
clinic.

A FURTHER delay in the launch of Taurus, the long-awaited paperless

The project, originally scheduled for last autumn, is now planned for next

The latest hitch is in the development by IBM of a system to protect the

FT  19 MAY 92 / National Grid faces first big inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PUBLIC inquiry starting today into plans to upgrade 50 miles of power
lines in Cleveland and North Yorkshire will constitute a test of the
environmental implications of the electricity industry's privatisation.
The National Grid Company, fighting its first big public inquiry since it
was established in 1990 under the electricity supply industry's
restructuring, wants to erect 50 miles of 400 kV powerlines, carried on 150
ft high pylons, between Lackenby on Teesside and Shipton, near York.
The 1,875MW Enron plant, the world's biggest gas-fired power station, under
construction on Teesside, was the catalyst. The upgrading will allow
Teesside Power, the consortium behind the Pounds 800m plant, to feed
electricity into the central pool for sale.
The Pounds 200m grid reinforcement will also provide additional spare
capacity in anticipation of imports of electricity from Scotland and the
construction of more power stations, underlining fears over the
environmental impact of the trend towards gas-fired power stations in a
liberated energy marketplace.
The inquiry, due to last at least 10 weeks, opens in Northallerton, North
Yorkshire.
NGC is proposing two alternative routes for the Teesside section, one
skirting the Cleveland Hills, the other - opposed by the government-funded
Teesside Development Corporation - criss-crossing the Tees. Three
alternative routes are proposed through the rural Vale of York.
NGC will counter calls for underground cabling by saying that costs 10 to 15
times as much as overhead lines. It denies that overhead lines pose a health
risk.
NGC's plans provoked 7,000 objections; 200 individuals and organisations
will speak at the inquiry. Objectors include the Department of Transport,
Cleveland and North Yorkshire county councils.

FT  19 MAY 92 / SE reviews privileges of its market makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange has launched a wide-ranging review of the market-making
system introduced to its markets at the time of Big Bang in 1986.
Under the chairmanship of Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman,
the review will examine how market makers are regulated and whether their
duties and privileges have kept up with the changes in the stock market.
By quoting firm prices at which they will buy or sell shares, market makers
are at the heart of the UK stock market. In return they are given certain
privileges, such as freedom from stamp duty on share transactions and the
exclusive right to borrow stock.
The future of this system, unique to the UK among leading stock markets, has
come under threat from a number of quarters. Market makers are likely to
lose their most significant privileges in the months ahead, as both freedom
from stamp duty and the right to borrow stock are extended to other
investors.
At the same time, some securities houses are more involved in proprietary
trading - acting as principals in trading for their own account - rather
than pure market making, raising questions about whether they should
continue to benefit from special privileges.
Also the nature of the business has been transformed by the development of
derivatives markets, which allow traders or investors to hedge their risks
in other markets. That raises questions about how market makers are
regulated.
For instance, a put option, which allows a market maker to sell shares at a
predetermined price to an investor, effectively puts a floor under a
company's share price, since the market maker will be willing to buy shares
if they fall below that price in the market.
The Stock Exchange examined a put option granted by the late Robert Maxwell
to Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, but decided that Goldman had not
breached market-making rules.
The exchange is to delay changes to its rules that would have significantly
reduced the amount of information which is published on activity in the
stock market.
It had planned to abandon publication of large trades altogether, in an
attempt to buttress its market-making system - a controversial proposal that
has in the past aroused the concern of the Office of Fair Trading.
The change, which was to have taken effect within weeks, will not now be
made until the exchange has completely overhauled its existing market
systems - a process likely to take months.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Inflation surge highlights gloomy state of Israeli economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTEDLY high rise in inflation, until recently one of the few
indicators in Israel to show an encouraging trend, has highlighted the
gloomy state of the immigration-burdened economy as the June 23 general
election campaign picks up pace.
While the debate between the ruling Likud party and the Labour opposition
tends to be dominated by the political issue of how to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict, the government is worried that record unemployment
levels and lack of significant growth will damage its prospects among such
key constituencies as new immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
The government statistics bureau tentatively reported a pick-up in
industrial exports and investment in recent weeks, saying this could presage
a recovery. Tourism is sharply up this year. But most figures offer the
government little comfort.
The consumer price index rose 1.8 per cent in April, the highest monthly
increase since last August when an inflation surge driven mainly by rising
house prices began to reverse. April is traditionally a high inflation
month, but there were hopes that the index, which rose by 18 per cent in
1991, would be held lower at a time of stagnation in the economy.
A report by Bank Hapoalim says a slowdown that began in the second half of
last year continued through the first quarter of 1992, its index of
industrial production showing a downward tend from last August. Newly
published final government statistics for 1991 show gross domestic product
rose 5.8 per cent last year. But per capita growth was negligible because of
a similar rise in the population from Russian immigration.
The biggest worry has been the poor performance of exports. Meant to be the
engine of successful immigration absorption, exports fell 2 per cent in
1991.
Bank Hapoalim said industrial exports suffered a downward lurch in the first
quarter of more than 4 per cent in dollar terms compared with the last
quarter of 1991.
Unemployment has risen to about 12 per cent of the workforce. Among new
immigrants the rate is almost 40 per cent, a figure which is blamed for a
steep fall in the flow of newcomers despite economic hardship in the former
Soviet republics.
The US, attempting to defuse a public row with Israel, said yesterday that
UN Resolution 194 - covering Palestinian 'right of return' - was not part of
the terms of reference of the Arab-Israeli peace process, Reuter reports
from Washington.
Last week the State Department said it still supported the resolution.

MANY WHO saw General Suchinda Kraprayoon's press conference on February 24
last year, the day after the military seized power, were impressed by the
performance of the Thai commander in chief.
His manner was friendly and relaxed, and he appeared willing to tolerate
frank questioning. He also modestly admitted that he was not well versed in
certain matters of state, such as the economy, and was therefore prepared to
leave broad areas of policy to the experts.
A week later he further enhanced his standing in the eyes of many by
appointing a respected and able civilian, Mr Anand Panyarachun, to be prime
minister,
This was a stark contrast to the military dictators who dominated Thai
politics for 40 years up to the 1970s, and still leave a legacy of thirst
for political power within the army.
Fourteen months later, as prime minister and himself faced with a mass
campaign against his rule, Gen Suchinda presents a different picture. But
many analysts believe that even if he does win the current battle, the
return of the military to full domination cannot be taken for granted.
It is significant that he is the first military prime minister to have been
the target of such massive public opposition as soon as he took office.
A similar uprising, in October 1973, took place when the public became tired
of years of dictatorship. This time, the public in Bangkok was determined
not to let the military take control right from the beginning.
Part of the reason lies in the growing strength of urban civil society that
has built up with the country's rapid economic growth and a lengthening if
intermittent history of parliamentary democracy. In Bangkok and many urban
centres, the public is much less willing to bow to the military.
Another part involves the image of Gen Suchinda and his colleagues that has
emerged since last year's coup. His apparent indifference to public opinion
has added to the alienation.
General Suchinda dominated the fifth class of cadets studying under the
post-Second World War curriculum of the country's military academy. The
group is now known as Class 5. The year of graduation from the academy has
come to be a key element in determining allegiances and enmities within the
forces
Class 5's politicisation came about in the late 1970s and early 1980s with
the rise of a group two years his junior, Class 7. The Class 7 officers, who
became disillusioned with years of fighting communism in Thailand's poorest
provinces, were responsible for the appointment of several prime ministers,
including Gen Prem Tinsulanonda.
Class 5's response to the Young Turks, who looked as though they might
overtake them, was to form a 'Democratic Soldiers' group, and much of the
internal military conflict in the 1980s was between the two.
Three figures have emerged as leaders of Class 5 since last year's coup: Gen
Suchinda, Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the Air Force chief who
succeeded him as Armed Forces Supreme Commander, and Gen Issarapong
Noonpakdi, the premier's brother-in-law who replaced him as army chief.
Several other Class 5 figures are in positions of power, and two members of
the Noonpakdi family have risen to important command positions.
Because many of the officers also have business interests, the Bangkok
public, including much of the business community that would once have worked
hand in hand with the military, has become highly suspicious of the degree
of domination.
The opposition is therefore seen as a civilian response to the return of the
military, and in many ways it is. But it is also important that many of the
elected politicians leading the opposition in fact have military
backgrounds.
Maj Gen Chamlong Srimuang, the near ascetic former governor of Bangkok, who
was arrested yesterday, was a member of Class 7 before he left the army.
This may explain why the prime minister treated his actions with utmost
suspicion.

ACCUSATIONS of fraud among candidates in last week's Philippine presidential
election further fuelled uncertainty yesterday, as Mr Fidel Ramos, the
administration-backed candidate, widened his lead in the count.
With nearly 32 per cent of the estimated 26.7m votes counted last night, Mr
Ramos, former defence chief, had a margin of 301,900 votes over Mrs Miriam
Defensor Santiago, the combative former immigration commissioner who had
claimed victory early in the slow vote-counting process.
Mrs Santiago had accused her rival of 'wholesale election fraud' and
threatened to launch protest demonstrations. Her camp announced plans to
divulge evidence of the alleged fraud tomorrow.
Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, a business associate of the late President Ferdinand
Marcos, maintained his hold on third slot. Mr Cojuangco, claiming that he
would take the lead once the votes from the provinces were tallied, had
accused the administration of Mrs Corazon Aquino of illegal spending to
influence the vote.
Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of the late dictator, another
candidate, yesterday refused to appear in a court arraignment in connection
with charges of illegal currency holdings overseas.
She said she would boycott all court hearings - she is facing more than 50
suits in various courts - in protest against what she alleged as widespread
fraud in the election. She was still in fifth position yesterday in a field
of seven candidates.
The Manila stock market composite index, after an upbeat mood last week
following a generally peaceful May 11 polling, yesterday fell 21.26 points,
or 1.6 per cent, to to 1,317.11.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Fujimori offers compromise on democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru has offered a compromise plan for a swift
return to democracy, in an attempt to avert the threat of sanctions.
In an address yesterday afternoon to foreign ministers of the Organisation
of American States (OAS), meeting in the Bahamas, he proposed a return to
democracy through election of a 'democratic constituent congress' to reform
Peru's constitution.
The proposal represents a volte-face by the president, who two weeks ago was
refusing to consider such a mechanism. But the prospect of international
isolation and the severing of crucial funding to support Peru's IMF-approved
economic adjustment programme seem to have wrought a change of heart.
Architect of the compromise is Mr Hernando de Soto, a former presidential
adviser. Mr Fujimori's proposals contain all the elements of Mr de Soto's
draft law on the 'democratisation of government decision-making,' which the
president has already embraced once and discarded. This time, having
committed himself before the OAS to setting up mechanisms for
pre-publication of laws, freedom of information and gathering of citizen
feed-back, Mr Fujimori may have to stick to his promises.
Mr Fujimori placed responsibility for his April 5 overthrow of democracy
squarely on Peru's political parties and justice system.
'There is a complete institutional vacuum,' he said, adding that those
elected to the interim congress would be prevented from standing in the next
two full congressional elections. This would ensure that constitutional
reform did not fall prey to party interests.
The proposals, outlined in Lima prior to the president's surprise departure
on Sunday for the Bahamas, have not been well received by Peru's deposed
congressmen.
Mr Maximo San Roman, elected by MPs as 'constitutional president' of Peru,
called them unilateral, arbitrary and dictatorial. But opinion polls still
give Mr Fujimori about 75 per cent popular support.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Ecuador elects to follow path of market reform: The
consequences of the left's declining popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOR appears set after elections on Sunday to follow the rest of Latin
America towards a more open market-oriented economy.
The new president will be either Mr Sixto Duran, 72, or Mr Jaime Nebot, 45,
who will face off in a second round on July 5. Mr Duran won 33.2 per cent of
the valid votes cast and Mr Nebot 25.4 per cent. Both favour privatisation
and moves to open the economy and make it more responsive to market forces.
This is in contrast to the administration of President Rodrigo Borja
Cevallos which, although lowering some tariff barriers, has resisted the
shift towards more liberal economic policies sweeping the continent. Mr
Borja's Democratic Left party, along with other socialist parties, suffered
a sharp setback in Sunday's local, congressional and presidential elections.
In theory, this suggests a new administration should have the support of a
sympathetic right-of-centre legislature. In practice, dealing with a
Congress fragmented among a dozen parties will be difficult and a common
economic cause will not necessarily overcome party rivalries.
Mr Jaime Duran, director of Informe Especial, a political survey group, said
a combination of local and international events contributed to the left's
decline.
The collapse of communism in east Europe and the success of market-oriented
economic policies elsewhere in Latin America were significant. On top of
this, many voters considered the Borja administration as mediocre and worn
out.
It has presided for four years over growth of 2-3 per cent, which translates
in per capita terms to economic stagnation. Inflation is down from its
highs, but still running at an annual 50 per cent. Ideology counts for
little among most voters.
Furthermore, the right-of-centre candidates satisfied traditional regional
divisions in Ecuadorean politics. Mr Duran, mayor of Quito for eight years
and twice unsuccessful as presidential contender, is viewed as the highland
candidate; Mr Nebot as the candidate of the hot coastal regions around
Guayaquil.
Mr Duran, an architect born in Boston, Massachusetts, who studied at Durham
University in England, claims blood ties with the coast and may have the
better claim to represent the whole of the country. He took more than a
fifth of the coastal vote, while in the highlands Mr Nebot took only 12 per
cent.
However, Mr Duran, while viewed as honest and unlikely to fall prey to
cronyism, is a less dynamic campaigner than the more charismatic Mr Nebot.
The latter is also likely to benefit more from the 21.2 per cent of votes
cast for Mr Abdala Bucaram, a populist of Lebanese extraction who is also
from the coast.
On the other hand, Mr Nebot is viewed with suspicion by the left, which has
no candidate in the second round.
Mr Nebot's Social Christian party secured at least 19 seats in the 77-seat
Congress. Mr Duran's Republican Unity won 13 but the Conservative party,
with which it is in alliance, enjoyed a resurgence and took seven seats.
If Mr Nebot loses he may prevent his party co-operating with the
administration, thus improving his chances of election in 1996. A year ago
Mr Duran pulled out of the Social Christian party, of which he was a
founder, to form his new movement.
Whoever wins, the new administration should be able to count on more support
from international financial institutions and western governments,
particularly the US. But the task ahead will not be easy. By some estimates,
Ecuador is 10-20 years behind neighbouring Colombia in its economic
development.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is to decentralise public education in a move aimed
at curbing the powerful teaching union's effective veto over plans to
modernise the system.
Responsibility for budgets, teacher training, salary negotiations and
regional variations in the national curriculum will be transferred to the 31
state authorities, although the federal government will continue to set
guidelines and provide most resources.
The reforms seek to reduce the power of the National Teachers Union to
obstruct change by, in effect, dividing it into state chapters.
The changes have been accepted by leaders of the union which, with 1m
members, is the largest in Latin America and one of the traditional props of
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party.
A senior government official said he expected resistance to the changes in
parts of Mexico City, Michoacan, Chiapas and Oaxaca.
Most Mexicans' poor standard of education is explained mainly by rural
poverty and lack of funding. However, poor teacher training, teacher
absenteeism, weak supervision, understaffing of rural schools and lack of
teacher evaluation are widely blamed on the union's unwillingness to impose
greater discipline on teachers.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Who might be who as a Number Two: The field of possible
choices for the Clinton and Perot campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST intriguing political news story of the week was to be found in the
New York Post, not normally a reliable source. It reported that Mr Ross
Perot, Texas businessman and president aspirant, had held secret talks with
Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York, and dangled in front of him the
prospect of the Number Two slot on the independent ticket.
The Hamlet of the Hudson confirmed the conversations and went on to say that
the Texan 'has more credibility than politicians'. But then, typically, he
deflated the balloon. The vice-presidency had not come up because 'Perot
knows I'm a Democrat and I will support Clinton'.
But, with the two main nominations sewn up, barring accidents, and Mr Perot
free to make his own choice, attention inevitably turns to who runs with
whom. President George Bush will go with a known commodity, Vice-President
Dan Quayle, but Governor Bill Clinton, who will be the Democratic party's
candidate, and Mr Perot have to find somebody capable of making a
difference.
So seriously is Mr Clinton taking the issue that he has asked Mr Warren
Christopher, one-time deputy secretary of state, Washington lawyer and
author of last year's devastating report on the Los Angeles police
department, to head a search committee.
The pundits' choice is Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. He would bring
regional balance, national stature (greatly enhanced by his prescient speech
on race relations in March), sporting fame, political compatibility, the
lot. The popular view is that he would have made a stronger presidential
candidate than Mr Clinton.
But Mr Bradley did not run for the nomination and insists that he is going
to live up to his promise to serve out his Senate term, which expires in
1996. Mr Clinton said he would serve out his term as governor of Arkansas,
but the suspicion is Mr Bradley means it.
There is a growing assumption that Mr Clinton will need someone with
Washington experience, and there are more heavyweights in the Senate than in
the House, which is in any case mired in scandal. The Senate short-lists
normally include Jay Rockefeller from West Virginia (safe pair of hands,
good name, lacks fire, from a small state); Tom Harkin from Iowa (early
candidate, liberal credentials not necessarily an asset); Bob Kerrey from
Nebraska (also failed candidate, better in print than in the flesh); John
Kerry from Massachusetts (smart, ambitious, not well-known outside New
England).
Also Harris Wofford, the new man from Pennsylvania (a northern Catholic, but
liberal compared to Mr Clinton); Paul Simon from Illinois (ran in 1988, from
a critical big state, but again rather liberal); and George Mitchell from
Maine (majority leader, once a judge, ability not in doubt, but from a very
small state and a real Washington devil in the Republican lexicon.)
Democrat Paul Tsongas, who once posed the biggest threat in the primaries,
probably would not accept, in the unlikely event he was asked, and seems
intent on launching a fiscal responsibility lobby with Republican Senator
Warren Rudman from New Hampshire, who has announced his retirement in
disgust with the ways of Congress. Mr Cuomo might be approached, despite his
rudeness to Mr Clinton, but an answer might not be forthcoming before the
election.
Mr Clinton will undoubtedly consider some state governors and some women
but, needing the south as he does, will not be seeking a black. Also, no
Asian or Hispanic automatically springs to mind.
Mr Perot has a 'temporary' running mate, retired Admiral William Stockdale,
but he was named only to overcome technical problems getting registered on
state ballots. Beyond that there are few clues to his thinking, though
Senator Rudman's reputation for plain speaking might appeal, and Governor
Lowell Weicker, the maverick liberal Republican turned independent from
Connecticut, is sounding more like Mr Perot every day.
If he is looking for a woman, Ms Jeane Kirkpatrick, UN ambassador in the
Reagan administration, is on record as saying that 'if Ross Perot were to
ask me, that would be very serious'. Ms Ann McLaughlin, former Republican
secretary of labour, has also reportedly been sounded out.
One equally delicious theory, on a par with the Cuomo flier, has Mr Perot
picking retired General 'stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf to help sort out the
national mess. However, General Curtis 'bombs away' LeMay added little to
the last potent independent candidacy of George Wallace in 1968.
Mr Perot could stick to his last and pick a businessman, but the corporate
heavyweights are not all enthusiasts. Mr Robert Allen, chief executive of
AT&amp;T, noted the other day: 'It would be refreshing to hear Ross ask for some
advice.'

CONTROVERSIAL proposals to impose an EC-wide quota on imports of cheap
Chinese footwear could increase the cost of trainers for EC consumers,
manufacturers say.
Trade officials from the Twelve yesterday discussed a Commission proposal
for EC quotas in different categories of shoes, including the growing market
for trainers. They broke up without agreement, with a majority said to
favour the quota proposal. Britain, Germany and the Netherlands asked the
Commission to supply further economic justification for the measure for
their meeting this week.
Chinese officials are in Brussels to discuss the proposals. China might
suggest a voluntary agreement to restrain exports, but Brussels does not
seem to favour such deals.
Instead of scrapping quotas altogether, Brussels decided to press for
harmonised EC quotas in specific areas, assessed according to the value of
imports. Quotas will be abolished in other markets, such as waterproof
footwear.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday cleared a link-up between ferry companies
operating a busy short sea-crossing between Denmark and Sweden, but promised
to watch the companies' pricing policy on the service.
It is the first time Brussels has ruled on such a case in the ferry
industry, using special rules on the application of EC competition law to
the sector.
The precedent will be examined by main operators on other short-sea routes,
for example, Sealink Stena Line and P&amp;O, across the English Channel. In
March, the UK Department of Trade and Industry refused to let P&amp;O merge its
Dover-Calais services with those of Sealink, ahead of Channel tunnel
competition.
The Commission said it would allow Danske Statsbaner and Statens Jarnvager,
the Danish and Swedish rail and ferry monopolies, to pool their ferry
operations with those of Scandinavian Ferry Lines on the crossing between
Helsingor, north of Copenhagen, and Helsingborg, Sweden.
Brussels found the agreement would curb competition between the companies,
but said the disadvantages would be outweighed by travellers having a more
frequent service on new, large-capacity ferries, with lower costs. The
Commission will monitor the joint services to check savings are reflected in
prices.
Brussels argued the companies were competing not only with one another on
the Helsingor-Helsingborg crossing, but with ferries on other routes between
Germany, Denmark and Sweden. Under the original agreement, they would
automatically have operated joint services on new routes between Sweden and
Denmark, but to avoid future curbs on competition, the trio have been forced
to drop that clause.
The Commission said its decision only referred to the supply of ferry
services, not touching on the market for harbour services, which are often
provided by ferry operators and could be used to restrict competition from
competing ferry companies.

FT  19 MAY 92 / German pay deal high but bearable, say experts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trend-setting pay agreement in the German engineering sector is higher
than employers wanted but low enough to be bearable this year.
The 5.8 per cent deal with IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union
representing 4m workers, suggests that average industrial pay increases this
year will settle below the 6 per cent allowed for in most economic
forecasts. In the opinion of Mr Willi Leibfritz, head of the macroeconomics
department at the Ifo economics institute in Munich, the package is 'not a
complete disaster as was feared'.
But the settlement is considerably higher than the 4 per cent recommended by
the group of economic advisers labelled the 'five wise men'.
Relatively rapid wage inflation, at least by German standards, combined with
depressed productivity growth, mean that manufacturing industry's unit
labour costs will continue to rise more quickly than in other large European
countries this year, further eroding the gains in export competitiveness of
the late 1980s.
The tensions arising from the cost of German unification will remain a
threat to west German competitiveness over the next few years, according to
Mr Leibfritz. Ordinary people, hit last year with a 7.5 per cent income tax
levy and parallel rises in duties on tobacco, petrol and heating oil, have
failed to understand the necessity for sacrifices to finance reconstruction
in the east, he said.
Intensive talks between unions, government and industry are needed to
persuade people of the fiscal costs of unification and the need to reduce
public sector borrowing. Mr Leibfritz argued.
'It will be very critical when value added tax goes up 1 per cent next
January that the lesson has been learnt that indirect taxes cannot be used
as a basis for wage negotiations. . . . the (union) leaders have recognised
the problems, but I don't see that their members have really accepted the
situation.'
Specialists at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
said the west German pay deal was less damaging than the agreements within
the metal industry to equalise wages in the east and western lander by 1996.
Last year's OECD report was strongly critical of the fast pace of wage
convergence between east and west and called for wage subsidies to close the
gap between high east German wages and low relative productivity.
Mr Reinhard Furstenberg, economist at J P Morgan in Frankfurt, argues that
the engineering industry agreement makes wage convergence process even more
difficult. 'This deal makes the 1996 target almost impossible for east
German companies to meet.'
However, the deal will ease inflationary pressures over the next few months.
Pay disputes in the construction and printing sectors are now with
arbitrators and deals there are expected soon. 'The 1992 pay round is now
all sewn up,' said Mr Juergen Pfister, senior economist at Commerzbank.
Mr Alexander Batschari, spokesman for the VDMA engineering industry
association in Frankfurt, said the 5.8 per cent could prove difficult for
some companies. 'But what was the alternative? There would have been strikes
and lock-outs and we could have ended up with an even higher deal.'

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWISS government yesterday confronted the country's traditional
isolationist tendencies head on, deciding to submit shortly a formal
application to join the European Community.
Public opposition to the decision is likely to be widespread and passionate
once the full implications of membership become clear.
The decision has been taken sooner than expected, spurred partly by last
Sunday's referendum which showed a majority in favour of Switzerland joining
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, the government
could have difficulty persuading a majority to vote for EC membership. Just
six years ago three-quarters of Swiss voters rejected a proposal to join the
United Nations.
Recent opinion polls have indicated that a slim majority in favour of EC
entry, but about a third are undecided.
Membership would mean sharply reduced subsidies for farmers, open
competition for small merchants and professionals, and an unrestricted flow
of workers and property purchasers from other EC countries.
Subsidy levels on Swiss meat and dairy products are now two to three times
EC levels, and the country's farmers demonstrate frequently to make clear
their opposition to joining the EC or accepting any reduction in aid.
The decision to apply for EC membership reflects the eagerness of a majority
in the federal cabinet that Switzerland should negotiate entry alongside the
other western European applicants - Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland.
The EC's position on member countries retaining a neutral foreign policy
will be worked out during these negotiations, and the Swiss government wants
to be a participant rather than be forced later to accept the result.
The decision has also been influenced by cabinet concerns about a plebiscite
in the next few months on the European Economic Area. The EEA would bring
together the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association,
including Switzerland, and those of the EC. The cabinet fears that if the
EEA treaty is rejected, Switzerland could not then immediately apply for EC
membership. However, if it applies before the referendum, it can claim the
two were unrelated and simply carry on with EC entry negotiations.

<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Russia's central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, was yesterday
accused of breaking the law and faces a call for his resignation.
Warning of 'financial collapse' because of soaring debts between
enterprises, Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the Russian parliamentary
budget committee and a member of its presidium, said he would demand Mr
Matiukhin's resignation during parliamentary hearings on the central bank
later this week or early next.
He said the bank had broken the law and terms of its charter by refusing to
produce a report on its activities due last Friday. It had also appointed
and dismissed board members without reference to parliament under whose
auspices it falls.
An investigation, related to the taking of bribes, was now in train.
However, Mr Pochinok said there was no confirm-ation of newspaper
allegations that credits had been advanced to members of the government or
parliament.
He said the central bank had followed the government's restrictive credit
policy too closely. This had resulted in an inter-enterprise debt of Rbs1.5
trillion (million million), and non-payment of wages by enterprises
amounting by May 1 to Rbs73bn.
There was now a severe danger of 'financial collapse' because of the
restrictions in credit.
Mr Matiukhin has been a political football in recent months - blamed by the
Russian government for adopting a loose credits policy, and now apparently
losing his previous parliamentary protection for being too tough.
Mr Pochinok said new candidates for chairman and board members were being
considered, but gave no names.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Europe fears refugee influx as war spreads: Civil conflict
displaces more than 1m people from former Yugoslav territories

THE displacement of over 1m people - the largest movement of refugees in
Europe since the second world war - could increase sharply if, as many fear,
the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina spreads to other cities, officials from relief
agencies said yesterday.
This grim warning was made as Italy, bracing itself for an exodus of
refugees, called for urgent talks with its European Community partners.
Some 600 people reached Trieste at the weekend, prompting fears that it
could face a massive influx of refugees after a 21-day ceasefire agreed by
Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders yesterday quickly broke-down amid renewed
outbreaks of shelling in Sarajevo.
Under the latest truce, brokered by UN officials in the Bosnian capital,
Serb-led Yugoslav federal forces claimed they would withdraw from Bosnia.
It follows a string of failed truces that have frustrated international
efforts to end fighting that broke out after multi-ethnic Bosnia seceded
from Yugoslavia in March.
Sarajevo has been shattered by pitched battles between Serb irregulars
backed by the federal army and a loose amalgam of Bosnian Moslem and Croat
forces since early April.
Despite the ceasefire agreement, the exodus is expected to continue. Last
night a train with some 2,000 Bosnian refugees was being held up at Zagreb
station pending clearance from either the Italian or Austrian authorities.
'The killing and the fighting is leading to an acute refugee crisis. It will
get worse,' said Mr Michael Steiner, co-ordinator of Germany's humanitarian
aid mission in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. Mr Steiner said the Croatian
government was finding it increasingly difficult to deal with the growing
numbers of refugees.
Croatia is looking after 484,000 refugees. An estimated 200,000 have fled
eastern Slavonia, eastern Croatia, after being driven out by Serb militants
and the federal army last year. The remainder have come northwards from
Bosnia after fighting started six weeks ago. Most are being put up in
schools, hotels, halls, or by Croatian families and relatives.
But resources and space are running out. Yesterday, Mr Zvonomir Separovic,
Croatia's foreign minister, sent a letter to the foreign ministers of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe appealing for assistance.
'The wave of refugees is not ending. Croatia is accepting them but cannot
take care of them. Europe has to decide whether to accept them or help to
give them a chance of survival,' he said.
Mr Steiner said the war in Bosnia could increase the number of refugees by a
quarter of a million. 'This situation is becoming desperate here, and in
Bosnia,' he added.
Before the ceasefire was announced, Yugoslav federal army troops and Serb
irregulars yesterday attacked Tuzla, northern Bosnia, which until recently
was an oasis of co-existence between the Moslem, Serb and Croat communities.
Apparently, the attack is retaliation for nine federal soldiers killed last
week.
Ms Nenda Nachampassak, an official at the UN High Commission on Refugees in
London, said innocent people in Bosnia were 'fleeing out of fright and
panic.
'We still want to try and get a convey to Sarajevo (the capital of
Bosnia-Hercegovina).'
'There are 100,000 children in the city. A quarter of them are under the age
of three. They have no milk . . .'
As part of the diplomatic drive to end the bloodshed in Bosnia, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, yesterday arrived in Belgrade.
Mr Kozyrev is due to meet Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and will
visit the capitals of the former Yugoslav republics.
Croatia and Slovenia will become independent members of the United Nations
under separate resolutions approved by the Security Council yesterday,
writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Bosnia-Hercegovina has also applied and is expected to be cleared shortly,
further confirming the break-up of the old Yugoslav federation, a UN
founder-state.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Upheaval fails to halt building of warships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW SLADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is continuing to build big warships despite funding problems, and its
submarine operations have hardly been affected by the dissolution of the
Soviet Union, a western naval authority said yesterday.
Capt Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships, the 1992-93 edition of
which was published yesterday, said production of nuclear missile-carrying
submarines had come to a temporary halt last year, but three nuclear-powered
hunter-killer submarines and three diesel-powered craft had been launched.
He warned that proliferation of submarine expertise was one of the main
problems posed by the break-up of the Soviet Union. Iran is said to be
interested in buying one or two diesel-powered submarines.
Of the former Soviet Union's 24 naval yards, 14 were now under civilian
control.
Captain Sharpe predicted that if this trend continued, Russia would probably
have only two major submarine yards, with perhaps another two yards
producing large surface vessels and three building minor warships.
However, at least three of these yards were each equivalent to any other
naval yard in the world.

THE presidium of the Crimean parliament yesterday caved in to Ukrainian
political pressure and backed down from its separatist bid. If parliament,
due to meet tomorrow, follows its recommendation, the prospect of a Crimean
breakaway from Ukraine could fade.
The presidium recommended that parliament annul its rather ambiguous May 5
declaration of independence following a resolution passed by the Ukrainian
parliament last week declaring the move unconstitutional.
Crimea's surprising turnaround may have been inspired by a statement by 17
of Crimea's 22 city mayors that if the Crimean government continued to
violate the Ukrainian constitution they would obey only Ukrainian laws.
Armenian fighters thrust into Azeri territory near the Turkish border
yesterday, Reuter reports. Armenian radio said its forces controlled part of
the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan after dislodging Azeris whom it accused of
shelling Armenian villages.
Other reports said Armenians from the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the main focus of four years of conflict, had taken the
key Azeri town of Lachin, enabling them to establish a land corridor with
Armenia proper.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Thai army fires on protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THAI TROOPS struggling to regain control of Bangkok fired on anti-government
demonstrators in the city centre with machine guns and rifles last night,
killing at least seven people and wounding more than 100.
Witnesses said the soldiers fired volley after volley at thousands of
protesters outside the Royal Hotel. The building became a focal point on the
second night of mass protests aimed at forcing the resignation of General
Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister.
Doctors inside the hotel, where dozens of injured people took refuge, said
there were six dead there.
Early today, renewed gunfire drove protesters away from an area they had
occupied on a central boulevard and the military said it had set up squads
to hunt down rioters.
The violence, which has been concentrated in a large area of the city near
the Democracy Monument, has aroused concern among foreign investors and
Thailand's trading partners.
In Tokyo, Japan's government spokesman Mr Koichi Kato said he hoped order
would be restored quickly. 'Political stability in Thailand is extremely
important for the stability of south-east Asia, and therefore we are
concerned,' he said.
The Foreign Office in London advised Britons to delay any travel to Bangkok
and in Washington the US State Department said joint military exercises with
Thailand were under review.
Last night, a Thai military spokesman, in a television announcement, accused
motorcycle gangs of inciting violence among demonstrators.
During yesterday's protests Thai troops fired over the heads of a group of
demonstrators and surrounded them, arresting the opposition leader Mr
Chamlong Srimuang and taking him away in handcuffs. Later, official
announcements said the arrested leaders had been treated well and 'invited
to discuss how to restore peace and order'.
Gen Suchinda imposed a state of emergency in an attempt to restore order,
but the crackdown only served to inflame the now leaderless demonstrators.
Officials said troops had killed at least five people since the start of the
unrest on Sunday.
Tourism, one of Thailand's main foreign exchange earners, is likely to be
seriously affected. Government offices and schools are closed until
Thursday, although banks and the stock market are supposed to reopen today
after a Monday holiday.
Mr Chamlong, a devout Buddhist and anti-corruption campaigner who was once
himself a general in the army, served two terms as governor of Bangkok. Just
before he was arrested, he told reporters that the demonstrators would make
'no compromise at all'.
Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief, said the government had no
choice but to use force during this latest round of protests because the
demonstrators were marching on government buildings.
He arranged a coup d'etat last year to overthrow the elected government of
General Chatichai Choonhavan, accusing it of excessive corruption. The
demonstrators want the post of prime minister kept for an elected member of
parliament and to amend the constitution to curb the political influence of
the military.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Government rules out Jubilee extension without O&amp;Y cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday toughened its stance over the Jubilee Line
extension to the Canary Wharf office development in east London, saying that
construction would not begin until the Pounds 400m cash contribution pledged
by Olympia &amp; York had been secured.
There could be no connection with a possible deal to move civil servants to
the development, the government added.
However, bankers to O&amp;Y, the property company which last week filed for
protection from its creditors in the US and Canada, said they could not make
a decision on whether to provide the money until they had assessed Canary
Wharf's long-term prospects, which will take another few days.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs in parliament that he saw
'no prospect' of his authorising construction 'until and unless' the O&amp;Y
contribution was assured. 'We are . . . looking to Olympia &amp; York to honour
that understanding before I can give London Underground approval to start
construction,' he added. The government had given Pounds 1.5bn towards the
10-mile extension, which was to have been finished by 1996.
Last night, Mr Steven Norris, junior transport minister, emphasised to MPs
that the funding of the Jubilee line was 'entirely separate' from any
decision about moving civil servants to Canary Wharf offices.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow local government minister, plans tomorrow to call
for two separate parliamentary inquiries into issues arising from the
affair.
He will call for the all-party public accounts committee to examine the
government's financial management in London Docklands, focusing on how much
public money has been spent there and on what it was spent. He will also
demand an independent parliamentary inquiry into more general aspects of the
government's urban regeneration policy.
Mr MacGregor's comments followed indications from the government that it
wanted an answer soon from creditor banks of Canary Wharf on whether they
would provide the Pounds 400m.
Bankers say they would be happy to discuss the issue with Mr MacGregor. But
they cannot tell him whether they will provide the funds until they have
received a detailed assessment of Canary Wharf's long-term commercial
prospects.
If the bankers then put Canary Wharf into receivership or liquidation, they
would not provide the Jubilee funds. If the project is kept as a going
concern - or even possibly if it is put into administration under UK
insolvency legislation - bankers might still provide the Pounds 400m.
According to ministers, London Regional Transport would be unable to
maintain beyond July the Pounds 1.5m a month project team now working on the
extension, without a definite go-ahead.
Meanwhile holders of Dollars 548m (Pounds 310m) in Eurobonds, whose security
is O&amp;Y's New York office building at 55 Water Street, are meeting O&amp;Y today
to discuss whether it has sufficient funds to refurbish the property. The
bondholders are concerned that without refurbishment their future interest
payments would be in doubt, as the building would be difficult to let.

FT  19 MAY 92 / BSkyB and BBC in Pounds 304m Premier League deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVE coverage of the matches of English football's new Premier League will
only be available on satellite television after a record joint bid by
British Sky Broadcasting and the BBC worth Pounds 304m over five years.
BSkyB won the deal yesterday at a meeting of the chairmen of the clubs in
the new league, which kicks off in August.
It won despite an increased five-year offer worth Pounds 165m which was
delivered to the meeting by Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association,
which is in the last year of a four-year Pounds 44m exclusive deal.
The new agreement applies only to the 22 clubs in the Premier League. The
old arrangement also benefited Football League clubs in lower divisions.
The BSkyB bid is a gamble that live Premier League football coverage will
not only encourage many more consumers to get satellite dishes but create a
potentially vast new stream of subscription revenue and, before long,
pay-per-view.
It is also a coup for Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, who
argued passionately yesterday for the satellite deal. Mr Sugar, who is also
chairman of Amstrad, the principal manufacturer of satellite dishes, did
declare his interest at the meeting.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, will have the right to show 60 live games a season on
Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings. This means in its first year the
Premier League will receive nearly Pounds 1m for each live game.
There are also plans to move to charging for each game watched, splitting
the additional proceeds 50-50 between BSkyB and the Premier League. The live
BSkyB matches could go on a subscription channel so that the pictures are
available only to satellite homes paying a monthly subscription.
The BBC will have the right to show the highlights of two games on Saturday
evenings and will bring back its old Match of the Day programme.
Each club will be guaranteed Pounds 1.5m a year. The exact amount will
depend on how many times each features in live coverage and on its league
position.
The deal will mean Pounds 40m going to the football league in the first
year, Pounds 42m in the second and Pounds 44m in the remaining three. In
addition, the satellite venture will pay Pounds 10m a year for sponsorship
rights and Pounds 8m a year for overseas broadcast rights. The BBC will pay
Pounds 4.5m a year for its more limited access.
The ITV bid was worth Pounds 30m in the first year, rising to Pounds 36m in
year five, excluding sponsorship and overseas rights.
'Taking live Premier League Football on to a pay satellite channel will mean
millions of viewers will never see a live Premier League game,' Mr Dyke said
yesterday.
Six clubs - Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Leeds and Aston
Villa - voted against the deal, fearing too many games would be transmitted
live and that fans could not watch without paying for satellite or cable
television.
The amount paid smaller Premier League clubs will increase dramatically. But
the difference may not be so marked for glamour sides which have
traditionally received most coverage.

FT  19 MAY 92 / German pay pact averts threat of more strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE threat of a long hot summer of strikes in Germany was lifting yesterday
as engineering workers across the country backed the last-ditch pay deal
agreed at midnight on Sunday.
Trade unions and employers agreed that the 21-month deal, providing in
effect a pay rise of 5.8 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in 1993, with
an hour's cut in the working week, would reduce the chances of prolonged
strikes in other industries.
But cautionary words on the engineers' deal came from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who said it would be 'economically difficult'. Mr Hans-Peter Stihl,
president of the German chamber of commerce and industry, said the award was
still excessive, and would hasten rationalisation and job cuts in the
industry.
Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest
industrial group, also criticised the settlement. He said Daimler would make
it clear to employees that the agreement would harm Germany's status as an
investment location.
Generally, however, the deal was greeted with relief for avoiding a damaging
and possibly prolonged strike, at a time when the German economy is poised
between recession and recovery.
However, hopes that the deal would prompt a rapid relaxation in the tough
monetary policy of the Bundesbank were firmly rejected last night by Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, who warned that the agreement
followed a pattern of excessive awards in recent months.
He noted that even if the present 4.6 per cent inflation rate were reduced
to between 3.5 and 4 per cent by the end of the year, it would still be too
high. Money supply was growing at an annual rate of 8 per cent, much faster
than the central bank's target of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent.
'Monetary policy cannot allow scope for passing on increased costs through
increased prices,' he told bankers in Frankfurt.
His words are likely to disappoint the financial community and the Frankfurt
stock ex-change, where the DAX index rose almost 2 per cent yesterday in
reaction to the pay settlement, and on hopes of lower interest rates.
The immediate effect of the deal, however, was to lift the cloud hanging
over the engineering industry, and raise hopes of similar deals in other
sectors.
An arbitration recommendation for the country's 1.5m building workers is due
to be announced today having been held back from Saturday, apparently to
await the outcome of the negotiations on the engineering workers' claim.
A similar recommendation will be made today for the printing industry. The
IG Medien union, representing print workers, is demanding an 11 per cent pay
rise, and is conducting token strikes in protest at a 3.3 per cent offer.
The textile workers' union GTB yesterday also called for token strikes among
its 160,000 members in support of a 9.5 per cent claim. Their employers have
made no offer.

FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bargain hunting helps
Nikkei recover in light trade

THE Nikkei average, which fell sharply last Friday on news that Olympia &amp;
York had filed for insolvency protection in North America, rebounded on the
more phlegmatic reaction on Wall Street, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index regained 368.83 to 18,443.10 on bargain hunting, and short-term
buying of speculative favourites, after opening at the day's low of
18,128.16 and reaching 18,458.05 in the afternoon. Volume, however, fell to
220m shares from 352m as most institutional investors remained on the
sidelines.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said leading investors are likely to
remain inactive during the corporate results season, which commences this
week and is expected to last until mid-June.
Advances led declines by 668 to 324, with 144 issues unchanged, while the
Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 21.92 to 1,370.74. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.66 to 1,095.75.
Short-term trading by dealers lifted speculative stocks. Japan Metals and
Chemicals, the most active issue of the day, moved ahead Y85 to Y810 on the
'environmental theme'. The company makes metallic alloys used in batteries.
Okamoto Industries added Y80 at Y1,520 as dealers tried to revive the
'biotechnology theme'. Mitsubishi Kakoki, which makes industrial waste water
treatment equipment, rose by its daily limit of Y100 to Y1,080.
Banks, which fell sharply last week on the O &amp; Y developments, were bought.
Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y50 to Y1,790 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y80
to Y1,330.
Real estate issues, which lost ground last Friday on fears about real estate
lending, failed to recover. Mitsui Fudosan, the leading real estate
developer which announced its first fall in pre-tax profits in 16 years,
dipped Y20 to Y1,040. Aoki lost Y23 to Y512 on reports of its links to the
stock and bribery scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, the parcel delivery
company.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 236.96 to 21,032.27 in volume of 11.8m
shares.
Roundup
INDIVIDUAL influences moved equities in the Pacific Rim region yesterday.
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok were closed for public holidays.
AUSTRALIA climbed steadily, and then lost much of its gain when Papua New
Guinea's foreign minister called for all mining agreements in the country to
be redrawn after the June national elections.
Mining and resource issues fell but industrials helped the All Ordinaries
index end 7.8 up at 1,668.5, off a day's high of 1,674.4. The All
Industrials index was 21.4 ahead at 2,615.2.
The PNG moves threaten CRA's position as major shareholder in Bougainville
Copper, but CRA closed steady at ADollars 14.24, off a low of ADollars
14.00. Other resource companies with interests in PNG tumbled, Placer
Pacific losing 15 cents to ADollars 2.53, MIM 4 cents to ADollars 2.68 and
Renison 20 cents to ADollars 4.80.
Turnover was light at ADollars 160.3m. Foster's and SA Brewing were heavily
traded after Friday's proposal of an ADollars 6bn merger, rising 9 cents to
ADollars 1.99 and falling 6 cents to ADollars 3.01 respectively.
NEW ZEALAND reported late foreign buying orders and closed at a six-month
high, the NZSE-40 index adding 8.96 at 1,539.45. Turnover shrank from
NZDollars 34.5m to NZDollars 24.7m.
Foreign buying was again focused on the forestry sector. Fletcher Challenge
moved forward 8 cents to NZDollars 3.71.
HONG KONG took the O &amp; Y filing as an excuse for profit-taking. The Hang
Seng index finished 67.41 down at 5,637.09 after recovering from an earlier
fall of nearly 100 points. Turnover contracted from HKDollars 3.6bn to
HKDollars 3.1bn.
Dealers noted that the index futures were trading at premiums of around 70
points to the cash index, indicating that underlying sentiment remains
optimistic. HSBC, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and estimated to
have around USDollars 700m in loan exposure to O &amp; Y - but not, HSBC
emphasised yesterday, specifically to the London docklands Canary Wharf
project - topped the most active list and declined 75 cents to HKDollars
43.50.
MANILA went into a downward technical correction and the composite index
fell 21.26 to 1,317.11. TAIWAN moved ahead in the last minutes on
speculation that the government plans to offer tax incentives to stock
investors. The weighted index climbed 81.56 to 4,437.63 in turnover up from
TDollars 15.18bn to TDollars 22.67bn, following a rise of 63.61 on Saturday.
BOMBAY overcame late profit-taking to end higher in volatile trading. The
BSE index rose to 3,527.21 initially before closing at 3,456.16, up 61.68.

News that Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, had filed for court
protection from its creditors stopped most stock markets in their tracks, if
only briefly, at the end of last week. Japan was the most affected, perhaps
because it reminded investors of what could happen to Tokyo's property
market.
The Nikkei average dropped 4 per cent on Friday, but earlier gains reduced
the loss on the week to 2.4 per cent, according to the FT-Actuaries World
Indices. This, together with a 1.4 per cent decline on Wall Street, left the
World index 1.5 per cent lower.
The week's best and worst performers were provided by smaller markets. Italy
fell 4.3 per cent to its lowest level since the start of the year, sinking
under the weight of rights issues by companies hoping to beat a
privatisation programme planned for the second half of the year. Fears ahead
of Fiat's 1991 results, which proved unjustified, also contributed to the
weakness.
The uncertain political situation in the wake of an inconclusive general
election is likely to delay a recovery in the stock market until later in
the year. But some analysts believe that the present conditions are ideal
for selective bargain hunting, especially in industrial stocks which are
likely to show an improvement in earnings in 1993.
Falling domestic interest rates and optimism about the forthcoming corporate
results season helped New Zealand to climb 4.2 per cent on the week, and
took the NZSE index to its best level so far this year.
The rest of the Pacific Rim was mixed, with Hong Kong notching up another
1.8 per cent rise for a 33.6 per cent advance since the start of 1992, while
Malaysia slipped 2.5 per cent as the market corrected after three weeks of
gains. However, activity is expected to pick up towards the end of the month
when Tenaga Nasional, the newly privatised electricity company, is due to be
listed.

FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent welcomes German pay
settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY settlement between metalworkers and employers in Germany put most of
Europe in a good mood yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had one of its remorselessly logical days, lifting bunds and
equities on news of the settlement, carmakers and engineers on the absence
of potentially crippling strike prospects, and most retailers on the extra
spending money that will result.
A rise of 7.96, or just over 1 per cent to 708.13 for the FAZ index at
midsession improved to 34.36, or 2 per cent at 1,758.43 for the DAX at the
close.
Turnover climbed from DM5.3bn to DM8.2bn. Traders and analysts welcomed the
settlement, indicating a 5.8 per cent pay rise for this year and one of 3.4
per cent, plus a working week cut equivalent to another 1.4 per cent for
1993.
Some dealers noted that much of yesterday's buying reflected
position-squaring following short sales last Friday. But Mr James Cornish,
County NatWest's strategist, felt there was more to go for.
Mr Cornish, who visited the Bundesbank at the end of last week, says that
another high M3 growth figure is imminent, but that the Bundesbank is not
likely not raise the Lombard rate in consequence, feeling that the figures
are being inflated by inputs which do not necessarily reflect inflation in
the German economy. So yesterday's drop in the Bundesbank's average bond
yield from 8.30 to 8.25 per cent looks soundly based.
Carmakers responded yesterday with gains of around 3 per cent, Daimler-Benz
rising DM21.30 to DM786.80, BMW up DM18 to DM579 and Volkswagen DM14.50
better at DM396; among engineers, MAN was outstanding with a rise of DM14.70
to DM383.50.
PARIS closed just off the day's highs, boosted by a firm bond market and
relief over the German situation. The CAC-40 index ended up 27.69 or 1.4 per
cent at 2,051.64 in moderate turnover of FFr2.7bn.
News late on Friday that the government planned to cut its stake in Total
from 34 per cent to 15 per cent and allow shareholders to swap their
certificates for voting shares at a parity of 4 certificates for 3 shares
prompted heavy arbitrage, which accounted for just under 10 per cent of the
day's volume. The shares dropped FFr11.80 or 4.5 per cent to FFr248.20 while
the certificates added FFr15.50 or 9.2 per cent to FFr184.40.
LVMH jumped FFr101 to FFr4,200 in 31,420 shares on good buying interest from
the UK. Eurotunnel added FFr1.15 or 3.1 per cent to FFr38.25 following
Friday's news that the government would allow it to carry heavy goods
vehicles in semi-open shuttle wagons as initially proposed. A re-design
would have cost Pounds 100m.
MILAN was boosted at the start of the new account by Fiat's 1991 results
which were announced after the close on Friday. However, optimism about
Fiat's turnround prospects was tempered by persistent political uncertainty
as the search for a president continued. The Comit index added 1.93 to
474.65 in turnover estimated at L90bn-L100bn after L117.8bn.
Fiat closed L125 higher at L4,935, catching up the gains made on London's
Seaq on Friday, but slipped L5 on the kerb. Ras, the insurer controlled by
Allianz of Germany, added L325 to L17,875 amid reports that it would use the
cash raised through its recent rights issue to buy into Banco Ambroveneto.
ZURICH saw limited domestic interest in equities, with the all-share SPI
index just 6.9 higher at 1,202.0, but foreign investors were inspired by the
German labour settlement and the Swiss government's nod toward European
Community membership. The SMI index closed 18.0 higher at 1,939.1.
Nestle bearers put on SFr140 to SFr10,100. Brokers put the gain down to
foreign buying, and a technical correction after Friday's losses.
AMSTERDAM closed higher, boosted by short-covering after Friday's expiry of
options and by demand for cyclical stocks. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.3
to 129.4.
Fokker rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 36.20 on reports that Aerospatiale, Germany's
Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia wanted to take control of the Dutch airline
manufacturer. Unilever remained under pressure after disappointing first
quarter earnings, losing 50 cents to Fl 186.80.
STOCKHOLM recovered from Friday's setback on expectations of encouraging
first quarter reports from Astra, Asea and Volvo, all due today. The
Affarsvarlden general index added 13.1 to 998.6 in turnover of SKr419m after
SKr393m. Volvo B rose SKr6 to SKr435, Asea B by SKr6 to SKr373 and Astra B
by SKr13 to SKr534.
MADRID eased in a technical correction, the general index losing 0.76 to
260.62 in an active Pta15.04bn.
Telefonica rose Pta10 to Pta1,105 on a 20 per cent gain in first quarter
profits. The power company, Endesa, expected to announce a new collaboration
pact in Europe, rose Pta40 to Pta3,650; but Viscofan, the food packaging
company which announced a 45 per cent drop in first quarter profits, fell
Pta210 or 8.5 per cent to Pta2,270.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Interest rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATES in the sterling cash markets fell slightly yesterday as
traders reacted optimistically to news that a potentially crippling
industrial dispute had been avoided in Germany.
The news that German metalworkers had clinched a 5.8 per cent wage deal with
employers came as a relief to traders who feared that a destructive strike
in Germany might lead to another rise in interest rates. Traders in the
sterling money market believe that the Bank of England will be unable to
engineer another interest rate cut if German short-term rates are raised any
further.
As a result, period rates in London ended slightly lower. 3-month money, a
key indicator of where the markets believe base rates are moving, ended the
day at 10 per cent, down from 10 1/16 per cent on Friday night. But 10 per
cent remained the rate right up to 6-month money, with the 9-month and
1-year periods ending at 9 15/16 per cent. That sloping yield curve suggests
that the market does not see a significant cut in base rates for some time.
The futures markets also reflected the news from Germany. September short
sterling ended the day six points higher, at 90.31, suggesting that base
rates four months from now will be at 9.69 per cent. Volumes for June short
sterling were also significantly higher than those for last week, and the
contract ended four ticks up on the day at 89.99.
The Bank of England's operations in the money market were extremely quiet.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 400m at the start of the day, but
little paper was offered during the day. The forecast was later revised to a
shortage of around Pounds 450m. The Bank did not operate in the market in
the morning and in the afternoon, and provided late assistance of around
Pounds 50m.
One trader suggested that the Bank may have been reluctant to buy paper,
perhaps signalling that it would not like to see rates fall in the wake of
the German pay settlement. That interpretation was scotched by many other
traders. 'There is any number of reasons why there would be a lack of paper
offered now,' said one. 'There is the usual reluctance to offer paper in the
wake of a base rate cut, and the simple fact that people don't borrow so
much money in a recession.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC ministers begin last push
towards farm reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE most radical overhaul of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy in its
30-year history hove into view yesterday, as farm ministers of the Twelve
convened here for marathon negotiations, and the European Commission began a
dogged defence of its reform proposals.
As the horse-trading began, it became clear that the Commission's challenge
was to prevent negotiation on detail from amounting to an assault on the
fundamentals of its plan.
The bargaining may last all week, and require an extra Council meeting
before the ministers are scheduled to reassemble on June 15-16 in Luxembourg
to finalise the reform. Agreement on CAP reform will also make conclusion of
the five and a half year-old Uruguay Round negotiations to liberalise world
trade less elusive, by demonstrating EC commitment to restrain subsidised
production of agriculture, the main obstacle in the international talks.
But doing a deal may well be at the cost of blunting the European
Commission's original reform proposals.
Such an outcome, while still amounting to the EC's biggest step towards
reining in overproduction, stabilising ballooning subsidies, and plugging
the widening holes in average farm incomes, will almost certainly require a
second round of negotiations later this decade.
After 18 months of hard negotiations, ministers have moved from unanimous
opposition to the Commission's plan to seeking an agreement based upon its
main precepts. Yesterday they started bilateral talks with the Commission
and the current Portuguese presidency of the EC to establish each country's
bottom line.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, says he is determined to
resist attempts to soften his proposed 35 per cent cut in cereal prices. The
Commission wants to reduce the subsidised price of around Ecu155 per tonne
to Ecu100 over three years. Last month, Mr MacSharry registered an
unprecedented, formal objection to the Portuguese presidency's suggestion of
an Ecu112 target, or 27 per cent cut - its fourth attempt to engineer a
compromise and slide the cuts downwards.
The commissioner argued that Ecu105 was the limit at which the EC could make
its cereals competitive, cease dumping its surpluses on world markets, and
bring internal markets into balance. 'The Commission is not prepared to
accept 112,' a senior Brussels official restated last week.
The cereals proposal is the linchpin of the reform. It foresees direct
payment to farmers in compensation for the price cuts, contingent on larger
farmers taking 15 per cent of their land out of production. Mr MacSharry has
warned that a looser target price of Ecu112 would require them to set aside
22 per cent of their land.
Expert opinion oscillates between those who foresee the final compromise
settling at around Ecu108 per tonne - an optimum outcome for the Commission
 -and those who see a further loosening to around Ecu115 or beyond, which
would be a victory for Germany.
The Germans, whose inefficient agricultural structure has dictated the high
subsidies of the CAP since its inception, want to settle as near as possible
to the 20 per cent domestic cuts required within the Uruguay Round. France,
however, the EC's largest and most competitive producer, fears that softer
price cuts will saddle its farms with quotas to restrain production, such as
the increased set-aside threatened by Mr MacSharry. The UK, Netherlands and
Denmark also favour deeper price cuts.
Brussels has some leverage in that farmers this year already face a further
6 per cent cut in cereals prices, on top of an extraordinary 5 per cent cut
last year which would be retained for 1992-93, making 11 per cent. This
results from the old 'stabiliser' system, a tax on overproduction, without
compensation, which has nevertheless failed to restrain output, depressing
incomes still more.
The Commission may agree to conflate some of next year's sharp, unrefunded
cuts into the package of reform cuts. If it fails to win sufficient cuts on
cereals, the higher than planned prices will rebound into the crisis-ridden
livestock sector, where the lower cost of cereal feed is supposed partially
to compensate also severe price reductions.
The Commission's tactical imperative is to prevent German and French
interests from converging too far away from its plan. The Portuguese
presidency's 'compromise number four doesn't get us very far', judged Mr
David Curry, the UK's deputy Agriculture Minister. 'He (MacSharry) is going
to have to do a lot of political juggling to get us there.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moscow to ease oil tax for
joint ventures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government said yesterday it planned to ease the oil export tax
burden for joint ventures.
'I would like to stress that for joint ventures we are introducing revisions
which will help them maintain the conditions on the basis of which many
agreements were signed,' Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the oil minister, told a news
conference.
A tax of Ecu26 a tonne (Dollars 5 a barrel) has been the subject of major
lobbying by western consultancies and oil companies which claim it is a
major obstacle to foreign investment in Russia's flagging oil production
sector.
Mr Lopukhin also suggested it was possible that new export tariffs which
were due to be introduced later this month could be lowered for other
exporters.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said the phased liberalisation
of internal oil prices, due to come into effect soon after May 21, could
lead to the removal of all controls on the price paid by domestic
enterprises in three months time.
But Mr Lopukhin admitted he could not say whether Russian oil producers
would use the opportunity to reinvest the profits which would result from
the higher prices. He said he was still in the process of preparing
anti-monopoly measures to make them more responsive to market pressures.
But defying more pessimistic expectations, he told a news conference he
expected exports to remain constant this year at last year's level of 60m
tonnes.
He also revealed that republics which already had a special bilateral treaty
with Russia, such as Belarus, would be paying about the same as Russian
enterprises for their oil. He could not say however what Ukraine, the second
richest republic, which has been at odds with Moscow for months over a host
of political and economic issues, would be charged as the price had yet to
be negotiated. But he confirmed that the Baltic republics would soon be
paying close to world prices for oil.
The government on Friday unveiled plans to abolish the fixed price of Rbs350
a tonne in favour of a range of Rbs1,800 to Rbs2,200.
This would be enforced through special taxes on enterprises which charged
more than Rbs1,800 but up to Rbs2,200 and by fines and administrative
sanctions for producers which charged more than Rbs2,200.
The new range corresponds to the present free market price within Russia but
is still about a third of international oil prices.
Mr Nechayev said the government would use the money made from the taxation
and fines to help certain enterprises and ordinary citizens weather the
impact of the price increases.
The resolution in which the plan was announced, however, says the proceeds
will be used mainly to rebuild the oil sector, leaving plenty of room for
confusion on the fund's final destination.
Mr Nechayev said, however, that he expected to make Rb160bn from the
punitive levies and Rbs300bn from extra VAT revenues.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Topsoil threat to world food
supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID loss of topsoil is threatening the world's long-term food supply and
raising the prospect of widespread starvation and hunger, according to Mr
Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, the US farm products
group, who has been long-time adviser to US presidents on farm policy.
He attacked fiercely the protectionism in international farm trade,
describing the agricultural sector as 'the biggest victim of the chaos in
today's world trading system'. He said world markets had been ruined by
predatory government policies that subsidise production and then dump goods
on the world's markets.
Referring to US threats to block Dollars 1bn of EC food exports in
retaliation for EC practices harming US oilseed exports, he warned that the
EC 'can expect more of that unless (they) can negotiate fair practices in
agricultural trade'.
Soil erosion has cost the world 480bn tons of topsoil since 1970, Mr Andreas
told executives attending the annual meeting in Oxford of the International
Agribusiness Management Association. That is more than the total of all US
cropland, he noted.
'Farmland in America's midwest breadbasket loses some 20m tons of topsoil
per acre every year,' he said: 'In Illinois, we're losing 1.5 bushels of
topsoil for every bushel of corn we produce.' Describing topsoil as 'our
basic raw material - to us, what iron ore is to the steel industry', he
warned that failure to act could turn the world into 'a famine-ridden dust
bowl of warring and hungry billions'.
Soil preservation policies were the foremost of five challenges facing the
global agribusiness companies, Mr Andreas said. The other main challenges
were to help the nations of eastern and central Europe to rebuild, to find
new uses for agricultural products, to ensure a fair multilateral trading
system, and to feed the world's hungry.
'Just to feed the world at today's nutritional standards means we will need
to build a new flour mill every eight days; a new crushing plant and
vegetable oil refinery every 30 days; and a new corn mill every 15 days,' Mr
Andreas said: 'World hunger is a ticking bomb waiting to go off.'

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan says aluminium still
flooding from CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S aluminium smelters are living a hand-to-mouth existence but are
still managing to produce a great deal of metal, according to Mr David
Morton, chairman of Alcan Aluminium of Canada.
He said it would therefore be 'imprudent' for western producers to assume
that the flood of aluminium exports from Russia would ease this year.
'The Russian smelters are terribly inefficient, in poor condition, short of
raw materials and are awful polluters,' said Mr Morton. But the Commonwealth
of Independent States' aluminium industry had 3.5m tonnes of installed
capacity and, in spite of all its tribulations, should be able to produce
2.5m to 3m tonnes this year.
CIS domestic demand had collapsed so it was prudent to expect that exports
to the west would be 800,000 to 1m tonnes compared with Alcan's estimate of
845,000 tonnes in 1991.
Mr Morton said an Alcan team recently returned from a fact-finding trip to
Russia and reported that, in contrast to the poor state of the aluminium
smelters, the hydro-electric plants supplying the smelters were
'impeccable'.
He suggested the western aluminium industry could offer Russia some
technical assistance - for which it could justify taking payment.
But it was not possible for Alcan to contemplate any large investment in the
CIS because of the absence of a legal framework or financial institutions,
taken for granted in the west.
Mr Morton, in London during a visit to institutional investors and banks in
Europe, pointed out that, apart from the extra metal from Russia, about 1m
tonnes of new capacity was coming on stream in the west in the next 18
months. So conditions in the aluminium industry 'are going to be miserable
for the next year or two'.
He said it was essential that more of the west's high-cost smelting capacity
was closed down. The highest-cost smelters were in Europe and it would take
some time for closures to occur because of social and other pressures.
However, at present aluminium prices, 50 to 60 per cent of smelters in the
west were not covering their full costs and this could not go on
indefinitely.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum exports run
wild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S PLATINUM export sales went spiralling out of control last year and
reached a record 1.1m troy ounces worth at least USDollars 363m, according
to Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group.
This was 380,000 ounces or one third up on the previous year when exports
were also extraordinarily high by recent standards.
In 1990 Russia already had begun to run out of gold to sell and turned to
other commodities in a desperate search for hard currencies to prop up its
ailing economy.
However, JM believes that Russia did not expect to have to sell so much
platinum last year. Much of the metal was supposed to be used only as
collateral for loans.
The Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs had 20 tonnes (643,000 ounces)
of platinum to lend to the market in a particular way - in swap deals which
involved the Bank selling metal to counterparts and promising to buy it back
at an agreed future date.
But towards the end of 1991 it became clear that the old Soviet Union would
split into its component republics and the Bank was orphaned. Western banks
and dealers withdrew its credit lines and the swaps were no longer rolled
forward when they expired.
The Bank had no alternative but to sell the platinum to meet its
obligations.
Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of JM's annual review of the platinum market, says
that all the metal allocated to the Bank had been disposed of by the end of
the first quarter this year and the Russians were now back in control of
their platinum exports.
The Russians recognise the damage they did in the market - last year the
extra supply helped drive the platinum price down from a peak of Dollars 424
an ounce to a low of Dollars 330 and the average London fixing price fell
from Dollars 472 in 1990 to Dollars 376. The Almaz organisation, now
controlled by the Russian Federation, has regained its monopoly of export
sales, Mr Coombes suggests.
He predicts that Russia's export sales this year will consequently fall back
to 1990 levels and be between 600,000 and 700,000 ounces.
The extra Russian metal helped to increase the surplus of platinum supply in
western markets to 120,000 ounces last year, according to the annual review,
up from a surplus of 30,000 ounces in 1990.
Both supply, at 4.16m ounces (up from 3.73m), and demand, 4.04m ounces (up
from 3.7m), reached record levels last year. Mr Keith Green, JM's operations
director, describes platinum demand as being 'incredibly recession-proof'
and facing good growth for the next five years.
Worries about the lack of economic growth in Japan, the biggest consumer of
platinum jewellery, had been dispelled in the first quarter when sales there
topped last year's record level.
Platinum demand in 1992, increasingly driven by its use in car
anti-pollution catalysts, should be even better than last year and absorb
surplus supplies, said Mr Green. This should enable the price to climb back
to Dollars 400 an ounce by the year-end.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee chief calls for action
to revive prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD coffee industry, hit by the lowest prices for more than 22 years,
has reached a turning point, according to Mr Alexandre Beltrao, executive
director of the International Coffee Organisation.
Calling for speedy action to revive the export quota mechanism which
collapsed in July 1989, Mr Beltrao told a coffee conference in Japan at the
weekend he was convinced that managed trade 'should no longer be seen as the
undesirable concept castigated by the deregulators of the 1980s'.
The value of world coffee trade has fallen from Dollars 12bn a year to
Dollars 7bn since the end of the export quota system. Retail sales of
coffee, including supplies to the catering trade now stand at about Dollars
40bn a year, he said.
Restoring the producers' share of the cake to Dollars 12bn would place no
additional burden on consumers. But if prices continued to fall, 'the good
years of surplus coffee for roasters and caterers sooner or later will come
to an end'.
World producers were taken aback by the rapidity of the market fall which
followed an indecisive ICO meeting early last month. On Monday April 13 the
second position robusta contract on London Fox fell from Dollars 864 a tonne
to Dollars 828 a tonne. The market touched a low of Dollars 676 a tonne on
May 8. Last night the second position contract closed at Dollars 735 a
tonne, up Dollars 1 on the day.
Next week producers will be arriving in London for talks at the ICO on the
format a new agreement should take. They appear increasingly determined to
take action to halt the slide in prices. Last week Costa Rica suspended
exports; over the weekend Colombia suspended the sale of its coffee on the
New York futures market; and Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers,
were last night holding high level talks.
Analysts in London agree that there might well be some movement in the
upcoming ICO talks. 'The economic pain is so great that everyone is going to
be forced to agree purely to boost market prices,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles
of GNI, the London futures brokers.
'There has been a sea change,' said Mr Neil Rosser of ED &amp; F. Man, the
London trade house. 'There is a serious crisis in the coffee world. No one
is making any money at these price levels.'

TIN prices eased from earlier 18-month peaks during afternoon LME trading,
but still closed higher. Dealers said three-month tin's run-up to a new high
of Dollars 6,265 a tonne largely reflected speculative buying as end-user
interest was fairly routine. Liquidation and profit-taking subsequently cut
into gains, but final business at Dollars 6,255 was still Dollars 62.50
above Friday's close. The immediate upside objective is Dollars 6,300, which
could be hit today if LME stocks fall as expected. Three-month ALUMINIUM
made another attempt in late trading to trigger stops lurking above Dollars
1,340, but finally closed at Dollars 1,338.50. The market was earlier
underpinned by Japanese buying, which unlocked some dealer covering with
consumers mostly willing to take a back seat. The London SUGAR markets
mainly dropped back sharply with New York, although trading went into a
temporary lull when New York trading was suspended because of technical
problems. New York dived on technical selling. 'I think people were
expecting the market to rally if they wanted to use the Thai situation as an
excuse,' one dealer said. 'But then the market went in the opposite
direction and everyone started bailing out.'

STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has reduced its rating on nearly
Dollars 2bn of Alcan Aluminium's long-term debt from A to A- but left
Alcan's US commercial paper unchanged.
S&amp;P cited Alcan's tightening cash flow due to persistently lower world
primary metal prices and market disruptions caused by Commonwealth of
Independent States exports.
Net financing needs rose in 1991 and despite cuts in capital spending and in
the cost base, Alcan's debt leverage may rise in 1992, S&amp;P said.
Aluminum Co of America's senior debt is rated as A, though S&amp;P said all its
ratings were under continuous review.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank hopes to expand London's
Ecu market role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England believes its plan to provide a new settlement system for
Ecu securities would 'bolster London's leading role' in the Ecu bond market.
In the latest Quarterly Bulletin, the Bank said the new securities
settlement system would provide institutional investors and dealers with
same-day settlement of Ecu securities.
Same-day settlement of Ecu bond trades is not currently available through
Euroclear or Cedel, the commercial clearing systems through which most Ecu
bonds are now handled.
The Bank said same-day settlement would make it easier for institutional
investors and dealers to undertake short-term borrowing and lending Ecu
securities - activity known as 'repo'.
It added that same-day settlement of Ecu securities would reduce the
'systemic' risks of trading Ecu bonds, again helping to foster the market in
London.
Repo of bonds allows investors to increase their returns from bond holdings
by lending securities. It also allows traders to cover short market
positions by borrowing bonds.
The Bank noted that repo market activity in London had expanded rapidly in
recent years. It said: 'This development has enhanced London dealers'
ability to make deep and competitive markets in a wide range of European
debt securities.'
The Bank is now talking to Ecu market participants about the need for an
improved settlement system but has not decided whether to press ahead with
the plan.
However, the report said: 'There is every sign that the cash and repo
markets are developing at a pace which would make such a system a valued
part of the Ecu market infrastructure.'
If the market is enthusiastic, Bank officials have said a same-day
settlement system could be in place by the end of next year.
The UK authorities are keen to capture an increasing share of Ecu bond
market activity in London.
The UK government's 10-year Ecu2.25bn bond issue, launched in February last
year, was widely seen as a move to attract business.
Earlier this year a programme of three-year to five-year Treasury notes was
started with the aim of improving market liquidity at the shorter
maturities.
Lending by Japanese banks fell to 28.5 per cent of total international
lending in London last year, down from 32.2 per cent in 1991, according to
the Bank of England.
However, the Bank noted the contraction was mainly due to a reduction in
lending between banks rather than to non-bank customers. In particular,
Japanese banks have reduced previous heavy reliance on certificates of
deposit.
In contrast, British banks' share of the market increased slightly to 15.6
per cent, the first increase since 1985.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Finland's DM1bn offering attracts
domestic investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Finland yesterday took advantage of the rally in D-Mark
bonds to launch a DM1bn, 10-year issue as attention swung back to European
currencies.
Most international investors have been significantly underweight in D-Marks,
given the inflationary wage demands from public sector, engineering and
other unions and the strong monetary growth of recent months. Also, yield
spreads had widened, offering better opportunities than in recent weeks.
News that the wage dispute with German engineering workers may have reached
a conclusion set the stage for Finland, a double-A credit, to come to the
market. Its deal was priced to yield 28 basis points over the benchmark 8
1/4 per cent Bund due 2001 (some 33 basis points over the 10-year fund
issue). Demand was said to have been heavy from domestic investors, with
three quarters of the issue being placed in Germany.
The bonds were bid later in the day at 99.45, just above the price at which
they had been issued.
Parallel with the rally in D-Marks yesterday was a renewed surge in the Ecu,
which has recently been the victim of sagging confidence in the convergence
process of currencies within the ERM. Alcatel Alsthom, the French
telecommunications and engineering group, took advantage of this to come to
the bond market with its first issue, a Ecu150m, five-year issue priced to
yield around 9.2 per cent.
The Ecu market, starved of interest from large institutions, has witnessed a
constant flow of retail-targeted deals recently. As a result some said the
Alcatel deal was likely to take some time to place in full.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Activity in management
buy-outs set to rise in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out (MBO) activity in the UK is set to increase, helped by
renewed confidence in the economy, last month's re-election of a
Conservative government and the more realistic prices at which managers can
now buy their own businesses.
Some leading UK banks say MBO-related lending started to pick up about six
months ago, and they expect activity to increase now that the general
election is out of the way.
According to 3i, the venture capital group, MBOs worth about Pounds 580m
took place in the first quarter of 1992, although the level of activity is
well below that seen in the 1980s. 3i reported 71 MBOs in 1989, but the
level fell to 44 in 1991 as recession and slow bank lending checked
activity.
However, the latest wave of MBOs differs in one important respect from the
wave of deals done in the late 1980s - they are less highly-geared, with
bankers now eager to limit the debt side of the deal to about 50 per cent of
the total value.
In the 1980s, debt repayments and servicing costs represented a huge outflow
of cash. But with debt-equity levels closer to 50-50, the servicing costs
are more manageable, says the Bank of Scotland. The equity portion in such
MBOs is usually provided by the management or venture capital funds.
Bankers report a stream of potential medium-sized MBOs in the pipeline at
present, following deals such as the Pounds 74m buy-out of the Herald
(formerly the Glasgow Herald), the Pounds 200m buy-out of the Bristow
Helicopter Group, and the Pounds 125m total funding for the buy-out of
Midland Newspapers.
In each of these cases, the debt portion represented 50 per cent or less of
the total value of the deal. However, interest margins are nearly double
their previous levels,reflecting the general rise in bank lending margins
over the last two or three years.
Bankers say that deals which would previously have paid margins of about
125-150 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) now tend
to command margins of between 212-225 basis points over Libor.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Barlow Rand rises to R400m at
half year
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARLOW RAND, South Africa's largest industrial group, overcame tough trading
conditions to record a 15 per cent increase in half-year earnings to R400m
(Dollars 140.8m) and pay a higher dividend.
Turnover rose by 9 per cent to R16.9bn in the six months to end-March 1992,
and operating profit, before interest, was 11 per cent higher at R1.36bn.
Pre-tax profit was 20 per cent up at R1.24bn.
Mr Warren Clewlow, executive chairman, said the group had performed well
while enjoying a 'following wind' from the sale of Middelburg Steel and
Alloys (MS&amp;A) last November for R1.1bn.
Mr Clewlow said the sale of MS&amp;A - a producer of ferrochrome and stainless
steel - had changed the nature of Barlow Rand by removing a cyclical
producer which had been a cause of much uncertainty.
He said it was this change that had been behind the group's decision to lift
its dividend by 6 per cent to 54 cents per share.
The effect of the MS&amp;A disposal is also evident in the strengthened balance
sheet where deposits and cash have risen to R1.4bn, from R849m a year ago,
while amounts due to bankers and short-term loans have dropped to R1.2bn
from R2.3bn.
Mr Clewlow was cautious about prospects. He said trading conditions were bad
and he would be happy if they were able to maintain their percentage growth
for the year as a whole. The group is continuing with a substantial capital
expenditure programme, with R680m spent during the reporting period and a
further R1.3bn of capital commitments.
Managing director Mr Derek Cooper told a news conference there was little
likelihood of a short-term recovery in the domestic economy, and the full
impact of the current drought in Africa would be felt in the current six
months of this year.

as investors digested the details which offers a lifeline to Mr John
Elliott, Foster's embattled former chairman.
The shares were also buoyed by a spate of rumours suggesting that every
important international brewer from Guinness to Anheuser Busch was building
a stake in Foster's in the event that deal collapses.
SA Brewing shares fell six cents to ADollars 3.01, a reaction which suggests
that the market believes the deal offers more to Mr Elliott and SA Brewing
management than to shareholders.
The merger plan would transform SA Brewing from a medium-sized drinks and
manufacturing group capitalised at ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.1bn) to the
controlling partner in a merged group valued at more than ADollars 5.9bn.
Its chief attraction is that it would virtually end Mr Elliott's involvement
with Foster's, which has turned into a nightmare since a mishandled buy-out
left International Brewing Holdings (IBH), Mr Elliott's private company,
with unmanageable debts.
After two years of deal making, IBH has cut its shareholding in Foster's
from 56 per cent to 38 per cent, and Mr Elliott has stepped down from
executive chairman to deputy chief executive. However, IBH faces liquidation
in November unless it finds a way to repay debts of ADollars 2.5bn secured
against Foster's shares worth only ADollars 1.6bn.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, says that the merger offer is
the only way to remove the IBH problem from Foster's, and give the group
time to reap the full benefit of its investments in Courage in the UK and
half of Molson Breweries in Canada.
Mr Wilson insists that the merger is a friendly offer which would be
achieved with the consent of directors and shareholders of both companies.
The mechanism would be a non-cash exchange of shareholdings for shares in
the merged group.
From Foster's headquarters in Melbourne, the offer looks like a replay of Mr
Elliott's 1984 takeover of CUB, especially since it is a condition of the
offer that Mr Wilson would be chief executive, and SA Brewing would name the
chairman.
There is no doubt that Mr Elliott would be a significant winner if the deal
goes through. The chief feature is the underwritten sale by IBH of about 6
per cent of its entitlement in the merged group.
Most of the balance of its Foster's shareholding would be swapped for
convertible notes exchangeable for shares in between two and 10 years,
leaving IBH with an initial shareholding in the new company of 7.5 per cent.
IBH's creditors would have to agree to accept the company's convertible
notes and shares as security against its debt, effectively giving Mr Elliott
an immediate cash injection to pay overdue interest bills, and a two-year
breathing space on the remaining debt.
The advantages for other shareholders are less clear-cut. Based on last
night's closing prices, shares in the merged group would open at ADollars
2.99, valuing Foster's shares at ADollars 1.99, equivalent to the market
valuation. SA Brewing shares would be exchanged at ADollars 2.99, compared
with ADollars 3.19 when the offer was announced on Friday.
The incentive being offered to both sets of shareholders is that the
reduction of IBH's role would trigger a re-rating of the shares. SA Brewing
says the merged group would trade at ADollars 3.92, capitalising it at about
ADollars 7.8bn, and valuing Foster's shares at ADollars 2.61 - sufficient
for IBH to repay its main creditors. On that basis, SA Brewing shares would
be worth ADollars 3.92.
However, the offer must overcome several hurdles. The most difficult will be
obtaining the approval of the board of Foster's, which is understood to have
rejected a similar proposal in March.
Mr Nobby Clark, chairman, opposes the merger plan, as does Mr Ted Kunkel,
the former chief executive of Molson Breweries, who took over as chief
executive of Foster's only two weeks ago.
Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns 20 per cent of Foster's, is also
believed to oppose any deal which would dilute its shareholding.
Foster's argues that the merger would destroy the group's
shareholder-approved strategy of selling non-core financial, pastoral, and
property assets to become a pure brewing company.
The group has found the asset disposal programme difficult, and has been
unable to sell non-core assets worth about ADollars 2.8bn because of an
18-month recession. Directors believe, however, that the assets can be sold
at fair prices as the economy recovers.
They say there is no synergy between Foster's core operations and SA
Brewing, which derives only 30 per cent of profits from food and drinks,
much of which is contributed by its wine division.
The balance comes from packaging and manufacturing domestic appliances.
The merger proposal will also be investigated by the Trade Practices
Commission, which is concerned about further concentration of brewing in a
market which is about 90 per cent controlled by Foster's and National
Brewing, owned by Lion Nathan of New Zealand.
The outcome will depend on SA Brewing's success in convincing shareholders
and IBH creditors that the offer would give Foster's time to recover from
the IBH debacle, and avoid a fire sale of its non-core assets.
If Mr Wilson succeeds, SA Brewing will emerge in control of a company three
times its size.
If he fails, the banks will have to decide whether to give IBH a further
lease of life, or put it into liquidation, with unpredictable consequences.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUI Fudosan, Japan's leading real estate company, revealed that
non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year ended March declined for the
first time in 16 years.
The real estate slump has hurt the company severely, and its pre-tax profits
fell 19.4 per cent to Y46.2bn (Dollars 354m). However, overall revenue rose
19.4 per cent to Y881.2bn.
After-tax profit edged down 1.1 per cent to Y29bn. Mitsui blamed the poor
earnings on increased construction costs and heavier interest burdens.
Interest payments surged 22 per cent due to growing debts.
A sharp increase in advertising in a bid to counteract the sluggish property
market conditions also hit the company. Mitsui also faces a new tax burden
of Y7bn, due to the introduction of the new land holding tax in January.
For the current year, Mitsui forecasts a 13.5 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y40bn on revenue of Y900bn.
Fujita Corp, a leading Tokyo redeveloper, reported gains of 20 per cent in
pre-tax profits to Y43.5bn and 5.2 per cent in net profits to Y17.1bn for
the year to end-March, writes Neil Weinberg. Sales advanced 10.2 per cent to
Y820.4bn.
Fujita noted a rise in public works related orders in contrast to a sharp
drop in housing activity and weakness in the construction industry.
Fujita projects sales will rise 10 per cent to Y900bn in the year to March
1993. Pre-tax profits are seen dipping to Y43.5bn while net profits are
expected to rise 8 per cent to Y17.5bn.

MITSUBISHI Kasei, Japan's leading chemical maker, unveiled a 53.4 per cent
plunge in pre-tax profit to Y13.3bn (Dollars 102m) and a 5.6 per cent drop
in sales to Y727.2bn for the year to March 1992.
Net profit also fell sharply, by 71.2 per cent to Y5.3bn.
The weak performance was the result of falling demand for petrochemicals and
coke in the car, electric machinery, steel and other industries as the
domestic economy slowed.
Sales of coke fell on weak domestic and overseas demand and the phasing out
of the fuel by steelmakers as they introduce more sophisticated furnaces,
Mitsubishi Kasei added.
Demand for carbon black used with rubber remained steady, but synthetic
rubber sales fell, while turnover of ammonia products increased.
Overall, petrochemical sales were down 9.5 per cent to Y271.6bn and carbon
products 7.9 per cent to Y203bn. The company's export sales slipped 0.5 per
cent to Y89.4bn, accounting for 12.2 per cent of the total.
Mitsubishi Kasei reduced cash and savings deposits 23 per cent to Y71.6bn,
while short-term borrowings shot up from Y190m to Y6.6bn. The value of its
securities portfolio declined 8 per cent to Y98.9bn.
Mitsubishi Kasei expects sales to decline marginally for the year to March
1993 to Y770bn. Although pre-tax profits are seen gaining 5.4 per cent to
Y14bn, net profits are forecast to fall 62 per cent to Y7bn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Realty and Development, the Japanese real estate developer,
yesterday reported a steep decline in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for
the fiscal year ended March.
The fall was due to sharp increases in interest payments and appraisal
losses on its securities holdings.
Pre-tax profits plunged 30.6 per cent to Y25.2bn (Dollars 193.5m), despite a
19.3 per cent increase in sales to Y223.2bn and a 24.7 per cent rise in
operating profits to Y66bn. After-tax profits fell 0.4 per cent to Y19.6bn.
Sumitomo's non-operating deficit grew 2.5 times to Y40.8bn due to a 25.2 per
cent fall in interest and dividends received and a 20.5 per cent increase in
interest payments to Y41.2bn. The company booked Y11.4bn in latent losses on
its securities holdings.
Short-term borrowings grew by 13.3 per cent to Y410bn while long-term
borrowings surged by 3.1 times to Y47.4bn. Sumitomo plans to procure fresh
funds of more than Y100bn through bank borrowings and corporate bond issues.
For the year to March 1993, the company expects pre-tax profits to decline
18.8 per cent to Y20.5bn on a 7.5 per cent rise in sales to Y240bn.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro launches workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems aims to fend off mounting competition in the market for
computer workstations with a new range of products, to be introduced today.
The US computer company claims the new products will outperform all rivals.
Although Sun has maintained its lead in workstation sales, with over 25 per
cent of the Dollars 9bn world market, competitors including Hewlett-Packard
and International Business Machines have been gaining ground with
workstations that are significantly faster than Sun's products.
The new SparcStation 10 represents Sun's response to these higher
performance workstations. Two models, which Sun calls 'mid-range'
workstations, priced in the US at Dollars 18,500 to Dollars 25,000, will be
available in the third quarter of this year.
These will offer performance of 86m to 96m instructions a second and,
according to standard benchmarks, are comparable to similarly priced
workstations from H-P and IBM.
Later this year Sun will begin shipments of two high-end multiprocessor
models which outperform any workstations currently available, offering
processing speeds of 200m to over 400m instructions a second.
However, its competitors are not standing still, and Sun's claim that it can
offer 'the world's fastest desktop workstation' is expected to be
short-lived.
Competition among workstation manufacturers is intense. It is one of the few
segments of the computer market that has continued to grow strongly in spite
of economic recessions in leading markets.
The new Sun workstations will also provide users with a new way to merge
computer and telecommunications networks into a single system.

<TEXT>
TWO large US retailers - K mart, the discount store chain, and Federated
Department Stores, which operates 220 stores nationwide - yesterday reported
modestly encouraging first-quarter figures, providing further evidence of
brisker trading on Main Street.
K mart said that after-tax profits had risen 8.3 per cent to Dollars 116m in
the three months to April 29, although earnings per share slid from 27 cents
to 26 cents. Total sales increased by 8.1 per cent to Dollars 8.27bn.
On a 'same-store' basis, K mart said there had been a 2.8 per cent increase,
when November's acquisition of OfficeMax is excluded. Its speciality chains,
which range from Waldenbooks to the Pace wholesale clubs, saw sales on a
same-store basis rise by 7.9 per cent.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said the 'colder-than-normal weather' had held
back sales in the home improvements, gardening and clothing lines. However,
he was encouraged by sales of 'big ticket' items - suggesting some progress
in the economy - and by the speciality stores generally.
Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores, which clambered out of bankruptcy
earlier this year, posted an after-tax profit of Dollars 11.8m in the three
months to May 2, compared with a Dollars 64.2m loss a year earlier. This is
the first year since 1987 in which the group turned a profit in the first
quarter.
Total sales from stores such as Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and Bon
Marche, were slightly lower at Dollars 1.57bn against Dollars 1.59bn, but
same-store sales rose 4.4 per cent.
Federated acknowledged that promotions had helped first-quarter sales and
warned that it expected comparable store sales to be lower, year-on-year, in
the second quarter.
However, the group also predicted a 'significant comparable store sales
improvement' for the full year.
In the speciality store sector, Toys 'R' Us, the New Jersey-based toy
retailer, saw after-tax profits improve from Dollars 22.4m to Dollars 28.3m.
Sales were up from Dollars 1.02bn to Dollars 1.17bn.
Its toy outlets in the US reported a 4.7 per cent increase in same-store
sales.
Overseas, sales growth was strong in Europe, but Canada suffered from
depressed economic conditions.
The Kids 'R' Us clothing operation was also affected by 'the difficult
apparel sales environment'.

BARNETT Banks, in an effort to bolster its leading market position in
Florida, plans to merge with First Florida Banks in a stock transaction
valued at about Dollars 885m, Bloomberg reports.
In the merger of Florida's two oldest banks, First Florida shareholders will
receive 1.42 Barnett common shares for each First Florida share.
Barnett Banks, the 19th largest bank in the US with Dollars 32.9bn in
assets, operates 550 offices in Florida and 42 offices in neighbouring
Georgia.
First Florida, based in Tampa, has about Dollars 5.4bn in assets and
operates 144 banking offices along Florida's west coast and throughout the
central part of the state.
First Florida recently initiated steps to improve its balance sheet. Last
October, it took a charge of about Dollars 116m to cover loan losses and to
write down bad real estate loans.

<TEXT>
POWER Corp of Canada, the holding company of Montreal financier Mr Paul
Desmarais, plans to invest in a 'special situation' in North America by the
year-end but still has not found a potential acquisition that meets its
criteria.
Mr Desmarais said Power Corp and its financial services arm had between
CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3bn available. The company sold two subsidiaries
in 1989 and has almost no debt.
Also, Power Corp and the Frere Group of Belgium have 63 per cent voting
control of the European holding company, Pargesa. It owns one of North
America's biggest life insurance companies and Canada's biggest mutual fund
distributor.
Power Corp earned CDollars 39.2m (USDollars 32.9m), or 30 cents a share, in
the first quarter, up from Dollars 31.2m, or 23 cents a year earlier, on
consolidated revenues of Dollars 1.52bn, against Dollars 1.56bn.
After Power Corp's annual meeting, Mr Desmarais said he would take a
minority position in a healthy North American company needing new capital
'as long as we can participate in management and can attain our target 15
per cent return on equity'.
A large takeover was currently difficult because of the high level of the US
stock market, he said, but Power Corp was concentrating on North America
because Pargesa's growth can be self-financing.
Mr Desmarais said he preferred manufacturing, communications and financial
services as target sectors.
A USDollars 422m takeover of International Corona of Vancouver by Homestake
Mining has been delayed without explanation.
The US mining giant offered 0.35 of a Homestake share for each Corona share.
The merger would create a mining group with annual output of 1.8m ounces of
gold a year.

operation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NKK, the Japanese steel company, yesterday announced a new long-term
management plan that re-emphasised the importance of its core steel-making
business, and conceded that new business areas would contribute less to
profits than previously forecast.
The company also said it had agreed to a 50-50 joint venture with Bethlehem
Steel of the US to produce treated sheets for the US construction industry.
The joint venture, formed through a US subsidiary of NKK, National Steel
Corp (NSC), is expected to have capital of around Dollars 16m and to employ
85 workers.
Japanese steel producers have been concerned by a US industry plan to pursue
an anti-dumping action against Japanese and other foreign companies, and it
is hoped in Tokyo that the Bethlehem deal will ease tension between the two
industries.
In 1988 NKK announced a long-term plan for the year 2000. At the time of the
announcement, Japanese steelmakers were drafting restructurings designed to
reduce their reliance on steel products and increase new business
activities.
These plans had been prompted by a sharp decline in national steel
production, from 105m tonnes in 1985 to 98m tonnes in 1986. Demand then grew
sharply in tandem with the rapid expansion of the Japanese economy in the
late 1980s.
In the original plan, NKK expected new businesses would account for 25 per
cent of annual sales by the year 2000, but that figure has been revised
downward to 16 per cent.
Engineering business is expected to account for 31 per cent of sales, up
from the forecast 25 per cent; steel is expected to account for 53 per cent,
up from 50 per cent.
Steel companies had predicted that urban development projects would be a
prime source of income, but NKK has halved its expected earnings in that
sector by the year 2000 to Y100bn (Dollars 746.2m).
Companies were planning to develop old factory sites and under-utilised
land, but property development is no longer seen as a promising area of
growth with the plunge in land prices.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Using family ties to take on IBM
 -Alan Cane on the developing relationship between Fujitsu and ICL, one of
its global network of associates, as they battle flagging profitability and
market changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collaboration between Fujitsu and its global 'family' of associate companies
is intensifying as Japan's leading computer manufacturer seeks to revive
profitability and stalk International Business Machines (IBM) for leadership
of the worldwide computer business.
The list of projects includes a development with ICL which could lead to the
UK company challenging IBM's mainframe superiority; research into computers
which recognise handwriting with the US-based company Poquet; and
developments in computer communications with Amdahl, the US-based large
computer supplier.
Fujitsu, like other Japanese mainframe computer-makers, has seen a steep
decline in profitability this year as Japanese banks and securities houses,
traditionally heavy spenders on large computer systems, cut back on orders
and information technology investment.
Mr Toshio Hiraguri, managing director of Fujitsu Ltd., which has
responsibility for all Fujitsu's computer families, said the Japanese market
was also being affected by the structural changes which were western
computer manufacturers. Customers, he said, were moving to common standards
and smaller, less expensive computers, a phenomenon known as 'down-sizing'.
Mr Hiraguri said Fujitsu was keen to increase the share of revenues coming
from software and services compared with hardware.
It is determined to develop software products which can be used on Fujitsu
computers and those of its competitors. An example was 'Graphicwriting
particular kinds of programs easier, and which was developed jointly by
Fujitsu's artificial intelligence centre in Kawasaki and an ICL group in
Dublin.
Technological links between Fujitsu and ICL, which began in the early 1980s,
are now being cemented by exchange of research staff between London and
Tokyo, and frequent video conferences. Mr Hiraguri confirmed that ICL
engineers were helping Fujitsu to design fibre optic communications systems
to be incorporated into the company's large mainframe computers, which
operate in the same way as IBM's large systems.
He said, however, that the system could also be incorporated into ICL's
mainframes - which are not compatible with IBM's - making it possible for
them to act as the heart of an IBM data processing system. Such a
development would give ICL new credibility among companies which use IBM
hardware exclusively.
Business links between the two companies have also been strengthened through
a reorganisation this year which placed parts of Fujitsu's operations in the
US and Europe under ICL's control. In the US, for example, where both ICL
and Fujitsu market systems for the retail trade, a single company under ICL
management has been formed.
Not all Fujitsu's overseas investments have proved instantly successful.
Poquet developed a pocket-sized computer compatible with IBM's personal
computer, but manufacturing and technical glitches meant weak sales. An
improved version, which can recognise handwritten characters, is expected to
do better.

<TEXT>
CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday group, is joining forces with Carnival
Cruise Lines, the US travel company, to launch a new cruise holiday concept
in Europe and Asia.
The two groups have signed a letter of understanding for their joint
venture, but have yet to finalise the details of the deal, according to Mr
Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Carnival.
Club Med and Carnival initially plan to launch a cruise holiday package
combining Carnival's expertise at running cruise ships with Club Med's
experience with holiday villages. The package, which will be launched in the
Mediterranean in summer next year, will be targeted at European clients.
When the venture is established, the two companies will consider launching a
mass-market cruise package for the Asian market. Although the concept of
cruise holidays is already well-established in Europe and Asia, it is not as
popular as in Carnival's home territory, the US.
For Club Med, one of Europe's largest holiday groups, the link with Carnival
is the latest in a number of joint ventures intended to diversify its
interests. Last autumn it joined forces with LTU, the German charter
airlines, to launch an upmarket holiday village business aimed at the German
market.
Club Med is still licking its wounds after a sharp swing into a loss of
FFr17m (Dollars 3.04m) from net profits of FFr395m in its last full
financial year to October 30.
Although the whole international travel industry was disrupted by the Gulf
war last year, Club Med was badly hit because of its concentration in the
south and eastern Mediterranean in Greece, Turkey, Israel and Morocco. It
was also vulnerable because it had expanded its airline interests the
previous year by taking control of Air Liberte and Minerve in France.

CIMENTS Francais, the French cement producer, said yesterday it was offering

Ciments Francais has already said it plans to delist Rezola once it gains
full control. The Basque producer will probably be absorbed into Ciments
Francais' larger Spanish affiliate, Financiera y Minera, one of Spain's
biggest cement producers.
The Ciments Francais offer comes just a few days after Corporacion Banesto,
the industrial arm of the Banesto banking group, offered a premium of 32 per
cent to buy out and delist Sanson, another cement producer from northern
Spain.
Analysts say the moves reflect further consolidation in the Spanish cement
sector.

FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann profits fall further
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the German engineering, motor components and steel tubes group,
suffered a further fall in profits in the first quarter of 1992, mainly as a
result of high start-up costs for its mobile telephone operation.
It gave no profit figure for the period, which saw turnover rise by 25 per
cent to DM6.1bn (Dollars 3.7bn) and new orders by 36 per cent to DM8.1bn.
Foreign business, including exports and sales by subsidiaries abroad, was 18
per cent up at DM3.3bn.
The company said profits in its machinery and industrial plant divisions
were also burdened by the weakness of the economy and increasing pressure on
prices for standard products. The steel tube business was stable, however.
The Brazilian subsidiary showed an improvement after last year's losses,
while motor components - including VDO and Boge for the first time -
performed more favourably.
Last year, the group's net profits fell 43 per cent to DM263m. Mr Werner
Dieter, the chief executive, has said he is 'not pessimistic' about this
year, despite the shaky start. Mannesmann's new D2 cellular telephones
business is due to start this summer.

Following the elimination of exceptional charges, Tullow Oil cut its loss to
IPounds 54,000, or Pounds 49,000, in 1991.
The year included IPounds 106,000 exceptional credits, being profit on part

During the year the main production income continued to come from the
Senegal gas project.
Turnover came to IPounds 928,000 (IPounds 912,000) and the operating deficit
to IPounds 201,000 (IPounds 58,000). Losses per share were 0.04p (1.34p).

<TEXT>
International Resort Holdings, the loss-making property and leisure group
which owns Collingtree Golf course, has gone into receivership leaving debts
of Pounds 14m.
Mr Peter Mills of receivers Smith &amp; Williamson said the company was
'significantly insolvent', with liabilities far exceeding assets. At the end
of March 1991, IRH had assets of about Pounds 16m.
Mr Mills said an unofficial valuation earlier this year, commissioned with a
view to a rescue rights issue, had shown that the company's asset value had
fallen too far to allow a cash call. IRH was suspended at 33p last month
following the findings.
Bankers Gamelstaden - which holds a 15 per cent stake in IRH - and Bank of
Scotland called in the receivers on Friday afternoon.
Mr Mills said he was in talks on the sale of Collingtree, in Northampton.
The golf course and property development is valued at Pounds 9m in the
company's books, but Mr Mills said it was now worth 'significantly less than
that'.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Baris near Pounds 1m loss after provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced profitability and heavy provisions against contracts in Spain and
the UK have pushed Baris Holdings, the fire protection and dry lining
specialist, into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 948,000 for the year ended
February 1992.
That represented a Pounds 3.18m downturn on the Pounds 2.23m pre-tax profit
of the previous year.
Accordingly, the directors are not recommending a final dividend, leaving
the 2p interim as the year's total (6.6p). Losses per share were 13.3p
(earnings 20.2p).
Mr Robert Smith, chairman, said the company suffered from recession in the
UK construction market and the dispute on the Vila Olimpica project in
Barcelona, and had made exceptional provisions of Pounds 1.8m for contracts.
Also, the company entered a borrowing position with net interest charges of
Pounds 149,000, against income of Pounds 119,000, as it experienced a
lengthening period of debtor collection.
Mr Smith said the second half performance was creditable in that turnover
was Pounds 12m (out of a total of Pounds 23.2m) and generated an operating
profit of Pounds 618,000.

IN A VOLATILE trading environment, London &amp; Overseas Freighters, the UK
tanker company, raised pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Dollars 2.04m to
Dollars 2.67m (Pounds 1.5m) in the year to March 31 1992. Net freights and
hire income climbed 11 per cent to Dollars 11.65m.
With earnings per share at 11.9p (8.4p), the dividend has been raised from
1p to a recommended 1.25p. Cash flow remained strong at Dollars 5.91m and
debt was reduced by 33 per cent from Dollars 15m to Dollars 10m.
Market values of each of the company's tankers fell by 20 per cent from
Dollars 24.5m to Dollars 19.25m over the year.
The directors said that this year both the 'London Spirit' and 'London
Victory' would carry out their biennial repairs with a consequent loss of
earnings. This, together with increasing costs and borrowings associated
with the newbuilding vessel, would put pressure on operating margins over
the next year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI AND SAATCHI, the advertising group, has announced details of plans
to consolidate existing ordinary shares in order to make the company a more
attractive stock in the US.
Under the proposal, which will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary
general meeting, following the annual meeting on June 10, every 10 ordinary
shares of 10p will be consolidated into one new ordinary share of 25p.
At the same time every 10 American depositary receipts, each representing
three 10p ordinary shares, will be exchanged for one new ADR representing
three ordinary shares worth 25p each.
The company gives as its reasons for the move the need to increase its
attractiveness to US investors and to improve company administration.
Saatchi group currently has more than 1.5bn shares in issue.
Saatchi has also issued its 1991 annual report, which reveals that five
directors - Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Mr Maurice Saatchi, Mr Charles Saatchi,
Mr Charles Scott and Mr Jeremy Sinclair - have agreed to waive Pounds 1m of
salary entitlements for the current year ending in December.
The Saatchi brothers are each waiving Pounds 312,500, the same as in 1991.
The report also shows six institutional holders of three per cent or more of
the ordinary share capital of the company, led by the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, with 7.97 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: ACT rises 34% and makes Pounds 5m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES AND profits last year at ACT, the Birmingham-based computing services
company, continued to display the vigorous growth the company has been
experiencing since it disposed of Apricot, its hardware arm, to Mitsubishi
of Japan two years ago.
Yesterday it reported sales for the year to March 31 up 21 per cent at
Pounds 119.4m (Pounds 98.8m) while pre-tax profits rose 34 per cent to
Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.7m). The results were at the top end of analysts'
expectations. The shares rose 4p to 192p.
ACT also announced the acquisition of Medical Computer Services, which
specialises in systems for private health care, for Pounds 5.02m, satisfied
by the issue of 2.7m shares and the payment of about Pounds 42,000 in
settlement of MCS share options.
Settlement in shares was at the request of the MCS owners. ACT has net cash
balances of Pounds 24.3m for acquisitions.
Mr Roger Foster, ACT founder and chairman, said each of the six divisions
made money in the year. However profits slipped at Logsys, a systems
integrator specialising in public sector contracts, which made Pounds
630,000 on sales of Pounds 27.5m and Computer Support, with Pounds 5.1m on
Pounds 26.8m.
In contrast, the financial services division, boosted by the acquisition of
Quotient and the Irish Kindle Group during the year, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 7.5m on sales of Pounds 44m.
Mr Foster claimed the company's portfolio of products and market sectors was
now wide enough to protect it against downturns in specific sectors.
He emphasised the importance of software products, which were stable and
cash generative and in which the group had investments totalling more than
Pounds 50m.
Earnings per share were 10.83p (9.5p) and a final dividend of 3p is
recommended for a total of 4.5p, an increase of 20 per cent on the 3.75p
paid last time.
COMMENT
Even if the contributions from acquisitions is stripped away, ACT's
performance in a year which many computer companies thought the worst ever
is remarkable and the company's credibility is strengthening rapidly.
Analysts are pencilling in profits before tax of about Pounds 23m for the
present year and Pounds 27m next. With a prospective p/e of about 15 the
stock seems neither overpriced nor particularly risky.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Thornton Inv seeks Pounds 100m for new
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORNTON Investment Management is seeking to raise Pounds 100m via an
international placing for a new investment trust which will invest in
European smaller companies.
Other investment trust launches are also expected, despite the widespread
opinion that such new issues might be halted following a series of ambitious
flotations at the end of the 1991-92 tax year, which were aimed at taking
advantage of tax loopholes.
Thornton's trust will be called European Smaller Companies and will be
distributed by Thornton in the UK, by Banque Nationale De Paris in France,
and Dresdner Bank in Germany. These companies will also share the fund
management, which will be devolved to the three countries.
It will qualify as a UK investment trust, and will be incorporated in
England. The trust will also be listed on the Paris and Frankfurt stock
exchanges.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew will sponsor the issue. Stock will be distributed in
Pounds 5 units consisting of five ordinary shares and one warrant, and
investors will also be allowed to subscribe in German or French currency at
a 'comparable' price.
Mr Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister who is chairman of Thornton and
the new trust, said the issue in the UK and Germany will be aimed equally at
the wholesale and retail markets, while the French marketing will be set
primarily at institutions.
He said the fund would aim to take advantage of the establishment of the EC
single market and the reconstruction of Eastern Europe. It will be jointly
managed by Thornton, Dresdner and BNP. Each company will be remunerated
equally, regardless of the share of the fund they manage - according to Mr
Walker this will remove any incentives to distort the fund's asset
allocation.
The company had opted for a closed-end structure because this would allow
the fund managers more freedom. An open-ended structure might have obliged
the managers to sell stock in the event of heavy redemptions, Mr Walker
stated.
According to the provisional timetable the offer for subscription will open
on June 15 and close on July 7, with dealings commencing on July 14.

bakery buy
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEN who turned round a German supermarket business before being given
the helm at a faltering British food retailing chain, are now keen to
develop a continental-type bakery in a bolt-on acquisition and expect
shortly to hire a Danish master baker.
Budgens has bought family-managed Gilsons The Bakers for about Pounds 1m and
is assuming banking liabilities of about Pounds 500,000.
This is not the first bakery operation with which Budgens' Mr John von
Spreckelsen, Mr Christian Williams, and Mr Graham Rigby - respectively chief
executive, director and finance director - have been involved. Before the
Budgens call, they revived the fortunes of Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based
chain of supermarkets, which included a bakery business. Mr Williams will
become Gilsons' chairman.
Founded soon after the turn of the century, Gilsons is based near Heathrow.
Its customers already include 15 of Budgens' 96 stores, as well as other
supermarkets, catering companies and Gilsons' two retail outlets.
Currently about 40 per cent of its Pounds 3.4m turnover is to the catering
trade, and when the acquisition is complete, it will supply some 30 Budgens
stores. In 1991, operating profits were about Pounds 350,000.
Gilsons' traditional British baking will be maintained, but one of Denmark's
20,000 qualified master bakers will be employed to spice up and add to the
operation, especially the pastries side.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter advances to Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JARVIS PORTER, the label printing specialist, said there was evidence of a
more consistent pattern of orders emerging from its customers as it reported
a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.7m.
But the company, which supplies labels for such products as Scotch whisky
bottles, toiletries and pharmaceutical packages, said it was not expecting
any 'sudden increase in demand'.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive who joined Jarvis Porter after
engineering a spectacular period of growth at David S Smith, the paper
group, said the results were 'better than he expected'.
The company's shares closed 10p higher at 136p as a result of the confident
statement.
In the year to February 29, sales rose from Pounds 27.87m to Pounds 28.4m.
Sales were boosted by Pounds 3.8m and operating profits by Pounds 400,000 as
a result of the inclusion of the recently-acquired Glasgow-based Holmes
McDougall label business.
The acquisition, which was completed in June, was said to have 'bedded down
extremely well'. Jarvis Porter spent a further Pounds 2.9m investing in
upgrading its technology.
However, the company recorded a sharp drop in earnings from 8.6p to 6.8p
after making a Pounds 500,000 provision against anticipated rationalisation
costs. Jarvis intends to cut its production facilities from three to two
sites.
A final dividend of 3p was recommended lifting the yearly pay-out to 4.4p
(4.2p).

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: John Wood surges to Pounds 16.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WOOD Group, the privately-owned Aberdeen-based company, increased its
pre-tax by 78 per cent, from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 16.9m, in 1991.
The group is one of Britain's leading providers of oilfield services. It
lifted sales by 44 per cent to Pounds 173.8m (Pounds 120.8m).
Mr Ian Wood, chairman, said that much of the larger turnover resulted from a
greater volume of offshore servicing activities in the North Sea, where the
group now operated on the basis of long term contracts with the major oil
companies.
However, margins on those 'partnering' arrangements were lower than in the
days before long-term contracts became common.
The group was also strengthening its non-oil activities especially in the
field of gas turbine maintenance, where it had joint ventures with a number
of gas turbine manufacturers.
Mr Wood said the North Sea was entering a challenging phase as oil companies
faced a squeeze on their profits because of the reduction in oil prices,
while at the same time carrying out big refurbishment programmes to extend
the life of their installations.
Some exploration and new field developments plans were being delayed.
In January, Wood placed Pounds 8.3m worth of convertible preference shares
with 13 institutions, most of them Scottish.
That doubled the proportion of the group owned by institutions to 18 per
cent, and reduced the stake of the Wood family to 73 per cent.
Mr Wood said yesterday that the group would not be interested in a public
flotation for about four years.
However, he did not rule out the possibility of obtaining a stock exchange
listing through the acquisition of a quoted company.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Standard Fireworks to be sold in Pounds 27m
management buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Heritable Trust (SHT), which is under pressure from its bankers
over its debts and commercial property portfolio, has sold its Standard
Fireworks subsidiary in a management buy-out costing Pounds 27m.
The deal, if approved, will reduce SHT's gearing to below 200 per cent from
270 per cent last December.
Huddersfield-based Standard is Britain's last fireworks manufacturer and
Europe's biggest, competing mainly against Chinese imports. It made profits
of Pounds 2.7m on Pounds 18.7m sales last year, but SHT said yesterday it
was 'a seasonal business in spades'.
It has negative cash flow of Pounds 1.25m a month for much of the year, but
an explosion of profit every November 5, when Britain celebrates the failure
of Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605.
In between, there are sales to events like fetes and carnivals, but these
make little impact on the whole.
Even the structure of the buy-out reflected the 'once-a-year' nature of the
business. SHT is getting about Pounds 15.2m of value ' Pounds 12m for the
business and Pounds 3.2m repayment of intercompany debts ' but the
purchasers have had to find another Pounds 12m for working capital to
survive until the main November pay day.
SHT bought Standard from Yorkshire's Greenhalgh family in 1986, and then
absorbed Brock, a principal competitor, soon afterwards. Mr Stuart
Macdonald, SHT's finance director, said the sale to the management
represented a profit of at least Pounds 10m on the costs of the original
purchases, and Pounds 3.5m in terms of net asset values.
SHT brought in the management team, headed by Mr Mel Barker, in 1988. As
pressures on SHT built, Mr Barker seized his chance, armed with Pounds 7.3m
of equity and mezzanine loan capital from 3i and Prudential Venture
Managers, and Pounds 19m of senior debt and banking facilities from the Bank
of Scotland.
Armed with independence, Mr Barker plans an export drive, as well as
consolidation of a growing UK market that seems to have been
recession-proof. Standard has also established itself as a pacesetter for
official standards in a highly regulated industry. This is helping to keep
sub-standard imports out.
Mr Macdonald said SHT's borrowings would now fall by nearly Pounds 12m to
Pounds 29m, based on last December's year-end figures, when Standard's net
assets were worth Pounds 8.4m. SHT's turnover would fall by 25 per cent but
it would not have to cope with summer debts of the fireworks business. SHT
shareholders' funds should rise to Pounds 18.8m.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Land write-downs put Prowting Pounds 17.7m
in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROWTING yesterday became the latest UK housebuilder to announce large
provisions against its land holdings due to sharply falling property values.
Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said that after a write-down of more than
Pounds 22m the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.68m in the 12
months to the end of February.
This compared with a profit of Pounds 7.55m in the previous 12 months and
was struck on turnover down from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 36.4m. After all
deductions losses per share came out at 18.8p compared with earnings of 6.9p
in 1990-91.
Despite the setback the final dividend is being maintained at 3.3p making a
same again total of 5p.
Mr Roydon said that the company had decided to keep faith with shareholders
on the grounds that: the write - down in land values was a 'one-off' and was
unlikely to be repeated; there were signs that the housing market was
starting to pick up and the group's financial position remained relatively
strong.
He said that dividend payments were 80 per cent covered by earnings before
taking account the large write-down on landholdings.
The average cost in Prowting's books of the 5,400 plots it owns with
planning permission had fallen from Pounds 17,200 to just Pounds 13,000 as a
result of the exceptional provisions. About 2,000 plots were acquired before
1986 at very low prices, said Mr Roydon, which would command a good margin
of profit as the housing market recovered and sites were developed.
The company builds in the west Midlands and southern England, 'everywhere
south of Birmingham.' It has been badly affected by the recession which has
hit hardest in the south of the country. Last year the group sold 273 homes
compared with 296 previously and a peak of 704 in 1988-89.
Average prices of the group's homes have tumbled during this period from
Pounds 141,000 in 1988-89 to Pounds 103,000 last year.
Mr Roydon said the housing market remained very difficult but there were
signs that sales were beginning to pick up.
'During the first four months of this year we have sold about 10 per cent
more homes than during the corresponding period last year. Sales halted
during the general election period but have picked up again since. The
south-west of England market has seen the best improvement as far as our
business is concerned.'
COMMENT
The provisions announced yesterday by Prowting are much higher than the
group needed to make. Even at current prices they leave room for a 25 per
cent gross margin. The company's land bank is sufficient for more than a
dozen years' production, even assuming the group achieves its sales target
of 400 homes this year and still allows for some land sales to help reduce
gearing from its current level of 59 per cent to about 40 per cent by the
end of this year. A Pounds 6.5m tax rebate due in December will assist debt
reduction. The company's long land bank, at cheap prices, makes it a classic
housing recovery stock. The questions investors must ask themselves are:
will the current upturn be sustained or will it peter-out like it did last
summer; and how much of the recovery potential is already reflected in
Prowting's share price? A prospective p/e in the early 30s on pre-tax
profits this year of Pounds 5m suggests that the current price is rich
enough at least until the first question is resolved more clearly.

FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Severance costs leave Mining &amp; Allied lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining &amp; Allied Supplies, the power transmission group, suffered a setback
in its first half but is looking for the year's profit to be in line with
the Pounds 281,000 achieved in 1990-91.
In the six months ended March 31 1992 pre-tax profit slumped from Pounds
161,000 to Pounds 12,000, after absorbing a loss of Pounds 129,000 in
Westwood Dawes. That included substantial severance costs as the workforce
had been cut by 57 per cent since last September.
During the last two months Westwood's order intake showed signs of recovery,
but break-even was expected for the year, said Mr Daniel Slabbert, the
chairman. Its future viability was being re-assesed as it constituted less
than 7.5 per cent of group sales.
Group turnover slipped to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 10.4m). Earnings per share
came to 0.04p (0.38p).
In Canada the group is to strengthen its capital base by merging its
subsidiary with Heenan Senlac Resources, and the resultant undertaking will
be listed in Toronto. With the initial share consideration and a placing to
follow, the UK company will control 74.9 per cent of the capital.
The Canadian business can then expand without having to rely on the parent
company for additional requirements.

FT  19 MAY 92 / DASA leads joint bid for Fokker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace (DASA), Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy are
negotiating to acquire joint control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft
manufacturer, in a move which could lead to a radical realignment of the
hard-pressed European regional and commuter airline industry.
The German, French and Italian companies are already partners in the
Regioliner regional aircraft consortium formed last year in which DASA, the
aerospace arm of the Daimler-Benz car group, owns 50 per cent with the other
two partners holding 25 per cent each.
Aerospatiale yesterday confirmed this partnership was now seeking to acquire
51 per cent of Fokker with DASA taking 26 per cent and Aerospatiale and
Alenia each taking 12.5 per cent of the Dutch aircraft group, which has a
current total market capitalisation of Fl 1.24bn (Pounds 375.9m).
DASA, which already co-operates on the Fokker 100 twin-engine jet, has been
holding talks with the Dutch company since March. Alenia already owns a 6
per cent stake in Fokker through its parent, the Italian state-controlled
Finmeccanica group.
Apart from taking a controlling stake in Fokker, the partners are also
proposing to set up a joint marketing company to promote all their various
commuter and regional aircraft products.
The negotiations led by DASA are understood to be difficult because it is
unclear whether the possibility of foreign ownership of Fokker would be
acceptable in the Netherlands. The Dutch government, which owns 32 per cent
of Fokker, is expected to play a crucial role in any deal.
The outcome of the talks is also uncertain because of possible complications
from the European Commission, which recently blocked an attempt by
Aerospatiale and Alenia to acquire de Havilland of Canada from the US Boeing
company.
Any deal would also have significant implications for British Aerospace,
which is seeking to rationalise its loss-making regional aircraft
activities. BAe has said a restructuring of the regional airliner sector was
necessary because there were too many manufacturers in a market depressed by
the financial problems of smaller airlines.
A French aerospace industry official yesterday did not rule out the
possibility that BAe might eventually also consider joining the new European
regional airliner partnership if the current negotiations are successful.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Whitbread profits fall 24% at year-end as bad debts bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD's pre-tax profits tumbled 24 per cent to Pounds 222.1m last year
as the brewing and retail group was exposed to the full blast of the
recession in south-east England.
More than half the fall in profits - the first since 1976 - was accounted
for by a Pounds 37m exceptional charge against bad and doubtful debts among
the group's free-trade loans.
Trading profit during the year to February 29 was 7 per cent lower at Pounds
227.7m on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 2.19bn.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 32.6m includes the disposal of the
European Pizza Hut operations.
Earnings per share fell 24 per cent to 35.78p. A final dividend of 12.4p,
against 12p a year earlier, lifts the full-year payment 4 per cent to
16.95p.
Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said yesterday trading performance had
been stronger than the results indicated. There had been no recovery yet in
restaurants and hotels but managed pub business was ahead.
'I am very optimistic about our prospects when consumer confidence returns,'
Mr Jarvis added.
Whitbread's beer division slightly increased its share of the total beer
market to 13.2 per cent. Operating profits rose 2 per cent to Pounds 67.6m
on turnover 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 889.4m. Sales of Boddingtons bitter
have doubled since the group acquired the brand in 1989 and Murphy's Irish
stout achieved retail sales of Pounds 70m in its second year of national
distribution.
Reorganisation of the tenanted pub estate, including the sale of 500 pubs,
led to a 3 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 63.9m on turnover of Pounds
241.3m, 12 per cent lower.
Almost 1,500 tenanted pubs have been converted to 20-year tied leases with
average rent increases of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.
Profits from managed retail operations fell 8 per cent to Pounds 119.9m on
turnover that increased from Pounds 1.24bn to Pounds 1.38bn. Whitbread Inns
maintained liquor sales, in spite of a 7 per cent drop in market volumes,
and food sales rose 11 per cent.
Beefeater profits rose 18 per cent and Pizza Hut maintained leadership of
the pizza market with a 33 per cent share. TGI Friday sales grew 24 per
cent. Travel Inn achieved occupancy rates of more than 80 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Plastow joins Inchcape as chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID PLASTOW is to become chairman of Inchcape, the motor and business
services group, after his retirement from Vickers, the engineering group
that includes Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
Sir David has just reached 60 and retires as chairman and chief executive of
Vickers at the end of this month. He begins in September at Inchcape, an
international distributor of cars, consumer goods and business machines and
a provider of services such as insurance and shipping.
He is leaving Vickers at a difficult time. The company made a pre-tax loss
last year, the dividend was cut and many jobs were shed. It also remains
unclear whether Rolls-Royce will be kept, after it survived Sir Ron
Brierley's attempt to demerge it two years ago.
However, Sir David's decision to retire at 60 was taken in 1983 and his
successors - Sir Colin Chandler as chief executive and Sir Richard Lloyd as
non-executive chairman - were named more than a year ago.
The chairmanship of Inchcape is the latest and most important of a series of
board appointments Sir David has lined up over the past year. He is already
joint deputy chairman of Guinness, the drinks group and his new positions
include one in banking - deputy chairman of TSB Group - and a directorship
at Cable and Wireless, the telecoms group.
Sir David will work two days a week at Inchcape's head office in St James's,
London. His role will include overseeing the board and communicating with
shareholders. He said: 'I see no clear definition between being executive or
non-executive chairman.'

   TRIPOLI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR TINY Rowland, chief executive of Lonrho, yesterday had a two-hour meeting
with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi in the Libyan leader's heavily fortified
offices in central Tripoli.
Last night Mr Rowland was still talking to government officials in Tripoli
about what are believed to be 'substantial misunderstandings' between Libya
and the UK-based conglomerate.
Lonrho sold a one-third stake in its Metropole Hotels to Libya for Pounds
177m in March, but yesterday denied that it planned to sell its African
interests, including gold and platinum mining operations, to Libya. The
denial was issued in response to a Sunday newspaper article, which Lonrho
said was based on claims by an individual with whom Lonrho was in legal
dispute.
Last night Mr Rowland, accompanied by Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho
East Africa, was meeting a Libyan minister and representatives from the
Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, the Libyan government's investment
agency.
The US administration is investigating Lonrho's dealings with Libya, after
secret visits by Mr Rowland to Col Gadaffi. Lonrho has denied that the
investigation might lead to the company being blacklisted in the US.
Lonrho has been keen to reduce gearing by disposals. Earlier this month it
sold George Outram, publisher of The Herald and Evening Times in Glasgow,
for Pounds 70m.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Roll up] Roll up] for the curate's egg: A distinct feeling
of nervousness is evident among the shoppers inspecting British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the UK government's privatisation programme were a rummage sale, British
Coal would be that box of curios on the white elephant stall that nobody is
quite sure if they want to buy.
Oil, gas and electricity have been snapped up by consumers, and the proceeds
spent. But British Coal sits there, shrinking by the month as pit after pit
closes, waiting to see how the stallholder will get rid of it.
British Coal, the state-owned coal company nationalised in 1947, is due to
be sold off next year, almost definitely to trade purchasers. The company is
already a shadow of its former self. In 1947 it owned 1,400 pits, today it
has 49, a number that is still falling.
Although it is smaller, it is more profitable. Ever since the government
restructured the company in March 1990, it has cut costs dramatically, and
last year earned its first profit - Pounds 80m - for 13 years. This year
profits will be up again.
But in spite of this, British Coal's peculiar nature could mean it is left
on the government shelf. It is peculiar in world terms because it sells most
of its 91m tonnes of coal output to the UK electricity industry, on
long-term contracts. Because electricity was privatised last year, the
future of these contracts is uncertain. And, in spite of British Coal's
powerful presence in the UK, it mines coal that would be considered
uneconomic outside Europe.
That is not to say that companies have not expressed interest in British
Coal. For instance, Mr Richard Budge, chairman of the private coal company
Budge Mining and of the Federation of UK Coal Producers, is prepared to buy
the whole thing.
Budge may be small, but it is robust, with a turnover of Pounds 100m and a
profit so healthy Mr Budge is reluctant to let his customers know what it
is.
He is also reluctant to put a price tag on British Coal.
'It is very difficult to value - it could be completely worthless. It
doesn't make any money, and the coal will be vested in the state. The value
is really the right to work the coal reserves.'
Rival predator Mr Crispian Hotson, chairman of private UK coal company Ryan
Group, goes further. By selling its coal at world market prices British Coal
could generate revenues of more than Pounds 1bn, he says.
But, however keen UK private coal companies such as Budge, Ryan and Young
Group, another strong contender, may be, it is by no means clear they could
all afford to buy.
Ryan has been highly geared since a difficult management buy-out in 1989 -
an interest charge of Pounds 20m wiped out its profit last year. It has just
restructured its finances to be able to bid for British Coal, securing
Pounds 50m in equity and Pounds 65m in debt from a City consortium.
Meanwhile, Young Group last month arranged a refinancing package led by Sir
Ron Brierly's BIL Securities which brought it back from the verge of
collapse.
Whether richer international companies will want to bid for British Coal is
an open question.
Companies such as RTZ, Shell and Anglo-United, acknowledge they might be
interested in the right package. But the fact remains that most UK coal is
uncompetitive on the world market.
'The UK is one of the world's disaster areas in terms of capital cost
compared with other investments you can make,' the coal director of one
company said. Whereas a mine in Australia could produce 50 tonnes per
manshift, British Coal mines were lucky to manage 12 tonnes.
'Even the 12 mines identified by NM Rothschild (the merchant bank advising
the government on privatisation) as profitable are only competitive if you
deliver coal to a nearby station,' he added. 'And once you get into the
other mines you are into really bad geology.'
The heart of the problem, the companies say, is that British Coal is a
curate's egg. Bits are good, bits are bad, and bits are downright inedible.
'Say you get five mines, and have to shut four down to get one that
survives, that's a deterrent,' one company said.
What most of the companies seem to agree on is that they could run pits more
cheaply than British Coal.
Mr Budge says he could cut 20 per cent of costs, and the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers (UDM), which hopes to stage a management buy-out of all or part
of the company, is understood to have a similar figure.
But the critical question facing potential buyers is whether the contracts
British Coal is due to sign with the electricity industry can be transferred
to successor companies. Mr Malcolm Edwards, formerly commercial director of
British Coal, says: 'The company is only interesting if you can transfer the
order books at the price signed in the new contracts.' The price, he
explains, will include a premium the electricity industry has always paid
for British Coal.
There is no reason to believe that premium will be transferable, he
believes. Without it, interest in British Coal will evaporate.
But one coal industry executive dismisses this as 'utter rubbish'. 'The
reserves, and the position of UK coal in Europe makes it strategically
important. Coal is so important in Europe, that anyone in coal must take
Europe seriously,' he says.
For instance, British Coal could make a profit exporting into Germany if the
country stopped protecting its market with subsidies, he points out.
Meanwhile, US companies with UK connections such as Peabody might, if
permitted, simply want a foot in the UK door while, Mr Edwards suggests,
South African companies could see it as a way of buying respectability.
But there is a distinct feeling of nervousness among the shoppers inspecting
British Coal. One sign of that is widespread reports that they are
considering forming risk-sharing consortia which could buy up groups of
assets and split them later.
There is also anticipation, as the companies wait for the government to
decide how it will divide British Coal.
Young, Budge and Ryan work as contractors for British Coal opencast or
surface mining business and would like a slice of this appetising part of
British Coal which makes around Pounds 150m a year, compared with British
Coal's Pounds 80m.
But it is not clear whether this will be sold off separately, or mixed with
less profitable deep mines. Nor is it known how the deep mines will be
split, although the likelihood is a rough north/south division.
But who will get the valuable British Coal ivory, and who will land the
elephant's foot waste paper basket, remains to be seen.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Bottlenecks avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTYN THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your business air travel survey (May 11) omitted an important and
topical issue. With the completion of the single market in Europe, there
will be a growing need for point-to-point air travel, avoiding the
bottlenecks of big airports. The UK has more than 350 licensed aerodromes
from which private flights can be made, and France has some 1,000 (most of
which are managed by the local Chambers of Commerce, which recognise the
business importance of having an airport). A direct flight from the UK in a
light aircraft is a convenient alternative for business journeys.
In the US, it is said that more business passenger miles are flown in light
aircraft than on scheduled services, which takes much of the pressure off
big airports.
This pattern is likely to develop in the European single market, with
important consequences for airspace policy. If the UK persists in the folly
of maintaining national customs and border controls after they are abandoned
by other European countries in 1993, it shall damage its competitive
position in Europe and miss an opportunity to reduce air and ground
congestion.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Employment training review must heed providers'
views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN ROE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its comprehensive review of employment training ('Employment training
faces review as criticism mounts', May 11), the Department of Employment
ought to consult and take on board the view of training providers.
In any event, it should: have the courage to stop using training schemes in
part to disguise the unemployment figures. The participants are unemployed
and they know it;
recognise that in employment training there have been real and substantial
cuts in funding, an unrealistic and penalising re-contracting process,
significant changes in paperwork administration and accountable bodies to
name but some. Providers have been asked, as always, to do more with less
and to deliver yesterday; release Training and Enterprise Councils from
their bureaucratic and financial straitjacket - and develop three- to
five-year flexible contracts so that the Tecs may do similarly with
providers;
admit that London Tecs are generally under-funded;
ensure that Tecs have, or have access to, the resources to provide quality
training and employment opportunities to those most disadvantaged in the
community. If not, then provide appropriate funding through other accessible
mechanisms.
The evidence that the 'disadvantaged' are, with the right resources,
achievers is overwhelming.
The Department of Employment should also:
recognise the role of the voluntary sector as provider of the above;
clarify, simplify and rationalise the benefit entitlement to all those who
are unemployed, on income support etc, irrespective of the training scheme
they join or its funding body.
remember it is easy to say that, in the final analysis, something has not
worked when its critics have been responsible for the progressive withdrawal
of its 'mother milk' before the availability of replacement solids. Ian Roe,

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reapportioning subsidy from owner occupiers to tenants is not the only
way to widen choice in the housing market ('More housing choice needed', May
13).
Government could help prospective tenants select from a glut of vacant
properties by establishing a computerised 'clearing house'. This would
maximise choice by liaising with existing letting agents and estate agents.
Government would endorse the rental alternative, which has a bad name in
Britain, without compromising free market principles or robbing loyal
supporters.
In the longer term, institutional investors may be attracted to fund a
private rental resurgence without additional tax subsidy; they would have
evidence of the volume and location of rental demand and the net yields
achievable.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON RANDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I congratulate you on your thought-provoking leader, 'More housing
choice needed'. Now is the time for a comprehensive review of housing policy
and finance. In particular we need further to expand opportunities in the
private rented sector and to encourage more private investment and greater
involvement of major employers and financial institutions.
We also need to look at ways of improving and extending opportunities for
shared ownership and equity sharing. Rents to mortgages is just one of a
number of potential schemes. Home owners should be able to move in and out
of part ownership as their circumstances dictate. This would certainly be
preferable to the present level of repossessions and homelessness arising
from mortgage arrears. The LBA has urged the government to encourage
mortgage lenders to develop a more positive role in this field.
Increasing the opportunities for housing mobility is another area of
concern. Each year thousands of local authority and housing association
tenants are helped to move to other areas, mainly for social and employment
reasons, through Homes (Housing Organisations Mobility and Exchange
Services), which was established in 1990 and is always seeking ways to
enhance the level of service.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEVILLE LEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader of May 13 was a timely contribution to an increasingly
lively debate.
Are subsidies either necessary or even desirable? The housing market is
distorted, damaged and limited by subsidies. Why do we forget that
unsubsidised personal share ownership, personal savings invested in pension
schemes, unit trusts or life assurance provide the capital to the whole of
British industry as well as financing major investments overseas?
A fraction of this investment would provide the funds necessary to provide
good quality rented housing, and the opportunity for home ownership for all
people.
However, neither the private investor or the fund manager will invest in a
game which is not played on a level field or where the referee belongs to
the other side.
The costs of mortgage tax relief, subsidised council house sales, local
authority rents set below market value, and soft loans to housing
associations probably add up to some Pounds 10bn annually.
If these subsidies could be removed from the market and paid directly to
those in need through the housing benefit or income support mechanisms,
house prices would fall to affordable levels. Private and institutional
funds would find new houses to rent a worthwhile investment as in every

FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Public sector stimulus and elimination of private
sector distortions would help meet need for affordable houses (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SHEILA MCKECHNIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('More housing choice needed', May 13) is a timely reminder
that the government's commitment to increasing home ownership through
schemes such as rents-to-mortgages does not necessarily translate into
greater housing choice for the individual.
High house prices have ruled out the possibility of home ownership for many.
Renting is their only option and, while the private sector has a role to
play in providing more homes, many people simply cannot afford to pay market
rents.
You suggest tax incentives for landlords as one way to boost supply.
However, these could lead to insecurity for tenants while encouraging rising
house prices and so excluding more people from home ownership. There are
more efficient ways of financing social housing that produce better value
for money for the tax payer and more security for the tenant. These would
involve changes in the public sector borrowing requirement rules in the way
suggested by your columnist, John Willman. The government's antipathy to
local authority management of rented housing could be met by introducing
arm's length agencies or through further housing association growth.
The ever growing demand for affordable homes can only be met by a greater
level of public investment in housing. Shelter has identified a need for an
additional 100,000 affordable homes annually over the next five years. This
could in part be done by redistributing Miras. This avenue has been ignored
by politicians of the two main parties in the belief that it is akin to
electoral suicide. However, Shelter commissioned an opinion poll before the
election which showed that 71 per cent of the population were in favour of
the redistribution.
The housing industry is not short of ideas on how to deal with the housing
crisis. What is lacking is the political will.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Appropriate safeguards and reforms for pensions (3)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From I M AITKEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised to read your editorial 'Reform of the pension funds',
suggesting that the balance of advantage must to some degree shift from
final salary schemes to money purchase arrangements. You seem to suggest the
move, prima facie, to avoid the problems of surplus while, at the same time,
acknowledging that it would impose extra investment risk on the member. This
seems convoluted logic.
The pension provided by a money purchase scheme depends on the investment
returns achieved during the contribution period up to retirement and the
investment conditions prevailing at retirement. The employee is unable to
plan his retirement as he is unable to quantify his pension.
On the other hand, many employers are aware of these shortcomings and
consequently the vast majority of the larger pension schemes in the UK have
been established on the footing of a pension based on final salary. Such
schemes are able to assume that the employee will retire with a pension
which is a function of salary at or near to retirement for each year of
service. Fluctuations in investment conditions do not concern the employee -
he is assured of his pension. The employer is prepared, if necessary, to pay
an additional 'risk premium' to provide the investment safeguard and, in the
good years, he accepts a 'bonus' by way of a reduction in his contributions.
Final salary pension schemes have stood the test of time well and it would
be a shame if they were now abandoned on account of the current esoteric
talk regarding surplus.

<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Norma Cohen's article 'Reforms that err on the safe
side' (May 9) on the recent National Association of Pension Funds
conference, I believe that much stronger safeguards should be placed on
pension funds, about whose performance it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to obtain information.
There should be a further safeguard which parliament should consider -
disclosure. The best way to see what is going on in a fund is to require
public annual reports of performance which break down investments by sector
 -gilts, equities, property etc. Then we can all see what is being done with
our money, and pick the fund of our choice.

   From Mr DAVID A RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a personnel manager and pension fund trustee, I noted with interest
your leader headed 'Reform of the pension funds' (May 11). Increasingly, I
think that schemes such as ours represent the silent majority of
well-managed and well-funded occupational final salary schemes.
Ours is a relatively small scheme which has never found itself in the
position of having to argue the ownership of surplus. In spite of this, we
have successfully coped with the effect of the Barber judgment and the
changes resulting from the Social Security Act 1990.
We have had no problems in recruiting the new members essential for the
long-term stability of the scheme. Where others fail, one can only point the
finger at poor communication on the part of the corporate provider and
misleading and optimistic misinformation of the private sector.
All the pension scheme trustees within Tunnel Refineries are also employees,
potential beneficiaries of the scheme and capable of influencing the
sponsoring employer. The recommendations of the recent Commons select
committee report hold no fears for our scheme.
The judgment as to whether a scheme should be final salary or money purchase
is one which must be made with reference to the age and service profile of
the workforce if it is to be a benefit. administrative convenience or
otherwise has limited, or no bearing. What is appropriate for a software
house is not appropriate for a factory with a mature and ageing population.
Changes are necessary within the occupational pension scheme sector and I
would welcome changes which increase the confidence of pension scheme
members in the security of those arrangements which will see them well into
old age. In spite of Maxwell and legislation, there are many schemes
valiantly preserving final salary arrangements.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Competition and interests of investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R A MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In privatising the public utilities, the government aimed to introduce
a competitive element into these monopoly industries and raise cash from
investors. Now that the main utilities are in the private sector, one cannot
help but feel that the aim of increasing competition has assumed a greater
degree of importance than the interests of the investor.
This is most striking in the case of British Gas, where Ofgas and the Office
of Fair Trading have a role in regulation and development of competition, by
whatever means.
Surely the system of gas pricing could be conducted in a less aggressive
fashion, without undermining the confidence of investors. This would give
British Gas the opportunity to maximise its non-monopoly operations,
especially those overseas, to the benefit of the company, shareholders and,
indeed, the UK as a whole.

Sir, For all the scoffing at the idea of a tax on fossil fuels, is there not

FT  19 MAY 92 / Britain's thin blue line on the drawing board: Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, is to deliver a message of reform and greater
efficiency to the police force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke will arrive at the Police Federation conference in
Scarborough on Wednesday like a relay runner passing the baton of reform
from department to department in Whitehall.
His audience will see him as man with a mission to reduce the power of
public sector vested interests in the cause of efficiency and better
service.
At the Department of Health Mr Clarke braved the outrage of doctors. One
consequence of the government's reforms was to attack the medical
profession's collective power.
Moving to education, he displayed similar decentralising tendencies towards
management of teachers, unions and local education authorities.
Now Mr Clarke is home secretary, and he is turning his attention to the
police. And while he does not wish to be seen as imposing cuts for the sake
of it, public spending pressures mean he must improve police performance.
Britain's police forces have enjoyed a growth in financial resources under
Conservative governments that is the envy of other public services. The
Conservative election manifesto claimed a 74 per cent increase in real terms
in spending on the police since 1979. Police strength has grown by 16 per
cent since then. If this is measured against a single criterion - the crime
rate - it was wasted. Recorded crime now stands at all-time record levels,
with offences notified to the police rising by 16 per cent to 5.3m last
year.
It would be unfair to assess the value of the police service purely in terms
of crime figures which are, in any case, not the most accurate statistics.
They are, however, one way in which the public and MPs evaluate the police.
Opinion polls show that the public wants more police officers on the beat,
and Conservative governments have tried to provide them. Not only is Mr
Clarke now constrained by pressures to contain public spending, but there is
evidence that increasing officers on the streets is not necessarily the best
way of tacking crime - a Home Office study found that a London foot patrol
officer was likely to pass within 100 yards of a burglary in progress only
once every eight years.
The police service has recently been trying to place the debate about the
effectiveness - and thus value - of policing in a broad social context.
Senior officers have spoken about the impact of unemployment and other
social problems on crime. A nine-point policing agenda published by the
Police Federation last autumn focuses firmly on the broad agenda.
But both the federation - the nearest thing to a trade union for
rank-and-file officers - and senior ranks will find the home secretary also
wants to examine the performance of the police service itself.
There are similarities between the police and Mr Clarke's old battlegrounds
in the National Health Service. Labour costs account for the bulk of
expenditure in both organisations - about 80 per cent in the case of the
police - and this is therefore an area where improved efficiency must be
sought.
The grip of professional insiders on both services is maintained by the
specialised nature of the work and the fact that there is little scope for
outside competition. So incentives to improve performance have to be
constructed within the organisation.
In the health service Mr Clarke separated the purchasing of health care from
its supply, making health authorities and hospitals bid for contracts in an
internal market. While this could not find a direct parallel in policing,
the home secretary is certain to encourage efforts already under way in some
forces to shorten lines of command and devolve decision-making and
budget-holding responsibility.
The management structure of the police service is powerfully reinforced by a
hierarchy based on formal, military-style rank. Although the great bulk of
day-to-day police work is carried out by humble constables acting on their
own initiative, they are supported by a senior management structure which,
the Audit Commission suggested in a report last year, has become top-heavy.
Some jobs, concluded the commission, tended to be allocated on the basis of
rank rather than the actual requirements of the post. Once a job was
occupied by a superintendent, it implied the need for 'all posts of similar
levels in management lines to be occupied by superintendents.'
Many forces are addressing such criticisms by adopting simplified management
structures, pushing decision-making to lower levels and sometimes giving
control of budgets to local commanders supported by civilian business
managers.
Lower ranking officers are also likely to face Mr Clarke's scrutiny. The
Police Federation has, for example, been accused of dragging its feet over
measures to dismiss officers whose performance is poor.
To improve efficiency, police forces are developing similar internal audit
procedures to other public authorities. In policing terms performance is
more difficult to measure, but forces have begun trying to allocate
resources in line with priorities determined by public opinion surveys.
West Mercia, a force which has restructured its management to give shorter
lines of communication, commissioned the Harris Research Centre to test
public opinion. The results showed that while 85 per cent of respondents
thought the police were doing a good job overall, 26 per cent were
dissatisfied with the treatment of telephone callers and a similar
proportion found police station reception areas off-putting.
In recent years, the biggest single step towards improving financial
performance in the police service has been through the replacement of police
officers with less expensive civilians in administrative, control and other
non-front work. Since civilians do not have to be as broadly trained as
police officers, they can be recruited more cheaply to perform specific
tasks.
The relatively generous funding of the police service during the 1980s did
not stop Mr Clarke's predecessors facing demands for yet more resources. It
would, therefore, require political courage to tell a Police Federation
conference that the days of generous spending increases for the service are
now over. But whatever impression Mr Clarke makes on delegates, there is
little doubt he will be try to reduce the police budget.
A really brave Mr Clarke could always relate the story of New York's
experience in the late 1970s, when a 20 per cent reduction in police
department manpower had no impact on the rate at which crime rose.
The New York episode supports one of Mr Clarke's favourite themes from his
health service days - that there is no automatic link between particular
levels of resources and the effectiveness with which they are used. But the
relationship between offending and deprivation, unemployment, schooling, and
countless other aspects of social policy is a highly complex one. Neither
the police nor Mr Clarke can solve those problems on their own.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Personal View: Maastricht's minor role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN TEW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Maastricht treaty on European union details the evolution of monetary
arrangements from now till 2000. By then hopefully all the UK's fellow EC
members are expected to have replaced their currencies with a single EC
currency, managed by an EC central bank. Will the treaty prove a reliable
guide to the future course of events? The obvious precedents - the Bretton
Woods Agreement of 1944 and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) Agreement of
1979 - offer little hope.
The Bretton Woods regime of the 1960s was de facto one of free foreign
exchange markets in which central banks operated by pegging on the dollar;
but the 1944 agreement made no mention of free markets, of central bank
dealings in such markets, or of pegging on the dollar.
Likewise the ERM regime in the 1980s was de facto one of pegging on the
D-Mark, with almost all the provisions of the ERM agreement turning out to
be dead letters. The intention that official intervention should be wholly
in European currencies (rather than in dollar) has been ignored, as has the
intention that the burden of adjustment should be shared between strong and
weak currency countries. The official Ecu in the agreement (as distinct from
the market Ecu adopted by private-sector intermediaries) has not played its
prescribed role; in particular the so-called 'divergence indicator' has not
been important in practice. The credit provisions of the agreement have
remained almost unused. The European Monetary Co-operation Fund has not been
transformed into the proposed European Monetary Fund, as was intended should
happen in 1981. Moreover, the most effective peggers on the D-Mark have been
Austria and Switzerland - both non-members of the ERM.
Central bankers are pragmatists. In the 1960s they judged the best
arrangement to be pegging on the dollar. Then, in the 1970s, when the dollar
waned, most of Europe (though not the UK until October 1990) turned to the
D-Mark instead.
Post-war experience warns us against accepting uncritically the Maastricht
treaty as a guide to the future. Instead we must consider the reactions of
decision-makers to the likely circumstances of the 1990s, especially since
the EC's pegging regime will differ from both the 1980s and the
pegging-on-the-dollar regime of the 1960s.
This is because financial deregulation has reduced the instruments available
for implementing monetary policy. Exchange controls have now gone; in
consequence financial regulations (such as credit ceilings) serve to drive
business off-shore, and changes in fiscal policy no longer have a
predictable effect on the exchange rate. (A stricter fiscal policy improves
the balance of trade but discourages the inflow of capital since the
government becomes less active as a borrower.)
The only surviving instrument of policy is the management of short-term
interest rates and in a pegging regime this instrument has to be dedicated
to maintaining the peg. The only objective which might take precedence over
maintaining an invariable peg is combating stagnation.
Currency depreciation operates to cut unemployment by improving the
international competitiveness of home industry, but only so long as the
domestic economy is not so fully integrated with neighbouring economies that
the depreciation is not offset by an equivalent rise in home-currency
prices. This proviso means that already by now Germany's smaller neighbours
are unable to improve their competitiveness by currency depreciation and
thus stand to lose nothing by freezing their exchange rates with the D-Mark
or by a transition to a common currency. The same will be so of other EC
states as their economies become assimilated into the wider Community
economy.
There is, however, a second argument. The Belgian authorities might
hypothetically argue as follows. 'We want to reduce unemployment not by
making prices more competitive but by cutting interest rates. This means
that to offset the capital outflow which would result from lower interest
rates, we must allow the franc to depreciate, while encouraging the
expectation that it will recover.' This is not plausible because the market
would be unlikely to expect any recovery of the Belgian currency unless its
initial depreciation left the franc 'undervalued'.
Already adjustments in exchange rates afford no advantage to those EC
members whose economies are so fully integrated that such changes would be
offset by equivalent changes in their domestic prices. Other EC members may
be reluctant to abandon the possibility of a realignment of exchange rates
until their economies become more integrated into the Community economy. It
is thus the pace of integration, rather than the Maastricht treaty, which
will determine the timetable for monetary union.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Thai generals out of time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE PAST 25 years in Thailand, politics has not been allowed to get in
the way of business. Few countries in Asia have rivalled its dedicated, if
blinkered, pursuit of profitable development. For the past two and a half
decades, the country's annual average increase in gross domestic product was
close to 9 per cent, accelerating to an extraordinary 11.7 per cent from
1988-90. Thailand can claim to be the world's fastest growing economy.
There has inevitably been a price to pay, but just how big the bill would
eventually be has not been the subject of intense internal debate. The
latest political manoeuvring by the army and outbreaks of violence in
Bangkok suggest that those assessments must assume greater urgency.
Thailand's problems stem, in common with other rapidly developing nations in
Asia, from the unwillingness of the ruling elite to appreciate the enormous
changes wrought in the economy and society since the mid-1960s.
Traditionally, Thailand has been governed through the interaction of the
monarchy, the military, civilian politicians and the higher ranks of the
civil service. Disagreements between them, including military coups, were a
matter of limited popular concern and did not interrupt economic
development.
Politics transformed
The system worked while Thailand remained primarily a rural and agricultural
nation. But the transformation of the economy into one dominated by
manufacturing and services and centred on metropolitan Bangkok has also
transformed politics. In February last year, the elected government headed
by General Chatichai Choonhavan was removed from office by a military
takeover led by General Suchinda Kraprayoon. Although there was
international concern over the interruption to the democratic process, few
tears were spilled over a government which, even by Thailand's immodest
standards, had brought exceptional financial rewards to its leading members.
General Suchinda promised that he had no political ambitions, arranged for
elections, did not stand as a candidate, then found himself invited by the
majority parties to become prime minister. His first cabinet included
several of the men whose removal he had engineered a year earlier.
Such a cynical manipulation of the system might not have raised many
eyebrows a couple of decades ago when communism threatened south-east Asia
and the west's view of the region was dominated by domino theories. But
today the too-long ignored HIV virus and the destruction of the environment
both pose a far greater threat to the Thai people than Vietnam. The role of
the army as the nation's protector has massively diminished but not, it
seems, its perception of itself.
Emphatic message
That message is now being more emphatically brought home to the army by the
people of Bangkok. In the March general election, the capital voted
massively for the Palang Dharma party headed by another ex-general and
former governor of Bangkok, Mr Chamlong Srimuang. The party took 32 of the
35 seats in the capital. Mr Chamlong is a devout Buddhist who refuses to
countenance the purchase of votes as widely practised by other parties. As
such, he is a distinctively new force in politics. His campaign against the
non-elected General Suchinda's assumption of the premiership has been the
catalyst of the present crisis.
The killing of demonstrators in Bangkok yesterday is not the background
against which General Suchinda can hope to build an effective government. He
initially offered to support an amendment of the constitution which would
allow only an elected MP to become prime minister. But together with the
main political parties General Suchinda has since backed away from the idea
and the prime minister's stance has become more confrontational.
In the short-term, such tactics might allow General Suchinda to hold on to
power. But he will have drawn the lines for a future confrontation that will
be very much more serious. Thailand has reached the point of economic
development where education, political awareness and a series of critical
social issues demand greater popular participation. To pretend otherwise
would be to put at risk what has been achieved in the past 30 years.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Arts: Roland Petit in Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP and FREDA PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roland Petit has always known that the theatre is a box of tricks. He has
ever been a master of those tricks, a conjuror ready to pull some
simple-seeming but astonishing feat from an empty sleeve. (In his very
earliest success, Les Forains of 1945, Petit cast himself as a manager of a
troupe of strolling players who was also a conjuror.) Charlot danse avec
nous, which I saw last Tuesday at the Teatro Eliseo, is a fine example of
Petit as a producer for whom revue, music-hall, cinema, ballet, are facets
of the theatre he loves. It is a fantasy about Charlie Chaplin (from whom
Petit once requested, and received, a libretto), with 20 scenes that are
variations on the theme of Chaplin as clown and film-maker. In them Petit
juggles ideas, styles, ingredients with entire mastery.
That said, I have to admit that I am one of those for whom Chaplin is rather
less entertaining than bubonic plague. WC Fields - now there was a comic -
dismissed Chaplin as a ballet-dancer, and his worst suspicions would be
aroused by the present show, in which Chaplin is indeed a dancer (Luigi
Bonino from Petit's Ballet National de Marseille). Yet Petit pulls off the
trick of the homage/commentary with real verve, in an entertainment cleverly
designed for touring. The stage is a black box, like the best conjuror's
setting, into which minimal properties are introduced, and every hallowed
feat of legerdemain is permitted.
With only six dancers - five men from the Ballet de Marseille; Elisabetta
Terabust as guest - we are treated to quick changes, spaghetti eaten by
strobe lighting, ombres chinoises, a snow-storm, captions as in the silent
cinema, an 'invisible' dresser from Noh drama, speeded-up Keystone Cops,
scenes from The Kid and The Gold Rush, and the flickering agonies of early
film melodrama. There is also an unabashed sentimentality which brings us a
blind flower-girl, Chaplin's own sticky little melodies, and the tramp
Charlie regularly down-trodden and achieving thereby a kind of immortality.
The evening has its uneven moments - Petit cannot escape the limitations of
Chaplin as a screen hero - but Luigi Bonino has the physical resource and
the unfailing timing that gives his portrait a theatrical edge. Terabust
(who now directs the Rome Opera Ballet) is enchanting throughout: grandly
serious when she needs to be in pas de deux; genuinely pathetic as the
flower-girl; irresistibly stylish as The Kid - she has true physical wit -
and as a saloon floozie. Jean-Charles Verchere, Laurent Dalibert, Thierry
Hauswald and David Vincendeau are admirable in the myriad things they have
to do.
Design is by Luisa Spinatelli, who helps Petit create a world through
suggestions of scenery and properties. There is a problematic score, owed in
part of Fiorenzo Carpi, who has produced an effective sound-track, with
Chaplin's own egregiously sentimental tunes woven into its fabric. But to
seek to assign a certain universality to Chaplin by accompanying his scenes
with chunks of JS Bach is worrying, and less justifiable than the playing of
the Bach Passacaglia for Petit's Le Jeune Homme et la mort all those years
ago. Here the music dwarfs the character and the occasion. The evening is
otherwise continuing proof of Roland Petit's vitality as a creator; if
Chaplin is to be celebrated, then let it be with such verve and affection,
and such loving theatricality.
The Petit quadruple bill at the Teatro dell'Opera, which preceded the
Chaplin Show, had a much less enthusiastic reception, apart from
L'Arlesienne, which pleased by virtue of Bizet's attractive and familiar
score and also Raffaele Paganini's striking performance as the tortured
young man of the Daudet story.
After a low-key opening with two extracts from the Soiree Debussy (with
greater satisfaction supplied by the orchestra than by most of the dancers),
the half-hour novelty arrived, Valse Triste ou le retour des cygnes, to a
collage of music by Sibelius.
If this pas de quatre was not in general much liked, perhaps this was on
account of a lack of clarity - a rare criticism to make of Petit. The flaw
may lie in his source, a piece of rather convoluted prose by Pierre
Combescot, last year's winner of the Prix Goncourt. The theme encompasses
swans, Wagner, Ludwig of Bavaria, Elisabeth the Empress of Austria and the
ill-fated couple of Mayerling fame, Mary Vetsera and Archduke Rudolf. What
is disconcerting is that on their entry the four dancers (Dominique
Khalfouni with Kader Belarbi in pale grey, and Elisabetta Terabust with
Cyril Pierre, in Black) are meant to represent their characters, which they
then abandon, according to the choreographer, in their formal solos, pas de
deux, and so on, each dancing eventually with all the others.
The doom-laden atmosphere, the dim lighting and the sepulchral make-up -
especially Terabust's and Belarbi's - call up a vision of graveyards, which
is reinforced at the end when they all make their exit through a trap-door.
It is also fostered by the music; Sibelius is hardly a favourite composer in
France or Italy, but it seems the choice was Combescot's.
If in conception the work is an addition to the long list of Petit's
love/death ballets, the absence of narrative transforms it into an
interesting and inventive piece of pure classicism, which repays attention.
While all four dancers have abundant opportunity to display their
considerable prowess and artistry, it is Khalfouni - above all for her solo
to the inevitable Swan of Tuonela - who stays in the mind. If Petit's
frequently announced remake of Swan Lake materialises, she will be a superb
Odette.

One of the characteristics of really good art is that it has something to
say to virtually everybody. Even though Anglo-Saxon Attitudes is set largely
in the 1950s and primarily concerned with a relatively small part of the
English middle class, it will impinge upon and throw light upon the lives of
a far larger group. Indeed, what it has to say about human relationships
must be well nigh universal. In today's episode (ITV 8.30) Gerald goes to
France seeking confirmation of his suspicions about the Melpham phallus.
Having dealt with punters and 'lads' (those men and women of all ages who
look after racehorses) BBC2's documentary The Racing Game moves on to
jockeys. Even for someone with no knowledge of the racing scene this is an
attractive series, though it does seem to have been made just as the entire
business is going under, at least in England (9.50). BBC1 begins yet another
documentary series about sport though this time with a wider brief. More
Than A Game promises to examine the state of sport as a whole.
In Viewpoint 92 (ITV 10.40) John Pilger pronounces upon third world debt and
third world aid.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Technology: Gambling on a gut reaction - The pharmaceutical
industry is making startling advances in drug discovery. Paul Abrahams
begins a series by looking at progress in ulcer treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<TEXT>
Leading gastro-enterologists gathered in San Francisco last week to discuss
the significance of a single bacterium. The outcome of that debate will
shape the drugs industry's most valuable market - for peptic ulcer
medication - worth more than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.9bn) a year.
The bacterium in question is helicobacter pylori (HP). Some specialists
believe the bacterium plays a vital role in the recurrence of stomach and
duodenal ulcers - nearly 80 per cent of patients whose ulcers are healed
subsequently have a relapse. The specialists argue that by eradicating the
bacterium in the stomach the risk of a recurrence is also eliminated.
The impact of a successful HP cure on the ulcer drugs market could be
striking. Nearly half the prescriptions for the leading class of ulcer drugs
 -known as H2-antagonists - are for maintenance therapy to prevent relapses.
Sales of the two leading H2-antagonists, Glaxo's Zantac and SmithKline
Beecham's Tagamet, totalled more than Dollars 4bn last year.
'If an acceptable method of eradicating HP can be found, it will profoundly
change the long-term management of peptic ulcer disease,' argues Anders
Vedin, president of Astra Hassle, the gastro-intestinal research division of
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group that sells an alternative therapy.
'By eradicating HP, you would eliminate the maintenance market for the
H2-antagonists, leading to significant savings in healthcare costs,' he
maintains. It would also give relief to the 15 per cent of the population
affected by peptic ulcers at some time in their lives.
Peptic ulcers are caused when there is an imbalance between the aggressive
qualities of the stomach acid used to break down food and the defensive
mechanism of the stomach lining. The hydrochloric acid starts digesting the
meat of the stomach lining - a painful and potentially dangerous condition.
The reasons for that imbalance are unknown. Diet, alcohol consumption and
smoking may have some effect. Stress may be a factor too. Doctors know that
between 10 and 20 per cent of patients taking non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs to treat arthritis develop ulcers within a month.
However, specialists are increasingly focusing their attention on HP, which
is found in about 90 per cent of patients with duodenal ulcers and between
70 and 80 per cent of those with peptic ulcers.
The problem is establishing a causal link between HP and ulcers, says John
Wood, director of medical affairs for group research at Glaxo, the UK
pharmaceutical company that markets the world's best-selling drug, the
H2-antagonist Zantac. A large proportion of the population is infected by
the bacterium, but fails to develop ulcers. He believes HP is one factor
among many.
Presently there are three main methods of dealing with peptic ulcers.
Historically, the most widespread treatment was anti-acid, such as milk of
magnesia, which counteracted the acidity in the stomach. In the event of
severe complications, patients required surgery, an expensive and
potentially dangerous procedure.
During the early 1980s, such traditional methods were largely abandoned
thanks to the development of a new class of drugs known as H2-antagonists.
These work by reducing the amount of acid produced by the stomach lining.
The cells responsible for secreting acid are naturally triggered by
histamine released in the stomach. The H2-antagonists act by blocking the
action of the histamine on the acid-secreting cells.
Once the ulcer is healed, H2-antagonists are also used to prevent relapses.
One study has shown that only 7 per cent of patients taking Zantac have a
recurrence of duodenal ulcers within the first year, compared with 49 per
cent of those who stopped taking the treatment. Glaxo reckons that about 80
per cent of patients with healed ulcers have a relapse if they do not take
any maintenance therapy.
More recently a third class of treatment, know as proton pump inhibitors,
has been developed. The best-selling version, Losec, is marketed by Astra of
Sweden. The drug works by controlling the final step of acid secretion,
blocking the action of the tiny acid pumps in the stomach wall. This reduces
the acid levels in the stomach and creates a suitable environment for
healing.
Once healed, patients are normally prescribed an H2-antagonist to prevent a
recurrence. This is usually for two years, but may have to be continued for
life - an expensive process.
So the attention of gastro-enterologists is now turning to the eradication
of the HP bacterium and the possible eventual end of such long-term
maintenance therapy.
Specialists are unsure why there might be a relationship between HP and
recurrent ulcers. According to Vedin at Astra: 'There appears to be certain
biochemical similarities between the HP organism and proteins in the gastric
lining, and that leads to damage. We know there is an effect, but it's only
now emerging how that might occur.'
At present, three different drugs are required to eliminate HP. The
treatment involves taking as many as 25 tablets at five different times a
day for up to four weeks. Patients have an understandable tendency not to
follow the regime properly. There are also problems with bacterial
resistance to the acid-resistant antibiotic involved in the treatment. Such
drugs are normally only administered in hospitals for patients who
frequently relapse.
The race is on to develop an easily administered treatment that would
replace the existing triple therapy and could be prescribed by general
practitioners. Takeda of Japan and Astra are separately conducting trials
using proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics such as amoxycillin. Astra
believes the reduction in acid levels achieved by the inhibitor allows the
amoxycillin to work more effectively.
Studies presented at the American Gastro-enterological Association's annual
conference last week showed that Astra may have come up with an answer to
the HP problem.
The studies demonstrated that Losec, together with amoxycillin, eradicated
HP in as many as 80 per cent of duodenal ulcer patients, and of these all
remained ulcer-free 12 months after the treatment. Specialists are now
experimenting to work out the most effective dosage. Some preliminary work
is also being done on gastric ulcers which are rarer than duodenal.
Glaxo meanwhile is also developing a Zantac-based treatment for HP called
ranitidine bismuth citrate, which would coat the ulcer and protect it from
further injury.
Astra admits there will always be a need for maintenance therapy. Even the
new HP therapies do not work in all patients and H2-antagonists will also
have to be used for patients on ulcer-forming, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.
However, the increasing preference of doctors for proton-pump inhibitors for
the initial treatment of ulcers is already hitting sales of the
H2-antagonists. Losec has already won 45 per cent of the acid-inhibitor
market in Sweden and 24 per cent in Germany. It has further to go in the UK
and US where it was only initially given limited approval - the drug
accounts for only 13 per cent and 8 per cent in those markets.
The impact of an effective cure for HP is likely to accelerate the trend
against the H2-antagonists. John Calam, senior lecturer in gastro-enterology
at Hammersmith Hospital, London, reckons it could take less than three years
for general practitioners to change their prescribing habits.
Others believe the natural conservatism of general practitioners will slow
the change. Vedin estimates it could take more than five years for the
market to alter fundamentally.
However, it looks as though a new HP therapy might not only cure the
disease, it may also cure the maintenance market out of existence.
The series will continue next month by looking at mind drugs.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): The mistakes of three
blind mice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESEARCH on Alzheimer's disease, the most frequent form of senile dementia,
has suffered a serious setback. Scientific error - and possibly fraud - have
cast doubt on the validity of animal models used to investigate the disease.
This is unwelcome news for the biotechnology and drug companies which have
raised hundreds of millions of dollars to develop new treatments for
Alzheimer's and other neurological disorders.
Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20 per cent of Americans over the age
of 70, has a severe, degenerative effect on the nervous system. It results
in a debilitating loss of memory, judgment and emotional stability.
What is the cause of Alzheimer's? Observations in the 1970s suggested that
environmental factors - and aluminium in particular - might be responsible.
This trail originated from data relating to a small group of kidney dialysis
patients who had acquired temporary dementia. Although their brains
contained unusually high levels of aluminium, this is now known to have been
caused by concentrated aluminium salts in the dialysis fluid.
Instead, the immediate physical cause of Alzheimer's has been tracked down
to a protein called beta-amyloid which accumulates in the patient's brain.
Brain biopsies taken from Alzheimer's patients show characteristic
accumulations of amyloid protein, known as plaques. Evidence that these are
associated with Alzheimer's comes from experiments in which laboratory
animals lost learning ability after injection with synthetic protein.
Amyloid - a protein whose normal function is not known - accumulates slowly
in most human brains as they get older. But why does it build up in some
individuals to such a degree as to cause Alzheimer's? Inherited genetic
characteristics are one likely explanation.
Genetic mapping shows that, for some families, the gene responsible is on
chromosome 21. Last year a family with inherited Alzheimer's was found to be
carrying a mutation in the gene for beta-amyloid protein, providing evidence
for a direct correlation between the gene and Alzheimer's.
This discovery led to the development of three animal models for
Alzheimer's, in which the normal human gene for amyloid protein is inserted
into mice. The animals then accumulate plaque proteins in the brain and
ultimately develop Alzheimer's symptoms. Unfortunately it now appears that
two models are no longer valid, despite their initial promise.
A US group from Miles Research in Connecticut first reported transgenic mice
showing Alzheimer's pathology. However, this report has now been withdrawn
as an honest scientific error.
Then a second US group reported that over-expression of the amyloid gene
gave rise to plaques similar to those in Alzheimer's patients. But this
report has been retracted because the results cannot be reproduced. There is
also doubt over whether the brain sections shown in the paper are from the
model mice.
From the three transgenic models, only one still seems to stand up. This is
a model produced by California Biotechnology and Daiichi Pharmaceutical of
Japan, in which amyloid deposits have been observed in 10 different animals
from three different genetic lines. However, it is too early to say whether
or not these mice develop age-dependent symptoms and other features
characteristic of human Alzheimer's disease.
The controversy highlights the essential role played by mouse models in
developing and testing compounds to treat Alzheimer's. The studies cannot be
done on Alzheimer's patients themselves, and monkeys are too scarce to use
routinely for this research.
Despite the competitive pressures, however, researchers must be less hasty
in publishing their results. Premature publication damages the reputation of
those responsible and leads other scientists in the field to waste an
incalculable amount of time and effort.
The authors work at the University of Sussex.

British companies are more dismissive of the likely impact of the single
European market than French and Danish counterparts, according to a survey*
by accountants Grant Thornton.
Thirty-seven per cent of small- and medium-sized businesses polled in the UK
viewed the proposed market as irrelevant, compared with only 18 per cent of
French businesses and 25 per cent of Danish companies.
Despite these sizeable minorities, more than half the companies in all three
countries plan to develop new markets, in particular inside the European
Community. Joint ventures and strategic alliances are the favoured means of
expansion in preference to outright acquisitions.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to find a partner to
fly the flag in Europe - Many British companies have been broadening their
horizons in pursuit of growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Three years ago, Gerard Lecoeur and David Mackay, directors of Crabtree
Hall, a London-based design company, sat down to talk about the future of
their industry.
They thought that there were too many design companies in Britain and
decided that they should reduce their total dependence on the UK market.
'We decided that a quick way to make an impact,' explains Mackay, 'would be
to ally ourselves with a French design company which had complementary
skills to our own'. Since Lecoeur is French, it seemed the obvious answer.
By the beginning of 1990, having researched the market, Crabtree Hall
settled for the Paris-based company Plan Creatif. A year later, a joint
venture company, Crabtree Hall-Plan Creatif was launched.
'The aim,' says Mackay, 'is to identify areas where we can operate together,
amalgamating our skills on large projects such as the design of shopping
centres'.
At the same time, both Crabtree Hall and Plan Creatif continue to operate as
individual concerns.
Small companies look for partners in continental Europe for a whole host of
reasons.
Ake Franzen, managing director of Glassfibre Flagpoles, based in Darlington
in the north-east of England, wanted to sell in Europe because he considered
his company had saturated the UK market.
The Slough-based marketing services group, Clarke Hooper, specialises in
sales promotion work. Barry Clarke, group chairman, initially wanted
European partners so that the company could refer its international clients
to reputable groups in other countries.
Finding a partner in Europe can be an onerous task. Crabtree Hall eventually
found its partner through published information.
Linda Shoppee, business development director, obtained a list of France's
top 25 design groups from a directory published by a French media magazine.
Shoppee wrote to most of the design groups asking for more background
information. Those which were affiliated to advertising agencies - and thus
not independent - were quickly dropped, as were those which did not have
design services complementary to Crabtree Hall's.
Shoppee then visited 10 companies from which she drew up a short-list of
three for Mackay and Lecoeur to see.
'We felt an immediate rapport with Plan Creatif,' says Mackay. 'The two
principals, Claude Braunstein and Clement Rousseau were of similar ages and
temperaments to ourselves. In terms of personality and attitudes, they were
our sort of people.'
Franzen found distributors and agents for his company's flagpoles by a
variety of means.
He took part in two trade missions to Belgium and Italy, organised by the
Department of Trade and Industry, coming away with distributors in each
country.
The regional development agency, Northern Development Company (NDC), was
also helpful in supplying European contacts. 'I also found distributors
through embassies, by looking up trade lists, even by reading local
telephone directories,' Franzen says.
For Clarke Hooper, finding European partners was relatively easy. Before
setting up his company, Clarke had worked as European vice-president of an
advertising agency and had made contacts in the sales promotion industry.
He started by contacting old colleagues, initially in Gruber Titze und Blank
in Germany and Group IPC in France, to see if they would like to set up an
informal network.
The three British companies have set up very different types of partnership.
Under guidance from its lawyers, Crabtree Hall/Plan Creatif opted for a new
legal formula - a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG).
Created by the European Commission, it allows companies from more than one
community country to establish a joint business venture.
Under the Crabtree Hall-Plan Creatif agreement, each partner contributes
equally to an annual marketing budget of about Pounds 125,000.
One partner acts as the lead on a project and the other invoices it in local
currency for consultancy time and expenses. Profits are shared among the
partners and taxed in their hands.
With just eight employees and little time to spare for developing close
relationships, Franzen decided to go for a more arms length approach with
his partners.
Glassfibre Flagpoles has set up exclusive trading contracts with its
distributors and agencies. It is up to each distributor and agent to develop
business in its country.
The incentive to do so comes in the form of a percentage cut of sales.
Clarke Hooper has developed the most informal of networks. From the start,
Clarke was adamant that he did not want to create a time- consuming
bureaucracy of companies.
As a result, no contracts exist and the only piece of paper that members are
asked to sign is a simple mission statement.
The network, comprising eight companies in Europe and six from other parts
of the world, has banded together to become the Promotional Consulting
Association International (PCAI).
Its main purposes are to exchange information on sales promotions and to
help one another with the implementation of international promotions.
Members contribute to an annual kitty of around Pounds 100,000 to fund the
group and they meet once a year. These various partnership agreements have
provided the companies with numerous benefits.
Both Crabtree Hall and Glassfibre Flagpoles have ceased to depend wholely on
the UK market for business. In 1991, Crabtree Hall gained Pounds 450,000 -
almost 25 per cent of its turnover - from work in Europe.
'It's more than compensated for what we lost in the UK because of the
recession,' says Mackay.
Franzen expects 50 per cent of Glassfibre Flagpoles' estimated turnover of
Pounds 1m to come from exports to Europe this year.
He has been particularly successful with his Spanish agency, Epok, which has
negotiated sales of flag poles worth about Pounds 600,000 for the Olympic
Games and Expo 92.
Of the effectiveness of PCAI, Clarke says: 'It's hard to see the results of
the partnership in our balance sheet. Mostly, it's given us access to a
world of promotional ideas and information - and that's what wins us
business.'
However, there have been direct benefits too. The partnership has
cross-referred clients successfully. Recently, PCAI's French company, Groupe
IPC, introduced its Orangina account to Clarke Hooper's US arm, Joseph
Potocki &amp; Associates.
The benefits of forming partnerships are not only commercial. In retrospect,
Mackay realises that he and Lecoeur had worked together for so many years
that they had started to think like an old married couple.
'By bringing in the French partners, we had to re-assess our creative stance
and ideas. They continually questioned what we were doing. It's been
tremendously stimulating,' he says.
There is, however, a downside to finding European partners - not least in
time and money.
'It took us twice as long as we expected to find a partner and get things
running,' says Mackay. Crabtree Hall also spent about Pounds 12,000 on legal
fees setting up the EEIG.
Discipline is also needed to maintain the relationship. 'We meet once a
month and that's quite hard when you're very busy,' says Mackay.
'It's tempting to let things drift and say you haven't got time to see one
another.'
Staff at Crabtree Hall have also had to adjust to a French business culture,
where potential new clients have to be courted far harder than in the UK.
That involves more meetings prior to drawing up a contract.
French clients' approach to the design process is also different. 'The
French are much more philosophical and the design solution, especially in
graphic design, is often esoteric,' says Mackay. 'UK clients, in comparison,
are far more hard-nosed and practical.'
Despite the difficulties of building a new business relationship, Mackay
says the benefits of having a partner far outweigh the downside.
'It's changed our attitude. As a combined group we're larger, have a huge
breadth of work and greater capability.
'We're much more confident now about selling our skills.'

WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN LOOKING FOR PARTNERS IN EUROPE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Should you be thinking about Europe at all? Have you exploited
opportunities in the UK?
Which is the best country for you?
What kind of partner do you want? A distributor, a joint venture, an
acquisition, or an informal network with no legal ties?
Are there any foreign contacts who you can exploit? Have you the time
and money to look for a partner?
Can you speak the local language?
Do you understand the local business culture?
European companies have different financial reporting rules. Have you an
accountant who can decipher them?

FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Stock Exchange loses Hogarth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Hogarth, managing director of the trading markets division of the
London Stock Exchange, is resigning at the end of the month, thus furnishing
further evidence of disarray at the top of the exchange.
Peter Rawlins, chief executive, hired Hogarth, then chief executive of
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, last March. Hogarth had previously spent
21 years with accountants Peat Marwick.
The exchange maintains that 41-year-old Hogarth is departing not much
earlier than planned, having completed his remit in the areas of broad
markets strategy, and information and technical services. In truth, the
exchange's customers have certainly yet to see the fruits of much of this
work.
And just last month Rawlins, an ex-Arthur Andersen man, contracted out the
information technology operations to Andersen Consulting for the next five
years, effectively sidelining Hogarth. Meanwhile, staff turnover at the
exchange has been high, including in Hogarth's division.
Hogarth is not being replaced directly - completing the collapse of the
management structure set up by Rawlins whereby the exchange was carved up
into three separate businesses, each with its own managing director and
board. Christine Dann, who has been running the primary markets division
since the beginning of last year, also assumes responsibility for
information services.

ProShare, launched in February as an outgrowth of the Wider Share Ownership
Council, is out to promote 'wider and deeper share ownership' with the help
of the likes of chairman Sir Peter Thompson - famed for making the lorry
drivers rich in the NFC buyout - president Sir John Harvey-Jones, and
ex-Tootal boss Geoffrey Maddrell as chief executive.
Senior comes in as director of company services where a big part of his job
will be to promote better employee share ownership schemes at a wider
cross-section of companies. He will also be encouraging UK firms to service
the private investor more effectively - using simpler language - at a
reasonable cost.
Meanwhile Pam Mapes, 39, becomes director of education at the group which
Maddrell has called 'a sort of Automobile Association for the private
investor'. She will be spreading the message to teachers, college lecturers,
adult education course directors and the like. She was until 1990 head of
marketing communications at the stock exchange, marketing information
products such as Topic and Seaq.

FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Approval for Nikko's Gemm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the body responsible for organising the government's bond market
borrowings, the Bank of England still sees the gilts market as sacred
territory. It will go to considerable lengths to ensure an orderly market,
including keeping an eye on the staffing of gilt-edged market-makers, or
GEMMs.
Yesterday, Nikko Securities, the fourth largest Japanese securities house,
completed a delicate approval process to become the 20th GEMM.
Nikko is not the first Japanese firm to stake out a pitch. Nomura and Daiwa
joined in 1988.
The firm appears to have taken a very Japanese, consensual attitude in
assembling a team of gilts traders - no team hirings or high-profile
poaching from other market markers. 'We didn't want to put any noses out of
joint,' says Philip Busfield, head of sales and trading.
Busfield himself joined from Credit Suisse First Boston, the US investment
bank; Peter Gibbens, senior trader, joins from Bankers Trust; other staff
come from Goldman Sachs, Midland Montagu, Kleinwort Benson, Credit Lyonnais
and Seccombe Marshall.
However, seasoned gilts market participants have a different explanation for
the diversity of Nikko's recruitment: the Old Lady still regards team
poaching as ungentlemanly conduct, and can make the approval process as
arduous as it chooses.

FT  19 MAY 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Greek car taxes are ruled to be
illegal - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek rules for the calculation of a consumption tax on cars, which vary
depending on whether the cars are imported or domestically produced, are in
breach of EC Treaty rules against discriminatory internal taxes, the
European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The Treaty rules prohibit member state from imposing internal taxation on
products imported from other Community countries in excess of the tax
imposed on similar domestic products.
Greece first introduced legislation for a consumption tax on cars in 1976.
The legislation, which was added to in 1979 and 1986, calculated the base
price on which imported cars were taxed by taking the wholesale price of the
car in its country of production, together with the price of optional
extras. These prices were increased by 21 per cent for cars purchased
directly from the foreign car producer and by 23.2 per cent for cars
purchased from a foreign distributor.
These prices were further increased by 7 per cent to take insurance and
import costs into account. By contrast, cars made in Greece were taxed
simply on the base of their ex-factory price.
The Greek government argued that, in Greece, the car industry was not very
developed and that car producers there were used to selling their products
directly to the consumer without using distributors or agents. Because of
this, the producer's 'wholesale' prices included marketing costs which were
normally included at the retail sales level.
In order to create a level playing field between domestic and imported cars,
it was necessary to increase the base price on which the tax would be paid
to take account of the marketing costs which would be incurred by the
importer.
The Greek government also explained that the system was aimed at limiting
the possibilities for the deliberate and fraudulent under-valuation of
imported cars.
The ECJ reiterated its earlier jurisprudence, stating that the Treaty
provisions were breached if there was any disparity in the method by which
the tax was calculated for imported and domestic products, even if this only
led to a higher tax being imposed on the imported product in a minority of
cases.
To be compatible with the Rome Treaty, the measures in question had to
exclude all risk of discrimination. The burden of showing that the
legislation had no discriminatory effect lay on the Greek government.
The Rome Treaty's ban on discriminatory internal taxation has been applied
by the Court to car tax systems in several member states and many other
economic areas. Companies doing business in other Community countries should
always check that they were not victims of similar discrimination under
national indirect taxation regimes.
Commission of the European Communities v Greece, Case C-327/90, FC, 12 May
1992.
Opinions and Oral Hearings
The Court did not hand down any other judgments despite a busy week. Nine
opinions from the Court's six Advocates-General were delivered and the Court
held 10 oral hearings.
One important opinion delivered last week concerned the equal treatment of
men and women in the UK in national insurance contributions. The
Advocate-General considered that the fact that men in the UK have to pay
national insurance contributions for longer than women was not contrary to
EC law.
Given the anxiety in the pension industry following recent judgments from
the ECJ, notably the Barber case, the judgment in the present case will be
eagerly awaited.
Case C-9/91 The Queen ex parte The Equal Opportunities Commission v
Secretary of State for Social Security, 12 May 1992.
(The role of an Advocate-General of the ECJ is best described by stating
what it is not. The Advocate-General is neither a first instance judge nor
an amicus curiae and the opinion delivered by the Advocate-General is not a
preliminary ruling.
The Rome Treaty provides that the duty of the Advocate-General is to act
with complete impartiality and independence in making reasoned submissions
in open court, in order to assist the Court in reaching its judgments.
The Advocates-General, who enjoy equal status to the judges of the Court,
are not bound by the collegiate approach of the Court. Their opinions can be
wide-ranging and generally contain a summary of the facts of the particular
case, the relevant law, the parties' submissions and an opinion on the legal
issues raised.
Before he delivers his opinion, the Advocate-General will have listened to,
and may have questioned the parties at the oral hearing. The opinion is not
binding on the Court, but is frequently followed.)
The Court recently held an oral hearing which may require it to decide a
dispute between the UK government and the government of Gibraltar as to
whether Gibraltar has power to bring proceedings in the ECJ.
The case is concerned with whether Gibraltar is excluded from the 1989
Council Directive on inter-regional air services.
The hearing concerned the admissibility of Gibraltar's application. The case
has important implications for the UK and Spanish governments.

UNION leaders of 37,000 white-collar workers at British Gas yesterday
rejected an offer to increase pay by 4 per cent. The company had previously
offered 3.9 per cent, Michael Smith writes.
Mr Dave Stirzaker, national gas officer of Nalgo, with 37,000 members at
British Gas, said it was a skinflint offer that would damage staff morale.
The offer coincided with a report by Incomes Data Services, the pay research
organisation, showing most pay settlements in the second quarter of 1992 as
worth between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Cut in repossessions 'would boost prices'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCTION in the number of house repossessions would give a strong
stimulus to house prices, according to an article in the latest Bank of
England quarterly bulletin.
It argues that in the short run house prices respond more rapidly to reduced
repossessions than to interest rate changes.
According to research by the Bank's economics division, a reduction in the
number of house repossessions by 20,000 for one year (there were about
75,000 last year) would increase house prices by about 5 per cent above
rises that would otherwise have occurred.
The increase in prices would in turn reduce the number of house
repossessions by a further 6,000 by increasing the value of housing equity.
A second simulation shows that a reduction in house repossessions of 4,000
would cause house prices to rise by 1.7 per cent in the first year.
'As well as the general cost of initiating a possession, the current scale
of possessions is having a significant effect on house prices,' the article
says.
The authors suggest that that depressing effect explains recent efforts by
lenders to initiate mortgage rescue schemes.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Asda sheds 500 jobs in store management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the troubled grocery chain, has declared 500 management jobs redundant
at its 206 stores.
The Leeds-based company plans to limit job losses by redeploying some staff.
The move follows the loss of 350 jobs at Asda's headquarters in January.
Asda, the Yorkshire area's biggest employer, said the latest job cuts
reflected the cost benefits from the company's investment in a centralised
distribution network.
Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director, said: 'Part of the saving is a
reduction in the number of people directly employed in goods reception in
our medium and large stores.
'Elsewhere, we have changed the nature of the managers' tasks. There is . .
. greater concentration on dealing with customers.'
On average, each Asda store employs about 20 managers in a variety of
functions. The affected staff were seen yesterday by their store managers
and offered alternative employment where possible.
The company said the annual savings would amount to the 'single-figure
millions'.
Retail analysts expect a sharp fall in profits before tax and exceptional
items.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Lang warns Scottish electronics industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, has warned that there will inevitably
be 'fallout' among electronics companies operating in Scotland because of
technological change and recession.
His warning echoes widely held fears in Scotland that Silicon Glen, as the
Scottish electronics industry is sometimes known, is vulnerable to the
changes sweeping the computer world. About 45,000 people work in Silicon
Glen.
'There has to be fallout among some of the electronics industry in Scotland
as a consequence of the changes that have taken place and the previous rapid
expansion of the industry,' Mr Lang said in an interview with the Financial
Times. 'It is absurd to pretend that there is not going to be.'
The world computer industry is in turmoil as advances in microprocessor
technology have reduced the cost to new companies of entering the industry,
while demand in many markets has slowed. Prices have fallen and industry
leaders such as International sses.
Scotland has several personal-computer and workstation manufacturers,
including IBM, Compaq, Digital and Sun Microsystems, as well as other
electronics plants.
Although Unisys recently closed its plant at Livingston with the loss of 700
jobs and Compaq last year reduced its workforce by about 10 per cent,
Silicon Glen has not so far experienced large job losses. Some new
foreign-owned companies have recently arrived.
Mr Lang said: 'We should never assume that inward investment (direct
investment by foreign-owned companies) is the answer to all our prayers. It
is a high-risk strategy in the sense that high-tech industry has a shorter
shelf life.
'It is susceptible to recession and more so to obsolescence, and the
combination (of the two) can be very serious indeed. We shouldn't assume
that all these companies are absolutely secure for ever more.'
His concern, he said, was 'as much about ensuring that indigenous Scottish
industry benefits from inward investment as with attracting inward
investment in the first place.' Some opportunities had been taken up, he
said, 'but there is still scope, especially in the manufacture of
components, for Scottish companies to find niches.'

A GERMAN-backed company is investing Pounds 2.92m in a plant to manufacture
computer monitors for sale in continental Europe at Prestwick, Ayrshire,
Scotland, James Buxton writes.
The plant, which is starting with 63 employees and hopes to reach 500 in

exporters exemptions from value added tax.
The company, European Monitors, is a joint venture between Escom Computer of

FT  19 MAY 92 / Suspended Bombay broker tries to embarrass authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOMBAY stockbroker implicated in a financial scandal yesterday sought to
embarrass the Indian monetary authorities by declaring that his alleged
illegal transactions were common practice in the Indian interbank securities
market.
Mr Harshad Mehta, who was suspended from membership of the Bombay Stock
Exchange on Friday after his assets had been frozen by the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI), claimed yesterday that the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank, was 'fully cognizant of these practices'.
In a letter to the CBI which he released publicly, he claimed that he had
violated no law. He said that all his transactions had been in line with
prevailing practice - 'a practice which is by no means secret or
clandestine'.
Mr Mehta's counter-charge is embarrassing the authorities because it is
increasingly clear that the channeling of funds out of the interbank money
and securities markets to finance share purchases has a long history.
It appears that Mr Mehta's operations were, however, on a much larger scale
 -including raising Rs6.2bn (Pounds 120m) from State Bank of India, the
largest commercial bank, on the basis of securities he allegedly did not
hold.
Mr Mehta's defence is strikingly - and perhaps intentionally - similar to
the one being used by ANZ Grindlays, the largest foreign bank, in a dispute
with the Reserve Bank of India over whether it violated RBI regulations.
Grindlays paid a cheque issued to it by another bank in the course of a
securities transaction into Mr Mehta's account - though the RBI does not
allow the use of brokers' accounts in interbank transactions.
The domestic commercial banks and the foreign banks are to meet today in an
effort to reconcile their accounts in the interbank securities market to
discover the extent of false and uncovered paper.
The foreign banks are meeting separately with Mr S. Venkitaramanan, the
governor of the Reserve Bank, to put their own views on tightening the
operation of the market.
In thin trading, the Bombay 30-share index edged up 61.68 points to 3,456.16
on the strength of institutional support. Brokers said private investors
stayed away from the market.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Australian cabinet minister resigns
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government suffered a serious blow yesterday when Senator
Graham Richardson, a senior cabinet minister, resigned over his relationship
with a businessman facing fraud charges in the Marshall Islands.
Senator Kerry Sibraa, a second minister embroiled in the affair, appeared to
have survived as president of the Senate after Mr Paul Keating, prime
minister, accepted a report explaining his involvement.
However, the affair appeared likely to spread after Mr John Hewson, the
conservative opposition leader, demanded an investigation into the role of
Senator Gareth Evans, the foreign minister.
Mr Richardson, who was transport and communications minister, is credited
with helping Labor to win the last federal election in 1990 by persuading Mr
Bob Hawke, the then prime minister, to endorse a strongly environmentalist
manifesto.
His resignation is a victory for the opposition, which has pursued the
Marshall Islands allegations since they emerged in the Victorian state
parliament earlier this month.
Mr Richardson, who denies any wrongdoing, said he had decided to resign to
avoid damaging Labor's prospects in the next federal election, which must be
held by mid-1993.
His resignation follows a spate of revelations about his relationship with
Mr Greg Symons, a relative by marriage, who is on trial for forgery in the
Marshall Islands, a former US protectorate in the Pacific.
Mr Richardson admits meeting Mr Symons in his Senate office, writing a
reference for him, and telephoning Mr Amata Kabua, president of the Marshall
Islands, after Mr Symons was arrested.
He initially denied any knowledge of Mr Symons' business affairs, but later
admitted knowing he was involved in a business emigration scheme aimed at
attracting Asian investors to the Marshall Islands, which has a passport
union with the US.
His resignation appeared to come as a surprise to Mr Keating, who said he
would consider a cabinet reshuffle later in the week.
Mr Keating said Mr Richardson's relationship with Mr Symons had been
unfortunate, but not improper.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Opposition leader wins hearts of Bangkok people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no doubt yesterday that Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the devout Buddhist
opposition leader arrested by soldiers in central Bangkok, was the hero of
the day for tens of thousands of anti-government demonstrators and for an
equal number of bystanders.
Mr Chamlong has won the hearts of Bangkok residents from civil servants and
secretaries to engineers and students, first by standing aloof from the
corruption of other politicians as the city's clean-living, ascetic mayor
and now by leading the most vigorous protest against military involvement in
government since the 1970s.
'I don't know him personally, but I have followed what he's been doing for
society for a long time,' said one machinery shop owner at a Buddhist temple
overlooking yesterday's continuing skirmishes between troops and rioters.
'He's not a guy to be taken lightly. When something's wrong, nobody wants to
protest, but he speaks up.'
Bangkok's relatively wealthy voters expressed their support for their former
mayor in the general election in March, giving his Palang Dharma (Moral
Force) party 32 of the 35 parliamentary seats from the capital, but
pro-military parties bought sufficient votes in the countryside to form the
present shaky coalition government.
Mr Chamlong subsequently resigned as leader of Palang Dharma in order to
head a broad group of liberal politicians, academics and students seeking to
give civilians more weight in the constitution and oust Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon, the prime minister, because he is not an elected member of
parliament.
Shopkeepers peered nervously from behind shutters yesterday as youths burnt
police cars and fire engines and yelled defiance at the soldiers, but it was
difficult to find anyone prepared to criticise Mr Chamlong.
Even those residents suspicious of Mr Chamlong seem prepared to drop their
objections to pursue what they see as the more important task of defeating
the military.
Youths who disobeyed Mr Chamlong's orders and started hurling missiles at
the police on Sunday night before rampaging through the streets smashing and
burning vehicles are widely dismissed as government 'agents provocateurs',
although there is no evidence to support this.
Mr Chamlong, however, does not altogether escape criticism. Some older Thais
are inclined to believe the official line that he is a troublemaker and a
Buddhist heretic. Others think he lost credibility by starting a hunger
strike to the death and then suddenly calling it off after less than a week,
while Mr Chalad Vorachad, a former MP from the Democrat Party, is still
fasting over a month later.
Among the most doubtful about Mr Chamlong are members of the educated elite
in their 30s who believe he took part in the right-wing suppression of
student demonstrations in 1976 when he was an army officer.
His decision to condone and lead Sunday's anti-government march has also
been criticised as a tactical error which allowed Gen Suchinda to declare a
state of emergency and crack down on the protestors.
But overall, Mr Chamlong's firm stand against his former army colleague Gen
Suchinda has made him the focus of the anti-government uprising. The places
where he has spoken and joined his fellow demonstrators - Democracy
Monument, the Sanam Luang park and the Phan Fa bridge - have intense
historical and emotional undertones for those who remember the successful
pro-democracy student protests of 1973.
'We just want the prime minister to resign,' said a 35-year-old engineer
trying to cross a barricade and join the demonstrators yesterday with his
wife and his mobile phone. 'If we win this time, I don't think the army will
have power again.'

<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S strict election code, which includes a ban on political party
supporters forming a convoy of more than three vehicles, yesterday lay in
tatters.
Hundreds of motorcycles, their riders and passengers waving the red flag of
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), trawled the streets of Jakarta,
honking horns, wailing slogans at bemused pedestrians and generally having a
political ball.
Members of the ruling Golkar party, in power since 1972, have promised not
to make empty promises during the campaign and have turned their rallies
into jamborees instead. Campaign podiums have been occupied mostly by
singers and dancers, with the occasional politician making a short political
statement.
The use of such an approach is questionable. Many of the bikers supporting
PDI, dressed in red T-shirts emblazoned with PDI's symbol of a discontented
bull, were youngsters ineligible to vote at the June 9 poll.
The local press has been calling on the government to allow greater
political expression and an end to entertainment rallies.
'I'd prefer three votes, then I could give one to each party. They're all
the same,' complained a businessman.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S TRADE surplus for April rose 13.4 per cent compared with the same
month last year to Dollars 7.16bn (Pounds 4.04bn), reflecting the strong
increase in exports that has accompanied the slowing of the domestic
economy.
Meanwhile, corporate bankruptcies rose 14 per cent from March, Tokyo
department store sales were 5 per cent lower than in April last year, and
wholesale prices were down 0.1 per cent from March.
In spite of the signs of economic slowing, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti) said the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) was too conservative in its estimate of 1.8 per cent
Japanese growth for 1992, and that the figure would be closer to the
government estimate of 3.5 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance said customs-cleared exports rose 13 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 27.23bn and imports were 12.8 per cent higher at
Dollars 20.07bn, though the figure was distorted by a taxation change that
led to a once-only 58 per cent increase in fuel imports to Dollars 4.55bn.
Seasonally adjusted, the surplus fell from Dollars 9.14bn in March to
Dollars 6.86bn, with a 4.3 per cent fall in exports and a 5.8 per cent
increase in exports.
But year-on-year export growth was strong for most leading items and
markets. Exports to the US rose 15.8 per cent to Dollars 7.52bn and imports
were unchanged at Dollars 4.23bn, while exports to the European Community
were 11.1 per cent higher at Dollars 5.41bn and imports rose 11.9 per cent
to Dollars 2.66bn, highlighted by the first increase in artwork imports in a
year and a half.
The express rate of growth in trade with China continued, with Japan's
exports to that country rising by 37.2 per cent and imports up by 39.4 per
cent. Present trends suggest that China will leapfrog Taiwan, South Korea
and Germany in the next year to become Japan's second largest trading
partner.
Exports of transport machinery, by value, rose 19.7 per cent on a year
earlier, of chemicals by 19.4 per cent, of precision instruments by 15.8 per
cent and of ordinary machinery by 13.1 per cent.
As for bankruptcies, Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research agency, said
46.8 per cent of the total were linked to the collapse of Japan's economic
bubble or the slowing of the economy. The number of cases in April rose 33
per cent from the same month last year.
The Japan Department Stores' Association said the 5 per cent fall in Tokyo
sales during April was partly caused by unfavourable weather, which led to a
4 per cent fall in clothing revenue. Household goods sales were down 11.1
per cent, while sales of food items rose 4.8 per cent.
Bank of Japan officials, who are concerned that inflation could be
stimulated by increased economic activity, said the composite wholesale
price index fell 0.1 per cent from March, and was down 1.2 per cent from
April last year. However, the bank remains concerned about price rises in
the service sector.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S tax inspectors yesterday began hauling in for questioning more
than 1,000 suspected owners of luxury yachts and holiday homes in Uruguay,
Brazil, Spain, the US and France.
The offensive against the rich is part of a successful campaign against tax
evasion by the 5,000 inspectors of the tax department, or DGI - known as the
Untouchables.
The wealthy have so far evaded the tax dragnet. They are the principal
holders of an estimated Dollars 40bn-Dollars 50bn (Pounds 22bn-Pounds 27bn)
in flight capital, which includes billions of dollars-worth of foreign
property, estimated at about Dollars 2bn in Uruguay alone. Mr Domingo
Cavallo, economy minister, wants them to pay taxes on the assets and 'begin
repatriating their wealth'.
Unofficial estimates indicate that attempts to encourage the return of
flight capital have so far been disappointing.
If the latest move is successful, the extra taxes will be used to finance
small companies and bolster the social security fund. Those complying will
be given an amnesty on any tax offences committed up to April 1.
Tax dodging was once part of the Argentine way of life. That changed when Mr
Cavallo took up his post last year and ordered a crack down. This, combined
with economic recovery, increased tax revenues to Dollars 1.84bn in April,
against Dollars 1.03bn a year earlier.

FT  19 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Indonesia in a bind over foreign
investment policy - Less-than-clear rules, says William Keeling, means much
may still have to be decided in a back room
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S investment policy has been through a mangle, squeezed between
the government technocrats who champion deregulation and the large business
groups who profit from central decision-making. At issue is the state's role
in the financing of large-scale projects: nearly Dollars 80bn-worth has been
queueing up for approval.
The government set a ceiling in October on new foreign borrowing for state
and private banks, state enterprises and private companies, and Bank
Indonesia, the central bank. It also announced a timetable for 14
large-scale projects to proceed between 1991 and 1996, while four
petrochemical projects were indefinitely postponed. A further 94 projects,
in areas as diverse as wood pulp, mining and telecommunications, were to be
reviewed.
The decision was in response to a burgeoning private and public
international debt, which increased 44 per cent to Dollars 75bn in three
years, and concern over a current account deficit of Dollars 4.3bn in 1991.
But as one Jakarta banker said: 'In Indonesia, a government decision is seen
as an invitation to negotiate.' A series of intense backroom negotiations
followed.
In April, the government Asri plant, one of the postponed petrochemical
projects, would go ahead. This came as little surprise: Bank Bumi Daya, a
state-owned bank, had already provided the project a Dollars 550m line of
credit; the project's backers included the Bimantara Citra conglomerate,
headed by President Suharto's second son, and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a leading
Indonesian businessman and close associate of senior politicians.
But approval was given with provisos: the project had to be wholly
foreign-owned - a first for a company outside a bonded zone (where companies
must export production); the project had to be scaled down from Dollars
2.25bn to Dollars 1.6bn, and Bank Bumi Daya's irrevocable letter of credit
would be transformed into a short-term bridging loan. It is unclear how the
Indonesian backers will meet these criteria.
Last month, the government announced that the rule on 100 per cent foreign
ownership was not exclusive to Chandra Asri. Full foreign ownership is now
allowed for companies investing more than Dollars 50m in projects in the
highly-populated provinces of Java and Sumatra, while those with lower
investment must be based in the more remote provinces. Previously, foreign
companies had been allowed 95 per cent ownership of joint ventures which
were export-orientated; their equity had to be reduced to 49 per cent within
15 years.
The decision has been an important deregulatory step, but some economists
believe it provides a loophole to by-pass the ceiling on foreign borrowings
 -which applies only to domestic institutions and enterprises - and may
worsen the current account deficit.
Government officials say loans raised offshore to finance wholly
foreign-owned ventures will not count as Indonesian debt, although they
accept that servicing such loans will have the same affect on the balance of
payments as foreign loans raised by domestic companies. Economists are
concerned that a shadow debt, not recognised by government but nevertheless
serviced by the country's export earnings, will grow.
Indeed, there is concern that the ceilings on foreign borrowing set last
year are already being broken. Private banks have supplied Bank Indonesia
with details of foreign loans but have not been given individual limits or
told if they are collectively within the ceiling.
Economists say that the central bank is reluctant to enforce the ruling
because this would be tantamount to a foreign exchange control. One minister
conceded: 'Bank Indonesia has suggested to us that perhaps the (private
bank) ceiling may have to be raised.'
The ceilings on all five categories may have been unnecessarily tight, with
one economist saying that even World Bank officials felt that the ceiling
limits were being overdone.
The government appears to have adopted a loose interpretation of the limits:
it estimates, for instance, that the eight projects scheduled for 1992-94,
which include two units at the Paiton electrical power complex in East Java,
have a total value of Dollars 2.2bn.
Yet officials at the government's Investment Co-ordinating Board say that
the Paiton units alone have investment approval of Dollars 2.2bn, although
this sum may include money raised locally. Other projects tabled for the
period include a Dollars 440m gas pipeline and an outer ring road for
Jakarta.
Industry officials also say that the Dollars 2.5bn Exor-1 refinery project
in West Java, not on the government's list of approved projects, will now go
ahead, as will the Dollars 200m upgrading of the Balikpapan refinery in East
Kalimantan.
Likely to be approved under the 100 per cent foreign ownership rule is
Exor-3, a Dollars 1bn project to refine crude oil for export which a
joint-venture of BP and C Itoh is studying.
Government officials say that a further 11 refinery and petrochemical
projects worth Dollars 18.6bn remain 'on hold,' and Dr Radius Prawiro,
senior economics minister, insists that the days of government funding for
mega-projects are numbered. 'We will curb foreign borrowing. We are not
going to finance big projects,' he says.

costs'

CONTROVERSIAL proposals to impose an EC-wide quota on imports of cheap
Chinese footwear could increase the cost of trainers for EC consumers,
according to manufacturers.
Trade officials from the 12 member states yesterday discussed a Commission
proposal for EC quotas in different categories of shoes, including the
growing market for trainers.
They broke up without agreement, with a majority said to favour the quota
proposal. Britain, Germany and the Netherlands asked the Commission to
supply further economic justification for the measure for their meeting this
week.
Chinese officials are in Brussels to discuss the proposals. China might
suggest a voluntary agreement to restrain exports, but Brussels does not
seem to favour such deals.
According to the Commission, Chinese footwear imports doubled between 1990
and 1991, from a large base. 'If they carried on at that rate there would be
no EC industry in five years,' a Commission official said yesterday.
But sports shoe companies such as Nike and Reebok contest the legality of
the Commission proposal, claiming it is too widely drawn. They are also
irritated they have been given little time to respond. Many EC imports of
popular brands of trainer are made in the Far East, with a growing share
coming from Chinese factories. In Reebok's case, the factories are built and
run by the Taiwanese in China. Reebok claims import quotas will increase the
price of trainers.
Instead of abolishing quotas altogether, the Commission decided to press for
harmonised Community quotas in specific areas, assessed according to the
value of imports. Quotas will be abolished in other markets, such as beach
shoes and waterproof footwear.
The Commission will meet Chinese officials this week.

MOTOROLA, the US manufacturer of semiconductors and communications
equipment, is building a factory in China to make these products primarily
for the Chinese market.
The group will officially announce plans to invest Dollars 120m (Pounds
67.7m) in a factory in Tianjin, a port city outside Peking, next month, when
it will hold the ground-breaking ceremony. The factory will be built on
property which is part of the Tianjin Economic Development Authority.
In 1988, Motorola announced plans to invest about Dollars 300m in a plant in
China. The project was suspended after the Tiananmen Square clampdown on
dissident students.
Motorola expects gradually to expand the project, employing several hundred
people after the facility is completed in 1993, but increasing the number of
employees to nearly 1,000 later in the decade.
Peking has been promoting investment in high-technology industries.
Motorola's decision to go ahead with the investment follows an announcement
by NEC of Japan, in September 1990, to form two joint ventures with Chinese
companies to make digital electronic switching systems and large-scale
integrated circuits for use in a wide range of consumer products.
Philips, the Dutch group, and BTM of Belgium have already set up joint
ventures to produce large-scale integrated circuits in China.
Although the sale and export of certain products, including all but the
simplest semiconductors come under scrutiny by Cocom, the Paris-based
organisation which monitors the export of sensitive products with potential
strategic applications, Cocom rules are being gradually eased.

FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: Governments aim their subsidies at
narrower targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS are cutting the subsidies they give to industry but are becoming
more sophisticated about how they subsidise, according to the findings of a
large international investigation by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
It has built up a data base of subsidies in 22 of its 24 member countries
(the exceptions are Luxembourg and Greece) and the European Community as a
first step to developing guidelines that would help policy makers avoid
unfair and trade distorting subsidies. These guidelines would be subject to
monitoring through a process of 'peer review' in the OECD's industry
committee.
The OECD looked at subsidy policies between 1986 and 1989. It found that the
total net cost to governments of the 879 subsidy programmes reported to it
averaged Dollars 66bn a year in the period, representing about 2.5 per cent
of the annual value-added in manufacturing in its 24-nation area. This, it
said, represented 'a sizeable macroeconomic sum'.
However, the total amount of support dropped from Dollars 74.6bn in 1986 to
Dollars 53bn in 1989, or by about a third in real terms. While the amount of
subsidy given through tax breaks almost halved from Dollars 49.3bn to
Dollars 25.7bn, governments gave more to industry through direct subsidies.
Direct financing of subsidies such as aids for investment, research and
development, regional development and export promotion rose sharply from
Dollars 25.3bn in 1986 to Dollars 36.1 bn in 1988 before falling to Dollars
27.4bn in 1989.
The OECD warns that these figures fall short of the total level of
industrial subsidy in its member states. There are gaps in its data base,
reflecting such problems as measuring subsidies given by public sector
entities other than central government. The subsidy element in government
procurement of civil and military goods and services is obscure. There is
also no national breakdown of subsidy totals.
But certain trends have emerged from the study. Tax reforms have led to a
shift away from general purpose subsidies such as general investment support
through such instruments as capital allowances, to more focused measures.
The share of general investment support in the net cost of subsidies to
governments fell from 71 per cent of the total in 1986 to 49 per cent in
1989. In the same period, the share of R&amp;D support increased to 13 per cent
from 10 per cent, while export related support rose to 20 per cent from 8
per cent respectively in 1986.
It appears that regional development expenditure has played a bigger role in
investment support. Industrial subsidies to help regions accounted for 22
per cent of total subsidy costs in 1989 against 14 per cent in 1986.
The OECD found that subsidy policies varied considerably among countries.
General investment aid was the dominant policy objective in the US, although
export-related and R&amp;D spending also was high. Japan targeted its subsidies
mainly on R&amp;D and small and medium-sized companies. In Germany, regional
policy was the main reason for subsidy in the period under review which
preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall and unification. In the UK, regional
development and export promotion were the main subsidy objectives although
R&amp;D and small and medium-sized concerns received considerable support.
The organisation says its investigation has improved understanding among
governments of the structure and mechanisms of industrial support. It has
also led to a 'substantial leap forward towards transparency'.
But the Paris-based organisation says more has to be done, including the
gathering of more up-to-date data, if proper international discipline is to
be brought to the complex world of industrial subsidies.

FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: EC insists on US trade talks
concessions - Andriessen stakes out tough negotiating position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday underlined that an early and successful
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks will depend on
US concessions. Mr Frans Andriessen, European Commission vice-president and
top EC negotiator in the Round, yesterday rejected the notion that Community
concessions on agriculture alone would open the way to a deal.
Mr Andriessen, who was attending the annual ministerial meeting of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is due in Washington
shortly for talks with Mrs Carla Hills, the US special trade representative,
and possibly with Mr James Baker, the secretary of state.
He staked out a tough negotiating position, insisting that the EC would be
unable to accept any deal that did not include acceptable terms on services
and market access, where the US is holding up agreement, as well as
agriculture, where the EC acknowledges it has problems making concessions.
He He also laid down other conditions. The EC wanted a 'peace clause' that
would exempt any agreements on agriculture from the terms of a new subsidy
code under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, guarantees of
compensation for EC farmers reducing output, and comparable rules governing
the reduction of internal farm subsidies and support for exports.
The EC was prepared to make concessions on agriculture, Mr Andriessen said,
provided the US also shifted its position on the remaining areas of dispute.
But he raised the temperature in the transatlantic war of words over trade
by attributing the Round's problems to the US because it had pressed from
the start for 100 per cent elimination of farm support.
This brought a barbed response from Mr Rufus Yerxa, US deputy trade
representative. He pointed out that the US had shown 'quite a lot of
flexibility' in the talks. 'I hope he's not indicating that the EC is not
prepared to tackle the problems of the common agricultural policy because
that is what is needed for a successful Uruguay Round.'
The potential benefits of the stalled Round were highlighted yesterday by
Mrs Barbara Franklin, US commerce secretary. Achieving an agreement could
boost US gross domestic product by a trillion dollars over the next decade
and lift the world economy by five trillion, she said.
But it was the impasse over trade which overshadowed yesterday's talks on
how to boost growth and cut unemployment. 'There clearly is impatience that
agreement should be reached,' said Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's chief
secretary to the Treasury.

FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: Farm surpluses expected to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL world's farm surpluses will continue to grow in the medium
term unless present output-based support policies are changed, the OECD
warned yesterday.
In its latest review of efforts to reform agricultural policies, the
organisation said there had been insufficient adjustment to farm policies in
recent years, with the result that competitive conditions on international
markets continued to be distorted. Neither support for agricultural
production nor the costs carried by consumers through higher prices showed
any significant decrease last year.
Production support, as measured by an internationally standardised unit
known as the producer subsidy equivalent (PSE) totalled Dollars 177bn last
year compared with Dollars 180bn in 1990. Most of this was financed by an
implicit tax on consumers, paid through higher prices. The consumers' burden
of farm support rose to Dollars 135bn last year, when measured in
internationally standardised consumer subsidy equivalents (CSE), from
Dollars 133bn in 1990.
The OECD said total farm subsidies were much higher, however. It estimated
that total transfers to agriculture, as measured by PSEs, CSEs and other
items such as welfare payments to rural areas and support for storage of
stockpiled farm products, rose by about 5 per cent to an estimated Dollars
320bn last year.
The OECD said political impediments to reform largely explained why the
movement to cut surpluses and subsidies had made little headway in recent
years. Although the overall benefits of reform clearly outweighed the costs,
those who stood to lose opposed reform actively.
The organisation said unusual or extreme events, such as food production and
distribution problems in the former Soviet Union or famine in Africa, also
postponed farm reform. But it warned that such events were only a 'temporary
reprieve' for western policymakers. The OECD also urged governments to
ensure that growing concern about the environment or food safety was not
turned into a pretext for hindering the attack on farm subsidies and
surpluses.

FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: Labour reforms will bring more jobs,
says UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth would be firmly established in Britain this year, ensuring
that the UK played its part in a sustainable world economic recovery, Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast yesterday.
Thanks to the labour market reforms of the past decade, he said, Britain
would be able to sustain a higher level of employment without succumbing to
inflationary pressures than in the early 1980s.
Mr Portillo told the OECD annual ministerial meeting that Britain was
continuing those reforms with measures to restrain unofficial strikes.
Changes in education and vocational training would lead to higher standards
and a better qualified workforce.
There was a danger, however, that European Community social policies could
intensify unemployment by making labour markets less flexible. The draft EC
directive on working time, which Britain opposes, could impose an additional
cost of around Pounds 5bn on UK employers, he said.
Mr Portillo underlined that he and other ministers from the OECD's 24
industrialised member states saw 'no quick fix' to the problem of
unemployment. But confidence was returning to Britain, he said. The full
benefits of lower inflation and the drop in interest rates from 15 per cent
in October 1990 to 10 per cent today had yet to come through.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Germany's DAX index climbs 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The DAX index of 30 leading German shares closed just under 2 per cent
higher yesterday, up 34.6 points to close at 1758.43.
The increase reflected a positive response to the news of a settlement: the
market had been expecting a strike and was surprised at the last-minute turn
of events.
Much of the buying came from traders attempting to square their 'short
positions' and there was no wave of purchases from institutional investors.
Brokers suggested this may come in the next few days as investors pondered
the details of the deal.
'It was a lot better than it could have been,' said Mr Gunter Kirchhain of
Deutsche Bank's Dusseldorf-based institutional equities team. 'It suggests
that the much-heralded German disease may have turned out to be no more than
a virus infection after all.'
Mr Hans-Peter Hodniock of James Capel in Frankfurt was emphatic that the
settlement removed the threat of a 'wage-price spiral' in Germany. He was
hopeful that the Bundesbank would look on it in the same light and be moved
to consider relaxing its tight monetary policy.
The Bundesbank itself took a relatively sanguine view of the lifting of the
strike threat. Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank directorate member
responsible for economics, said in London that the deal was 'a step in the
right direction'. Even though wage levels were still rising by more than the
country could afford, Mr Issing pointed out that a settlement in the region
of 5.5 per cent was in line with mainstream economic forecasts for wage
rises at the beginning of the year.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Moscow may keep nuclear missiles on Kazakh soil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, yesterday foreshadowed
the shape of new defence alignments in the former Soviet Union when he said
Russian nuclear missiles may in future be allowed to be based on Kazakh
soil.
Mr Nazarbayev, who was leaving Moscow for an official visit to the US after
talks on Sunday with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said the
missiles at present in Kazakhstan would be returned to Russia, and that
future stationing of part of the Russian nuclear armoury would depend on the
two states' reaching a 'mutually advantageous' agreement.
Kazakhstan, with Ukraine and Belarus, are expected to sign a protocol to the
Start treaty on nuclear weapons soon, allowing the implementation of a
treaty stalled for some months by disagreements between the four nuclear
states of the former USSR.
Agreement has now been reached between them, and between them and the US,
that all four should become signatories to Start - after which the three
non-Russian states would accede to the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, and
return all tactical and strategic weapons on their territory.
Mr Nazarbayev emphasised that the decision to send all nuclear missiles to
Russia and to negotiate an agreement on basing Russian missiles in
Kazakhstan in future was possible because of the signing last Friday in
Tashkent of a collective security agreement between six of the 11 members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The signatories to the agreement are Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Of these, the last three are poor Central Asian states who cannot afford to
support their own military, and who have CIS forces on their territory paid
for by Russia. Mr Yeltsin said last week that Russia could come to an
arrangement with other states to base units of the Russian army on them by
agreement.
Kazakhstan, evenly balanced between a Slav and Kazakh population, has under
President Nazarbayev pursued a largely pro-Russian policy, and has proposed
itself as a 'bridge' between East and West.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Italian unions angry over this month's missing pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian union movement has protested vigorously over the refusal of the
government and industry to pay an inflation-indexed wage increase this
month.
The CGIL, the largest of the three union confederations, has taken the
matter to the courts, and the metalworkers' union has threatened a protest
strike on May 29.
Yesterday, in an attempt to head off a wave of protest, Mr Franco Marini,
the outgoing minister of labour, held talks with the three main
confederations and will hold a similar meeting today with Confindustria, the
industrialists' association.
Italy's scala mobile system of indexed-linked wages went into abeyance at
the beginning of the year following agreement between the government, unions
and employers that broad negotiations on labour costs and wages would resume
this June.
At the time Confindustria, which has long sought to abolish the scala
mobile, said it regarded the system as dead. With average wages projected to
increase to 5.6 per cent this year, Confindustria calculated topping up
wages would have resulted in an effective increase for employers of 7.5 per
cent. However, the unions warned that they expected a final payment.
The CGIL claimed that many wage deals last year had been negotiated with
this May's scala mobile payment included.
The increase sought by the CGIL would amount to only an extra L28,000
(Pounds 12.67) a month in take-home pay. But the protest is less about money
than principle. The unions are also aware they need to flex their muscles in
advance of next month's tough talks with Confindustria on wage costs.
These negotiations will be a crucial test on whether the two sides can agree
on measures to ease the European Community's most rigid labour market and
create a more competitive wage structure for industry. The unions recognise
the climate of industrial relations is changing and that formal wage
indexation is unrealistic. Nevertheless, they are anxious to safeguard their
members in an economy which has consistently showed unpredictable and high
levels of inflation.
After an abortive ninth joint session of parliament yesterday, the country's
politicians were still no closer to finding a candidate capable of winning
sufficient cross-party support to be elected president.
Socialist efforts to present a candidate backed by potential allies in the
International Socialist movement - the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) and the Social Democrats - collapsed early yesterday.
Too much mistrust appeared to exist between the opposition PDS and the
Socialists, who are partners in the outgoing Christian Democrat-led
four-party coalition.

FT  19 MAY 92 / Settlement brings mood of relief rather than jubilation at
IG Metall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mood at the IG Metall trade union headquarters in Frankfurt yesterday
was one of relief rather than jubilation that a west German engineering
strike had been averted by a last-minute settlement.
'It's a compromise', said Mr Horst Neumann, deputy head of economic research
at the trade union. 'I'm pleased there's not a strike, but the risk that the
21-month settlement will be overtaken by inflation next year has not
disappeared'.
The union, representing nearly 4m workers in the German engineering industry
was happy that employers' demands for a pay settlement of less than 5 per
cent - the formal initial offer was only 3.3 per cent - were effectively
overcome. The union was also relieved the already agreed move to the 35-hour
week has not suffered a setback.
IG Metall's own demand was 9.5 per cent, a level presented by Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, head of the union, as a concession to mounting concern in
Germany over inflation and monetary stability. The latest annual inflation
figure was 4.5 per cent, though it has touched 4.8 per cent this year.
But, Mr Neumann added, many of the union's disgruntled members do not
necessarily separate out the official consumer price figure from the overall
burden on their incomes. 'Price rises, tax increases, higher consumer tax
levels - these are all seen as part of the same thing'.
Thus it was that the preliminary warning strikes called by the union in
recent weeks to bolster its claim had such a strong response. 'We were
pleased, and the employers possibly surprised, at the size of the turnout.
People were willing to get into buses and travel to demonstrations'. On some
days, more than 100,000 people took part in warning strikes of up to four
hours.
Such actions, Mr Neumann reckons, must have swayed what he calls 'the
radicalised Mittelstand' - the host of small- and medium-sized companies
which had lined up firmly behind demands for as low a wage increase as
possible after last year's 6.7 per cent. Many of them, especially in the
automobile supply sector, are suffering from an intense squeeze on profit
margins in the face of weak foreign markets and pressure from the car
companies to keep prices low.
In IG Metall's view, this is a problem within the industry that should not
be solved by keeping a lid on pay. The employers see it differently, though
it is noticeable that some of the motor manufacturers expressed less concern
about settlements approaching 6 per cent than did smaller engineering and
components companies.
The risks from an all-out strike would have been high on both sides. Because
of a change in the law, employees laid off or put on short-time working
because of a strike at another plant would not have been entitled to state
welfare. This would have put pressure on the union to widen strike action so
that it could pay all affected members from its own funds.
Employers had also threatened extensive lockouts so that the consequences of
a strike could have been severe. Many companies, especially in the car
industry, rely heavily on just-in-time deliveries, which would have been
totally disrupted.
If a strike had occurred, said Mr Neumann, 'it would have been like a raging
fire over a wide area'. Obviously, neither the employers nor the union
wanted any of the opprobrium which that would have caused.
