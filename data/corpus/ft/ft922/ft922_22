FT  19 MAY 92 / Pressure over BR route access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government faced demands from both sides of the Commons last night to
ensure that the introduction of rail services by private-sector operators is
not limited to British Rail's most profitable routes.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's shadow transport secretary, led the calls for
restrictions to prevent 'cherry-picking' by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Group and other interests keen to secure access to BR's tracks.
Railway enthusiast Mr Robert Adley (C Christchurch), who has warned that the
privatisation of BR might become a 'potential poll tax on wheels', also
insisted that private-sector operators should not be allowed just to 'pick
the bit they like'.
He suggested a 'coupling procedure' - with those seeking to operate the most
profitable routes being required to take responsibility for a less
attractive service as well - as one means of protecting BR's position.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, who moved the second reading of the
British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill, confirmed that the
principle measure dealing with BR would be introduced in the autumn
It would be preceded by a white paper outlining proposals for the
franchising of passenger services, the sale of BR's freight and parcels
buisnesses, and preparing the way for the sale of stations.
He described the bill - which Mr Adley promised not to oppose while
reserving his position on the measure to be introduced in the autumn - as
the first legislative step to bringing the 'the benefits of the private
sector and privatisation to the coal and rail industries'.
Mr MacGregor was unable to answer fears expressed by Mr Tam Dalyell (Lab
Linlithgow) that negotiations were already in hand for the sale of
Edinburgh's Waverley station.
That, Mr Dalyell told the House, occupied a most valuable central site and
had benefited from the investment of 'huge amounts of money'.
The minister said decisions on the future structure of the coal industry and
the timing of its privatisation had yet to be made.
Mr Prescott argued that the bill reflected the government's 'ideological
obsession' with privatisation, and emphasised that France, Germany and other
countries with efficient railway services believed that they could best be
operated as a state enterprise.
He condemned the excessive restrictions imposed by the Treasury which
prevented British Rail having the same access to private capital as its
foreign counterparts.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Forlani forced to pull out of Italy's presidential race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Christian Democrats suffered a big reverse yesterday when the
leadership was forced to withdraw the party's official presidential
candidate, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, from the race.
The withdrawal of Mr Forlani after he twice failed to obtain sufficient
backing in the special parliamentary vote for the presidency is likely to
complicate the five-day-old process of choosing Italy's ninth postwar head
of state.
The opposition to Mr Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary, also
underlined the serious divisions within both the party and its allies in the
outgoing government coalition.
The presidential race was last night again open, with the Christian
Democrats having to reconsider the whole basis of their alliances and
whether they should consider seeking a candidate from within their own
ranks.
Mr Forlani had only emerged as the Christian Democrats' official candidate
on Friday after a series of hectic late-night negotiating sessions and four
inconclusive rounds of voting in parliament.
When he stood in the fifth and sixth rounds he got 469 and 479 votes. This
was well short of the simple majority of 508 votes required after the first
three rounds in which a two-thirds majority was necessary, had passed,
As one of the party's most experienced political figures and the man
responsible for strategy in the April 5 general elections, Mr Forlani had
been chosen as a heavyweight to rally support among a demoralised and
divided party. The Christian Democrats had also counted on the support of
their allies in the outgoing coalition - the Socialists, Liberals and Social
Democrats.
In theory the four should have been able to muster 539 votes if all the
deputies, senators and regional council representatives had backed Mr
Forlani.
The failure of Mr Forlani underlines the virtual impossibility in the
present parliamentary climate of finding a presidential candidate proposed
solely by the outgoing four-party coalition. Mr Mario Segni, the Christian
Democrat dissident who heads the referendum movement, revealed yesterday he
had cast a blank vote, as had several of his supporters, in protest against
the party's continued refusal to recognise the need for a head of state who
clearly represented the nation's mood in favour of fundamental institutional
change.
The issue of change, highlighted by the large protest vote in the April
general elections, is now likely to dominate the choice of a candidate.
Equally, the withdrawal of Mr Forlani could mark the beginning of a big
change within the Christian Democrat party, leading to the exit of old-guard
politicians.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Honour for Opus Dei founder draws crowds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the largest crowds ever to gather at the Vatican (above) witnessed
yesterday's ecclesiastical spectacular in which Pope John Paul took the
founder of the controversial, conservative Opus Dei movement a step closer
to sainthood, reports Reuter in Rome.
Police estimated that more than 200,000 people from about 60 countries
filled St Peter's Square and its approaches for the beatification of the
Spanish Msgr Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer.
The day was clearly a triumphant one for Opus Dei, which has for decades
been fending off criticism from church liberals that it is secretive and
elitist and has created a cult around its founder. These critics maintain
that Escriva was a vain, hot-tempered man who did not discourage reverence
for his person.
But the Pope, who supports the movement, praised him for preaching that
ordinary Christians could find holiness in life's daily routines. He said
Escriva's life was 'marked by Christian humanism, with the unmistakable seal
of goodness, meekness of heart, the hidden suffering by which God purifies
and sanctifies his chosen ones'.
Escriva, who died in 1975 at the age of 73, has been credited with
performing one miracle: the medically inexplicable cure of an elderly
Spanish nun who suffered from a terminal tumour. He must be ascribed another
miracle before he can be declared a saint.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: More dollar nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTINUING uncertainty over the dollar is certain to dominate the
markets again this week, writes James Blitz.
Analysts believe that last week's good indicators for US industrial
production and money supply make it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will
cut rates at their Federal Open Markets Committee tomorrow. But the market
will need to see extremely good figures for the US trade balance on
Wednesday if it is to invest in dollars.
Traders may still be influenced by last week's comments from Mr David
Mulford, the US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, who said
that Washington wants to see a strong yen. Those comments brought the US
currency below Y130 last week. There is little doubt that if the dollar dips
below Y129 or DM1.60 there will be another furious bout of selling.
However, the outlook for Japan is not all that strong either. Yen traders
will focus on the Bank of Japan's April money supply figures, due out on
Wednesday at the earliest, as a key to whether the economy is about to
recover. Analysts believe that the market is likely to be disappointed, with
monthly growth falling back to 1.6 per cent after being at 1.8 per cent last
month. If that is the case, it will further worry those who believe that the
Japanese economy is slowing down too much.
In Europe, attention will focus on whether the French franc and sterling can
continue their onslaught against the D-Mark and breach their central rates
against the German currency. With a Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday,
threatening yet another rate hike, the markets are likely to give the D-Mark
the benefit of the doubt for the time being.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Justinian: Jersey's judicial lesson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The removal of the deputy bailiff of Jersey from judicial office and
consequently from his position as deputy speaker of the island's legislature
may have repercussions for the future of this self-governing dependency of
the Crown.
Whatever the political outcome of public support for Mr Vernon Tomes, his
departure provides a rare opportunity to examine the British constitutional
position of an independent judiciary, an opportunity missed a year ago when
140 MPs were calling for an Address to be presented to the Crown petitioning
for the removal of Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice until a few weeks ago.
The issue is neatly dealt with in Ferdinand Mount's The British Constitution
Now, published last week. Mr Mount faithfully recites the long-standing
adherence of this country to the principle of the separation of powers and
the constitutional invulnerability of the judiciary. The independence of the
judiciary carries two distinct meanings: the independence of individual
judges in the exercise of their judicial functions and, second, the
independence of the judiciary as a body of judges. The latter concept is
concerned with the freedom of the judiciary from interference by executive
government or the legislature in the exercise of judicial functions. In
modern times the independence implies not only that judges should feel
unrestrained by political pressures but also, with the growth of corporate
giants, be removed from business entanglements likely to affect them in the
exercise of justice. But that was not the issue over Lord Lane's handling of
the Birmingham Six appeal in 1989 or the deputy bailiff's dismissal last
week.
Apart from securing adequately their terms of office and tenure, judges, in
judicial decision-making and in other official duties are subject to no
authority but the law. It is an axiom of the rule of law that interference
with the independence of judges to give their decisions according to the law
is detrimental. As Mr Mount puts it: 'No other organ of government is to
judge their performances as judges'.
What was hopelessly overlooked by politicians and commentators last year in
clamouring for Lord Lane's removal was that he was being assailed for having
made a mistake - shared by two other appellate judges - in dismissing the
Birmingham Six's appeal. The call for Lord Lane's removal was
unconstitutional. The fact that no judge has been removed in this way since
the Act of Settlement of 1701 escaped the notice of his denigrators.
The 1701 Act was the genesis of the irremovability of judges for
incompetence on the bench. That act provided that the judges' commissions
from the Crown should be made 'quamdieu se bene gesserint' (as long as they
are of good behaviour). On that ground, judges are removable only on an
Address by both Houses of Parliament.
This measure did not of itself create an independent judiciary. Other steps
needed to be taken to secure their salaries and pensions. But the 1701 Act
was the bedrock of independence, now re-enacted in the Supreme Court Act
1981. For nearly 300 years no judge has been removed by that process. This,
as Mr Mount observes, is no trivial custom. It is fundamental to
constitutional protection of judges.
How then does the case of the deputy bailiff fit into this constitutional
picture? His offence was inordinate delay in handing down decisions. No one
has doubted the quality of his judgments. They were of a high order,
meticulously constructed. What was intolerable was the delay in
administering justice. It was his conduct, not in his judging of cases, but
in the administrative process that constituted his offence.
One of the besetting problems for litigants all over the world is the time
they have to wait for a decison to be handed down. There is no means within
a legal system of literally forcing a judge to give his decision. Various
devices have been sought, such as applying to the judge in open court for
him to give his decision so that his failure up till then may be publicly
noted. Alternatively it may be that help could be sought from the head of
the judiciary, the Lord Chancellor, or from the head of the division in
which the judge sits.
One ruse comes to mind with the listing last week in a legal magazine of Mr
Justice Harman at the bottom of the league of judges favoured by the legal
profession. In a copyright case some years ago he reserved judgment for many
months. Both parties became agitated at the long silence. They complained to
the judge, through his clerk. In desperation the clerk, late one Friday,
arranged to have the case put into the Daily Cause List (which lists cases
due for hearing), for judgment to be delivered first thing on the Monday
morning. Faced with the announcement of the pending judgment, the judge
hurriedly concocted it over the weekend. Judgment was duly delivered, to
everyone's astonishment.
The deputy bailiff of Jersey was given a number of warnings to speed up his
delivery of judgments, failing which he would have to be dismissed. The Home
Secretary, on behalf of the Crown, had ultimately no alternative.
Constitutional propriety was fully observed.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Monday Interview: Venerable enemy of dogma - Teddy Kollek,
mayor of Jerusalem, speaks to Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1967, during the Six Day War, Teddy Kollek had to dodge artillery
bombardments to visit anxious citizens. Then, as now, the mayor of
Jerusalem, Kollek says he had little time to take in the momentous
consequences of the unfolding battles of the war, which began and ended with
such dazzling speed 25 years ago next month.
It did not take long, though, for the euphoria of victory to infect Kollek
and sweep the country. The war opened early on Monday June 6, when Israeli
jets devastated the Egyptian air force in a series of lightning strikes. By
the following Sunday, Israel had completed its stunning reply to months of
threatening Arab rhetoric and actions by capturing the Sinai peninsula and
the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank
and east Jerusalem from the Jordanians.
A quarter of a century, six prime ministers and three wars later - more than
half the life of the modern state of Israel has passed since - Israel still
holds all but the Sinai. But the heady assurance of 1967 has long since
dissipated. The expected peace never came. Instead, there was a bitter
internal debate about whether to cede more 'land for peace', or hold on
stubbornly to all the remaining territories in the face of Arab hostility
and international condemnation.
The debate goes on unresolved and unabated, the focus of the campaign for
the June 23 general election between the ruling Likud party, which would
give no ground, and the opposition Labour party which advocates compromise.
But it is by now a weary, over-rehearsed argument. As the anniversary
celebrations of the 1967 victory get under way, Teddy Kollek confesses that
the desire for a simpler solution sometimes flashes through the mind of even
a 'dove' like himself.
'You see, sometimes you think: 'Wouldn't it be a good idea to have another
war to show them that they can't stand up to us.' You remember suddenly how
in 1967 on every Arab house there was a white flag . . . Why not bring this
back? You have to catch yourself and realise that this is a silly idea.'
Now approaching his 81st birthday, Teddy Kollek is a venerable figure in
Israeli public life. First elected mayor of the Jewish half of the
then-divided city in 1965, he has outlasted many governments. He has
signalled that he will step down at the end of his current term in 1994. But
for the time being, he is the last senior public figure of the old Labour
ruling establishment still in office, tilting angrily at the dogmatic
policies of the Likud and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Teddy, as all Israelis chummily call him, is now so identified with
Jerusalem that it is easy to overlook his previous roles at the heart of
Israel's creation and development. An enthusiastic young Zionist in Vienna,
where he was brought up, he emigrated to British mandated Palestine in the
1930s, where he became a Kibbutznik farmer on the shores of the Sea of
Galilee. During the Second World War, he was an agent in Istanbul, receiving
some of the first chilling intelligence about the Holocaust from contacts in
Nazi Europe.
He went on to head an illegal arms procurement operation in New York for the
Zionist pioneers, sited over the Copacabana nightclub. In the 1950s, he
headed the office of Prime Minister David Ben Gurion.
Ben Gurion, the driving force of Israel's early years, was a towering figure
to Kollek. The mayor tells a story to make a timely point about his abiding
influence. A few days after the 1967 war, by which time he had retired, Ben
Gurion visited the newly-recaptured western, or Wailing Wall, the holiest
Jewish shrine in the Old City. At Kollek's apartment later, many guests were
proclaiming that the Arabs would now surely capitulate to Israel.
'But Ben Gurion said immediately: 'The Arabs will not make peace. They are a
proud nation. We cannot give them back Jerusalem. This is the history of the
Jewish people. But everything else - or practically everything else - we
should give back as quickly as possible.' Well, he didn't convince anybody.'
Kollek regrets that few were listening. He has remained loyal to the Ben
Gurion line throughout the past 25 years. 'We should hold on to what is
absolutely necessary for our security and this is much less than we talk
about. I'm for giving up land because I don't want to rule 1.7m Arabs. Not
to rule this multitude is an advantage for us, not a disadvantage. We may do
the Arabs a favour as well. There is no harm in that.'
But what about Jerusalem itself, the tortured heart of the Arab-Israeli
conflict? Here, perhaps, is Kollek's 'blind spot'. Unquestionably, through
his personality and extraordinary range of international contacts, he has
overseen a great wave of development since the wall fell in June 1967 and
Israel annexed the east side. 'It is a better city now,' he insists.
He has done much for the development of facilities for the city's 150,000
Arabs. He has tried - in vain - to persuade them to join the city council.
Their votes have helped him stay in office. He has fought bitterly against
provocative moves by Likud leaders to settle Jews in Arab areas of the Old
City.
Kollek is prepared to devolve more administrative power in the city to Arab
'boroughs'. But he will not countenance any compromise of Israel's claim to
exclusive sovereignty over all Jerusalem, something very few in the
international community have ever recognised, the Palestinians utterly
reject and which has helped make the issue of the city a huge obstacle on
the path to peace.
In Jerusalem, Kollek speaks of the Arabs, who are heavily outnumbered by the
city's 350,000 Jews, as a 'minority', denying that they are any longer part
of the West Bank, and, by implication, part of a Palestinian people who
would make up a Palestinian state. He can therefore say, contrary to
conventional wisdom, that Jerusalem need not be a great stumbling block to
peace.
But Kollek's conviction that Israeli control of Jerusalem must never be
shaken is perfectly in step with the thinking of the vast majority of
Israelis. It is not seen by them as any kind of paradox with his views on
what to do about the other occupied territories.
'What is happening now is against all our interests,' he says of the
policies of Mr Shamir's government. 'The Jewish settlement activity of today
(in the West Bank and Gaza) is not directed by the priority of how to settle
immigrant Russians and Ethiopians and how to provide work for them. The
first consideration is how to fulfil God's promise to Abraham. If we try to
carry out that promise we will fail and we will fail in our desire to make
peace.'
Likud politicians are inclined to proclaim that the threat to Israel's
existence is still a real one when they argue for holding on to the occupied
lands. Kollek says there is still much genuine insecurity among Israelis as
a result of the Holocaust experience. But he emphatically dismisses the
notion that Israel could yet be wiped out. 'Not at all, not at all. But we
shall still have very difficult times. I'm not certain that we shan't have
another war.'
He clearly believes the chances of that will be increased if Likud wins the
election. He tells a cautionary tale about the Maronite Christians of
Lebanon.
'I have a story, which you may know, the story of the Lebanon. Here you had
a small Christian enclave and then along came the French. This Christian
enclave felt superior to the Arabs and with the French they created Grand
Liban, including the Druze and the Sunnis and the Shias and everybody. It
was something exhilarating at the beginning. Here, suddenly, instead of a
small enclave, was an important country which the French supported. And you
saw what the results were. I think it is a lesson for Israel.'

FT  18 MAY 92 / Ford cuts its UK trade deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, Britain's biggest motor vehicle maker, cut its UK balance of trade
deficit last year to Pounds 214m from Pounds 1.297bn in 1990.
Until now Ford refused to disclose details of its UK trade balance after it
moved into heavy deficits in the early 1980s.
It is understood, however, that the deficit ran close to Pounds 1.4bn a year
in 1988 and 1989.
The sharp improvement last year, which was due both to a big fall in imports
because of the recession and to a strong rise in exports, continued in the
early months of 1992.
Ford of Britain believes that its foreign trade deficit was virtually
eliminated in the first quarter.
The US carmaker's UK balance of trade - the difference between the value of
its exports and imports of vehicles, components, parts and accessories - is
an important factor in the UK motor industry's overall foreign trade
performance.
Ford dominates the UK new vehicle market, accounting for 25 per cent of UK
new car sales and nearly 45 per cent of light commercial vehicle sales. It
is also the biggest vehicle maker in the UK ahead of Rover and Vauxhall, the
UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US.
Ford of Britain first moved into deficit in 1981, having been a significant
positive contributor to the UK trade balance.
After its deficit reached Pounds 676m in 1983 and Pounds 501m in 1984, the
company stopped disclosing details of its trade balance in its annual
report, and adopted the defensive policy of only revealing the value of its
exports.
It is understood that the deficit was more than Pounds 1bn a year in each of
the five years from 1986 to 1990 and peaked at Pounds 1.4bn in 1989.
The improvement last year was a key factor behind the sharp contraction in
the overall UK motor industry trade deficit, which fell by 78.3 per cent to
Pounds 1bn from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a record deficit of Pounds 6.6bn in
1989.
Ford of Britain's foreign trade performance deteriorated rapidly from 1988
to 1990, when imports of new vehicles from its continental European plants
rose to meet record UK new vehicles demand. At the same time its UK vehicle
output was hampered by serious labour conflicts in 1988 and 1990.
The recession depressed the value of Ford of Britain's imports by 26.6 per
cent last year to Pounds 2.48bn from Pounds 3.38bn in 1990. Its UK new car
sales fell by 23.9 per cent to 385,944 from 507,260 a year earlier.
The value of its exports rose to Pounds 2.27bn last year from Pounds 2.08bn
in 1990.
The underlying improvement in exports was in fact much greater, as the 1990
total included exports by Ford's UK tractor operations, which have since
been sold to Fiat, the Italian automotive group. Excluding the tractor
business, the value of Ford's UK exports of cars, commercial vehicles and
components rose by around 40 per cent last year from Pounds 1.6bn in 1990.
The most significant factor was rising foreign sales of its Fiesta small
car, where exports accounted for more than 50 per cent of last year's output
of 223,000.
Ford's export performance was helped by a sharp improvement in industrial
relations. The company said it recorded the lowest number of industrial
disputes at its UK plants in 1991.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Weary leader may never see his dream come true: Julian
Ozanne finds Col Gadaffi seeking how to end United Nations sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA'S tug-of-war with the United Nations over the fate of two Libyans
charged with organising the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie
in Scotland has left its mark on Colonel Muammer Gadaffi.
The Libyan leader, looking more like a defeated boxer than the passionate
revolutionary, told the Financial Times at the weekend that he expected UN
sanctions against Libya to be lifted following the regime's 'categorical'
renunciation of international terrorism and its acceptance of a UN
resolution.
He spoke inside a Bedouin-style tent covered with Persian carpets at a farm
10km from Tripoli.
Female bodyguards with holstered pistols strapped to their belts lay on the
ground in front of a huge mobile home. A lone anti-aircraft gun, mounted on
the back of a Toyota land cruiser, was visible in the distance.
The Libyan leader said that both men were ready to stand trial anywhere in
the world but feared whether they would get a fair hearing. Preparing what
western diplomats in Tripoli believe is a face-saving way out of the
stalemate between Libya and the UN, Col Gadaffi said: 'This is not my
personal problem or the problem of the Libyan state. It is a problem which
concerns the two men and their lawyers.'
He said that Libya's acceptance of UN Resolution 731 to cut all links with
terrorist groups and invite UN monitors to confirm that his regime was no
longer training terrorists meant that 'anyone who has ever been involved in
terrorism should be thrown out of Libya.
'There is no justification for a confrontation between Libya and the US and
Britain and no justification for sanctions because the Libyan people are not
guilty,' he said.
He said the two Libyan suspects' confidence in American and British justice
has been shaken by the verdict in the Los Angeles police case and the recent
reversal in Britain of Ms Judith Ward's conviction for terrorism, which he
described as an 'historical scandal'.
Col Gadaffi, dressed in a dark brown jerd - a traditional Libyan lamb's wool
blanket - draped over his shoulder, said the aviation sanctions imposed by
the UN had caused much suffering, particularly to those who needed to travel
abroad for medical treatment.
He said he feared that forthcoming US presidential elections, which he
compared to a fabled beast which needs to be offered sacrifices every four
years, would influence how the west acted towards Libya.
Throughout the interview Col Gadaffi spoke softly in Arabic. At times he
appeared disoriented and occasionally he rested his head in his elbow.
He insisted that his personal renunciation of terrorism was genuine. 'You
cannot spread ideals by force or they won't be ideals any more. You can only
spread ideals by convincing people,' he said.
He also appeared to show a new-found respect for the UN. 'I am happy that
everybody is refering to the UN to solve international disputes like the Pan
Am case,' he said.
Reflecting on his 23 years in power, the colonel said his greatest
achievement had been the establishment of the people's authority and his
green book of philosophy, blending pan-arabism, nationalism, socialism and
Islam with prophecy. The worst failure, he said, was that he had not been
'able to change the world. But, he added, 'it is going to change. We only
regret that we may not be here to see it, but it will change to our ideas.'

FT  18 MAY 92 / Germany expected to pull out of European fighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is expected to announce at the end of this month a recommendation to
pull out of the multi-national European Fighter Aircraft project.
The government decision would put great pressure on Britain, Italy and Spain
 -the remaining partners - to abandon the project. They nevertheless insist
they intend to go ahead.
Withdrawal by Germany would force Britain, as the other principal partner,
to carry out an urgent review of the cost implications of going ahead with a
smaller partnership and smaller guaranteed production.
In anticipation of such a move, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence
secretary, has begun contingency work to evaluate savings that could result
from concentrating production at fewer assembly plants.
Officially, no final decision has yet been taken by the German government
over the controversial fighter, whose first prototype is due to fly this
autumn.
A six-member working group drawn from the three parties in the ruling
coalition - Christian Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and
the Free Democrats (FDP) - is supposed to produce a report on the EFA by
June 1.
Mr Volker Ruhe, newly appointed defence minister, is expected to deliver his
recommendation at the same time. Several apparently well-sourced reports in
Germany insist his decision will be negative.
However, the ultimate decision on a new generation of fighter aircraft
beyond 2000 remains unclear. Reports suggest that the EFA, or Jager 90 - as
it is known in Germany - could very well still be bought when a final
decision is taken in 1998.
Welt am Sonntag reported yesterday that General Jorg Schonbohm, the defence
ministry official in charge of arms procurement, will fly to London, Rome
and Madrid in the next days to discuss possible compensation payable by
Germany.
A decision to quit the project would be politically popular in Germany as a
sign of the government's willingness to sacrifice prestige projects to help
pay for the costs of unification.
But, the move could also cause severe strains in the coalition, since the
Bavaria-based CSU, the smallest partner, is strongly committed to going
ahead.
Most of the 10,000 defence industry jobs which would be lost in the event of
a German pullout are concentrated in Bavaria. Munich-based Deutsche
Aerospace is the main German contractor, through its subsidiaries
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm and Motoren- und Turbinen-Union.
The irony is that the savings resulting from cancellation of Germany's
participation are likely to be modest, particularly in the next
'pre-production' phase. Germany is already committed to paying its full
share of development costs, continuing into 1993. The big savings would come
only towards the turn of the century, when the Luftwaffe will anyway need a
new aircraft, whether German-built or bought off-the-shelf.

So who should the UK premier pick? The experience of other countries shows
there's nothing to be lost by playing safe. The Treasury favours Eddie
George, the current deputy governor. Sir David Walker has his fanciers.
Conventional City wisdom is that Warburg's Sir David Scholey would be ideal.
But surely Major ought to look more widely. In the US, someone like the
London School of Economics' Professor Charles Goodhart might be a contender.
Then again how about an industrialist like Courtaulds' Sir Christopher
Hogg?. Not only is he a Bank director but, as chairman of Reuters, he knows
a thing or two about financial markets.
Observer's tip, however, is Bruce Pattullo. One of Britain's best bankers,
he's a leading light at the Bank of Wales besides being Governor of the Bank
of Scotland.
At 25-1 against, Ladbrokes' current odds for him might well be worth taking.

By contrast, there is never any debate about where the next Governor of the
Bank of Japan will come from. The governorship alternates between an
internal BoJ appointee and a man from the ministry of finance. Current
holder Yasushi Mieno is a BoJ man and, even though he is highly regarded,
there is no likelihood of his grooming one of his underlings as his
successor.
Tradition dictates that it is the finance ministry's turn for the job, and
already the runners are mustering. An international reputation counts far
less than an administrative background and appropriate seniority.
Accordingly, the next boss of the BoJ is likely to be one of: Yoshiro
Yoshino, 61, president of the People's Finance Corporation, an MoF quango;
Akira Nishigaki, 62, president of the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund;
and Sadaaki Hirasawa, 60, a special adviser to an MoF think-tank.
True, it isn't an inspired way of choosing a central bank chief. But one
can't quibble about the BoJ's house-keeping.

Then again, while the Germans and French are even less daring than the Brits
in picking central bankers, they haven't done too badly. Jacques de
Larosiere, ex-boss of the IMF and now Governor of the Banque de France, is
an old finance ministry hand as are his two predecessors, Michel Camdessus
and Renaud de la Geniere.
Similarly, there have been only five presidents of the Bundesbank and they
have generally worked their way up through the system. The present incumbent
Helmut Schlesinger is a central bank veteran whose 40 years' service began
when the institution even had a different name. Likewise, Otmar Emminger had
been vice-president throughout Karl Klasen's term.
Hans Tietmeyer, who arrived in 1990 from the finance ministry, may
eventually get the top job. But those who tipped him to succeed Karl Otto
Pohl last time under-
estimated the length of apprenticeship required at the Bundesbank. Even Karl
Klasen, a Deutsche Bank veteran, had also done a stint as president of the
Hamburg regional central bank.

Americans don't have the same sort of hang-ups about choosing their chairmen
of the Federal Reserve. Indeed it is hard to imagine the circumstances in
which a Rockefeller, or the boss of J P Morgan or Goldman Sachs, for
example, would be regarded as in the running to head the US central bank.
Americans are worried by concentrations of financial fire-power and bend
over backwards to avoid conflicts of interest. Hence professional bankers,
like the UK's Sir David Scholey, are ruled out.
Instead, Fed chairmen tend to come from a much wider background. They know
their way around Washington, and have often made their name as academics.
William McChesney Martin, by far the longest serving Fed chairman, first
made his mark as head of the New York Stock Exchange. Arthur Burns was
president of the Council of Economic Advisers before Nixon tapped him for
the Fed. Paul Volcker worked at Chase Manhattan before moving into the US
Treasury. Today's chairman Alan Greenspan is another economist who headed
the CEA.
Even so, the system of choosing Fed chairmen is far from foolproof. Jimmy
Carter, for instance. made a mistake when he picked Bill Miller, the chief
executive of Textron. Miller only lasted 17 months and was shunted over to
be US treasury secretary in 1979 after he failed to stop US inflation taking
off.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Place your bets, please, on the next Governor of the Bank of England.
Ladbrokes has already opened a book on who will replace Robin
Leigh-Pemberton who will step down a year or so from now.
Alas it's hard to imagine a duller set of probables. So in the hope of
making it a sporting contest, Observer suggests a wager on a few outsiders.
One leading question is whether Premier Major will dare to break tradition.
Hitherto, with one or two exceptions, the governor has been chosen from one
of the City's patrician merchant banks.
If the prime minister really is intent on shaking up Britain's class-ridden
society, the governorship would make an ideal start. This time John Major
could demonstrate that the City's old boy net is no longer the key to the
succession. Why can't an academic, an industrialist, or a politician, for
example, be thought up to husbanding the Old Lady?
Admittedly, the current governor was a rather daring choice. Whereas Labour
cabinets have played safe and often appointed career central bankers as
governor, Margaret Thatcher's selection of Leigh-Pemberton was seen as an
overtly political move. However, the choice was equally unusual in that it
also broke the unwritten law that commercial bankers were not even made Bank
of England directors, let alone the governor.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Restructure of private health care overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the soaring cost of healthcare ('Losing patience with
private medicine', May 11) covers the actions of insurers and corporate
customers but leaves aside consideration of the overdue need for a
fundamental restructuring of the private sector. At least two areas merit
review.
Private hospitals continue to rely upon consultants who are both part-time
and effectively self-employed in the sector, having no contractual
relationship with any hospital.
This leads to obvious inefficiencies and perpetuates consultants' ability to
charge many times more than they accept from the NHS for identical work.
This state of affairs may well have been reasonable when the private sector
was small and subject to political vulnerability but can no longer be so
justified. Hospitals should take consultants on to their payroll.
The second area is the standard mode of reimbursement to hospitals by the
medical insurers - which continues to relate mainly to the in-patient 'per
diem' mentality and hence rewards longevity of occupation of the hospital
bed.
A change to some form of pre-determined price for a full episode of
treatment - incorporating the consultants' costs - would encourage the more
rapid embracing of short-stay technologies by creating the incentive for
hospitals to seek efficiency gains more readily.
Changes in both areas would lead to gains for the patient/customer not only
from the resultant direct efficiencies but also through increased
transparency, and hence comparability, of medical charging practices -
currently a perplexing subject indeed.
Although the measures covered in your article will help abate the increases
in healthcare insurance premiums, substantial inroads into the underlying
cost structure await a radical restructuring of the sort now common in most
industrial sectors - and, ironically, in the NHS - but from which the
private health sector has been curiously immune.

Sir, John Willman's article on local government ('Lifting the lid on a
Pandora's box', May 14) was most interesting. However, I would like to draw
attention to one point.
He refers to the Conservative party's 'third position in Scottish politics'.
In the recent general election the Conservatives won the second largest
number of seats in Scotland and also took the second largest share of the
vote in Scotland. That was also the case in the 1987 general election.
The Conservative party is therefore clearly in second place in Scottish
politics.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Unemployment revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MASS UNEMPLOYMENT is a scar across the face of the developed world. It
results from a wound repeatedly inflicted by decades of neglect during which
the skills, education and opportunities of a significant minority within
almost every industrialised country have atrophied. But the wound has not
properly healed; as with all open and ugly wounds, the risks of infection
are great.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, whose ministers
meet today to discuss the subject, has recognised the threat to social
cohesion and stability from persistently high joblessness and the associated
rise in poverty and crime.
Yet it is questionable whether the developed countries have in recent years
satisfactorily diagnosed this growing problem, let alone devised a cure. The
prominence that the OECD gives to measures of unemployment based on people
who are both out of work and actively seeking work has predisposed it
towards US models for dealing with unemployment, even though America has had
fewer prime-age men in jobs than in any other important OECD country in the
last 20 years.
The purist economist may be content to know that the US does not have armies
of job-hungry unemployed workers searching inefficiently for jobs; but the
average US citizen would probably be more interested to know what the people
who are neither employed nor unemployed are doing. The fact that so many
American men have no jobs, and that large numbers of them are instead
turning to illegal sources of income, is what matters for policy.
Technological advances
Once identified, the disease is not easily cured. Over the past two decades
the demand for unskilled labour has declined across the OECD, in the face of
technological advances and fierce competition from the developing world. The
real wages at which companies would be prepared to employ the unskilled and
the uneducated have plummeted.
In the US, where the minimum wage is low and unemployment benefits are
sparse, this has meant a fall in actual wages too. For many US men, though
not for women, the alternative sources of income available outside the
system mean that the available jobs are just not worthwhile. European
governments have intervened more actively to prevent wages from falling, but
the underlying economic forces are the same. Companies do not want to hire
at these real wages and slow employment growth and open unemployment has
been the result.
Small government
The OECD's support for restricted unemployment benefits, deregulated labour
markets and small government are all part of its taste for the American
approach. On economic efficiency grounds this may be right, though the US
record on productivity growth does not make the case. But there is no reason
to believe that cutting the benefits and wages of European men would make
them more willing to take low paying jobs than US men.
Sweden is the only high employment and low unemployment country in the
western developed world; but it has not solved the problem, merely concealed
it a greater expense than electorates elsewhere have been willing to pay.
The OECD has, in fact, advised Sweden to cut the size of its public sector,
while praising Sweden's programmes of 'active' measures to help the
unemployed to re-train and find jobs. Yet Sweden has found jobs for the
potential unemployed in the public sector, at wages the private sector would
not be willing to pay and at a cost that the Swedish electorate is now
unwilling to meet.
Effective policy is bound, to some extent, to be an amalgam of all these
approaches. But even under a policy which combined Swedish willingness to
provide the unemployed and the young with marketable skills through better
education and training with an American emphasis upon creating jobs in the
private sector, an uncomfortably large number of people will remain
chronically without work. In developed economies, this group will always
attract subsidy, either through the benefits system or some other means. It
is better in principle to subsidise people to work and to gain marketable
skills, whether in the public or private sector, than to provide incentives
for them to seek illegal alternatives to work.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Base rate policy - suck it and see
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the shock of German unification not only jeopardise further progress
towards monetary union but put in jeopardy the progress already made in the
ERM? The main worry that market-inclined economists have had about fixed
exchange rates or a single currency is the loss of a useful safety valve in
the face of what they call 'real shocks'. In fact, there have been hardly
any such shocks confined to a single member country, and the shock of German
unification is the first clear-cut example.
The problem as usually stated is that because the German government has not
financed more of the costs of unification from taxation, the Bundesbank has
had to double interest rates in the past three or four years to contain
inflation. This has led to a level of real interest rates supposedly quite
unsuitable for other EC members.
What then are the alternative courses for countries saddled with a high
German-induced level of real interest rates? I shall talk about the
alternatives facing the UK, but much of the discussion applies to France and
others.
1) Leave the ERM and surprise the financial markets. The advocates of this
course are mostly those who never wanted to join in the first place - with
the addition of a few fainthearts and weathercocks.
2) Stay in the ERM, and devalue. This is put forward as a less provocative
alternative. But it is not in fact available. Of course a realignment would
be technically possible - but UK interest rates would be higher, not lower,
afterwards. For the risk premium over German interest rates - now almost
eliminated - would widen out again.
3) Yet another course would be to make more use of small realignments. A
problem with taking this route now is that it is not even clear in which
direction any realignment should go. If the expected trend were for the
D-Mark to rise, other countries would need to have still higher interest
rates than they have today. Such a shift would only be helpful if Germany
failed so badly to contain the inflationary effects of unification that the
D-Mark was expected to fall against other currencies. This would be over the
dead body of the Bundesbank.
So much for the backward-looking choices. For those who accept the progress
made towards fixed exchange rates, there are other courses.
4) The simplest is to grit our teeth and bear it for as long as it takes
until German interest rates pass their peak and the Bundesbank decides that
they can safely come down. We simply do not know whether present British
real interest rates are compatible with recovery or not. During the long
upswing of the mid-1980s real base rates (adjusted by the RPI excluding
mortgage interest) hovered around 5 per cent to 7 per cent, compared with 4
per cent to 4 1/2 per cent now.
5) Make much more use of the room for manoeuvre provided by the margins
around the central parity. This course has been made less likely by the
decision of the Treasury and Bank of England to let the return of confidence
after the election take sterling up to near its central DM2.95 parity. But
the chance may return; and there is still some room before the upper end of
the band is reached.
International movements of funds are of course influenced by interest rate
differentials combined with expected exchange rate changes. Anatole Kaletsky
of The Times has provided a useful chart showing that if sterling were at
DM2.885, the lower boundary of the narrow band, and were expected to reach
the central parity in a year's time, base rates could be just above 7 per
cent instead of 10 per cent. On the more extreme assumption that sterling
went to the bottom of the existing wide band against the D-Mark, base rates
could fall to below 4 per cent.
Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs has poured cold water on this analysis by
saying that currencies which are low in their band against the D-Mark are
seen in the market as a devaluation risk, and that the interest rate premium
then has to be higher, not lower.
Market sentiment could change. But in any case making use of the margins can
only buy time. For once sterling has risen to its central point or its upper
limit, depending on how policy operates, there would be nothing more to go
for by holders of the pound. To maintain base rates below Germany's for any
length of time, markets would have to see at least a possibility of an
upward realignment of sterling.
5) A more ambitious variant would be for sterling or the French franc to try
to take over the anchor role from the D-Mark. Advocates of wrenching the
anchor from Germany vary in their sincerity. Some Europhobes are obviously
thinking: 'Take advantage of Germany's weakness to set interest rates below
German ones now; and having regained the habit of setting our own interest
rates, leave the ERM when the time is ripe. But not say anything to John
Major about it at the moment, if you want to stay a junior minister.'
Questions of sincerity apart, becoming an anchor is not entirely a bed of
roses - the Bundesbank never wanted that role for the D-Mark. But the way to
achieve it, if desired, is through tighter rather than looser monetary
policies than are currently expected. In other words, keep real interest
rates high in the hope of killing inflation and reduce nominal interest
rates later.
A little cold water needs to be thrown on the idea that British inflation
rates have fallen behind Germany's. We must allow for the distorting effects
of German VAT increases and the timing of British mortgage rate cuts. If we
do so the underlying German increase in consumer prices is 3 1/2 per cent to
4 per cent, comfortably below the British underlying rate of 5 1/2 per cent.
Fortunately the range of choice is not in practice as bewilderingly large as
the number of theoretical courses. If we leave aside the catastrophist
options of devaluation or leaving the ERM, all the others point in the same
operational direction. That is to say, stay in the ERM at the present
parity, but make as much use as possible domestically of the room for
manoeuvre provided both by the margins and the new post-election credibility
of the British government.
To succeed in this course there are two policy requirements. The first is to
keep the 6 per cent margin for as long as possible, which means until the
formal start of Stage Two in 1994. The British government's original reason
for wanting to move to narrower margins earlier - to reduce the downside
risk on sterling - in now obsolete. Second, the government and the Bank of
the England should be much less fearful, with the election out of the way,
of making interest rate cuts they may have to reverse.
Interest rates are a price. Like all prices they need to move in both
directions without loss of prestige. The only way to find out whether
British interest rates can indeed move below German ones is to suck it and
see at a time when there is a domestic case for going lower. The French
government did not get away with such a manoeuvre last year, but the British
government might in 1992. If moving interest rates by  1/4 per cent at a
time would help two-way movement, so be it.
The root of many of the problems supposed to surround the ERM - and it is
the theme of Europhobic economic utterances - is that Germany will need much
higher real interest rates than the rest of the world for the foreseeable
future, and it is thus a folly for us to link our currencies to the D-Mark.
This begs the question of how Germany can maintain much higher real interest
rates than, for instance, the US in a world of free capital movements? There
is only one way: for the dollar to undershoot so far against the D-Mark that
a correction is expected. That is, the market must expect the dollar to rise
and the D-Mark to fall. In that way a lower return on American financial
assets would be offset by an expected dollar appreciation.
Something of this kind is indeed consistent with the pattern of short-term
interest rates and forward quotations. But if you look at, say, 10-year
bonds, you find a completely different picture. American yields are only
just over  1/2 a per cent below German yields, thus suggesting a long-term
expectation of convergence of nominal interest rates in the two countries.
If the market is anywhere near right then the present high level of German
short-term interest rates is an aberration and/or US interest rates are
abnormally low; and in any case the two will converge over the next few
years.
How does this observation fit in with German difficulties over unification?
No problem, once you strip away the veil of money and look at underlying
realities. Capital is internationally mobile. Its price, to which real
interest rates are an approximation, tends to equality in advanced market
economies.
The less mobile factor of production is labour. Because of the addition of
the east German working population which did not bring with it a
corresponding increase in the amount of usable capital or knowhow, German
real wages need to fall. More precisely, unskilled wages need to fall and
parity between east and west German wages needs to be postponed until the
next century; while wages of key workers with the skills required for
reconstruction in the east should rise. Such changes are difficult to
implement in an economy with powerful unions and national pay deals.
But the resulting tensions will not necessarily produce more inflation,
apart from the present hiccup. The strain is more likely to be taken by
unemployment, open or hidden. Once this begins to damp down wage push - and
this always happens - German interest rates will come down to a more
acceptable level. Thus the German economy may become less and less a model
for the rest of Europe, but may still provide it with the public good of low
inflation.
It would not be surprising if German enthusiasm both for political union and
the single currency cooled further. During this period the task will be to
hold together the ERM and to build up the European Monetary Institute which
will try to co-ordinate European monetary policies during Stage Two of the
move to monetary union.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Development and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Development Report from the World Bank has a stark message:
poverty is increasing. Among its symptoms are the rising number of people
drinking contaminated water or huddled in smoke-filled rooms, and the deaths
attributable to water-borne disease and land over-use.
The report proposes urgent policies to deal with these problems, starting in
many cases with better education for women, whom the bank sees playing a
crucial role in reducing the numbers of people born into poverty.
However the timing of today's report, less than three weeks before the
opening of the Earth Summit in Rio, as well as its title 'Development and
the Environment' are a reminder of how the debate about poverty and its
remedies has shifted in recent years. The two issues, once quite separate,
have become closely interwoven.
As it happens, many of the Third World countries' most serious environmental
problems of land degradation, growing deserts and deforestation can be
traced directly to their primitive level of development: the state of their
economies gives the people no choice but to destroy their natural endowments
to survive. As a result they slip into a downward spiral in which they waste
ever more resources as they get poorer.
Useful focus
The World Bank's report thus provides a useful focus on a major aspect of
the environmental debate at a time when the developed world's mind is too
easily fixed on more fashionable pollution issues, such as greenhouse gases
and the ozone layer.
As the report remarks, 'for the 1bn people in developing countries who do
not have access to clean water or the 1.7bn who lack access to sanitation,
these are the most important environmental problems of all.' Again, in the
second half of the 1980s 1.3bn people living in urban areas were threatened
by respiratory disorders caused by airborne particles. Similarly, soil
depletion may be causing annual income losses in some countries equal, says
the Bank, to 0.5-1.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
These are serious environmental problems. Fortunately, their solution does
not require a global compact; it requires, first, more development and,
second, that those responsible for economic expansion are forced to take
account of the environmental consequences of their actions. Those who doubt
whether policies that improve economic efficiency will also improve the
environment need look only at the polluted landscapes of eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union, which are a monument to distorted energy prices and
industrial protection. By contrast, industrial countries have solved most of
the problems that worry the developing countries. For poor countries,
development is the heart of the solution.
International co-operation
It is not so everywhere, above all not for the main international
environmental issues, on which the Rio conference should focus: global
warming and protection of biodiversity. Here economic development is the
problem, not the solution. The answer rests in international co-operation.
But developing countries feel, quite understandably, that they are expected
to pay for solutions to problems they did not cause.
It is important the Rio Summit not be side-tracked into a long and probably
futile argument about backwardness and aid. This would inflame the
north-south confrontation, which has already obstructed many of the
preparatory meetings and scuppered some of the agreements which should have
been signed at Rio.
None the less, the Rio agenda cannot avoid questions of equity. What is at
stake is the right to exploit such globally scarce resources as an
atmosphere low in carbon dioxide. The World Development Report shows that
the total output of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption and cement
manufacture in the industrial countries is far greater than in developing
countries. If the rich want the threat of global warming removed they will
have to bear the cost, because it is they who are benefiting most from what
is causing the danger. That is the heart of the matter. It cannot be evaded.

FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Revolutionary idea from Mars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim O'Neill, head of global capital markets research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, has lured S G Warburg's European economist David Mars to beef
up the European equity research operation in London.
O'Neill, who is less than complimentary about how research is organised at
other houses, has had the 'quite revolutionary' idea of integrating bond and
equity research in one group, thereby maximising cross-fertilisation of
ideas and minimising in-house fights.
Mars himself may know something about the latter, as his territory appeared
to overlap considerably with Warburg's international economist George
Magnus.
SBC, while well-respected for its foreign exchange and bond, particularly
Ecu, coverage, has some catching up to do on the equity side. But O'Neill at
least had the satisfaction of generating surprise at the Warburgs stable
with his latest appointment.
Mars, 44, joins as a director and head of European equity research in
London. Before his five-year stint at Warburgs, he spent some years with the
Commission in Brussels, and earlier at the Treasury.
*****
Stephen LeBeau, one of the rising stars of the British machine tool
industry, has joined 600 Group as product strategy and marketing director
for its recently formed lathe division.
The appointment is important for 600 Group, which makes and imports machine
tools and materials handling equipment. Earlier this year it closed its
lathe factory at Colchester and concentrated production at its Harrison
plant in West Yorkshire.
The move has made it vital for the company to develop a detailed product
strategy for the Colchester and Harrison lathes, which will continue to be
sold separately. This will be LeBeau's task in a post tailor-made for him,
one of the few men in the industry to hold a PhD in machine tool product
strategy.
Until the end of March, he was UK sales director at Yamazaki Machinery, but
parted company from the Japanese group after only 15 months for reasons
which were never made clear.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Management: How to figure out the end of recession - Some
alternative statistical sources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 64,000 dollar question for most British companies is whether the country
is finally emerging from recession.
The problem is how to go about finding an answer. The evidence is ambiguous
and most published economic indicators are weeks, if not months, out of
date. If you want to be a step ahead, you should consider alternative
sources of information, some of which can be obtained on a weekly basis.
Here are the indicators to watch.
Official data
The government's Central Statistical Office provides monthly data about such
things as retail sales, exports and imports and consumer credit.
The information is normally reliable and reasonably accurate, but refers to
economic events up to two months in the past.
Unofficial data
The weekly data from unofficial sources are less comprehensive and may not
correct for seasonal distortions. But provided you treat the figures with
caution, they should give you useful clues.
Treasury officials lean heavily on such data: every Friday, Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, is given a report detailing what has happened in the economy
over the past fortnight.
Retail sales
A group of 30 of Britain's largest stores - accounting for roughly half the
total turnover of the retail sector - collaborate on a computerised project
which adds up their revenues every week. Every Tuesday, the companies know
the sales totals for the group as a whole in the previous week (the revenues
for specific companies are not identified). The data in recent weeks show
that there has been little economic uplift since the April 9 general
election.
Over the next few weeks they should provide clues to trends in consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the Pounds 600bn a year UK
economy and will be a vital factor behind any recovery. The weekly data are
not publicly released, but if you know someone in one of the stores
involved, there is a good chance you can get the information.
Clothing and footwear
Six companies - House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer, Storehouse, Burton,
Sears and John Lewis - organise a variant on the above for their particular
sector. Though only a small part of retailing (a tenth of sales in the
sector), weekly data represent a useful snapshot. The statistics are
produced by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, and go routinely to the
Treasury. Among the specific companies, John Lewis publishes its weekly
sales figures on a weekly basis - a useful public service. M and S does not
publish its figures but sends an index of its sales every month to the
Treasury.
Bank and building society lending
A group of 90 large banks gives information every week to the Bank of
England about its lending patterns. The collated data related to the
previous week are normally available every Wednesday.
Much the same happens for building society lending, with the figures being
collected by the Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog.
As with retail sales, only the monthly figures are available to the public -
well out of date.
If you want to find out about the weekly data, take out for lunch a top
banker or building society chief and state your case. The Treasury gets the
statistics every week.
Housing sales
The big building societies, which have their own chains of estate agents,
conduct their own weekly surveys to assess the strength of housing turnover.
At least one of these groups provides the Treasury with the information.
Assessing the nationwide pattern on a weekly basis is extremely difficult.
But the data from the individual businesses will almost certainly be a help.
Air transport
British Airways and BAA produce their own monthly data on UK passenger
traffic and aircraft movements.
However, they normally keep much of the most interesting information - such
as the numbers of people using specific routes - to themselves. If you have
a good internal contact, you may be able to get the data on a weekly basis.
Car sales
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has an arrangement with the
government's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency under which it gets data -
transfered via electronic links - about new car registrations, virtually as
they are happening.
This can provide timely clues as to overall economic activity. The SMMT
publishes figures for each month, normally on the fourth working day of the
following month. The statistics for April showed a sharp year-on-year
increase. Why not ask the DVLA for the data on a more timely basis?
Recruitment
MSL, a specialist recruitment consultancy, monitors job advertisements in
newspapers to gauge demand for top managers in industry and public services.
This is considered a reliable guide to future patterns of economic activity.
An index compiled by MSL - which has a good track record - is normally
published once a quarter. MSL may be able to inform you about changes more
regularly.
Trade
Official data about imports and exports are published by the CSO, weeks out
of date. A useful guide to trends - though not conclusive - may be the
figures available every week from P&amp;O, the shipping company, on its cargoes
to and from the UK and continental Europe.
Industry
Time was when sulphuric acid and steel were the main industrial bellwethers.
More important now are semiconductors and plastics packaging. The Electronic
Component Industry Federation publishes monthly figures on semiconductor
production and consumption. (The most recent data show little sign of any
economic lift.) And talk to British Polyethylene Industries, Europe's
biggest producer of plastic sheet. In recent months, sales have been 'flat
on a quarterly basis, but not as bad as a year ago.'

FT  18 MAY 92 / Management: Bosses on the up and up, down under - There is
concern over rises in executive pay in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian bosses seem to be awarding themselves increasingly fat pay rises,
while at the same time expecting blue collar workers to act in the national
interest and accept modest increases.
Peter Cook, federal industrial relations minister, says he is 'concerned' by
forecasts that bosses' pay will rise by 12 per cent this year, when workers,
covered by Australia's centralised wage bargaining system, will receive
increases of 2.5 per cent.
The figures reflect a disparity which has become more noticeable since the
Labor Party began to open the economy to external pressures in the
mid-1980s, ending 80 years of protectionism. This has led to a more
competitive market for senior executives. But while top salaries have been
rising sharply, the government has sought to improve overall industrial
competitiveness and control inflation by holding down average wages.
Workers have been angered by evidence that the increases of their bosses
have not always borne much relation to performance, especially in companies
run by entrepreneurs like Alan Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation
Holdings and Christopher Skase, former head of the Qintex media and leisure
group.
The largest rise in directors' fees in 1990 was for John Spalvins, then
managing director of the Adelaide Steamship group, whose pay rose 56 per
cent to ADollars 1.2m (Pounds 500,000). Adsteam subsequently fired Spalvins
under pressure from its bankers and the company is now being financially
restructured.
While no one is prepared to defend the entrepreneurs, many consultants say
Australian salaries and fees are relatively low by international standards
and suggest that an adjustment was inevitable.
Towers Perrin, the international management consultancy, recently produced a
comparison of executive pay which concluded that Australian salaries were in
the bottom quartile of the 21 countries studied.
The total package for the chief executive of a medium-sized Australian
company was put at Dollars 271,000, (Pounds 150,500) the lowest of any OECD
country surveyed. Equivalent salaries included Dollars 400,000 in the UK,
and Dollars 747,000 in the US.
Matthew Butlin, a senior official of the Business Council of Australia, says
disparities of this kind have been behind the increase in top pay which has
taken place as the economy has opened up.
However, the apparent underpayment of Australians may be misleading. Simple
comparisons fail to take into account the job security traditionally enjoyed
by Australian managers. In addition, many Australian businesses are
subsidiaries of overseas corporations which make important decisions at
parent company level. This means that the responsibilities of Australian
executives are often not comparable to those of managers in
independently-owned companies of similar size.
Nevertheless, the trend in executive rewards is clearly upwards, and there
are few signs that the boom is petering out, although it has been slowed by
18 months of flat or negative economic growth.
The government has set up an inquiry into the issue which will report later
this year. However, early indications are that the inquiry is finding it
difficult to identify ways of forcing executives to share the restraint
being urged on the rest of the community.
From the government's point of view, the best hope is likely to be a greater
linkage between pay and performance and greater scrutiny of top pay by
remuneration committees and non-executive directors. Peter Kent, chairman of
the Australian Shareholders' Association, says such a development would be
strongly supported by small shareholders, few of whom object to high
salaries for executives who produce results.
However, John Egan, a veteran Sydney remuneration consultant, says the
introduction of results-related remuneration is being strongly resisted by
managers who are unaccustomed to the idea of risking part of their income -
or their jobs.
'We have to find a path forward where we are not encouraging greed, but we
are genuinely responding to sustained performance by managers who are also
at risk of losing their jobs if they don't perform. That is not going to be
easy to do,' said Egan.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Lloyd's to look at Names aid plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Lloyd's Council are this week expected to consider a scheme to
help Names - the individuals whose assets provide the Lloyd's capital base -
suffering badly through the insurance market's recent losses.
Lloyd's confirmed yesterday that it had appointed a merchant bank to advise
on the details of any scheme.
It is understood that a council sub-committee will consider a scheme
presented by the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which contains
representatives of groups involved in legal proceedings against Lloyd's
agents.
The working party was formed in April and is headed by Mr Peter Nutting. Its
proposals include:
Limiting the losses of Names to no more than 30 per cent of premium limit -
the amount of premiums a Name can trade - in any one underwriting year. A
fund of Pounds 1.25bn might be needed with half financed by a premium levy.
The scheme would be retrospective to cover losses made since 1987.
A Pounds 1bn loan facility for Names whose losses amount to more than 10 per
cent of their premium limit for 1988 to 1990, which would allow Names to pay
losses from future profits.
An end to litigation within Lloyd's, with all disputes transferred to an
independent and acceptable mediation or arbitration process.
An end to self-regulation.
Modification of the so-called hardship arrangements - the relief provided by
Lloyd's to individual Names as an alternative to bankruptcy.
Measures to deal with difficulties created by agencies that specialised in
placing Names on catastrophe reinsurance or LMX syndicates, which insure
other syndicates against unexpectedly high losses.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Oftel may face power vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWER VACUUM at the top of Oftel is likely for several months at a time
when it has to finalise a new price formula for BT, the telecommunications
group, and a new telephone numbering system.
The telecommunications regulator is expected to face the vacuum after the
departure next month of Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, to
head the Office of Fair Trading. The government has yet to announce a
successor and observers think it unlikely that a replacement can be found so
quickly.
Mr Bill Wigglesworth, Oftel's deputy director-general, is expected to fill
the post in the interim. The possibility of Sir Bryan's running both Oftel
and the OFT is understood to have been rejected by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Mr Wigglesworth has been with Oftel since its establishment in 1984.
Although he is not considered as tough as Sir Bryan, Oftel officials say he
would rise to the challenge.
When Sir Bryan leaves Oftel, the BT price formula and the numbering system
are likely to be the two most important items of unfinished business.
Sir Bryan has yet to reach agreement with BT on a new price formula. Even if
BT agrees, it seems unlikely that all the details could be settled before
the middle of next month. If BT refuses to accept Sir Bryan's plans, he is
thought likely to refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
before he goes to the OFT.
Sir Bryan is also understood to wish to clarify Oftel's plans for a new
national numbering system before he departs. A plan he announced last
September has been held up after objections from the Telecommunications
Managers Association, which represents large users, that it would cost
industry Pounds 3bn.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Clearer finance law urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in the law is needed to clarify the duties of financial firms
towards their customers, according to the head of the Law Society's company
law committee.
Mr Bill Knight, a partner at City law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons, called present
law 'a mess' and said clarification was necessary to ensure that financial
firms knew where they stood in dealings with customers.
He was responding to a Law Commission paper published last week on the
complex legal issues raised by the trend for investment firms to offer a
much wider range of services.
The discrepancies between a firm's common-law duties to its customers and
regulations that govern its activities leave the true legal picture
un-clear, the commission said.
For example, under common law, an insurance broker should disclose all fees
and commissions received for helping a customer choose a life assurance
policy. Under City regulations, those payments are kept secret.
Also under common law, stockbroking firms should not deal in securities on
their own account while simultaneously advising clients whether to buy or
sell the same securities, and also advising the companies that issued the
securities. Such practices are common in the City.
It is unclear what the true legal position is in such cases because the
courts have not been asked to rule on such matters.
The uncertainty has raised fears of a legal minefield on a par with the
local-authority swaps fiasco. In that instance, after a long legal dispute
the House of Lords ruled that UK local authorities were not obliged to pay
out losses on swap transactions to banks. Those deals involved authorities'
exchanging fixed-rate debts for floating-rate ones.
Mr Knight said: 'It's important to have our markets based on concepts which
everyone understands. We are in favour of the minimum possible legislation
to achieve clarity.'
The Law Society would have to analyse the Law Commission's paper in more
detail before it could decide how extensive changes in law needed to be, he
said.
According to the commission, the courts are likely to take City regulations
into account when judging whether a firm has carried out its common-law
duties. However, it called for a simple legal change to make that explicit.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Three groups seek combat radio deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE CONSORTIA have entered bids for a UK combat radio project expected to
be worth between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn.
The project, called Bowman, is to replace British forces' Clansman system at
about the turn of the century. Bidding for the contract, which will pit
British, US and French VHF radio systems against each other, closes today.
Siemens Plessey Defence Systems, a UK subsidiary of the German Siemens
group, yesterday submitted a joint bid with Racal Electronics for a new
family of radios derived from Racal's successful Jaguar system.
Racal won a Pounds 70m Canadian contract for enhanced Jaguar radios last
October.
The two companies produced most of the communications equipment for
Clansman, which has been in service since the late 1970s.
GEC-Marconi, defence arm of the General Electric Company, is competing
jointly with Thomson-CSF of France, offering the new 'fourth generation'
PR4G tactical radios that Thomson is producing for the French Army. Thomson
recently won a Dutch order in competition against the US Sincgars, made by
ITT.
ITT is entering its Sincgars for the UK competition, acting as prime
contractor in a consortium with British Aerospace. Harris of the US is
participating as a sub-contractor.
SEL of Germany, part of the French Alcatel group, was also invited to tender
for the contract last October.
Two of the contenders are expected to be selected next year for a
demonstration phase, with a production contract for the winner of the
run-off awarded probably in 1996.
The Ministry of Defence has insisted on using proven technology in order to
save on development costs.
Production is expected to involve up to 60,000 radio sets, with some items
due in service before the end of the decade. The project is aimed at
providing much greater capacity for secure transmission of data at the same
time as voice communications, and will include ultra-high frequency
ground-to-air radios.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Businesses prepare for a kick to the economy: Members of the
CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce will have one topic uppermost in
mind at their meetings this week: the timing and scale of recovery. Michael
Cassell and Paul Cheeseright went to Leicester to gauge the mood there
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEICESTER finally has something to celebrate and it is not just the
unseasonally warm sunshine. City, the local football club, is just one match
away from a lucrative place in the new premier league.
While the fans pray City's promise is fulfilled, Leicester's economy appears
poised for recovery, although it seems reluctant to get on with it.
Mr Des Cloake, president of Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce, says: 'I
think there are small signs of recovery. It's much to do with attitudes.'
The changing climate, he emphasises, is less noticeable in manufacturing and
more evident in the retail sector.
Surveys for the city council by Nottingham Business School showed that
towards the end of 1991 the local economy stopped deteriorating. Mr Andrew
Ross of the council's economic unit says there is 'cautious optimism' but
this is not yet reflected in a marked increase in investment. He adds: 'We
are certainly not yet out of the recession.'
Business leaders have always believed that Leicester's economy was
sufficiently diversified to provide a cushion against hard times - but those
cushions deflated as the recession became severe.
From December 1990, the rise in unemployment accelerated. At more than 14
per cent, it is back to levels recorded in 1986. Manufacturing jobs have
disappeared and one legacy of the recession will be a hard core of long-term
unemployed.
The city has a population of 300,000 and a broadly based engineering sector.
It is strong in food manufacturing and has a small but developing services
sector. Textile manufacture, which has for long been a staple of the
economy, went into recession as early as 1988. Since then, 170 companies
have gone out of business.
Mr John Harrison, director of the Leicester-based Knitting Industries'
Federation, says his industry is starting to perk up. He adds: 'It's not
unusual that the first into recession should be among the first to come
out.'
The local printing industry also suffered badly, and most companies report
sales volumes down by 25 per cent. The worst is now over, according to Mr
Charles Mathew, managing director of Raithby Lawrence, a colour brochure
printer.
He says: 'Factory prices to us have been cut heavily. Inquiries from
customers are up but although they appear more confident it has not been
reflected in actual sales. I think it will be the autumn or even next spring
before we see a real revival.'
Jones &amp; Shipman, machine tool maker, also believes manufacturing industry is
beginning to revive. The company last week announced more than Pounds
500,000 of new orders and Mr John Wareing, managing director, says an
increase in the number of inquiries signals that manufacturers are
'beginning to inch out of the doldrums'.
Sales at Rackham's, the House of Fraser department store, have been above
expected levels. Mr David Illingworth, the manager, says up-market products
have been selling best. He adds: 'The people with money to spend have been
far more confident since the election.'
At the Grand Hotel in the city centre, Mr John Jarvis, chairman and chief
executive of Jarvis Hotels, says an improvement in business has accelerated
since the election. In particular, companies were resuming using the hotel
for training and management development programmes, which had been cancelled
during the depths of the recession.
Everard Breweries says it is too early to talk of a sustained improvement.
Mr Richard Everard, chairman, says: 'Bar food sales held up during the
eating out more in our restaurants, a sign things are easing up. It would be
nice to say the recession is all over, but we've got some way to go.'
Car dealers report patchy business, with corporate sales flat on their back
but with some revival among private buyers in search of a bargain.
Mr Peter Lowe, finance controller of Central Motors, a large Ford dealer,
says: 'There is, as yet, no real sign of a sustained improvement in demand.
People remain worried about unemployment and want to see further cuts in the
cost of money.'
Although the local construction industry remains in the doldrums, there are
signals of rising interest and confidence in the residential property
market. Mr Roman Toloczko, managing director of the central division of
William H. Brown, estate agents, says: 'There has been a flurry since the
election. I wouldn't say it's a stampede.' The greatest interest is in
properties up to Pounds 50,000, but in Brown's suburban offices, dealing
with more expensive property, there has not been the same activity.
Just as the recession has tested the estate agents, so it has tried the
entrepreneurial skills of Leicester's Asian community, an estimated 30 per
cent of the city's population. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East,
says the thousands of Asian businesses have experienced one of their
roughest trading periods. He adds: 'Many have only survived by moving into
new areas and ensuring every member of the family works very hard to keep
things afloat.'
Mr Chandu Mattani, owner of Sona Rupa, a sari specialist, says business is
still bad, reflecting high unemployment. He adds: 'The base factors for a
revival are in place and there is less pressure on us with interest rates
down.'

FT  18 MAY 92 / Golden angle to northern triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUPER-RICH, inhabiting a little-known golden triangle of rural England,
are helping to alter the traditional image of the down-at-heel north.
Just six months after opening an office in Harrogate, North Yorkshire,
'accountants-to-the-rich' firm of Saffery Champness, is earning fees of
Pounds 1m a year, recruiting extra staff and taking on more office space.
And this is at a time when accountants nationally have been cutting back and
axing staff in the face of the recession.
North Yorkshire's 'golden triangle', which straddles the A1 Great North Road
between York, Wetherby and Harrogate, boasts more super-rich (minimum
qualifications Pounds 20m of net worth) than any other part of the country
outside Belgravia and Mayfair in London.
The triangle's wider claim to fame is that Marston Moor is in its middle. It
was here in 1644 that Cromwell's Ironsides defeated the dashing Prince
Rupert's cavalry, giving parliament control of the north.
In modern times, the rich have been waging a different kind of war against
parliament, saving as much as they can of their wealth from the taxman.
Mr Keith Weston, a Saffery Champness partner who has totally forsaken London
for the north, now sees Yorkshire's golden triangle as far too limited.
He has drawn a new triangle, with Newcastle, Liverpool and Grimsby at the
corners. This takes in the rich pastures of Cheshire and the Derbyshire
Peaks, as well as the rest of Yorkshire and Humberside.

FT  18 MAY 92 / CBI Distributive Trades Survey: Retailers report highest
sales for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S hard-pressed retailers made their highest sales for two years in
April, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, but a strong
high-street recovery is still a long way off.
According to the CBI's latest quarterly survey of the distributive trades,
retail sales volumes last month were above the levels of a year ago. After a
poor performance in March, they resumed the upward trend in sales growth
experienced since the middle of last year.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said:
'These are the best results we have seen for two years but there is a long
way to go before any trader would describe today's conditions as a
high-street boom.'
The survey, which covers more than 15,000 retail and wholesale outlets,
showed considerable differences within the industry. In spite of the
improvement on a year ago, retailers said sales remained poor for the time
of year, while wholesalers described them as average.
Fortunes were very mixed in the retail sector. Mr Whittaker said: 'For every
retailer reporting good sales, two say they are still poor for the time of
year.'
A balance of 20 per cent - the percentage responding 'up' minus the
percentage responding 'down' - said sales in April were up on a year ago.
That was slightly lower than at the beginning of the year. The survey says:
'This suggests that while sales did improve after the ending of election
uncertainties, it was far from a mini-boom.'
Grocers, chemists, confectioners and carpet and furniture stores reported
sales well up on a year ago. Sellers of electrical and other household goods
said sales growth was more moderate, while sales were down for clothing
stores, off licences, booksellers and stationers compared with a year ago.
Retailers expect the underlying improvement in sales to continue, but said
stocks were still too high in relation to expected sales.
April sales growth for wholesalers was slower than in March, but orders
remained up on April last year. Sales volumes are expected to rise in May
but more slowly. Stocks remained too high relative to expected sales.
Motor traders reported that sales were still poor but had improved
considerably for the time of year since last month. They expected sales
volumes to show annual growth in May for the first time since April 1989.
Orders were down on last year but falling more slowly than in March.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Pension law statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS OF the government's review of pension law will be announced soon, Mr
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said yesterday.
Ministers promised a thorough look at the operation of pension funds in the
wake of the Maxwell scandal.
On BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Lilley said: 'I will be
announcing in a matter of weeks the details of that review.' Among the
issues to be considered in the review would be whether pension funds
belonged to employers or employees and the legal framework of pension funds,
including the role of trustees.
It was 'certainly conceivable' there would be new legislation following the
review.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Mellor targets BBC bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID MELLOR, the national heritage secretary, said yesterday that
tackling the BBC's 'complex welter of bureaucracy' would be one of the key
issues in the debate over the corporation's future.
On TV-am's David Frost programme he said: 'The BBC bureaucracy looks
increasingly isolated in a world where perhaps most other management
organisations have moved on from that kind of bureaucracy.' Mr Mellor
questioned whether the licence payer should have to pay for the
corporation's bureaucracy in its present form.
The BBC is investigating how much can be saved from overheads costing Pounds
330m a year as part of the Producer Choice policy that gives programme
producers the right to buy services from outside.
Mr Mellor emphasised that he was open to new ideas about funding the BBC but
conceded that he had not found one with the simplicity of the licence fee.
He said: 'I don't see how we can move away from the universal principle (of
payment) without moving away from the concept of the BBC with a
public-service broadcasting obligation serving the whole nation.'
In the debate about the corporation's role, the continued existence of the
BBC and the need for high-quality broadcasting had to be separated from 'a
rather absurd defence of everything the BBC does and the way that it does
it'.
The BBC admitted yesterday that the individual new business units being set
up under Producer Choice, which have an obligation to break even, might have
a total deficit of Pounds 100m next year if overheads were not brought down.
Overall, however, the BBC is not budgeting for a deficit next year.
Mr Mellor will address a conference of BBC governors and top managment later
this week. He will put forward his own proposals for the future of the
corporation in a discussion document to be published towards the end of this
year.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Furniture report highlights the striking impact of Ikea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE striking impact that Ikea has had on the UK furniture market is
highlighted in a market research report showing that the Swedish furniture
chain is achieving sales per square foot 2.7 times the industry average.
Ikea's three stores made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds
91.4m last year and the company is expected to break through the Pounds 100m
turnover barrier this year, with another two stores opening shortly.
Verdict, the retail research group, says this is the first time Ikea has
published its UK trading figures since it opened its first store in
Warrington in 1987.
Although Ikea's profits have fallen from Pounds 4.1m in 1989, Verdict points
out that the retailer's profitability is being dented by the high costs of
its opening programme. The report suggests that it takes three years for an
Ikea store to achieve mature sales levels.
Verdict suggests that Ikea's success shows it is possible for aggressive
retailers to increase sales even during a recession.
The report says the furniture market has declined by 7 per cent in real
terms since its peak of just more than Pounds 4bn in 1989, resulting in many
corporate casualties, such as Lowndes Queensway and ELS. Recession has
forced companies such as Habitat, Perring's and Allied Maples to rethink
strategies.
Verdict highlights the strong operational performance of MFI, the market
leader, which has struggled financially under the weight of debt taken on to
finance a management buy-out in 1987. MFI, it suggests, will be in a good
position to exploit its market dominance when it secures its finances by
returning to the stock market later this year.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Shephard relents on work hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government believes it can no longer fend off an agreement on the
European Community's controversial working time directive - including the
48-hour ceiling on the working week - at the next social affairs council on
June 24.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, will instead be lobbying
over the next few weeks for a clause saying that although workers cannot be
obliged to work more than 48 hours, they may work over the limit if they
choose.
That idea was floated at last month's social affairs council, along with the
earlier UK proposal that all workers who regularly do more than 48 hours a
week should only be allowed to do so if they pass a health 'risk assess
ment'.
The risk assessment idea has won little sympathy from other EC countries,
most of which support the working time directive.
Almost 6,500 engineering workers at Britain's largest railway carriage
makers will work 38 hours a week from July this year and 37 hours a week
from next July, the AEEU engineering union announced today.
The union says the deal for Brel workers at York, Derby and Crewe is one of
the biggest and best negotiated under its shorter working week campaign.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Major aims to appease party rebels: Stance on federal EC
stressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will this week seek to limit a rebellion by Conservative MPs
against the Maastricht Treaty by signalling strong opposition to any further
moves to enhance the authority of the European Commission.
As leaders of the rebel MPs predicted that between 20 and 30 on the
government side would vote against legislation to implement the Maastricht
accord, ministers said Mr Major would emphasise that he remained opposed to
a federal structure for the community.
The rebels acknowledge that although the government has an overall majority
of only 21, there is no prospect of blocking the legislation. In spite of
the threat of a rebellion by up to 60 of its own MPs, the Labour leadership
has decided to abstain on the substantive vote.
The Euro-sceptics are promising a series of 'wrecking amendments' - possibly
including a call for a referendum - designed to attract opposition support
when the bill is debated again, clause by clause, next month.
The prime minister, who takes over the presidency of the community at the
beginning of July, will emphasise instead the priority attached to
completing the single market and speeding up negotiations to widen the
membership of the community.
The Conservative rebels, buoyed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's scathing attack
last week on federalist ambitions in the community, will argue that the
Maastricht agreement represents a significant step on the road to a United
States of Europe.
They will also claim that recent proposals by Mr Jacques Delors, the
commission president, for another overhaul of the EC's institutions have
undercut Mr Major's assertion that his negotiating stance allowed Britain to
sidestep the pressures for federalism.
Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British member of the commission, sought to
counter that argument by insisting yesterday that a suggestion that the
commission be given greater executive authority had won little if any
support across the community.
Mr Major will insist at the start of the two-day Maastricht debate on
Wednesday that Britain has achieved its ambition of remaining at the heart
of Europe while resisting the centralising instincts of its partners.
Conservative party managers meanwhile have warned more than 60 new
Conservative MPs that a vote against the government might wreck their
chances of promotion.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Scots given clues on constitutional future: Ian Lang talks
to James Buxton about possible change in the system of government north of
the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN LANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, says that just over a month ago the
Scottish Conservative party was being portrayed by opponents as 'the pariah
of Scottish politics, an alien force with no public support, which was going
to be wiped out at the general election'.
As we know, Mr Lang had the last laugh. His face, desperately gaunt in the
days leading up to polling day, broke into smiles from the moment he kept
his seat. He retains the confidence of a man whose party was the only one in
Scotland to increase both its seats and its share of the vote.
Admittedly, the Tories won only two extra seats - taking them to 11 - and
their vote went up less than 2 points to 26 per cent. Yet in Scotland's
four-party system, where they are in second place, they have the political
advantage, and the question is what they plan to do about Scotland. Mr Lang
provides clues rather than answers.
His first move after the Tories were returned to power was to call for a
'change of tone' in Scottish politics. That, he says, was partly a request
that his party be treated more reasonably, and that it be recognised 'that
we had a valid point of view that deserved to be addressed on its merits'.
For the government's part, 'we decided that the tone from us would change as
well - we would be seeking a note of reconciliation in Scottish politics,
which had become too confrontational'. Policies would remain the same, 'but
the pace and flavour of them will be tempered'.
Although he does not say so, the shifting by Mr John Major of Mr Michael
Forsyth, the combative former Scottish health and education minister, to a
post in Whitehall was crucial. Mr Forsyth was replaced as health minister by
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and at education by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton,
who swiftly published a remarkably warm letter to the teaching unions.
Mr Lang admits there has been 'very little response so far' to the request
to the opposition for a new tone.
Even so, is it enough to be nice, or must the government tackle the issue of
Scotland's constitutional future? Although the Tories won the election,
almost three quarters of Scots voted for parties offering sweeping
constitutional change.
The unfathomable question in Scotland is how much people really want
constitutional change and how far they are prepared to go in support of it.
Mr Lang says: 'People do not put constitutional change high in their
priorities' - a view supported by opinion polls - and he believes he 'called
the opposition's bluff by fighting the election on the constitution'.
He continues: 'We were able to turn the tide that seemed to be running in
favour of a Scottish parliament and it became clear that the electorate,
when it addressed the issue, did not share the views of the chattering
classes.'
Now, he says, the Labour party is rapidly abandoning the scheme for
unilateral devolution to a Scottish parliament on which it fought the
election, with some MPs accepting that Scotland could not have its own
tax-raising parliament except as part of a federal structure for the whole
UK, and others veering towards independence. 'Labour are now the
multi-option party.'
Does that mean the government will do nothing? No, says Mr Lang. 'We are
willing to look at change of a constitutional nature within the parameter of
a United Kingdom that would be strengthened rather than weakened by such
change. We are now looking at a range of mechanisms.'
But what does change which does not weaken the UK mean? For Mr Lang it means
doing nothing that jeopardises Scotland's 'present arrangements at
Westminster - our access to resources, to have members of the UK parliament
with equal rights to those from other parts of Britain, ministerial
positions in all parts of the government . . . '
Does that rule out a Scottish parliament? 'It almost certainly does, because
the sovereignty of the UK parliament has to be paramount. It rules out any
separate legislative body with entrenched powers that are not retrievable by
Westminster.'
So what are the 'mechanisms' for improving the governance of Scotland that
the government is most likely to favour? Mr Lang points in the direction of
Westminster. 'Westminster is not being used to its full extent. It's a much
more flexible, adaptable place than has been recognised.'
For example, he says, the Scottish grand committee, the committee of all 72
Scottish MPs, which meets occasionally at Westminster and in Edinburgh,
could be exploited more. Currently it only discusses Scottish issues, rather
than deciding anything.
Some people have suggested that it should be given power to approve Scottish
legislation, at least the non-controversial issues. It is not something Mr
Lang is to be drawn on - but it looks as though Westminster committees are
be the 'mechanisms' the government is focusing on. The question is whether
that will be enough.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Status of training doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURVEY of more than 100 leading companies has cast doubt on the belief
that employers are becoming more rigorous in their training activities and
integrating training with normal business activities.
The survey, by the Employee Development Bulletin, found that only a quarter
of employers always set overall targets for their training and only a fifth
conduct training-needs analyses of their workforce.
The survey also found that training is not yet seen as an investment that,
like other investment decisions, is costed and evaluated.
Meanwhile, a new approach to the government's Employment Training scheme for
unemployed adults is to be launched this week by Norfolk and Waveney
Training and Enterprise Council.
According to the latest issue of Personnel Today, the East Anglian Tec is to
establish shorter courses and provide better careers guidance, linked to the
needs of local employers.
The Institute of Personnel Management has appointed Mr Geoff Armstrong, 45,
as director-general. A director of Standard Chartered with personnel
responsibilities, he will take up the post from July.
Mr Michael Bett, 57, executive deputy chairman of BT, is to join as
president-elect.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Smith supporters hint at second vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING numbers of Mr John Smith's Labour colleagues are warning privately
that he may have to accept another election in two years if, as expected, he
wins the contest in July to succeed Mr Neil Kinnock as party leader.
A senior member of Labour's frontbench team, who supports Mr Smith's
candidacy, said yesterday that the controversy surrounding the unions' role
in the election might 'fatally undermine' the authority of the new leader.
He suggested that the answer would be for Mr Smith to call a new leadership
election in two years, after the franchise for the contest had been changed
to effectively exclude the unions.
There would be no certainty of a credible challenger, but by suggesting such
a contest Mr Smith would be able to deflect inevitable Conservative attacks
on the legitimacy of his leadership.
Another colleague said there was growing acknowledgement in the Smith camp
of the damage inflicted by the refusal of his union supporters to ballot
their members before casting their block votes in the electoral college that
chooses the party leader.
Their comments, echoing the view of Mr Smith's opponents and a growing
number of uncommitted Labour MPs, came as Mr Kinnock signalled his
determination to press ahead with plans to weaken the authority of the
unions.
Party officials confirmed that Mr Kinnock would use his remaining short
period as leader to try to force through constitutional changes to end the
unions' role in the selection of Labour MPs.
Mr Kinnock wants this year's party conference to endorse a 'one member, one
vote' system for prospective parliamentary candidates.

MR Kim Young Sam yesterday appeared assured of winning the presidential
nomination of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) after his
only challenger within the party dropped out of the race.
Mr Lee Jong-Chan, an MP from Seoul, said he was withdrawing from the
nomination race prior to the DLP convention because of pressure being
exerted on delegates by senior party officials to support Mr Kim.
The charges by Mr Lee are likely to damage the image of the DLP, which had
promised that this year's convention would be the first to allow delegates
to choose the presidential nominee freely.
Mr Kim Dae-Jung, of the main opposition Democratic party, and Mr Chung
Ju-yung, founder of the Korean business group Hyundai and head of the
Unification National party, are Mr Kim's likely opponents in the
presidential election.

THE Pakistani government is about to launch its national conservation
strategy as preparations continue for a high-level delegation, led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, to attend next month's Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
The conservation plan, which coincides with increasing concern among foreign
aid donors over environmental damage in Pakistan, involves projects in 14
areas.
'In a country where the environment has been severely damaged because of
deforestation, pollution and a large population, we have to tackle our
problems,' a senior government official said.
Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, the environment minister, said at the weekend that
the environmental plan would need Rs150bn (Pounds 3.35bn) over the next 10
years.
The government expects to provide up to Rs90bn from its own budget while
hoping to raise the remainder through foreign assistance and projects
involving the private sector.
'We will come up with new laws which will take care of all aspects of the
environment within the next six months to a year,' the minister said.
Such laws might tighten regulations on industrial pollution and waste
disposal, officials added.
Despite the plans, western development experts believe that Pakistan
continues to be bogged down with a population of 112m, growing at more than
3 per cent a year. There are also fears that corruption in the forestry
sector may limit moves to curb deforestation.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Kurdish leaders put on brave face as poll delayed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KURDISH leaders last night moved to maintain the credibility of elections
organised by Kurdistan Front guerrillas in northern Iraq, after postponing
for two days the poll scheduled for yesterday.
In an eve-of-poll twist, indelible ink supplied from Germany to mark hands
and prevent anyone carrying out their democratic rights more than once was
found to be washable. But Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the KDP (Kurdistan
Democratic party), one of two key parties contesting the election, said last
night at a press conference in the mountains that 'our people at Salahuddin
University' had managed to manufacture a substitute and that the election
would take place tomorrow.
Leaders had earlier played down the postponement as a 'technical hitch'
while admitting there was a sense of anti-climax among a population keen to
vote after years of war and violent repression by Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein.
Late on Saturday evening Kurdish-controlled television stations broadcast
news of the delay and yesterday guerrillas toured the countryside with
loudspeakers.
But at 8am yesterday, the time scheduled for opening booths, the isolated
and troubled residents of Halachan, a village razed by Mr Saddam's soldiers
in 1988, emerged from their tents still expecting to vote.
At Hajiyawa, scene of heavy fighting during the Iran-Iraq war, Kurds hungry
for news anxiously discussed developments by a fleet of empty Land Rovers
collected to ferry voters from villages. An armed guerrilla said: 'The
people don't like to postpone. They think it's not right.'
The Kurdish leadership is anxious to gain international recognition for the
elections. Mr Hoshyar Zebari, a leading KDP member, said on Friday he was
disappointed that no US or British politicians were attending the poll, but
he was relieved that other international monitors would be remaining.
A US State Department spokesman in Washington had said that the US welcomed
'public and private assurances by the Iraqi Kurdish leadership that these
elections will deal only with local administrative issues and do not
represent a move towards separatism'.
But Turkey and Iran, neighbouring states with large Kurdish populations,
have both condemned the elections as being outside Iraqi law. Ankara has
announced that, on Friday, 27 Turkish soldiers and 36 Kurdish separatist
guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers party were killed in clashes near the
Iraqi border.
All levels of Kurdish society appreciate the international dimensions of the
elections.
The dream of full independence is evident among ordinary people, but with
100,000 Iraqi government troops on a 320-mile frontier with
Kurdish-controlled areas, the most widespread hope voiced in the streets,
bazaars and tea shops is that the Kurds be allowed to live in peace.

MR Rashid Solh, the new Lebanese premier, announced his cabinet at the
weekend, 10 days after the previous government resigned because of economic
unrest.
Although two-thirds of the ministers in the 24-member, half-Christian,
half-Moslem cabinet served in the previous government, the key posts of
economy and finance were given to newcomers.
Mr Samir Makdisi, minister for economy and commerce, holds a doctorate in
economics from Columbia University and worked for the International Monetary
Fund for 10 years before returning to a professorship at the American
University of Beirut in 1972.
Mr Assad Diab was named minister of finance despite attempts by Mr Nabih
Berri, the Shia Moslem militia leader, to secure the post for himself. Mr
Diab, an examining magistrate, has little financial experience but his
appointment was greeted with relief by Lebanese who admire his record for
fairness.
The leader of the Phalangist militia, Dr Samir Geagea, was named a minister
without portfolio but resigned hours later, saying the government was
'basically the same as the outgoing one'. Although Dr Geagea expressed
pessimism about the ability of the new government to reverse Lebanon's
economic crisis, he praised the appointments of Mr Makdisi and Mr Diab.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Population level poses big threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAPID growth in the world's population, most of it among people living in
poverty, poses one of the gravest threats to the environment. 'The result is
overgrazing, deforestation, depletion of water resources and loss of natural
habitat,' says the report.
Over the next 30 to 40 years the world's population could rise by a further
3.7bn people, from its present level of 5.3bn. In most parts of the world
this growth will come among urban dwellers. Only in Africa will more than
half the population still be living off the land.
The report makes the gloomy comment that the earlier goal of reducing the
number of poor in the world between 1985 and 2000 will now not be
achievable. At the end of this century the number of poor is now projected
to exceed 1.1bn people.
The report says four policy aims should be adopted to check these trends:
Incomes of poor households must rise.
Child mortality must decline.
Educational and employment opportunities (especially for women) must expand.
Access to family planning services must be increased.
The report says investment in female education yields some of the highest
returns for development and the environment, as better-educated mothers
raise healthier families and have fewer children.
Family planning also helps. Contraceptive use in developing countries
expanded from 40 per cent to 49 per cent over the last decade. But there is
large, unmet demand for contraceptives and their use must continue to rise
sharply to keep population growth under control.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Environment debate 'ignores plight of poor': World Bank's
annual development report claims poverty alleviation is a moral imperative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOBAL environmental debate has largely ignored the most serious
problems facing developing countries, the World Bank says in its annual
world development report, published today.
The focus on threats such as global warming has diverted attention from the
plight of poor countries where more than a billion people lack basic
amenities such as clean water, adequate sanitation and clean air.
Such problems are mainly the result of too little, rather than too much,
economic development. 'Alleviating poverty is a moral imperative and a
prerequisite for environmental sustainability,' it says.
Ahead of next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the bank calls on rich
countries to increase financial transfers to poor countries to help meet the
cost of essential environmental reforms. Assistance for programmes that curb
population growth should be doubled in real terms during the 1990s.
The report says rapid economic growth can be compatible with an improved
environment, but only if developing countries commit themselves to radical
reforms costing 2-3 per cent of annual gross domestic product (GDP). In the
absence of reforms, 'appalling environmental damage' is likely.
Over the next 40 years the bank expects the world's population, now at
5.3bn, to grow by more than two-thirds to about 9bn. About 90 per cent of
the increase will occur in developing countries. Food demand is expected
nearly to double while global industrial output and energy consumption will
more than triple.
Green lobbyists may wonder at the bank's arithmetic: how can environmentally
sound growth be bought at the price of a few per cent of GDP a year?
The bank's answer is to attribute no intrinsic value to the environment as
such: destruction of natural capital is not counted as a charge against
current production. It then claims that the level of output is only one of
several factors influencing pollution.
Clean technologies can reduce the environmental damage inflicted per unit of
raw material consumed and improved economic efficiency can reduce the inputs
required for a given level of output. Changes in prices can reduce demand
for environmentally-damaging products.
The reassuring conclusion is that rapid growth need not threaten the
environment. Dozens of colourful graphs reinforce the message.
Divergent lines show how the environmental outlook can be good, mediocre or
awful - depending on the policies of developing countries. If nothing is
done, for example, vehicle emissions will rise more than fivefold by 2030;
with tough reforms, they could fall.
Experience in rich countries shows that growth and pollution can sometimes
be 'delinked'. Since 1970 the output of rich countries has risen by 80 per
cent yet lead emissions, for example, have fallen by 50 per cent in Europe.
Air quality has improved, yet the annual cost of anti-pollution measures has
been less than 1.5 per cent of GDP.
The bank's ranking of environmental priorities sharply diverges from
conventional wisdom. In order of importance the third world's problems are:
Lack of clean water and sanitation. Some 1.7bn poor people lack access to
sanitation while 1bn lack clean water. This causes 900m cases of diarrhoeal
diseases a year and more than 3m children die.
Air pollution. Some 1.3bn people live in urban areas where output of
particulates (for example, dust and smoke) far exceed safe levels. Between
300m and 700m people, especially women and children, experience chronic
indoor air pollution from cooking fires.
Soil degradation. The loss of productive potential in rural areas due to
soil erosion depletes GDP by as much as 1.5 per cent a year. The problems
reflect poor farming methods and inefficient irrigation as well as advancing
deserts.
The bank says the way to tackle these chronic problems is by reducing
poverty. The single most important step is better female education, which
would sharply reduce family size and promote sounder agricultural policies
as women are usually the 'principal managers of natural resources'.
Some environmental problems are side-effects of growth. The loss of natural
habitats and biodiversity is one example. Tropical forests are being
depleted at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year. Animal species are also
being destroyed at an accelerating pace.
Global warming is a second example. The build up of carbon dioxide is
expected to raise average temperatures by 3 degrees Celsius within a century
 -and perhaps by more than 5 degrees Celsius.
The bank advocates two kinds of green reforms. The first are 'win-win'
policies offering benefits without negative effects on growth. The most
important include:
The removal of economic distortions. Developing countries encourage
pollution by spending Dollars 230bn (Pounds 130bn) a year on energy
subsidies. Deforestation is also encouraged by the charging of logging fees
covering less than a third of the cost of replanting trees.
Clarification of property rights. Resources such as forests are being
depleted because people have open access to them. Where ownership rights are
firmly established, as for metals and minerals, demand is rationed by rising
prices which also encourage the use of substitutes.
The bank concedes, however, that 'win-win' policies alone will not suffice.
Some 'win-lose' policies restraining growth to achieve environmental goals
are inevitable.
It urges the use of market-based policies, such as taxes on polluters or
tradeable pollution permits. US studies indicate flexible policies can
sharply reduce the overall cost of pollution curbs by encouraging the
producers least disrupted to shoulder the greatest burden. In some cases,
however, market-based policies will have to be bolstered by direct
'command-and-control' regulation.
The report says developing countries should bear most of the costs of local
environmental programmes. These could amount to 2-3 per cent of GDP a year,
but would be reflected mainly in higher prices for consumers rather than in
government outlays.
However, as the world's worst polluters, industrial countries should bear
much of the burden of meeting global challenges, such as preservation of
forests and animal species and the curbing of global warming. Such transfers
should be seen as imports or 'payments for services rendered' rather than
aid.
Indeed, the bank points out that, if 'rights' to carbon emissions were based
on population density, industrial countries would already have exceeded
their quota and ought to pay compensation for their current emissions.
Such compensation would roughly equal current development finance.
The bank's underlying message is positive; some would say too good to be
true. If governments can muster the political will to make rational - yet
relatively inexpensive - reforms an extra 3.7bn people can enjoy rapid
growth without threatening the environment.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Water and sanitation listed as top priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the world's most pressing problems can be traced to one vital
resource: water. All too frequently it is either scarce or contaminated.
The World Bank report puts dirty water and inadequate sanitation at the top
of the developing countries' priorities.
While rivers in high-income countries are becoming cleaner, they are not
improving in middle-income countries, and in poor countries they are
actually getting dirtier.
Much of the contamination is caused by disease-bearing human waste. As
surface water becomes less usable, people turn to ground water. But this too
is liable to increased pollution from seepage of improperly disposed
chemicals and other hazardous wastes.
Although progress has been made in bringing sanitation to the world's
population, little has been done to treat human sewage. In Latin America, as
little as 2 per cent of it receives any treatment. It is estimated that
worldwide 1.7bn people are without access to proper sanitation. It is also
calculated that at least 170m people in urban areas still lack a source of
drinking water near their homes. The number in rural areas without safe
water is put at 855m.
Twenty two countries face a permanent and severe water shortage; 18 more go
dangerously short in years of poor rainfall. Because of the big role played
by water in bearing diseases such as typhoid and cholera, a clean-up in the
water system can bring rapid health benefits.
If all those people now without safe water and adequate sanitation were to
receive it, the World Bank estimates that 2m fewer young children would die
of diarrhoea, and hundreds of millions of people would be spared various
infectious diseases.
But it is an enormous task. In Nigeria, for instance, providing access to
clean water for the whole population by the year 2030 would mean increasing
the number of urban mains connections four times, and of rural connections
almost nine times.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Ecuador's centre-right ahead in poll
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXIT polls published after the first round of presidential elections in
Ecuador yesterday confirmed that two centre-right politicans will contest
the presidency of Ecuador in July.
The polls showed Mr Sixto Duran, 72, of the newly-formed Republican Unity
party, obtaining 36 per cent of the votes, and Mr Jaime Nebot, of the Social
Christian party, 26 per cent. Their nearest challenger, the populist Mr
Abdala Bucaram - who nearly beat current President Rodrigo Borja in 1988 -
polled 21 per cent.
The polls confirmed the expected poor showing of the Democratic Left party
of President Borja.
His party's candidate, Mr Raul Baca, picked up only 8 per cent of the votes.
Ecuadoreans also voted in congressional, provincial and local elections,
with the exit polls confirming a stronger performance for the parties of the
centre-right.
The second round of presidential voting is scheduled for July 5, and the new
president starts his four-year term on August 10.
Both candidates have emphasised the need for a reduction in the role of the
state, and support for policies such as privatisation. Ecuador is one of the
few countries in South America not to have embraced market-oriented economic
reforms.
The behaviour in the second round of those who vote for Mr Bucaram in the
first was said by political analysts in Quito to be critical to the final
outcome of the presidential run-off.
Voting is traditionally made along regional lines, with Mr Nebot's support
concentrated in the coastal regions. Mr Duran, a steadier but less
charismatic figure than Mr Nebot who has already run unsuccessfully twice
for president, is from the highlands but claims links to the coast.
Voting is compulsory except among the 7 per cent of the population deemed
illiterate. The electorate is 5.7m, double that when Ecuador returned to
democracy from military rule in 1978.
The electoral process is regarded as relatively free of fraud, with ballots
being counted under an Italian-financed computer system.
The election campaign has also been relatively peaceful, aided by a law
which bans the sale and consumption of alcohol for 72 hours around election
day. Publication of opinion polls has been banned for 30 days ahead of the
election.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Growth too sluggish to cut unemployment, says OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth will be too sluggish to make inroads into the industrialised
world's 30m jobless total this year, according to the latest projections
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The OECD, which released the figures today to coincide with its annual
ministerial meeting in Paris, now expects real growth of 1.8 per cent this
year in its 24 member countries compared with a projected 2.2 per cent last
December.
Unemployment is expected to jump to 7.5 per cent of the labour force this
year, or roughly 30m people, from 7.1 per cent last year.
It will only start a slow decline to 7.2 per cent of the labour force by the
second half of next year as growth recovers to around 3 per cent. The
Paris-based think tank's assessment of growth prospects in 1992 reflects a
sharp downwards revision of forecast growth in Japan and western Germany in
the first half of this year. In western Germany's case, the OECD forecasts
growth in the first and second halves of 1992 at annual rates of 2.2 per
cent and 2.1 per cent respectively compared with its December projections of
3.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively.
The organisation expects Japan will grow at an annual rate of only 1.5 per
cent in the first six months of 1992 compared with its December 1991
forecast of 2.7 per cent.
Japan's sluggish domestic growth is reflected in a sharp rise in its current
account surplus. The OECD now expects this will be between Dollars 92bn
(Pounds 51.3bn) and Dollars 93bn in both 1992 and 1993 against last
December's forecasts of just over Dollars 80bn in each of the two years.
Although Japanese imports have sparked resentment among some US citizens,
the OECD has revised down its forecasts of the US current account deficit to
Dollars 41.1bn in 1992 from Dollars 55.8bn previously and Dollars 49bn in
1993 from Dollars 60.6bn in its December forecast.
The revisions are in line with a greatly improved US export performance
recently.

Bank, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
As has become customary in Swiss plebiscites, the turnout was a feeble 39
per cent, and only 55 per cent of those voted were in favour. Still, the
result will give a big boost to those Swiss who believe that their country's
future lies in abandoning isolationism and joining more international and
European institutions, including ultimately the European Community.
Within the next year, two tough referendum battles on European issues are
expected. The first, in September, is to approve the construction of new
rail tunnels through the Alps. The second, not yet scheduled, is to ratify a
recent agreement that would bring together the seven countries of the
European Free Trade Association, including Switzerland, and the European
Community into the European Economic Area (EEA).
The result of the IMF referendum, which would make Switzerland the Fund's
157th member, will come as a relief to officials of the Swiss National Bank
who have long been embarrassed that a country with as large a stake in the
world economic and financial systems was unable to participate in the
deliberations of the Bretton Woods institutions.
It may also give a boost to the Swiss franc, which has been
uncharacteristically weak in recent months.
The vote on the IMF confirms a substantial shift in Swiss sentiment since
1986, when voters decisively rejected a government proposal that the country
join the United Nations.

FT  18 MAY 92 / A no-nonsense launch for new Munich airport

<TEXT>
MUNICH'S new airport - Flughafen Munchen Franz Josef Strauss, a memorial to
Bavaria's best-loved prime minister and a monument to German patience -
opened its new runways to commercial air traffic yesterday.
Overnight, almost 700 trucks, 1,600 rail wagons and 5,000 personnel had
shifted all the moveable paraphernalia - workshop equipment, mobile aircraft
steps and the contents of 9,000 offices - out of the old Riem airport, and
switched out the lights.
After more than 30 years of planning, litigation, stop-go building and more
litigation, the new air transport hub went straight to work with no fuss.
All the ceremonial button-pushing had been done well in advance, before
Sekt-sipping audiences of invited guests.
There were no bands, booze or brouhaha to greet the first wave of paying
visitors. The protesters who have dogged the project since its inception
managed a small show of force, but preserved their main events for villages
in the surrounding countryside.
Meanwhile the new airport's customers, siphoned from their aircraft, trains
and cars directly into the main concourse of the single, 1km-long terminal,
quickly discovered what life is like inside a pinball machine.
Getting lost is impossible. Getting around is mindless. Brain cells
concerned with anxiety are left free to ponder who put the cat out.
Immaculate signposts in English and German shunt travellers left, right, up,
down and along walkways and escalators which deposit them at their appointed
slots in the array of nine gate areas.
There are no satellites, arms, fingers or any of the other appendages
commonly tacked on to other international airports.
The concourse, a white, grey and blue confection in steel tube, with all the
charm of the inside of a washing machine, features environmentally-friendly
rubbish bins but hardly anywhere where you can sit without paying through
the nose for a beer and a bun.
Bavaria's showpiece has already cost DM8.5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) - 39 per cent
from the state and the balance from private financing - and the returns are
flowing in. The airport's turnover, expected to reach DM1bn a year by 1995,
is only a part of the reward. According to Mr Willi Hermsen, managing
director, the project provided up to 6,000 jobs in the building period and
there are more to come.
Almost 120 airlines have elected to use Munich II, as it is now known,
against 80 at Riem. Able to handle 75 aircraft movements an hour, it already
has 15 per cent more capacity than Frankfurt. By 2000, passenger throughput
is expected to be almost double today's estimates of 11m a year, and there
is already talk of another terminal.
Mr Hermsen believes local outside contractors can now count on DM75m a year
in work from the airport. On the site itself, 300 companies currently employ
12,000, a total likely to grow to 20,000 by the end of the decade.
Beyond the perimeter fence and all along the 30km road to Munich cranes and
earthmoving equipment mark out the sites of new hotels, offices and industry
parks in an area formerly reserved for cabbages and sugar beet. Land prices
 -between DM30 and DM50 a square metre 10 years ago - now range between
DM500 and DM1,000.
Meanwhile, the local resistance movement, which put up an estimated 7,000
legal challenges to Munich II during planning and development, is bracing
itself for the next round. Its targets are the mooted extra terminal and the
likely need for new road and rail connections.
The already overloaded stretch of the Nuremberg motorway serving the airport
suffered unusually heavy jams yesterday. The effects of the curious joining
the flow of travellers added weight to the local joke that Munich II is the
world's first airport accessible only from the air.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Anxious German employers weigh up interests: Prospects for
the engineering sector amid signs of a breakthrough in the dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME German engineering executives have been shivering in their shoes at the
thought of a strike - which would be inevitable if hopes of a settlement
raised by last night's twelfth-hour talks prove groundless.
Others are keen for a fight, however, and the rest are playing it cool.
With such a big gap between the original demand by the powerful IG Metall
trade union for a 9.5 per cent pay rise and the employers' offer of 3.3 per
cent, a strike had seemed unavoidable as the negotiators warmed to their
task.
However, the seriousness with which the latest round of weekend talks was
taken in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg showed how strong the
desire had been to reach an accord; the state is home to such doyens of
German industry as Daimler-Benz and its Mercedes-Benz car and truck
subsidiary, Robert Bosch, the components company, and Porsche sports cars.
A strike would be expensive for both sides. The question remains whether
employers look more to short- or long-term interests. Many of Germany's
small- and medium-sized engineering and components manufacturers have said
last year's near 7 per cent settlement was too much for them. Now, with
domestic and foreign markets weaker and foreign competition stiffening, they
want as low a deal as possible. If that were to mean a strike to preserve
longer-term competitiveness, many would be prepared for that.
There is a heavy concentration of such Mittelstand companies in north
Baden-Wurttemberg, where the weekend talks took place in Karlsruhe. Deals
agreed there in recent years were adopted in the rest of the country. During
the last strike called by IG Metall in 1984, many Mittelstand operations
were hit hard. But the big companies also suffered. Bosch, with its central
importance as a supplier to car manufacturers, was a strategic target.
However, the law has been changed so workers at plants affected by a strike
elsewhere do not receive welfare payments if they have to stop work. If
action were to go ahead, this could put pressure on the union to make its
strikes more widespread so that all workers involved in industrial action
received strike pay. On the other hand, such tactics would also quickly
reduce IG Metall's coffers.
Either way, it could make for a short strike, if there were to be one.
Stuttgart, the local capital, is where the big companies such as Mercedes
and Bosch are based, but Mittelstand companies are scattered through the
state. Altogether, the region where the talks are being held has 700,000 of
west Germany's 4m engineering workers. But it is not the only concentration
of engineering might. The industry employs more than 800,000 people in the
neighbouring state of Bavaria, home to the BMW and Audi car manufacturers,
Kugelfischer (bearings), and MAN (trucks, printing machinery, and diesel
engines).
The biggest block of output, however, is located in the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia which has nearly 1m engineering workers and includes the
traditional heavy industrial area of the Ruhr. Many employers in the state,
such as Mannesmann, Thyssen, Krupp, and Hoesch, have switched their emphasis
from steel and heavy engineering to high-technology sectors such as
components and automation. But that would not make them less vulnerable.
Modern production methods mean that plants which rely on just-in-time
deliveries - notably in the car industry - could be shut down quickly.
Volkswagen, in the more remote town of Wolfsburg in Lower Saxony, a state
with 120,000 engineering workers, turns out 4,000 cars a day there. Its
Bavarian-based Audi subsidiary makes 2,000 daily. In the state of Hesse
(360,000 workers in the industry) Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, has
its main plant near Frankfurt, while the local subsidiary of Ford of the US
is based in Cologne, south of the Ruhr.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of Audi, said that a strike would cost the company
some DM30m (Pounds 10.2m) a day in lost revenue. But each 1 per cent on the
wage bill would also add DM30m a year to its costs.
Audi is profitable and racing to meet high demand, so it could well do
without a strike. But some components companies which are losing money
because of weak foreign markets have indicated that they would not mind if
there were a brief shutdown. Whatever happens, many companies are likely to
consider shifting more output to lower-cost countries. That is what Bosch
did after 1984.

engineering workers rise after last-ditch talks

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S threatened engi-neering industry strike appeared to have been
averted early this morning after two days of intense negotiations between
employers and trade union leaders.
A deal was announced at 12.30am in the region of north Baden-Wurttemberg,
the last region of the country not to declare the negotiations failed and to
call a strike ballot.
Traditionally this region has reached the accord later adopted by the rest
of the west German engineering sector.
The deal agreed is for 21 months. It involves a pay rise of 5.4 per cent for
12 months, backdated to April 1, and an increase of 5 per cent in special
payments, amounting to an estimated 5.8 per cent for the year. For the
remaining nine months of 1993 the pay rise will be 3 per cent, with a
similar increase in Christmas bonus and other payments - amounting to 3.4
per cent.
The contract will also cut the working week to 36 hours from the present 37
from April 1 next year.
If the agreement it is accepted by the national wages commission of the IG
Metall trade union, and by the leadership of Gesamtmetall, the employers'
association, it will have prevented a potentially disastrous strike in
Germany's most important industrial sector.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG Metall, who was present in Karlsruhe
outside the direct negotiations, was quoted expressing his support.
The agreement was reached after four separate rounds of secret talks between
the two key negotiators in the region, where 700,000 of Germany's 4m
engineering workers are employed. The region is also the headquarters of
Daimler-Benz and Robert Bosch, two of Germany's most powerful engineering
groups.
The same region, and the same two negotiators - Mr Dieter Hundt for the
employers and Mr Walter Riester for the trade union - have produced the
final deal in the past two years of wage talks for the industry.
This time they apparently performed the impossible against all the
indications. Gesamtmetall had hitherto resolutely refused to improve its 3.3
per cent pay offer, in response to the union's demand of 9.5 per cent, and
IG Metall was all set to call a selective strike ballot this morning.
Mr Hundt, as chief negotiator of the employers, said the deal would give the
engineering industry 'a clear situation . . . free of pay policy battles'.
Union leaders had let it be known, although later denying it, that a deal of
around 6 per cent - compared with the public sector's 5.4 per cent - might
be acceptable. Opinion polls showed a broad public majority believed a deal
of around 5.4 per cent would be justified.
Throughout the day hopes for a settlement had see-sawed as the negotiators
shuttled between bilateral talks and their parent organisations. Several
times they expressed pessimism about the chances of reaching agreement.
Finally, just before midnight, Mr Riester announced: 'There is an agreement
that I can accept.' He left to present the deal to his negotiating team.
If it is approved, the pay deal will relieve the increasingly tense
industrial relations climate in Germany, paving the way for similar awards
in other industries such as printing and construction, where strikes are
also threatened.
A pay rise of under 6 per cent will also reassure most economic observers,
who had built such a level into most projections of German economic growth,
currently forecast at between 1.5 and 2 per cent this year.

The French franc was the star performer of the system last week. It leapt
from bottom to sixth in the EMS grid, nudging its central rate of Ffr3.539
against the D-Mark. Sterling also remained strong, though it is a little
further away from its central rate of DM2.95 than the franc. Analysts said
both sterling and the franc had profited from a weaker dollar. Last year,
dollar weakness tended to result in EMS tensions, as funds floated from the
US currency into the D-Mark. Now, with Germany in the thick of economic
difficulties, those funds are flowing into the British and French
currencies. Currencies, Page 29
The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. Currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise more than
2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system.
Sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per
cent fluctuation bands.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Bangkok declares state of emergency
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S government declared a state of emergency in the capital, Bangkok,
and four surrounding provinces last night in the midst of the largest and
most violent anti-government demonstration since the 1970s.
At 4.30am local time today, gunfire was heard as troops advanced past
burning vehicles in an attempt to scatter groups of demonstrators in the
city centre. In one street, demonstrators pushed a blazing fire engine into
a shop front while others carried their injured comrades through the
streets.
Dozens of protesters were injured in the clashes which began with thousands
of young demonstrators hurling stones and bottles and demanding the
resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister.
They routed police and troops who had attempted to block an opposition march
to his office at Government House and ignored pleas for calm from the
organisers. They attacked police barricades and smashed police cars.
Several policemen were hurt by flying glass and police retaliated with water
cannon and baton charges. Unconfirmed reports said that at least one person
had been shot dead.
Gen Suchinda's government reacted by establishing a council of military
leaders and police to enforce the state of emergency, banning gatherings of
more than 10 people, closing schools for three days and preventing the media
from publishing anything 'detrimental to law and order'.
An official announcement on television accused Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the
devout Buddhist opposition leader, of inciting the marchers and trying to
lead them to the palace of the country's revered king. Mr Chamlong and other
organisers of the march had, in fact, urged the crowd not to attack the
security forces.
Mr Chamlong said after the state of emergency was declared that he was ready
to be arrested. He said the violence was the work of 'third hands' not
connected with the democracy movement. Earlier he told the rally: 'We're
here to fight dictatorship. Suchinda must resign.' The clashes followed the
latest in a series of peaceful pro-democracy rallies in the aftermath of a
general election in March.
Gen Suchinda, the former armed forces chief, took office at the head of a
coalition of parties sympathetic to the military in spite of opposition
demands that the prime minister be an elected member of parliament.
Tension had increased over the that the coalition was backtracking on a deal
to push through constitutional amendments.
Middle-class residents of Bangkok have grown increasingly frustrated with
continual military intervention in politics and business. The latest of 18
coups since the absolute monarchy ended in 1932 was arranged by Gen Suchinda
last year on the grounds that the elected government was too corrupt. Gen
Suchinda and his coalition supporters, however, went on to include several
ministers accused of corruption in their new government.

FT  18 MAY 92 / South African reform talks likely to resume 'very soon'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to end the deadlock in South Africa's constitutional talks are
expected to resume 'very soon', Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress, said yesterday.
Although Mr Mandela, speaking in Oslo at the start of a visit to
Scandinavia, expressed optimism about the outcome, an early breakthrough
seems unlikely.
A wide gap emerged between the two main parties attending the Convention for
a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for negotiations, which ended
its second formal round of talks on Saturday.
Hopes are now pinned on Codesa's multi-party management committee, which has
been given a three-week target by the convention to resolve the impasse.
The committee will resume talks on the creation of an interim government and
interim constitution, as well as on the principles of a permanent
constitution to be drawn up by an elected national assembly.
Mr Mandela, stressed at the weekend that this must be a package agreement:
'There can be no question of installing transitional executive committees
until there is clear agreement on the next phase,' he said.
The government's plan, he said, was to 'create an interim government which
would be made irremovable except by an excessively high majority'.
The two-day Codesa session, the culmination of months of preparation, had
been in danger of collapse on Friday. The ANC had rejected government
demands for what amounted to giving whites, in alliance with other minority
parties, a veto in a post-apartheid constitution.
The government also called for a decentralised administration that would
give wide autonomy to regional and local authorities, a structure that would
also favour minority parties.
At Saturday's closing session, President FW de Klerk angrily denied what he
called 'accusations and innuendos that the government promotes continued
minority domination or privilege'.
But sceptical ANC officials pointed to a passage in the same speech in which
Mr de Klerk spoke of the 'reality of South Africa', and referred to 'the
concern in the hearts of specific language groups, cultural groups, interest
groups and regions who wish to be assured that the space in which they live
will be safe and protected'.
The decision to authorise the management committee to continue talks ensures
that the negotiating process remains alive, with all 19 parties at the
convention expressing their support for Codesa.
But the predicament of the ANC - frustrated by the slow pace of negotiations
yet the seeing no immediate alternative - was illustrated by sharply
contrasting comments on Saturday by Mr Mandela.
In his final address from the floor, the ANC leader said: 'We have been able
to save Codesa and the peace process. We are going back home full of
strength and hope.' Less than an hour later, his assessment had changed
markedly. He told a press conference: 'Despite all the hard preparatory work
put in, nothing concrete has emerged. The negotiation process has stalled.'

FT  18 MAY 92 / Ministers want O&amp;Y creditors' answers on rail cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government indicated yes-terday that it wanted an answer soon from
creditor banks of Canary Wharf, the east London office development created
by Olympia &amp; York, on whether they will meet the Pounds 400m contribution to
the cost of the Jubilee Line extension.
It also emerged yesterday that the banks may yet decide to put the
development into liquidation after they have received further financial
information this week.
Ministers said yesterday that the government was willing to negotiate
quickly a deal to relocate civil servants from Whitehall if banks decided to
keep Canary Wharf out of receivership. One cabinet minister closely involved
with negotiations said the government's position could be summed up in the
phrase: 'We are not going to subsidise Canary Wharf, but we do want to
support it'.
Much depends on the rent the government has to pay to take space at the
development. Canary Wharf is offering at Pounds 15 a square foot about
500,000 sq ft of space. However, a rival office developer is believed to be
offering the government space at Pounds 13.
Bankers will meet environment department officials this week to discuss a
possible move to Canary Wharf.
Meanwhile, a leading bank creditor to Canary Wharf said: 'We are keeping all
our options open, including liquidation'. The 11 bank lenders hope to
receive financial information by mid-week which should help them to decide
between four options.
The banker said these options range from keeping the Pounds 3bn office
development as a going concern, putting it into administration under UK
insolvency procedures, putting it into receivership or liquidating it
completely.
The bankers have until the end of May, when its Pounds 21m loan to Canary
Wharf runs out, to decide. The decision will depend on whether the banks
believe they can ever make a profit out of the project. If they decided the
outlook was too bleak, they would opt for liquidation.
The banker said he could not predict which of the four paths the banks would
choose. Over the weekend, all but one of the banks voted to keep it as a
going concern for at least another few days, until they have received all
relevant financial information. This is in spite of Canary Wharf's parent
company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, filing for protection from its
creditors under Canadian and US insolvency law.
The remaining bank is expected to give its approval, the banker said.
If Canary Wharf is kept afloat, the bankers would probably want to appoint a
new manager for the project. They have discussed the suitability of Sir
Peter Levene, the former head of procurement at the Ministry of Defence, for
the post. 'He has an impressive record,' the banker said.
Meanwhile, ministers said London Regional Transport could not keep in place
the Pounds 1.5m a month project team working on the Jubilee Line extension
beyond July if there was no definite go-ahead for the project.
With the Treasury adamant that it would not increase public funding for the
line, the transport department would also be under pressure within the next
few months to decide whether the Pounds 1.5bn in public money already
committed might be better spent on other projects. So suggestions from O&amp;Y
and some of its banks that there could be a one or two-year delay to work on
the Jubilee Line extension were impracticable.
Meanwhile in O&amp;Y's court filing under the Companies Creditors Arrangements
Act, the Canadian parent company estimated the market value of its assets at
CDollars 14.9bn (Pounds 6.85bn), about the same as its debts. The company
values its equity in Canary Wharf at CDollars 3.8bn, based on appraisals on
Jan 31. Its US property investments are estimated to be worth CDollars 5bn.
The Canadian property holdings are valued at CDollars 3bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst mistake in economics is to make projections with a ruler - in
other words to assume that the future will resemble the past. This rarely
happens because human beings tend to learn from their mistakes. As the US
economy emerges gingerly from recession, the strong sectors of the 1980s -
such as consumer spending and construction - are noticeably subdued while
the weak sectors - such as manufacturing production and exports - are doing
better than expected.
At the very least this rebalancing of sectors suggests that the economy is
not going to be plagued by huge trade and current account deficits in the
1990s. Judging from the scramble to restructure balance sheets, dangerously
high ratios of debt to income in the consumer and corporate sectors may fall
more rapidly than expected. The gigantic federal budget deficit is a more
entrenched problem, but the enthusiasm on Capitol Hill for a constitutional
amendment mandating a balanced budget is a telling sign of changing
attitudes. Don't assume, in other words, that debts and deficits are an
unalterable aspect of US economic life.
Several powerful forces are conspiring to bring about change. The importance
of demography is brought out in a recent circular by Roger Brinner and David
Wyss, economists at the forecasting group DRI/McGraw Hill. The 1980s saw
rapid growth in employment reflecting both the coming of age of baby-boomers
and the entry of women into the labour force. With both the population and
the ratio of employment to population rising rapidly, a surge in consumption
spending and housing demand was inevitable. It made sense to finance some of
the spending out of borrowing. But these forces have played themselves out.
As baby-boomers grow older they are likely to borrow less and save more;
consumption will stop outpacing national income.
The psychological impact of three recessionary years can only reinforce
these tendencies. Few middle class families anticipated the end of the
housing boom. Fewer still realised that their jobs might become nearly as
insecure as those of blue collar workers. For the first time since the
1930s, many households have cringed as easily serviced debts turned into
millstones. The consequence - already evident in the failure of car sales to
respond to lower interest rates - is greater caution in personal financial
affairs. With the housing boom over, savings are more likely to be
channelled into productive assets. Consumer caution will inhibit recovery in
the short-term but it may be an asset in the longer-term.
At the same time, US industry is undergoing a partial rebirth. The
overvaluation of the dollar in the mid-1980s was a turning point for many
manufacturers - the event that finally brought home the need for fundamental
reform. More recently, many service sector companies have cut costs and shed
labour to raise efficiency.
The fruits of reform are evident. The quality gap between US and Japanese
cars, for example, is obvious to the naked eye. The surprising success of
small speciality steel makers marks a renaissance for the steel industry. In
overseas markets, US manufacturers have steadily recaptured market share
since 1986. In five years the trade surplus on advanced technology products
has nearly doubled to Dollars 37bn. Most economists seem confident that
export growth will remain strong despite the slowdown in Europe and Japan.
Sales are running at double-digit rates in Latin America and south-east
Asia.
The shock of tougher world competition is forcing US industry to sharpen its
game in subtle ways. It has imported new management philosophies. It has
developed tighter methods of inventory control: the recession was relatively
shallow partly because supply and demand were more closely matched. US
employers, always quick to fire, have become even more ruthless: last autumn
a second mild downswing led to immediate job cuts. According to Ms Gail
Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board in New York, the economy's
'systemic efficiency' is improving: she means that it is able to respond to
change faster than before.
Relative to Europe, the flexibility is most evident in wages With unions
virtually impotent, US employees do not have a 'going rate' mentality. The
real pay of all groups except the highly skilled has thus fallen sharply in
recent years.
The US economy is still troubled. Consumer confidence remains fragile for
this stage of the business cycle. The recovery from recession is far from
firmly established despite recently improved figures. Olympia &amp; York's
bankruptcy filing is a timely reminder of the chronic weakness of north
American commercial real estate markets. Budget deficits will continue to
drain away domestic savings.
But the balance between consumption and production looks set to improve as
manufacturers regain confidence and consumers adopt more conservative
habits. A sharper focus on the needs of industry and export markets does not
mean the US economy will be a roaring success in the near future; indeed,
shorn of the stimulus of unrestrained borrowing, growth rates may look
rather unimpressive. The important point is that a new chapter is beginning:
the economy's behaviour in the 1980s is likely to be a poor guide to the
shape of the current upturn.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan and the global crunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
READERS may well be confused to the point of indifference by the reports
about Japanese financial activities. It's time to get this straightened out.
As will appear, the Japanese crunch will have international effects but only
indirectly on the securities markets.
The basic facts have just heaved into view, out of the murk of Japanese bank
accounting practices, with the leak of a Japanese bank estimate of potential
problem loans in the Japanese banking system. The problems are mainly
domestic, but they are huge.
The trust banks, which tend to specialise in property lending, are naturally
the hardest hit. Out of total loans of Y59,300bn (say Dollars 420bn),
Y7,300bn to Y9,800bn (Dollars 50-70bn) are regarded as potentially suspect,
or 12-16 per cent, in round numbers. The 11 biggest commercial banks have
lent a combined Y236,900bn; non-performing loans are put in the Y13,700bn to
Y18,300bn range: Dollars 85-125bn, or 5.7-6.4 per cent. These numbers have
been published in Tokyo, and appear to be accurate.
What this means is that although the Japanese banks are still doing some
cautious lending, the whole system is dangerously vulnerable to any further
fall in property values, or any second leg of the stock market slump. The
banks themselves are among those helping, not altogether successfully, to
support the stock market; property, especially in such areas of wild excess
as Osaka, are like those in London, a matter of tightly-crossed fingers.
In any other country, such a banking crisis might signal an immediate slump;
Japan, with its enormous flow of savings at the personal and national level,
is more resistant. But loans are tight, with the main effect, as here, being
felt by the small company sector; and since the market rigging is widely
suspected, savings have been flowing overseas. Hence the heavy buying in New
York and London by Japanese insurance companies and savings institutions.
There has also been a secondary effect in foreign credit markets. Japanese
banks, for so long among the most aggressive lenders, are drawing in their
horns, and their loans books in some places are actually shrinking. This is
only a marginal constraint in Europe (including Britain); but it will tend
to hamper growth or recovery in some of their main areas of activity -
notably south-east Asia, where the Japanese have been providing up to 90 per
cent of foreign capital; and also California.
California is perhaps the most interesting case; for while the Asians can
expect continued large flows of corporate capital from Japan, investors like
Sony, Matsushita, and the major Japanese property developers have not had a
happy time on the west coast. The Japanese banks now control more than a
third of all business lending in California, and nearly a quarter of other
commercial lending.
The current Japanese lending slowdown has been hampering any recovery from
the west coast recession for some time. Post-riots, recovery has retreated
far into the future. Defence cuts are making things worse. Actual
liquidation by the Japanese-owned banks could cause a regional slump. This
means that the Tokyo banks are not just a Japanese problem; Mr Bush is now
running second to his businessman challenger Ross Perot in the region, and
the White House is getting actively concerned.
This means that the US authorities have fully woken up to a fact which does
not seem to disturb the happy dreams of the bulls and regulators on this
side of the Atlantic: the fact that in a global market, troubles in the main
source of capital must effect everyone. In most countries Japanese debt
deflation, provided that the system as a whole is preserved, is just one
more factor assuring that any recovery will be slow; but in some regions, it
is a much more pressing menace, and one which will effect more distant
regions through trade. It is little good comforting ourselves with the
thought that the leak is not at our end of the boat.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: ISMA stands at crossroads of
a radical change - An extension of the association's TRAX system presages a
shift in identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Munich was an appropriate venue for last week's annual meeting of the
International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the trade association
and self-regulatory body for the Eurobond market.
Like the Bavarian capital, ISMA is on the surface solid and prosperous, yet
it faces some tough choices about its future role in Europe.
At the most superficial level the conference was uneventful, even
self-satisfied. Last year was, after all, a bumper year for most Eurobond
firms.
ISMA's annual accounts were approved without question, and board members
were elected unopposed. Even an increase in the annual membership fee was
passed almost without complaint.
However, seasoned observers of the Eurobond market noted that the conference
contained the seeds of radical change. In particular, the time may be
approaching when ISMA must decide whether it is an investment exchange, a
regulatory body, a systems supplier or a trade association.
The catalyst for change could be TRAX, the electronic trade matching and
confirmation system introduced by ISMA in 1989.
Although TRAX is now used by 260 international bond firms from London to
Hong Kong, the system does not operate at anything near full capacity.
To make use of its potential, ISMA officials have proposed that the system
should be extended to cover equity transactions.
ISMA is one of three suppliers - along with the London Stock Exchange and
the Thompson group - chosen to supply an electronic trade confirmation
system for equities to UK institutional investors.
It is a measure of ISMA's sure-footedness as a systems house that it was
chosen following a tender by 20 potential suppliers.
The conference was used to set out a timetable for this development. The
TRAX database is already being loaded with the details of around 100,000
liquid international equities. The technical specifications for the system
have been drawn up by a consultative group of banks and investment managers.
Programming work will begin this month and should be completed by the
year-end. Those close to the project were adamant that the task was easily
within the technological limits of TRAX.
If the deadlines are met, ISMA should have a fully operational equity trade
confirmation system to offer to investment institutions by the start of next
year. The marketing drive has already begun.
Whether TRAX is capable of beating either the London Stock Exchange's
Seaqual system or Thompson's Oasis remains to be seen. But if TRAX were
capable of winning business, there would be no reason why the system should
stop there.
It is also within the limits of TRAX to carry real-time dealing prices and
to meet regulatory trade reporting requirements. If institutional demand for
these functions surfaced, ISMA would start to look more like an investment
exchange than a trade association.
ISMA has already shown itself to have similar ambitions for bonds. In the
late 1980s, it proposed that TRAX should carry 'real time' trading prices
for bonds, contributing to market transparency.
The proposal was roundly rejected by the association's membership. Many bond
firms saw increased price transparency as a threat to profit margins which
were already painfully thin.
Some within the association still regard TRAX as a Trojan horse. Even after
a year of fat profits, there is no sign that opposition to TRAX as a carrier
of real-time bond prices has weakened.
But it may be more difficult for the membership to object should ISMA prove
able to provide investment institutions with similar exchange-style services
for cross-border equities.
Extension into the international equities business is certainly seen as the
way forward by many Eurobond market participants. For example, the
International Primary Markets Association (IPMA), the trade association for
new issue firms, has started to rewrite its rules on equity issues in
recognition of the dramatic growth in the 'Euro-equity' market.
ISMA has already found that its hybrid character does not fit neatly with
the new European regulatory framework for securities trading being designed
by European Community governments.
In particular, a number of European countries led by France have proposed
that the draft Investment Services Directive (ISD) should restrict
securities trading to 'recognised investment exchanges'.
As currently constituted ISMA would not qualify, not least because it has no
formal listing or issuer reporting requirements.
Several European governments, including the UK and German authorities, with
the vocal support of ISMA, object to the French proposals. As a result the
draft ISD has been deadlocked for months.
However, there was informed speculation circulating in Munich last week that
the Dutch government was softening its opposition to the French-led
proposals.
Whether the issue is forced by European regulation or the success of TRAX,
it is likely that ISMA will sooner or later have to choose a clearer
identity. There are signs that it is preparing the ground. The increase in
membership fee was proposed even though the association turned in a big
surplus last year.
Capital and reserves are quite openly being built to meet 'future
challenges'. The shape of these challenges became a little clearer in Munich
last week.

FT  18 MAY 92 / European Bonds: Bund's dethroning appears plausible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European bond markets last week continued to flirt with what until
recently was unthinkable: the overturning of the bund as the lynch-pin of
European Community markets.
The French franc's strong advance during the week was the main factor. From
FFr3.3658 to the D-Mark on Monday, the currency strengthened to FFr3.3498 by
Wednesday. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the franc would
have to fall well below its ERM central rate (FFr3.3539) before any rate cut
could be considered.
By the end of the week, the franc had risen back above the central rate and
a bout of profit-taking wiped some of the gains from French government bonds
 -even as the latest consumer price figures for April were released,
confirming France's good inflation record with a year-on-year rise of 3.1
per cent. By the end of the week, yields on French bonds had inched still
closer to their German counterparts: the 10-year yield spread had narrowed
to around 60 basis points, having fallen sharply from some 75 basis points
at the start of the month.
UK gilts, meanwhile, have followed a similar path - though both the UK and
France are expected to hold back from cutting interest rates below German
levels.
Events in Germany in the coming days could determine whether the bund is
finally to be dethroned. The pay dispute involving the IG Metall union still
seemed yesterday to be on course towards outright confrontation and a strike
ballot.
By the end of the week, money supply data will begin to emerge for April.
March brought M3 growth at 9.7 per cent, well outside the Bundesbank's
target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. April, according to many analysts, will
be even worse, with M3 growth hitting as high as 10 per cent.
The market does not expect the Bundesbank council on Thursday to raise
interest rates - if only because to do so would encourage investors to put
more cash into short-term deposits, thereby pushing M3 still higher.

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Post-election rally gains fresh vigour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILT market's surging post-election rally, stalled recently by concerns
about rising headline inflation and the overhang of new gilt issuance, was
back on the rails again by the end of last week. A batch of important data
due out this week could help the market to continue to power ahead.
The April retail price index was looming large in the minds of investors in
UK government bonds last week. Most had agreed that the year-on-year rate,
when reported, would be well up on the 4 per cent of March - though there
were differing views on just how sharp the rise would be.
One-off factors accounted for much of the expected jump: last year's
reduction in the community charge (or 'poll tax') dropped out of the
calculation, together with the reduction in mortgage rates last year by  3/4
percentage point. Together, these two factors would add 2 1/4 points to the
inflation rate, according to Greenwell Montagu.
In the event, year-on-year inflation came in at 4.3 per cent - close to the
bottom of the range of expectations, and well below some alarmist
predictions that put it close to 5 per cent.
The news set the stage for the expected announcement of Pounds 850m of 'tap'
stock from the Bank of England. The Bank has issued some Pounds 7bn of gilts
since the general election at the beginning of April and sold perhaps
another Pounds 2bn from its own book. That still leaves more than Pounds
20bn of gilts to sell before the end of the fiscal year - but the market on
Friday was not letting that disturb it, and took the news of the latest tap
issue confidently in its stride.
The tap stock was concentrated in the 10 to 15-year areas of the the yield
curve, a maturity at which the Bank has issued little paper recently. (Its
last auction, and the only one of the fiscal year to date, was its
extra-long dated issue.)
The three largest tranches, each of Pounds 250m, are the 9 3/4 per cent
Treasury stock due 2002; the 9 1/2 per cent conversion stock due 2005; and
the 9 per cent Treasury loan maturing 2008. There was also a small, Pounds
100m tranche of short-dated paper, the 9 per cent Treasury loan due 1994.
It is this end of the yield curve that has seen the best advances, and which
is likely to see further gains in the days ahead. The yield curve has
already steepened marginally, and could develop an even more marked
inversion. The Bank of England has made clear that interest rate cuts are
out of the question until inflation falls further. Three-month money in
London spent last week hovering just above 10 per cent as a result, and is
not expected to come down in the forseeable future.
Indeed, a more likely challenge is whether sterling could sustain its
current firm position without a hike in interest rates, should the
Bundesbank be forced to take action to raise German rates in the coming
weeks.
For longer-dated gilts, economic data due this week is generally expected to
remain positive. Tuesday sees the release of industrial production data for
March, while Thursday brings the latest money supply statistics.
The figures are likely to show that manufacturing output fell by 0.5
percentage point in March, according to Philip Tyson, an economist at
Warburg Securities. That, and soft money supply figures, could set the scene
for further price gains.

FT  18 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Mixed signals cloud outlook on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meets tomorrow to
consider the state of the US credit markets, with Wall Street divided over
the likelihood of an early cut in short-term interest rates.
The Fed last eased on April 9, when it cut its target for the key Fed funds
rate from 4 per cent to 3.75. Many analysts are expecting it to trim a
further 25 basis points off Fed funds over the next few weeks.
Some aggressive Fed manoeuvring on Wednesday of last week briefly, but
wrongly, suggested it might already have done so: the central bank chose to
add reserves to the banking system, which for a time took Fed funds below
the 3.75 per cent target.
The move was eventually seen to be a purely technical move, in response to
wide swings in bank reserve demands, yet some traders viewed it as a
possible foretaste of easing to come.
However, the indicators that might trigger a Fed easing continue to throw
out very mixed signals as the economy climbs slowly away from last year's
recession.
Last week produced stronger-than-expected retail sales for April, on top of
lacklustre revised March figures, yet car sales in early May remained
sluggish, at a 5.7m unit annual rate. This reinforced the view that the
revival in consumer spending needed to underpin recovery was still modest.
According to the market's easing theory, the Fed will cut Fed funds one last
time in this interest rate cycle to ensure that the recovery does not peter
out, as it did around this time last year. Adding weight to the easing
theory has been the performance in recent weeks of money supply, which
dipped well below the Fed's 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target band for growth this
year.
Last Thursday, however, it staged a bounce back into the target range, with
M2, the monetary measure tracked most closely by the Fed, surging by Dollars
9.8bn in the week ended May 4, far ahead of the Dollars 3bn to Dollars 5bn
expected.
Many analysts judged that this ruled out an immediate Fed easing, but Mr Ed
Yardeni, of CJ Lawrence, noted that excluding M1, the narrow money measure
which tracks currency in circulation and demand deposits, M2 actually fell
Dollars 700m during the week.
However, Mr Lawrence Lindsay, a Fed governor, said during the week that
money supply growth had been weak in April because of seasonal factors, in
particular the deadline for filing Federal income tax returns, and should
start to show the 'beginning of a bounce back'.
All this adds up to a consensus view that the Open Market Committee will
this week retain its 'bias towards easing' and give Mr Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, the go-ahead for a further cut in Fed funds over the next few
weeks if - and it remains a big if - a batch of statistics provides worrying
signs of economic weakness.
Last week's statistics on inflation have given the Fed more room to ease
without provoking market fears of spiralling prices. The producer price
index rose just 0.2 per cent in April, below the consensus forecast of 0.3
per cent, and the consumer price index rose by a similarly small amount.
This further evidence that inflation is under control, coupled with the
belief that economic recovery will remain subdued, sustained the three-week
rally in the bond market. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue ended the
week  29/32 higher in price, while its yield dropped eight basis points to
7.815 per cent.
The lower yields helped bring a rush of corporate bond issuers into the
market, which some bears interpreted as a warning that the rally may not
have much further to run.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Italian Bonds: Government paper proves resilient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a country without a president, prime minister or government, Italy's
bond market has been surprisingly resilient, especially considering the free
fall now under way in equities.
True, the bond market's much greater size and liquidity have partially
masked the effect of the political upsets which have helped to send the
stock market spinning. Nor have bonds suffered from the surge in cash calls
which have so damaged equities this month. And while the government bond
market is benefiting from a lengthy period of innovation and reform, the
bourse is still at the start of that process.
However, the relatively good performance of Italian bonds at a time of acute
political uncertainty has come partly at the expense of shares, as big
institutional investors have sold equities to reinvest in government paper.
The shift of institutional money into government issues was reflected in the
record turnover figure reported on the screen-based 'primary dealers' market
for government bonds earlier this month, where trading hit a new peak of
L16,992bn.
The continuing appeal of government paper was also evident at last week's
auctions. Seven-year fixed-rate Buoni Poliennali del Tesoro (BTPs),
auctioned on Friday, enticed L11,550bn in bids from investors for just
L5,000bn of paper on offer, pushing prices well above market expectations.
But the bond market has not emerged totally unscathed from Italy's current
political problems. In particular, foreign investors have taken cover, with
their absence being only partially replaced by greater activity among
domestic institutions.
The relative strength of the bond market may also have been helped by
discreet promptings from the Bank of Italy which looks to have been quietly
defending longer bonds. A further indirect boost came last week, when Mr
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the central bank, warned commercial
banks to control lending growth this year.
Mr Ciampi's remarks were seen as a further sign that the central bank
intended to maintain its tight monetary policy, designed to keep down
inflation. But the message on loan growth may have been taken on board by
some bankers well before Mr Ciampi's warning.
Underlying all the Bank of Italy's strategies has been the continuing
priority of safeguarding the lira and isolating the currency as far as
possible from the type of downward spiral seen on the bourse. With the lira
proving remarkably insensitive to domestic political turbulence so far, it
seems to have worked.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: US lenders loom as immediate O&amp;Y
challenge
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Among Olympia &amp; York's most immediate challenges is to mollify lenders to
its US operations.
O&amp;Y maintains that its US business - comprising buildings mostly in New
York, but also in numerous other cities around the country - is relatively
healthy. These operations have been left outside the court protection
granted to O&amp;Y late last week under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code and
Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangements Act.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, declined to say on Friday whether the
company will meet interest payments on its US properties, now that a
standstill is in place on debt payments in Canada.
While the company has managed to keep debt-service payments current on some
US loans, it has failed to make payments on others since its liquidity
crisis surfaced two months ago.
In at least one case, involving Dollars 62m in interest on a Eurobond issued
to finance a building at the World Financial Centre, O&amp;Y has funnelled
rental income to its cash-starved Canadian operations. Failure to pay
interest on this bond led to a cross-default on another USDollars 160m loan,
prompting JP Morgan to foreclose last week on an interest-rate swap held as
collateral.
O&amp;Y is due to meet this week with holders of bonds secured by 55 Water
Street, an office building in lower Manhattan. The building appears to
generate sufficient rental income to meet debt-service payments, and the
next interest payment is due on June 30.
O&amp;Y has taken a number of steps in recent months to deal with the handful of
US buildings which are not paying their way. Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong
magnate, took an equity interest last autumn in the building formerly
occupied by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the failed investment bank.
In addition, O&amp;Y says that it has deferred a USDollars 100m refinancing due
this year on 320 Park Avenue, the former ITT head office in midtown
Manhattan, which is now standing virtually empty.

<TEXT>
THE French government intends to retain control of key strategic decisions
affecting Total, the French oil group, in spite of plans to reduce its
direct financial stake in the company to 5 per cent.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, claimed that the run-down in
the state's share of Total, which currently stands at nearly 32 per cent,
would facilitate its relations with other foreign companies.
However, the Finance Ministry made it clear that the government would
continue to exercise the right to appoint the chairman of Total, though
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy over the weekend expressed continuing
confidence in Mr Serge Tchurk, the current chairman.
The government's determination to maintain its influence over Total was
further underlined yesterday, when it announced the appointment of four new
state representatives to serve on the Total board.
Mr Strauss-Kahn said that Total would continue to need government
authorisation for international agreements, thus somewhat undermining his
claim that Total would in future have greater freedom.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Astra ulcer therapy threatens
Glaxo sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, believes it has developed a new
therapy for peptic ulcers that could seriously undermine sales of Zantac,
the world's best-selling drug, which generates annual revenues of Dollars
3bn for Glaxo of the UK.
The new treatment eradicates a bacterium, helicobacter pylori (HP), which
specialists believe is a significant cause of recurring peptic ulcers.
By eliminating HP, Astra believes it could reduce the need for long-term
preventative therapy. Glaxo estimates that 40 to 50 per cent of Zantac
prescriptions are for long-term maintenance therapy.
Astra has been testing a combination of its Losec ulcer drug with an
antibiotic on patients infected with HP. Two studies revealed last week at
the annual convention of the American Gastroenterological Association showed
that the drugs could eradicate HP in as many as 80 per cent of duodenal
ulcer patients. Of these patients, all remained ulcer-free for 12 months
after the treatment.
The effect of eradicating HP is not new, said Mr Robin Gilbert,
pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel. However, previous treatments to
eliminate the bug required taking 18 pills a day on five separate occasions,
normally within a hospital environment. The importance of the new treatment
is that only one pill a day, prescribed by a general practitioner, would be
needed.
'If this combination fulfils its early promise it could revolutionise the
market,' said Mr Gilbert. 'The maintenance market could virtually
disappear.'
Astra claims the combination works because Losec reduces the acid content of
the stomach allowing the antibiotic to work more effectively. Antibiotics
able to withstand acid did not prove as effective because patients had built
up resistance to them.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Arianespace celebrates its quiet
successes - The satellite launch group has earned a reputation for
reliability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arianespace, the successful European satellite launch company, faces
increasing competition as today it celebrates two symbolic achievements  -
its 50th launch and its 100th contract.
When the group was set up by a French-led consortium of private and
state-owned companies 12 years ago, critics saw Arianespace as a
Euro-eccentric, proposing to put satellites into orbit on expendable space
rockets at a time when the US space shuttle seemed to be the space vehicle
of the future.
Quickly, Arianespace confounded the doubters by emerging as a serious
competitor, taking more than half of the Dollars 1.15bn western market for
commercial satellites by the mid-1980s. The lion's share of the rest goes to
three US groups: General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, and Martin Marietta.
The space shuttle, which stopped commercial flights after the 1986
Challenger tragedy, has grabbed the world's imagination over the past week
with its dramatic satellite rescue. Ariane has made a less exciting but
important name for itself as one of the most dependable commercial launchers
in the world, says Mr Charles Bigot, Arianespace chairman.
Now, the French-led group makes on average of seven to eight flights a year
from the European Space Centre in French Guiana, its most recent being a
twin satellite launch for France Telecom and Inmarsat, the international
marine telecommunications organisation. Last year, its sales jumped by
nearly 50 per cent to a record FFr5.87bn (Dollars 1.08bn), on which net
profits rose by 14 per cent to FFr154m.
Mr Bigot is confident that the European group will be able to stick to its
target of at least holding market share in the years ahead. The delays
imposed on the French-supported Hermes shuttle do not affect Arianespace's
commercial satellite business, he points out. With a backlog of orders for
33 launches worth FFr15bn, Arianespace has enough work to keep it busy for
three years.
But there could be one or two bumps on the way. An important German client
has just become the first company from a Arianespace member country to buy a
cheaper launch elsewhere. US competition is intense, and the whole industry
is anxious over the threat of being undercut by Russia's gigantic and under
used space programme.
Arianespace is owned by aerospace and electronics companies from the 12
European countries that include its main customers. French state and private
groups are a long way in the majority, reflecting Aerospatiale's position as
Arianespace's lead contractor for rocket building and design. Germany comes
second, with 18.6 per cent.
So it was that a recent decision by Deutsche Telekom, the German public
telephone service, to choose McDonnell Douglas to launch its next
telecommunications satellite created consternation at the French-based
company.
Mr Bigot regrets the move, which he attributes to Deutsche Telekom's desire
to show its independence in the wake of German telecommunications
deregulation. McDonnell Douglas helped by pitching its prices low, he
estimates.
'We think they should be more circumspect in the future and give preference
to Ariane,' says Mr Bigot. After all, he points out, the US government and
its agencies give preference to US companies to the extent that it is almost
impossible for Arianespace even to place a bid for such contracts. This
matters, since satellite launches for the US administration represent two
thirds of the entire western civil and government market, he says.
Competition rules have long been a source of friction between the European
group and its US rivals. Arianespace's US competitors can charge most of
their launch centres' fixed costs to the government. They only have to pay
by themselves an extra percentage to cover any commercial business which
they take on.
Arianespace, by contrast, simply charges government clients by the number of
launches they use. Since 15 per cent of Ariane's flights are for
governments, while its US rivals get 80 per cent of their orders from the US
government, the European group is at a clear disadvantage.
Competition rules also need to be agreed with Russia, the inheritor of the
former Soviet Union's space programme, says Mr Bigot.
THE European space industry is facing a recession during the next two years
because of difficulties in its two main markets - space telecommunications
and large European Space Agency programmes, writes
Paul Betts. This is the conclusion of the latest annual study of the
European space industry by the Paris-based Euroconsult group.
Although industry figures for 1991 have not yet been released, first
estimates indicate a slowdown in growth last year to be followed by
recession this year and in 1993.
The survey says the slowdown in the telecommunications satellite business
and the intensification of competition in the international market has posed
a significant challenge for European satellite manufacturers.
Over the past 18 months, only two of the 27 civil telecommunications
satellites ordered internationally were awarded to European prime
contractors, although this was in part offset by subcontracting work on
several satellites under US prime contractorship.
But telecommunication satellites are expected to remain a key market for the
European industry. The report expects this market to rebound in the
mid-1990s as recently launched satellite systems will have to be renewed.

FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Westar seeks court protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTAR MINING, Canada's largest coal exporter, has applied for court
protection from its creditors to help deal with a crippling debt burden and
a protracted labour dispute at its biggest mine.
Westar's difficulties are a sign of the turmoil in western Canada's coal
industry caused by its high costs and the sharp decline in world coal prices
over the past five years. Another large British Columbia mine, Quintette,
recently agreed to hand a one-third equity stake to its banks in return for
debt concessions.
Westar, which produces 9.5m tonnes of coal a year, has asked for court
protection until September 30 under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements
Act to enable it to finalise a financial restructuring.
The move came after the company missed an interest payment on its CDollars
330m (USDollars 277.3m) debt at the end of April, and Royal Bank of Canada
demanded repayment of a CDollars 45m loan.
Westar's Balmer mine earlier this month locked out 1,100 members of the
United Mine Workers union, after they rejected company demands for a
two-year wage freeze and other workplace concessions.
The company says the sacrifices are necessary partly to staunch losses, but
also to ensure the viability of a proposed CDollars 75m mining pit. The
existing pit is difficult to mine and has only seven to eight years of
reserves at present prices. The new pit would add 20 years to the life of
the mine.
Mr Peter Dolazel, Westar's president, warned that unless a 'timely'
agreement is reached, the Balmer mine will be permanently closed.
Balmer exports 6m tonnes of coal a year, mainly to Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan. Japanese steelmakers have a one-third equity stake in the parent
company.
Westar said its Greenhills mine would continue to operate normally while it
is under the protection of the courts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian entrepreneur turned yachtsman, is returning to
the Italian corporate scene with the launch of a new food group, Reuter
reports from Milan.
The ex-president of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, who said over a year ago he was
turning his back on Italy, is teaming up with Mr Giulio Malgara, the former
European chief of Quaker Oats.
Mr Malgara's resignation as head of the European operations of the US-based
foods group was announced last week.
The new venture, to be called Garma, will have an initial capital of L200bn
(Dollars 161.3m), with the majority being held by the Gardini group.
Mr Malgara was said to be considering buying Quaker's Italian oils business.
Quaker had authorised negotiations on the possible sale.
Mr Gardini, whose yacht is currently competing for the America's Cup,
angrily announced his divorce from Italian industry after Ferruzzi's
Montedison sold its stake in chemicals joint venture Enimont to its state
partner in late 1990.
He subsequently left Ferruzzi and has launched a number of ventures abroad
through his French-based Ste Centrale d'Investissements (SCI).

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Laporte ends relationship with Solvay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAPORTE, the speciality chemicals group, will today formally end its
21-year-old relationship with Solvay of Belgium as it finally unravels its
stake in Interox, the 50/50 joint venture between the two companies.
The upshot will be that the number of Laporte shares in issue will drop from
182m to 154m, and its capitalisation, on Friday's closing price of 644p,
reduces by Pounds 180.3m to Pounds 991.8m.
Although it is principally an accounting exercise and the fundamental value
of the company is unchanged, it is likely that Laporte's short reign in the
FT-SE 100 Index will end when the index of the 100 most heavily weighted
listed UK companies is reviewed towards the end of June.
It joined the Footsie at the beginning of January but financial analysts
believe its share price will have to reach 740p if it is to remain.
Laporte established its Pounds 500m joint venture in 1971 to fend off a
hostile bid from Burmah Castrol. The decision to end the relationship
followed a divergence of interest between Laporte and Solvay.
While Laporte has shifted, over the past decade to high-value low volume
products, Solvay, Belgium's largest company, has concentrated on bulk
products.

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ocean Wilsons sets sail for sunny Bermuda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 150-YEAR-OLD Brazilian tugboat company is setting sail for the sunny
climes of Bermuda. Ocean Wilsons (Holdings), a UK listed company linked to
the business empire of the late Sir Walter Salomon, is planning a change in
domicile to the offshore financial centre, citing tax and regulatory
advantages.
Shareholders are being asked to approve a deal in which a new holding
company, Ocean Wilsons Holdings (Bermuda), will buy the current holding
company in a one-for-one share swap. The London listing will be retained.
Three main factors have determined the decision to go offshore. First, the
company's profits come largely from Brazil and as a result, Ocean Wilsons
has developed a significant problem of unrelieved advance corporation tax.
This is deducted from dividends and can only be offset against corporation
tax on UK-generated profits.
Second, the company needs to deal with the regulatory regimes of both Brazil
and the UK, causing a significant administrative burden. Finally, there is
no withholding tax in Bermuda and this will allow the company to pay
dividends gross to international investors.
The company's roots date back to 1837 when two brothers called Wilson who
were transporting coal by boat were forced to take shelter in the Brazilian
port of Salvador. They liked what they saw and set up an importing/exporting
business in the town. In 1908, the company bought its main trading partner,
the Ocean coal company in south Wales.
In the 1940s and 1950s, the company suffered two blows as first coal was
nationalised and then South American debt problems forced it to start
disinvesting from the region. But the Brazilian businesses attracted Sir
Walter Salomon and clients of Rea Brothers, the merchant bank, made a
successful bid for 51 per cent of the shares in 1958.
The businesses in Brazil currently include a fleet of 56 tugs, shipping
services, property and a Mercedes dealership. Elsewhere, the company has an
investment portfolio which includes several stakes in Salomon-linked
companies, such as Finsbury Growth Trust (formerly Scottish Cities
Investment Trust). In addition, Finsbury Trust (formerly Scottish and
Mercantile) owns 23.6 per cent of Ocean Wilsons and Salomon family interests
own a further 18.9 per cent.
Ocean Wilsons made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.19m (Pounds 4.41m) in 1991
and earnings per share were 4.6p (4.85p). No final dividend is being
recommended but if the deal goes through, the Bermudan company will
recommend a gross payment of 2.66p, equivalent to last year's net 2p.
If shareholders approve the deal at meetings on June 10, it is hoped that
the new shares will be listed on July 13.

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort ready for talks on international
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson, the UK merchant banking group, is about to reactivate
negotiations with Banque Nationale de Paris and Dresdner Bank about joining
their international alliance.
These negotiations are expected to begin now that Dresdner, the second
biggest German bank, and BNP, France's number two bank, have passed an
important milestone in their separate talks on the formation of an
international alliance.
On Friday Dresdner told its shareholders that preliminary agreement had been
reached with BNP on a deal which would involve the two banks taking a stake
of up to 10 per cent in each other and forming a joint venture linking their
international operations.
Having cleared that hurdle, they will now start negotiations with KB.
The London based merchant bank had preliminary discussions with BNP on
forming a link with it a year ago, when BNP bought a 4.5 per cent stake in
KB. But these talks were frozen while BNP began its detailed negotiations
with Dresdner.
Bankers say that in the coming month, negotiations between KB and both
Dresdner and BNP will start. Initially these talks will concentrate on
whether KB can make an agreement with the two banks to co-operate on
international business.
However, if there is a basis for forming a tri-partite international
alliance, then Dresdner is likely to take a shareholding in KB and BNP is
likely to lift its KB investment.
Some KB directors believe that BNP and Dresdner should either make an
outright takeover bid to acquire 100 per cent of KB or they should restrict
their shareholding to a minority stake. They are uncomfortable about the
idea that BNP and Dresdner might between them control a majority stake of
less than 100 per cent.
It is likely that the banks will decide in the next three months whether a
deal involving all three of them is possible. KB believes that uncertainty
about whether the deal will take place could be damaging to its business.
Nonetheless, the French and German banks still have to surmount an important
hurdle before they can conclude their own separate alliance. They have yet
to put a price on each other's shares as a basis for carrying out the share
swap.

Palma Group, manufacturer and distributor of hosiery and knitted garments,
made substantial inroads into its losses in the year ended January 26 1992.
'I believe that the clearing away of our group's past problems is now nearly

reorganised and refocused and management structure strengthened
considerably, he explained.
Turnover in the year was Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 29.9m previous 13 months) and
generated a trading profit of Pounds 453,000 (loss Pounds 436,000). With
interest charges being cut to Pounds 942,000 (Pounds 1.55m) the pre-tax
deficit worked through at Pounds 278,000 (Pounds 2m).
Losses per share were 1.47p (7.97p).

Automagic Holdings, which operates shops taking in shoe repairs and dry
cleaning, stayed in the red in the half year ended January 11 1992.
The loss for 28 weeks came to Pounds 436,000. That compared with a profit of
Pounds 43,000 for the comparable 37 weeks, but that was turned into a
deficit of Pounds 96,000 for the 61 weeks ended June 29 1991.
Turnover in the period was Pounds 6.47m (Pounds 8.73m) which produced an
operating loss of Pounds 228,000 (profit Pounds 339,000). There were
exceptional charges of Pounds 55,000, of which Pounds 42,000 accounted for
director's compensation and loss on sale of properties.
Losses per share reached 7.03p (earnings 0.49p).

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Non-trading side lifts Alexanders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDERS Holdings, the largest Ford main dealer in Scotland, saw its
pre-tax profit rise from Pounds 207,000 to Pounds 408,000 in the six months
ended March 31 1992, as it was boosted by non-trading activities.
Turnover fell to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 43.9m) and the operating profit was
lower reflecting, said Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, who heads the group, the
impact of continuing and seriously depressed conditions in the motor sector
affecting both volume and margin.
They were exacerbated by the disruption which accompanied the acquisition
and refurbishment of the new facilities at Greenock and major refurbishment
at Kirkintilloch.
Non-trading activities lifting the profit were a surplus on proceeds of life
policy Pounds 342,000 and surplus on sale of property Pounds 56,000, less
compensation for loss of office Pounds 90,000 which is subject to
shareholder approval at the next annual meeting.
Earnings per share were 1.065p (0.381p). The directors expect to maintain
the year's dividend at 1p.

FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Celltech and British Biotech plan float in
next two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CELLTECH AND British Biotechnology, the two largest UK-based biotechnology
companies, are both planning to float on the stock market within the next
two years. Both are losing money heavily and need new funds to bring
promising new products to market.
British Biotechnology, which turned over Pounds 5.2m in 1991 is likely to go
for a public listing in July this year if its institutional shareholders
agree at a meeting to be held on Wednesday this week.
The company is likely to be floated both in London and New York. It intends
to raise about Pounds 50m, giving the company a value of around Pounds 170m.
It has appointed the investment banks Kleinwort Benson in the UK and Morgan
Stanley in the US as advisers.
It will be the first UK biotechnology company to go public and the first to
attempt the trick job of floating simultaneously in the US and UK.
Celltech, which lost Pounds 6.58m in 1991 on a turnover of Pounds 17m is
planning to float no later than 1994. It has announced a deal with the Bayer
company of Germany through which Bayer will market a new Celltech drug for
the treatment of septic shock. The deal could be worth Pounds 25m over
several years.
Both companies need the proceeds of flotation to fund further research
especially as potential products enter the stage of complex clinical trials.
British Biotechnology, which lost Pounds 7.8m in 1991, points out that it is
a 'development stage company that does not yet market or sell pharmaceutical
products'.
In the five years since its formation, however, it has put together a
portfolio of potentially money-spinning products including an Aids vaccine,
an anti-cancer drug, a treatment for asthma and a drug for the control of
arthritis.

FT  18 MAY 92 / EC poised to rule on capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE EC directive, removing one of the City of London's most
important competitive advantages, could be agreed by member states by next
month.
The Capital Adequacy Directive, under discussion for four years, will set
minimum levels of capital for EC securities firms. This will abolish a key
advantage of UK-based securities firms, which have to carry less capital to
back their business than their continental European competitors.
In a last-minute compromise, the proposed rules have been watered down to
make them more palatable to underwriters in London's equity and
international bond markets. The compromise is due to be put to EC economic
and finance ministers tomorrow, and could be adopted before the end of June.
An earlier proposal by the commission - a ban on firms taking exposures to
particular securities of more than 25 per cent of their capital - has been
scrapped. The commission has opted instead for a sliding scale of additional
capital requirements, which become more onerous the longer the exposure
remains.
Existing underwriting practices and 'bought deals', under which firms buy
blocks of shares or bonds from a company before selling them on to
investors, will continue. However, this will require more capital, and so
become more expensive. so In the first 10 days of taking on a large
exposure, firms would need three times the normal capital backing. After
this, the amount of capital would rise sharply.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Toyota set to seek Dollars 1bn in record bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the Japanese motor manufacturer, plans to raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds
500m) in the biggest-ever offer by a company in the international bond
market.
The transaction, expected this week, marks the most prominent step by a
major Japanese company to refinance its part in the 1980s equity warrant
boom.
While Japanese share prices soared in the last part of the decade, companies
like Toyota raised money at virtually no cost by issuing bonds with
warrants. These warrants, giving the holder the right to buy a companies'
shares at a set price in the future, were stripped from the bonds and traded
separately.
Toyota issued Dollars 800m of warrant bonds with an interest rate of 1 1/4
per cent a year.
In theory, the cash from selling Toyota shares to the warrant holders would
repay the bondholders. In practice, the warrants will not be exercised,
since the company's shares have fallen below the price at which the warrants
can be exercised.
In all, Dollars 36bn of warrants and convertible bonds issued by Japanese
companies come up for repayment this year, with a further Dollars 83.9bn due
next year. The collapse of Japanese share prices means most will have to be
refinanced, a fact expected to cause congestion in some capital markets,
particularly the domestic Japanese corporate bond market.
Toyota is unusual in having a top triple-A credit rating and an
internationally recognised name which together make it possible to
contemplate such a big money-raising exercise in the international market,
or Euromarket. However, the size of the issue is likely to force it to pay
more for the cash than for a typical Euromarket bond issue.
'There won't be many Japanese companies which can refinance warrants in the
dollar market like this,' said one banker with a close knowledge of the
Toyota transaction. The rest of the Dollars 1bn will meet research and
development costs.
The Euromarket faces a glut of dollar bond issues. Last week Canada's
province of Ontario, one of the international bond market's most active
borrowers, said it planned 'global' issues with an offer of more than
Dollars 1bn of bonds. These allow borrowers to issue bonds simultaneously in
the main domestic centres, creating a single large issue.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: The OECD reaches a crossroads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next couple of days, a nondescript office building in Paris's
fashionable 16th arrondissement will become a mecca for finance, trade and
foreign ministers from the world's 24 leading industrial countries.
The event - the annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development - is an established staging post on the way to
the world economic summit of the Group of Seven nations which takes place
this year in Munich from July 6 to July 8.
As always, the ministers will have a full agenda, embracing issues from
rising unemployment in the OECD area, through world growth or the lack of
it, the failure to complete the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks,
to how best to help the ex-communist states of the former Soviet Union and
eastern Europe integrate with the industrial world's market economies.
But it would be a pity if they did not this year stop to think about the
future of the organisation hosting the meeting.
The OECD is at a crossroads. It is not a global body like the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank which have most of the developing and former
communist countries among their members. It has no cash to disburse in
return for good economic behaviour. It is also difficult to escape the
conclusion that its members are taking it less seriously.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, and Mrs Carla Hills, the US
special trade representative, decided at short notice not to attend this
year's ministerial meeting. Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance
minister, cancelled his attendance last Friday.
Britain, too, is adopting a low-key approach to this week's talks, unlike
last year when three cabinet ministers attended. Mr Michael Portillo, the
new chief secretary to the treasury, will deputise for Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor and be accompanied by junior ministers.
And yet countries other than the 24 members of the club are clamouring to
join or be associated with the OECD. The collapse of communism and the
adoption by more countries of market-based economic systems and democratic
government have meant many nations either have, or aspire to have, the style
of life characteristic of the industrialised and pluralist societies of the
OECD during its 30 years.
These countries seeks expertise. The OECD plays a unique role in the
exchange and dissemination of knowledge. Its secretariat provides
non-partisan analysis on a growing number of issues, ranging from
macro-economics to trade, the environment, health and the impact of
technological change on society.
Perhaps more important, it is one of the few places where officials of
member countries can exchange views without the risk of committing
themselves or their governments in negotiations.
These two facets of the organisation's activities mean it can act as a
clearing house for ideas. In OECD committees, away from the public eye, some
of the more stupid national preoccupations that would otherwise snag
international negotiations can be discussed and amended or allowed to die a
natural death.
But how should the OECD respond to requests for co-operation and even
membership from interested countries in east Asia, eastern Europe, Latin
America and the former Soviet Union? With 24 members from Europe, North
America and the Pacific rim, it is already unwieldy. The budgetary
constraints of its member governments have also ensured it does not have the
cash for grandiose projects.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general, has responded cautiously to the
sudden popularity with non-members. He sees three concentric circles around
the nucleus of member countries.
an inner circle of countries which take part in the work of OECD committees.
These would include Mexico, which sits in the steel committee, South Korea,
a member of the working party on shipbuilding, and Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and Poland, the 'partners in transition'.
fast-developing countries such as the Asian 'tigers'. Dialogue between the
OECD and countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia would
not take part in formal committees but through workshops or conferences.
less developed countries. The OECD would have only limited contact with
these.
Such a structure would be flexible because countries could graduate from one
group to another, even to full membership. It would also recognise the
growing tendency for the world to develop in regional economic groups.
Building on this idea, Mr Paye has suggested the OECD could become the main
forum for dialogue between the industrialised world and other groups such as
the newly industrialising Asean countries of Asia or Latin American nations
moving towards greater economic co-operation. The organisation could also
help relations between the European Community, North America and Japan, as
the EC and the members of the planned North American Free Trade Area develop
into more cohesive economic areas.
If the OECD is to develop as a meeting point between the industrialised
world and other country groups it will have to know more about the countries
outside its 24-nation area.
But it also faces a more serious challenge. In recent years, members have
fallen behind traditionally protectionist countries such as Chile,
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Mexico in the promotion of free trade and open
markets. This development, if allowed to continue, bodes ill for an
organisation pledged to fostering a healthy world economy based on a
multilateral and non-discriminatory trading system.
Unless the organisation's members start taking these obligations under OECD
convention more seriously, the OECD could become a forum for dispute among
regional groups rather than the 'pre-eminent forum for dialogue' that Mr
Paye envisages.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Fresh blows rain on to Tokyo's brokers: The year-end
accounts reveal the full misery of Japan's securities industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stirrings of recovery in Tokyo share prices in the past month had
prompted some securities houses to believe the worst of the market collapse
was over and the time had come for investors to 'accumulate'.
But the confidence-building lasted only until Friday, when the Nikkei stock
average dived, 12 of the country's 14 leading brokers announced losses for
the financial year ended March, and the market talk was of which houses
would be most vulnerable in the tough year ahead.
The accounts revealed the full misery of the Japanese securities industry
and, in particular, the fragility of some second-tier brokers, whose once
ambitious plans for expansion have been replaced by survival strategies.
In the first of what may be a succession of rescues, Yamatane Securities
confirmed on Friday it would be assisted by Sakura Bank, formerly Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank. But the bank is unwilling to embrace the troubled broker
until former executives leave the board.
Yamatane and other brokers are in trouble because the Nikkei average fell
26.4 per cent during the past financial year, while daily trading value last
calendar year was Y435.4bn (Pounds 1.84bn), down from Y716.7bn in 1990 and
Y1,308bn in 1989, when the market's surge peaked.
At the same time, individual investors lost faith after a series of
scandals, including the compensation of large corporate clients for trading
losses, dealings with gangster groups, and the shuffling of stocks from one
client account to another to avoid booking losses.
The costs of slump and scandal were unevenly distributed, with Nomura
Securities, the largest house, showing its strength, and two of the other
Big Four brokers, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, weakened but able
to report pre-tax profits for the year.
Yamaichi Securities, the remaining member of the quartet, is less healthy,
reporting a large loss on its stock dealings, Y36.9bn, and a pre-tax loss of
Y36.5bn, after a profit of Y67.6bn in the previous year.
Another important measure of brokers' health is provided by a Ministry of
Finance capital-to-assets ratio, which takes into account unrealised gains
on securities holdings, asset quality and operating expenses, and sets
thresholds for government intervention. Warning lights are activated when
the ratio passes below 200 per cent, while brokers with 150 per cent or less
are forbidden from opening new branches, and the ministry is supposed to
begin daily monitoring of a broker at 120 per cent.
The Big Four reported falls in their capital ratios, with Nomura down from
615 per cent to 580 per cent over the year, and uncomfortably large declines
at Daiwa, down from 360 per cent to to 288 per cent, and Yamaichi, from 357
per cent to 302 per cent.
But the most troubling falls were in the second tier, where Sanyo
Securities, which had visions of itself as a big-league broker, was down
from 256.8 per cent to 141.1 per cent. Not surprisingly, Sanyo said on
Friday that three overseas offices, Madrid, Milan and Toronto, would be
closed over the next month.
Two other brokers fell below 200 per cent. Cosmo Securities was down from
257 per cent to 182 per cent, and Yamatane Securities plunged from 422.1 per
cent to 183.3 per cent. Dai-Ichi Securities, at 202.2 per cent, was just
above the line, as was Kankaku Securities at 212 per cent.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, at SG Warburg Securities (Japan), said capital ratios were
under pressure because the brokers were cutting costs, but 'their income is
falling even faster'. She says a typical second-tier company requires a
daily turnover of at least 600m shares to ensure profits - last year the
Tokyo average was 373m shares, down from 877m in 1989.
Commission income fell at all leading houses, with the larger houses more
active than the medium-sized in the public and corporate bond market. At
Yamaichi, for example, underwriting of bonds rose 12 per cent, while
commission revenue at the bond division fell 15 per cent, compared with a 40
per cent fall in stock commission revenue and a 22 per cent fall in
investment trust commissions.
Net losses on securities dealings were reported at six of the 14 largest
brokers. Four houses lost on bond dealings, but biggest losses, as expected,
were on stock trading accounts. Top of the ladder was Yamaichi which lost
Y36.9bn, followed by Daiwa with Y19.4bn and Kankaku with Y11.8bn. The
largest loss on bond trading was reported by New Japan Securities - Y11.4bn.
Operating expenses were cut by all 14 brokers, with the largest decline at
Dai-Ichi Securities (23 per cent), Yamatane (18 per cent), Nomura (16 per
cent), and Okasan Securities (16 per cent). But, at Nomura, for instance,
the biggest cut was in interest expenses (down 54 per cent), and not in
selling and administrative costs (down 11 per cent). At Sanyo, the latter
expenses were down only 6 per cent, and at Kankaku they actually rose by 1
per cent.
However, Japanese brokers are still confident that trimming expenses will
tide them over until the market climbs again.
That optimism is reflected in Nomura forecasts of a 36 per cent increase in
pre-tax profit this year on a 2 per cent rise in operating income. Yamaichi
expects its Y36.5bn loss to become a Y30bn profit on a bullish 21 per cent
lift in operating income. Nikko and Daiwa aim at 3 to 4 per cent gains in
operating income.
But, as Friday's fall in the Nikkei showed, the market is still delicate,
and in the current year, already weakened companies may have to do more than
revise ambitious profit forecasts and make superficial cuts in costs.

FT  18 MAY 92 / HK Bank may sweeten Midland bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation is working on plans to improve the
terms of its takeover offer for Midland Bank by providing Midland's
shareholders with cash rather than bonds.
It is understood HSBC is at an advanced stage of talks with leading US
investment banks which would involve those banks buying the new bonds and
then placing them with their investment clients. The funds raised could then
be distributed to Midland's shareholders, many of whom have complained to
Hongkong Bank that they want cash in place of the bonds.
Hongkong Bank's bid terms are one new share and 100p of new bonds for each
Midland share. If the bid goes through, it would issue Pounds 703m of the
new bonds.
Although Midland shareholders do not want the bonds, US investment banks
believe investment institutions on the Continent and the US would buy them.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Hongkong Bank has formulated a 'nuclear option'
to prevent Midland being bought by Lloyds Bank, which also says it wants to
buy the UK clearing bank.
If Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, became convinced Midland's
shareholders were prepared to sit out a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation of Lloyds' proposed takeover before deciding whether to accept
his bid or Lloyds' terms, he could announce that Hongkong Bank would never
sell its 15 per cent stake in Midland.
Lloyds would then never be able to buy more than 90 per cent of Midland's
shares and would not achieve complete integration of its operations with
Midland. It needs at least 90 per cent to meld the two businesses
completely.
In those circumstances, Mr Purves believes Midland's shareholders would be
under intense pressure to back his takeover, bankers with a close knowledge
of his intentions say.
The next 10 days will be crucial to the battle for Midland between Hongkong
Bank and Lloyds. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, is
expected to follow the advice of the Office of Fair Trading that the Lloyds
bid should be referred to the MMC, but not that of Hongkong Bank.
Lloyds would then have to decide whether to drop its pre-condition not to
bid if there is an MMC investigation.

FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, Fiat maintained its dividend even though its attributable
profits were halved. Investors who thought that payout signalled confidence
about recovery were badly mistaken. The question is what they are to make of
last Friday's 30 per cent fall in Fiat's 1991 profits and the accompanying
40 per cent dividend cut.
If anything, the recovery argument is rather stronger this time, not least
because Italian car demand unexpectedly rose by 4 per cent in the first
quarter of this year. There is still room for doubt, in particular about the
scope for losses in the tractor division. But the lower base for the
dividend makes a further cut unlikely, and Fiat should avoid making an
overall loss this year. Judging by the rise in its shares after the figures
were announced, the market believes that Fiat is close to turning the
corner. The ride could be bumpy all the same.

FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the world's investing institutions brace themselves for this summer's
massive sale of Wellcome shares, they might care to ponder the accompanying
chart. Relative to the UK drug sector as a whole, Wellcome has enjoyed three
big surges in the past five years. The first was based on the original Aids
panic, the second on clearance for Wellcome's Aids drug, Retrovir, for use
in pre-Aids carriers of HIV. The third owed much to the realisation that if
Retrovir was slightly disappointing, Wellcome's older anti-viral drug
Zovirax was a goldmine. Given the switchback history of the shares, might it
not be time for another downward leg?
Part of the answer depends on Wellcome's drugs in development. Zovirax and
Retrovir between them account for nearly half of Wellcome's sales and much
more than half its profit. The future of Retrovir - better known as AZT - is
as cloudy as ever, but it still has a huge lead over its competitors.
Wellcome has several other Aids treatments in development, all based on the
same approach.
The strategy for Zovirax is largely defensive. The drug's potential against
shingles and chickenpox is huge, but it loses patent protection in Europe in
the mid-1990s and in the US in 1997. Wellcome has a new compound known as
256U, related to Zovirax but allegedly more effective, which should be
cleared in time to take its place. Meanwhile, it is pushing Zovirax as a
non-prescription cream against cold sores.
It also has drugs on the way against conditions as diverse as strokes,
depression, arthritis and migraine. A couple of new drugs against epilepsy
and cancer are thought particularly promising. Nevertheless, the company
could remain heavily dependent on anti-viral drugs for the rest of the
decade.
But there is a separate question. The company's history is that of a
charitable institution grounded in pure science. Some of that tradition died
in the run-up to flotation six years ago. Under the new marketing-oriented
management, more is being jettisoned. There was never any doubt about
Wellcome's ability to invent new compounds. The question is whether it can
wring more commercial benefit from its scientific ethos without damaging it.
If that trick is pulled off, the shares are a long-term buy wherever they
may be on the switchback.

FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Groupe Suez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was touching last Friday to hear Suez group chairman Mr Gerard Worms
single out shareholder satisfaction as one of his chief priorities for the
next few years. Suez, after all, has been as guilty as any French company of
treating investors with disdain - useful in so far as they stump up new
capital when asked, inconvenient to the extent that they demand information
and an adequate financial return.
Sceptics will say that they have heard the pious promises before, but it
could just be that the company now means what it says. Mr Worms is clearly
conscious of the group's poor rating, and even acknowledges that its
sprawling structure may be partly responsible. Under his leadership there
seems a renewed and welcome commitment to financial assets - the area Suez
knows best - and a determination to shake off peripheral industrial
interests which came with the headlong expansion of the late 1980s. Some
FF8bn of disposals have been completed in the past 18 months, and, though no
target has been set, there is clearly more to come. Suez is under no
particular financial pressure, but is anxious to take advantage of
privatisations in France when opportunities arrive.
The signs are that Acec-Union Miniere, the highly cyclical non-ferrous
metals subsidiary which so distorted last year's results, is getting to
grips with its problems. Confusion over the insurance strategy will be ended
when negotiations with UAP over Victoire's Colonia stake are finally
settled.

FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The value of security
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing ever seems to turn out right in banking. In the early 1980s bankers
discovered that, despite all the theory to the contrary, sovereign borrowers
could effectively default on their debts. So they must have thought they
were on to a good thing by lending against the physical security of
property. After Olympia &amp; York, they are learning that this theory does not
necessarily hold either. Moreover, when a borrower is in deep trouble, a
secured loan may not be worth much more than an unsecured one - as banks
whose loans to the Maxwell empire were secured against equity in MCC have
also found to their cost.
That raises the question of how banks should judge the creditworthiness of
their customers. The obvious answer, in an environment where asset prices
are no longer rising, is to revert to the yardstick of cash-flow. What
concerns a bank most is that its loan should be serviced. That a building is
worth less than the money lent against it may not matter if it produces
enough rental income to cover the debt.
Unfortunately this criterion too is flawed. Commercial rents can fall. They
are still soft in New York despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to
stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates. Seemingly free cash-flow
can turn out to be committed elsewhere. The sad conclusion is that lending
is an inherently risky business; a sadder one still is that banks seem
incapable of learning to price that risk correctly. Perhaps that is why
British banks have underperformed the market by 30 per cent over the past 20
years.

FT  18 MAY 92 / A damaging fall at the highest fence of reform: Moves to
revise South Africa's constitution have stalled over the question of veto
powers for minority groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A blackboard is useless without white chalk.' Crudely put
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
by Mr Amichand Rajbansi, leader of the Indian National People's Party in
South Africa - that is the bald truth of South African life which rose up
like a spectre to shock the participants at last weekend's constitutional
talks.
For after five months of halting progress within the multi-party negotiating
forum known as the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the
country's political leaders fell at the last and highest fence: the share of
white political power in the new black nation.
By the time Codesa's two-day plenary session had ended on Saturday, they had
picked themselves up, dusted each other off, and declared the conference a
success. Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress
(ANC), the main black leader at the talks, praised the 'remarkable job' done
by Codesa and portrayed the 200-odd delegates as members of a happy
multi-racial family. Mr FW de Klerk, the President and leader of the ruling
National Party, congratulated the gathering for transforming crisis to
success.
But away from the conference hall - where communal lunches and cocktail
parties have bred a spirit of inter-racial bonhomie which would make Mr
Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of apartheid, turn in his grave - the message
was blunt, and negative. 'Despite all the hard preparatory work put in,
nothing concrete has emerged. The negotiation process has stalled. It is
urgently necessary to revive it,' said the Patriotic Front, the ANC-led bloc
which includes other anti-apartheid groups.
Senior officials from both the Patriotic Front and the Government camp
(which includes some black homeland leaders, the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party
and leaders of the discredited Indian and Coloured parties in the current
parliament) made clear that the gap between them remains large. The issue is
whether whites and other minorities should be allowed to exercise a veto
over the writing of the new constitution, and whether minorities should be
further protected by a federal constitution which devolves much power to
regional and local level.
The National Party position is that South Africa's fragmented society -
rendered so by apartheid - cannot be governed except by consensus. 'No
majority should ever be able to misuse its power to undermine the
constitution or to dominate minorities,' Mr de Klerk vowed.
Toward that end, the National Party demanded a 75 per cent majority of
delegates pass the most contentious clauses of a new constitution: the bill
of rights and, crucially, the clause setting out the powers of regional and
local governments which may be minority-dominated. Other clauses would be
passed by a 70 per cent majority. But the Nationalists also demanded the
creation of a senate under a final constitution, which would give
disproportionately large representation to minorities. These proposals are
designed to allow the National Party, in alliance with other ethnic minority
parties, to veto majority decisions.
The ANC proposed a two-thirds majority (which it assumes would be too high
to allow a National Party veto). It offered to accept a 70 per cent majority
(with 75 per cent to approve the bill of rights), but then insisted that a
popular referendum be called if that majority could not be achieved.
The dispute has now been referred back to a committee representing the 19
Codesa parties. They have been given three weeks to solve it, and it is
difficult to see how they will do so. For while the gap appears small in
percentage points, the final figure will determine whether blacks have the
power to write what is essentially a majority-rule constitution, or whether
whites and other minorities can entrench minority protections.
De facto or de jure, whites will have a veto over the new South Africa.
'There's a white veto right now,' points out Mr Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, a
political commentator. 'It lies in the army, in the economy, in the capacity
of capital to flee the country.' The battle now is over whether it is
entrenched in a constitution.
Neither side has so far demonstrated the political will to overcome this
obstacle. This is not brinksmanship, but a fundamental dispute over who
wields power. For while Mr de Klerk closed the conference by urging the need
for 'compromising on basics", it soon became apparent that this advice was
aimed solely at the ANC. Both sides seem to think that the other is in a
hurry to settle: outsiders find it difficult to reach the same conclusion.
The National Party, especially, seems content to sit tight. Despite
multiplying revelations of security force murders of political activists and
government corruption scandals Mr de Klerk appears confident and in no rush
to relinquish power. His negotiating team has been plagued by illness: one
senior minister is on sick leave due to exhaustion, another resigned after a
nervous collapse. But Mr de Klerk seems calm and collected.
ANC negotiators, trained in the trade union movement, are bearing up well so
far. But they have yet to feel the ire of their constituents, anxious to
benefit from the spoils of power. Their expectations cannot be frustrated
forever.
Nobody would disagree that South Africa pays a high price for delay. Mr
Mandela pleaded the case for speed: 'The question that faces us all is - how
long can we, who claim to be the leaders of our people, sit here, spin out
complicated forumlae and enjoy the applause while the country sinks deeper
into crisis?'
He concluded with a veiled threat of mass insurrection: 'Let none of us make
the mistake of thinking that the people will do nothing to change their
condition. Not only do the masses have the right, they have the duty to
engage in struggle to change their condition, change any government or
leader they see as acting against their common good.'
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest union
federation with over 1m members, has said it will stage a general strike
next month unless a multi-racial interim government is installed by then.
This is no idle threat: last November, Cosatu led a 2-day strike which
paralysed the economy.
Despite this threat, Codesa failed to remove obstacles to the early
installation of a multi-racial interim government. Because of its failure,
multi-party control of the security forces, crucial to contain the violence
which has left 11,000 people dead since 1984, has been postponed. Remaining
economic sanctions, which would largely have been lifted on installation of
an interim government, will stay in place.
US commercial banks will not lend to Pretoria, several US companies believed
to be interested in investment will hold off, and lending from the World
Bank and IMF remains a distant prospect.
And while Codesa searches for a political solution, the economy remains in a
three-year recession, millions are jobless, homeless and hungry. Codesa's
negotiators ignore these pressures at their peril. For if they follow the
advice which doomed the rest of Africa - the dictat from Mr Kwame Nkrumah,
Ghana's first independence ruler, 'seek ye first the political kingdom' -
they may achieve political power only to regret it.

   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many will profoundly disagree with David Elyan's view. Such
private/public company links are usually beneficial. I would cite the Civil
Aviation Authority, a nationalised service, with a board dominated by
private sector non-executives as an excellent quid pro quo.
I suspect this civil servant's fees will be paid to her principal employer.
A recent survey for Pro Ned of non-executive fees showed: kept in full (47
per cent), paid to employer (30 per cent), salary offset (6 per cent) - with
a significant increase in those paid to the principal employer when they had
been directly or indirectly instrumental in the individual's non-executive
appointment.

<TEXT>
Sir Mr Elyan's understanding of non-executive directorships (Letters, May
15) is regrettably limited. The government encourages its senior staff to
take non-executive directorships with major companies. We need productive
interchange of ideas and experience. It is essential for senior civil
servants to understand the needs of business and the context in which it
works, just as business needs an insight into workings of government.
Each appointment is carefully vetted to ensure that there are not conflicts
between the company and the civil servant's official duties. None of the
officials in this department who is a non-executive director receives a fee.
Where a fee is paid it passes via this department to the exchequer.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: Engineering firms in the south-east not complacent
over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM SCOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Earnings rise continues' (May 15) suggests the
manufacturing sector shows 'complacency over its pay-setting arrangements'.
With a membership of over 700 engineering companies in the south-east, the
Engineering Employers London Association represents an important part of the
manufacturing sector. In recent times, pay settlements have been some two
percentage points below the average rise in earnings, and EELA has recorded
a 12-month moving average of 4.02 per cent as of April 1992, well below the
quoted earnings rise of 8.25 per cent in manufacturing. Wage drift has been
minimal.
Significantly, EELA has recorded that pay deferments and pay freezes still
constitute over 20 per cent of all settlements, and, taking this into
account, the average settlement during April 1992 was 2.95 per cent, also
well below the quoted floor of 4 per cent.
I suggest engineering in the south-east is well aware of the ERM constraints
imposed. More importantly, the ability to award higher-than-inflation pay
increases is limited by pressure on profit margins as material prices
continue to rise faster than output prices.
Caution has enabled many companies to gain a competitive edge both in export
markets and in the UK. Encouragingly, EELA's quarterly business activity
survey for the first quarter of 1992, with additional forecasts, shows the
first signs of recovery.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Maladies at the heart of the body politic: Jurek Martin
keeps a doctor's appointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A political doctor responds to a patient's questions.
Q: Doctor, where are we now on the American presidential election?
A: Where we are is that George Bush will be the Republican nominee, Bill
Clinton the Democratic nominee and Ross Perot will probably run as an
independent. That is the only safe clinical observation to make. Previous
diagnoses suggesting an internal eruption of the Democratic party emanating
from the capital of New York state or outer space may now be discarded.
Does this competition imply health in the body politic?
The body politic is not healthy. How could it be with trillions of dollars'
debt, Dollars 400bn of deficits, the second-largest city in flames, and the
great Red corpuscle threat now into convertible roubles?
Is President Bush himself as healthy as he was after his operation in the
desert last year?
Obviously not; the domestic climate does not suit him and the global warming
of the cold war takes him out of his element. His planned trip to Rio de
Janeiro next month should carry a severe health warning and his cure in the
economic waters of Munich in July offers no panacea. The president is
suffering from a severe case of political dyslexia, unable to translate what
he reads and thinks into action, or possibly vice versa. I am not saying it
is terminal but the prognosis must be very guarded. I recommend external
electric shock treatment, say an invasion of Peru, which would have the
double dose of saving democracy and bashing a Japanese (President Fujimori)
in one fell stroke.
What do the White House physicians say?
They speak with many tongues, which is part of the problem. Doctors Quayle
and Fitzwater keep reminding him to stay with the course of conservative
prescriptions which worked well for him in the 1980s. Dr Kemp wants a more
radical approach and now has him visiting clinics in most cities in the
country. Drs Baker and Cheney, experts in tropical medicine, seem to have
been taken off the case.
What about Governor Clinton? I thought his case was terminal.
He is still not well. All the early spring maladies are still coursing
around his system. He has a good mind and a strong constitution, which
primary micro-surgery has improved, but he could easily catch another severe
bout of the ague. Republican researchers, specialists in Horton's disease,
are confident they can unearth further viral complications, but it is not
clear if these will be fatal.
Mr Perot seems pretty vigorous these days. Is this attributable to the Texas
air?
Possibly. His health owes much to not living in Washington which is
notoriously claustrophobic (the politico-medical term is Beltway Bursitis
which afflicts the body's moving parts when decisions have to be taken).
Normally, phenomena like Mr Perot are ephemeral, particularly if, as in his
case, close investigation, using the latest media probes, reveals skeletons
(Nixon and North) rattling round inside. But his ability to buy the best
medical care available, regardless of the cost, could bring a degree of
longer-lasting immunity, as could his refusal to answer questions about the
specific nature of his complaints.
Is there a universal medicine which could help all of them?
A very difficult question; what is needed is a cure for disaffectitis.
Classically the best results can be achieved through an accommodating media,
without which it is impossible to understand what the candidates are saying
or complaining about. However, all diagnosis in this medium must last no
longer than 10 seconds, unless it be about the Northern Spotted Owl, which
is not running for anything except possibly from chainsaws.
Picking up from that, would you say that politicians themselves are an
endangered species?
Well, they certainly must be very careful these days. The body of Congress
is losing healthy members by the dozen - some to talk show programmes where
they think they have more influence.
What about amendments to the constitution? They have been useful in the
past, haven't they?
Sometimes; certainly it was thought prohibition would make the body politic
less paralytic. Just last week the states ratified a 200-year-old amendment
stopping Congress giving itself pay raises and Congress itself is about to
pass an amendment prohibiting the federal government from spending more than
it takes in. However, money, like alcohol, is a narcotic from which there is
no easy withdrawal, which explains why I am charging you Dollars 500 an hour
for this consultation, claimable, of course, on your medical insurance
policy.
I had better stop then. What is your prognosis for this election?
A political doctor, when not spinning, can only stick to the facts. The only
medical certainty this year is that all three presidential candidates will
be left-handed. This is unprecedented. Can you wonder the country is
disturbed?

FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: The Mystery of Dr Martinu - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 22 years, no less, since Ken Russell last made a film for the BBC. The
Mystery of Dr Martinu, screened on BBC2 on Saturday to open the channel's
season of Collaborations and Commissions, offered a belated postscript to
the Martinu centenary in 1990 as well as a splendidly batty study of one of
twentieth-century music's more elusive figures. Personal prejudice needs to
butt in here. There are few celebrated composers of any nationality or any
century whose music infuriates me more than Martinu's, none whose works,
with the single exception of the opera Julietta, seems more trivial or
dispensable. But even after watching Dr Martinu it's still difficult to work
out just what Ken Russell thinks of the music, or indeed of Martinu himself
as anything but a suitable case for televisual fantasy.
His life was that of a wandering composer - from Bohemia to Paris, Paris to
New York, and finally back to France - his musical output staggeringly vast,
much of it still unpublished. The crux of Russell's film was Martinu's
breakdown in the late 1940s. The fantasies and fears of that period provided
him with a rich parade of images - a troop of deaf-mute girls dabbling in
rock pools on the seashore, images of the composer's hands alive with ants,
and, repeatedly, a lighthouse from which a beautiful girl endlessly beckons
and from whose delights Martinu is barred by a succession of uniformed
doormen.
A key to all this was provided by the final confrontation between Martinu
and his analyst, teasing out the threads and obsessions in a script of
unashamed banality. The girl, for instance, turned out to have been a
student with whom Martinu had had an affair in Paris, and with whom he had
been discovered in flagrante by his ever faithful wife. But Russell never
made a connection between any of this and the music, so that the soundtrack
of blithely trivial works counterpointing these lusciously choreographed
scenes appeared quite irrelevant.
Perhaps that was the point. Did Martinu always compose on automatic pilot,
careful to keep himself completely detached from his art? As he moved from
fashion to fashion he never found the style that he sought. The real mystery
of Dr Martinu is surely that a composer of such tremendous facility and
skill was able to hide his own personality so completely; confronted by
Russell's own fantasies he just didn't stand a chance.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: L'Opera Francaise in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City Opera season ended back in November and the Met season in
mid-April, but the city has not been left quite opera-less. L'Opera Francais
de New York put on three performances of a Milhaud centenary bill, Le Pauvre
Matelot and Esther de Carpentras; and the Juilliard gave the New York
premiere of Delius's Fennimore and Gerda.
Fennimore needs no long notice. Most of its productions from the British
premieres onward (BBC in 1962, staged by Hammersmith in 1968) have been
reviewed in these pages; and the Juilliard's version was essentially a
recreation of the St. Louis 1981 production, which visited the Edinburgh
Festival two years later.
Frank Corsaro, its producer (and the artistic director of the Juilliard
Opera Center) has long been Delius's American champion, responsible also for
the US premieres of Koanga (Washington, 1970), A Village Romeo and Juliet
(Washington, 1972, and then taken up by the City Opera for three seasons)
and Margot la Rouge (St. Louis, 1983).
His Delius productions, collaborations with the designer Ronald Chase, were
all executed behind a gauze, with a continuous show of movies, photographs
and paintings projected upon it while the actors appeared in pools of light
behind. This is a form of operatic presentation (we have had a Corsaro-Chase
Tote Stadt and Doktor Faust in the same mode) that proves undramatic.
Although a gauze may be acoustically transparent, it always seems to put a
damper on things, and it certainly inserts a visual barrier between the
singers and their audience. Moreover, the method emphasises only the dreamy,
movie-music aspect of Delius's scores.
The composer specified five 'pauses', of from three to five minutes, to
indicate the passing of time between his scenes. They would be dramatically
fatal; most producers ignore them; Corsaro inserted punctuation of his own
in the form of 'new-age' environmental tapes (the sounds of waves, winds,
and birds) - one six minutes long - accompanied by more home movies of
blossom and bough and by invented new actions behind the gauze.
But, as Beecham said of Fennimore, 'The problems confronting successful
production are not few in number.' Corsaro faced them, and though I didn't
much like his solutions, it was good to see and hear the opera again. We can
blame the gauze for the fact that the young singers did not come across
strongly. Christopher Keene conducted.
Le Pauvre Matelot has a grim, neat little Cocteau libretto: wife murders a
stranger for his wealth so that she can give it to her beloved sailor
husband, expected back after many years away; she has failed to recognise
him . . . Milhaud sets it 'objectively', to tuneful chanties handled in his
wrong-note and polytonal way. It is a clever, piquantly disturbing work.
Esther de Carpentras, a comedy, is closer to his Provencal and Jewish roots.
The Pope's nephew, a blithe young Cardinal, has been banished to Provence in
disgrace because in Rome he had an affair with a Jewish girl. He devises a
way to regain favour: when the Jews of Carpentras celebrate Purim with an
enactment of Esther, he takes over the role of Ahasuerus himself and offers
the company a choice between baptism and banishment. But when the beautiful
young actress playing Esther falls into his arms . . .
The score includes chromatic chant, Provencal mirth in the manner of Bizet's
L'Arlesienne, cabaret song, opera-comique couplets and a C-major fugue.
Milhaud was a bewilderingly uneven composer. As the Record Guide puts it,
his style 'varies from a dry gravity to a vulgar nonchalance', but 'if his
taste is uncertain, his music is hardly ever dull.'
For 30 years he was important on the American scene. Nearly a quarter of his
works (which run to Opus 464) had their first performances here. No big
celebration is billed - not even, in Columbus year, a professional
Christophe Colombe; not even a Creation du monde at the Philharmonic. But
L'Opera Francais is a stylish enterprise, with the exceptionally gifted
young Canadian conductor Yves Abel at its helm. I've enjoyed his Gluck,
Gretry and Bizet. In Milhaud he was equally alert and stylish.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: A new dome for Rome - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have just seen a wonder. The new mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre in
Rome by the distinguished architect Paolo Portoghesi is one of the very best
new buildings I have seen for a long time. First of all, it is remarkable as
the first and only mosque in the capital city of Christendom. Secondly, it
is brilliant as an advanced example of the work of a master architect and
historian.
Paolo Portoghesi won the commission to design this mosque as long ago as
1975. It is still being built on a site in the suburbs of Rome beyond
Parioli. Completion is probably due this autumn but there seems to be no
hurry - decoration of the interior by Moslem craftsmen continues slowly and
carefully. Work did not really begin until 1985 and when you visit the site
today there is an unusually calm sense of unhurried progress.
The domed mosque is only a part of a group of cultural buildings - a
library, prayer hall, school, auditorium and offices make up what Portoghesi
calls a small slice of the city. The approach to the new mosque is a
processional route that begins with a circular fountain set within a square,
along a gently ascending flight of shallow steps where water runs alongside
in a narrow channel, as it does in a Moghul garden. At the top of this
ascent, which is almost a modest echo of that climb to Aracoeli by the
Campidoglio, is a grand colonnaded square. Here the architect's real
ingenuity is manifest in three dimensions. There is a forest of smooth
concrete columns that divide and branch almost like trees. As the curved
branching tops of these columns overlap visually, the eye sees Islamic forms
cross and merge to make what appear to be the pointed shapes of Italian
Gothic. At the same time there are strong suggestions of the great Islamic
buildings at Cordoba.
To one side of this cloistered square is the mosque itself - entered through
a pair of giant doors, which the architect opened for me with an
appropriately large key. The interior is a glorious revelation. Portoghesi
has written about and studied the Italian Baroque as no other architect has.
In his mosque is all the absorbed knowledge of the past transformed into
something completely new. The inside of the beautiful dome floats above a
lacework of ribs. It is pierced to allow a series of precise rays of light
on to the tiled floor. The proportions of the dome are the same as those of
the Pantheon - a perfect sphere would fit beneath it. There is a sense of
total, calm rightness, emphasised by the complexity of the ring of the
branched columns that surround it.
I think it is Portoghesi's skill as a manipulator of light and structure
that makes this interior so successful. It is a complex but rewarding place
that intriguingly marries the mathematics and pattern making of the Middle
East to a truly Roman sense of architecture. There are some worries. Much
Islamic mosaic and carved decoration can be restrained and elegant. There
is, however, a real danger that modern versions of Islamic pattern making
can look kitsch. So far the Moroccan mosaicists have been responsive to the
architecture but it would be a tragedy if the pure beauty of the
architecture was overpowered by a layer of decoration of indifferent
quality. In the unfinished prayer hall one feels an incredible architectural
power, almost reminiscent of ancient Egypt. This could also be trivialised
by casual decoration.
The architect has used remarkable materials. The lowest floors are built
from large scale tufa bricks. The mass of the walls are made of the thinnest
Roman clay bricks that lie one upon another with scarcely any mortar -
yellow ones made from Aurelian clay and red ones from Flaminian. Travertine
marble trims the brickwork and is used for paving. The very subtle ribbed
dome - which deliberately manages not to look either Islamic or Roman - is
sheathed in lead. Traditional materials meet the prefabricated concrete
columns with perfect equanimity. In the same way Portoghesi's architecture
brings the intelligence of the past to the present - the result is
powerfully evocative but also completely new. Professor Portoghesi is a very
great architect.
We are lucky in England to learn that he has recently won a competition to
design a new building at St. Peter's College, Oxford. The Intellectual
Property Centre will form the fourth side of the south quadrangle of the
college. It will be Portoghesi's first building in this country and St.
Peter's must be congratulated on making such an enlightened choice.
It is a relatively small building that fills a very narrow site. It will be
on six floors and house the college law library, the intellectual property
law centre and teaching and residential space for visiting fellows. An
important part of the design is the landscape and patterning of the court
which adds a sense of dignified perspective to a quad of uneven
architectural quality. Portoghesi's arrangement of pediments and gables and
frames and cloisters seems to adopt elements from the disparate facades of
the quadrangle and harmonise them into an intricate geometry that will be a
most distinguished and intelligent addition to the architecture of Oxford.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 18 years since it was new, the Royal Opera's production of La Boheme
has played host to most of the leading tenors of a generation, including the
big three of Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti. With the marvellous music that
Puccini gave his Rodolfo this can easily become a tenor's opera and that is
exactly what happened at the first night of this revival on Saturday.
The good reports that have been coming out of La Scala, Milan, about Roberto
Alagna have not lied. French by birth, Sicilian by descent, this young tenor
could hardly be more ideally suited to play the poet in Puccini's tale of
Parisian romance. He has the looks and the stage presence, bright, smiling,
quickly smartening up his hair when he hears there is a girl at his door, as
well as a voice that has the role easily within its compass.
This last was fortunate in the circumstances, as he was saddled with the
most obtuse conductor of Puccini that this production can have witnessed in
all its two decades. Mark Ermler kills the music with kindness. When the
pace should be firm, he slows up. When it slows, he very nearly stops
altogether. The gap between one phrase and the next becomes a ravine of
silence, on the edge of which the singers are left to teeter nervously.
There was no chance for the Rodolfo to make this a performance of
headstrong, veristic passion and Alagna wisely did not try. Instead he used
the time at his disposal to shape musical phrases of considerable elegance
and beauty, varying the tone with real tenderness when he sings quietly.
There is not a lot of flesh on the voice as yet, but it is a healthy sound,
fresh, sappy, technically well placed. He is welcome back in London at any
time.
There were other debuts at this revival, including the Mimi of the Romanian
soprano Angela Gheorghiu. Those with happy memories of this production will
think back to her compatriot Ileana Cotrubas in the same role, but Gheorghiu
is a different kind of singer, harder in sound and a touch more resilient in
nature too, so that she does not win hearts so easily, although she does
sing as though she cares about every phrase.
Anthony Michaels-Moore was the new Marcello, not sounding very Italianate
alongside Alagna, but he is taking confidently to the larger roles with
which the Royal Opera is now entrusting him. Bruno Caproni and Clive Bayley
completed the Bohemian quartet ably enough, without erasing memories of
their predecessors. Either the audience lacked a sense of humour or their
comic routines have lost their edge over the years.
The latter seems more likely and so this revival gets its recommendation
mainly for the chance to hear a young (half-) Italian tenor of outstanding
promise. Note, however, that Alagna does not sing in the last two
performances.
Performances continue until 17 June. (Box Office: 071 240 1066.)

FT  18 MAY 92 / Arts: Snatched by the Gods/Broken Strings - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On their way to the Munich Biennale, the destination of so much new opera
these days, two pieces by Param Vir were presented for the first time last
week under the auspices of Netherlands Opera at the Amsterdam Studios. The
cast was largely British, as was fitting when the composer's language - his
musical language as well as the language of his librettos - has become so
British since he came to England from his native India eight years ago.
Studying with Maxwell Davies and Oliver Knussen may have helped. However
Snatched by the Gods, the earlier of these chamber operas, suggested
Britten's Curlew River as the nearer neighbour.
This is also a story of pilgrimage, a boat crossing and the death of a boy.
There is even a close musical connection in the wan falls with which so many
of the vocal phrases end. Quite bizarrely, an Indian composer's treatment of
an Indian story (based on a poem of Tagore) sounded for all the world like a
piece of European exoticism, its main distinction being in the instrumental
music, evoking moods of the sea in the way of another Britten work.
The companion piece, Broken Strings, is musically more individual and
instrumentally even more lustrous: hearing it played so superbly by the ASKO
Ensemble under David Porcelijn was like turning the pages of a richly
illuminated Persian or Moghul book.
The story, too, is more interesting: a Buddhist parable, adapted by David
Rudkin. A young musician, proudly confident of winning the competition for a
royal appointment, is astonished when his elder rival continues to play on a
broken instrument, summoning magic animals - an elephant, a fish, a peacock
 -with his music. The young man breaks his own instrument. Nothing happens.
Param Vir's music rapturously takes hold of the opportunities here for
illustration, in matching, for instance, the characters and speeds of the
magic animals, and even in tackling the rather trickier matter of suggesting
the celestial music the old musician plays. In remaining at that level of
illustration, though, the composer may have been too modest; the piece
begins as spoken drama, and the role of the music is not so far above that
of the rich brocade costumes invented by Chloe Obolesnky for the magic
animals, a role of beautification. One wanted the supple solo woodwind
lines, the inventive string effects and the suave textures woven around harp
and two horns to be more at the heart of the matter, as they might with a
more suggestive, ambiguous sort of drama.
Pierre Audi directed the two pieces with care and tact. There were excellent
performances from Cynthia Buchan and Katherine Ciesinski as the main women
characters in Snatched by the Gods - the one strident in warmth, the other
warm in stridency - and from Christopher Gillett and Richard Suart as the
two musicians in Broken Strings, a show almost stolen by Nuala Willis's
deep-voiced magic elephant.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Easing traffic congestion in Oldham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A traffic bottleneck in Oldham will be relieved under a Pounds 5m road
improvement contract awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION.
About 2.6 kilometres of the A62 Manchester Road in Oldham is to be converted
into a dual carriageway. It will run from Oldham's ring road, the Oldham Way
to South Street.
The contract, for Oldham Municipal Borough Council, includes extensive
demolition of empty commercial properties, including several pubs and shops,
to create the new southbound two-lane carriageway. The existing road will be
upgraded to become the northbound two-lane carriageway.
Work includes excavating and capping old mine shafts and pumping up to 4,000
tonnes of grouting into the mine workings.
More than 30 side streets will also have to be re-aligned at their junctions
with Manchester Road.

<TEXT>
COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded five retail contracts,
worth nearly Pounds 19m, located across the country.
The largest contract is a construction project for Wm Morrison Supermarkets
for a superstore in Whitley Bay. The scheme consists of a predominately
single-storey superstore, with two-storey elements, a petrol station with
car wash and ancillary retail units. The structure will be a steel frame on
pad foundations with brick and block cavity walls and a tiled roof. The
construction is due for completion next January.
There are three fitting-out contracts for Waitrose for the shells of stores
at Longfield, near Dartford, The Meadows in Chelmsford, and Cathedral Way,
Chichester - all of which were built by Costain. All three contracts include
all services and fittings to the sales areas, warehouse preparation and all
associated works.
The final contract is a fitting-out contract for BhS, for its store in the

FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Finance role split at Berkeley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Berkeley Group, the Surrey-based housebuilder, has brought Roger Lewis
on to the board with responsibility for corporate finance and, with chief
executive Tony Pidgley, strategy.
Pidgley, who is wary of companies with finance directors who spend too much
time in the City, believes in splitting the role of finance director. So
Brian Davis remains in charge of day-to-day functions while Lewis
concentrates on what Pidgley terms corporate finance - which includes
long-term funding arrangements, financing for joint ventures and for new
acquisitions.
Lewis, 45, joined the company last year, and has already been working in
these areas, although his promotion to the board gives him an opportunity to
become more closely involved in decisions relating to 'strategic growth'.

Alison Horrocks has been appointed group company secretary of SHANDWICK.

George Neophitou has been promoted to financial director of HARLAND SIMON
following the resignation of John Macaulay.

FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Hands-on experience for adviser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lance Anisfeld, one of Peter Lilley's special advisers at the Department of
Trade and Industry, has decided to try his hand at making money in the real
world rather than follow his boss to the Department of Social Security.
'At the DTI you are mixing with business leaders but at the DSS you are
having to spend your time with the poverty lobby,' says the 30-year old
Anisfeld. Conscious that Lilley often taunted his Labour rivals that 'none
of them had ever spent a day in industry in their lives', Anisfeld has
decided to get some hands-on experience.
He has been appointed joint managing partner of East8, a small firm of
property advisers specialising in Eastern Europe and founded by Philip
Hudson, a 32-year-old architect.
Anisfeld, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse, was
first spotted by Madsen Pirie, president of the free-market Adam Smith
Institute and the man credited with writing the nasty bits in prime minister
John Major's speeches. A former president of the Cambridge Union, where he
is remembered more for his yellow dinner jacket than his libertarian views,
Anisfeld had worked in PW's privatisation group under Howard Hyman. At the
DTI he concentrated on trade matters.
Anisfeld contributed to East8's guide to Real Estate Development in Eastern
Europe, and the firm is advising the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development on its first real estate project in Europe - the National Bank
of Poland's 800,000 sq ft banking centre in Warsaw which is being
constructed in conjunction with US developers.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 20m Bristol road project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bristol Development Corporation (BDC) has awarded the design and build
contract for the Bristol spine road to BALFOUR BEATTY. The contract, valued
at Pounds 20m, is due to start on site this month, although preliminary site
works have already begun.
The spine road, due for completion by May 1994, is believed to be the
largest and fastest contract of its kind and the most important
infrastructure project in Bristol.
Significantly, for a major work of this scale, the contract is substantially
under budget.
The 1.5 mile dual carriageway road will link the M32 (M4/M5) in the north
with the A4 Bath Road in the south, opening up the BDC's 900 acre urban area
for major redevelopment.
The spine road, together with the proposed Avon Weir, form the axis of the
Corporation's regeneration strategy which is aimed at transforming Bristol's
waterfront and linking the area into the national transport network.
The spine road will relieve traffic congestion on the inner circuit road
allowing capacity for the Corporation's flagship gateway development at
Temple Meads and also open up the potential for new public transport
initiatives.
The Temple Meads project is a Pounds 500m mixed development, aimed
specifically at office relocation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAING NORTHERN has won a contract, worth about Pounds 6m, to construct an
indoor water park for Tyneside Waterpark at North Shields with Tyne &amp; Wear
Development Corporation and TSB as financiers.
Work has started and completion is scheduled for summer 1993. The building,
part of the 200 acres Royal Quays development, will be rectangular in shape
with a concave curved roof. A spine wall will separate the main volume of
the building from the flume tower and run out area.
Most of the construction will be at ground floor level with two-storey
accommodation against the spine wall.
The building will be entered at one end directly into the first floor. At
this level there will be the control, administration, cafe, bar and support
spaces.
The building is designed to take 12 rides: six 'speed' slides; five
conventional flumes and one river ride. Initially there will be four flumes,
the river ride and two 'speed' slides - the 'Twister', which will be 85
metres long with a take-off height of 12.5 metres.

FT  18 MAY 92 / People: Through the ranks at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank has named Bill Gordon, a career Barclays man who has worked
his way up through the ranks since he joined a Birmingham branch at 16, as
its new managing director in the banking division. In charge of UK banking,
he replaces Geoff Miller who is taking early retirement at the end of the
month.
Gordon, 52, moves after a spell as director of personnel, which should be
good preparation for his new assignment - given that the bidding for Midland
places the British banking market on the cusp of its biggest shake-out, in
jobs as well as everything else, for decades. His new responsibilities
encompass the gamut of everyday banking activities throughout the UK branch
network; central retail services including UK credit cards; and the
Mercantile Group. He works alongside Richard Carden who is the banking
division managing director in charge of international and corporate banking.
At personnel for the past two years, he says one of his achievements, last
year, was to 'downsize' the overall staff by 5,000 'using a range of
imaginative schemes rather than the brown envelope technique'. Immediately
before that, he worked under Miller in the banking division as director of
UK corporate services, among other things helping to create the 300 or so
business centres around the country which cater specifically to medium-sized
businesses - a pool of expertise at the bank which he claims has proved very
useful in dealing with the kinds of problem that have arisen during the
recession.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RESULTS DUE
WHITBREAD will open a round of brewers' results today by reporting its first
fall in earnings for 16 years. The impact of the recession, culminating in a
Pounds 37m provision for bad and doubtful debts, is expected to reduce
full-year pre-tax profits by more than 20 per cent to between Pounds 225m
and Pounds 230m.
Market forecasts for Allied-Lyons tomorrow suggest pre-tax profits in the
new management's inaugural year of about Pounds 635m - marginally ahead,
excluding last year's Pounds 147m on foreign currency dealings. The results
are likely to have less influence on sentiment than statements about the
group's plans for the future and the benefits expected from restructuring.
Interim results from Bass on Wednesday should show a 20 per cent rise to
Pounds 263m on last year's weak first half. The country's leading brewer is
continuing to benefit from cost savings from brewery closures, but pub sales
to comply with the government beer orders will hit retailing profits.
At least Pounds 290m pre-tax for the year to March is expected from British
Airways, which reports its finals tomorrow, against a Gulf crisis-affected
Pounds 130m. Strong second and third quarters lie behind the recovery. It is
hoped the upturn will be accompanied by some positive noises about future
trading.
BOC, the chemicals group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 166m tomorrow. This compares with Pounds 144.7m last year, when
the figure was depressed by some above-the-line charges. Analysts will be
looking for signs of improvement in the US and the scale of any downturn in
Japan.
Courtaulds, also in the chemicals sector, reports full-year results on
Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 200m are expected, compared with
Pounds 186.3m. Attention will focus on the downturn in performance materials
and the quality of business in fibres and films.
Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK's composite insurers, could
show a slight fall in pre-tax losses to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 25m
when it reports its first-quarter results on Wednesday. Like its rivals,
Royal and General Accident, which both reported improved figures this week,
CU will benefit from premium rate increases in the UK.
BT, the telecommunications group, is expected on Thursday to report pre-tax
profits for the year to the end of March, marginally up on the previous
year's Pounds 3.07bn. Profit growth has been held back by the recession,
competition from Mercury Communications and a tighter price cap which came
into force last September.
Storehouse, the retailing conglomerate which owns BhS, Habitat, Mothercare,
Richard Shops and Blazer, will announce a mixed bag of trading fortunes when
it reveals its annual results on Thursday. Although group profits are likely
to be down from Pounds 21m to Pounds 13.5m, there should be progress on
several fronts.
Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain of supermarkets, will demonstrate
the continued resilience of food retailing as it looks likely on Wednesday
to lift yearly pre-tax profits by about a quarter to Pounds 360m. This
performance will continue a remarkable five-year period of growth since
Argyll bought Safeway.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Boards faulted on voter rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half Britain's largest corporations included in a recent survey on
corporate governance allow shareholders no say in the appointment of top
executives.
Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which advises pension funds on
investment issues, included the findings of the survey in its Mid-Season
Corporate Governance Report, released today.
The survey found that 27 of the UK's 52 largest companies have adopted
provisions by which all or some of their executive directors need never seek
re-election by shareholders.
Coats Viyella, Commercial Union, Guardian Royal Exchange, Inchcape, P&amp;O and
TSB insulate all their executive directors from regular shareholder votes.
PIRC, which advises UK local-authority pension funds and some US-based
pension funds, is urging clients to discuss the matter with managements.
The Bank of England-backed Institutional Shareholders Committee guidelines
say it is best practice for directors to be subject to re-election every
three years, although company law allows exemptions.
PIRC also found that 18 of the 52 companies studied have nominated
non-executive directors who fall short of the ISC's criteria for
independence, which bar anyone who has been employed by the company in an
executive capacity within the past few years or who has been retained as an
adviser or who is a director of a significant supplier or customer.
Among appointments questioned are those of Sir Graham Day to the board of
British Aerospace; Sir Brian Corby and Mr Colin Southgate at Prudential; and
Sir Timothy Bevan at Barclays.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Credit card warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERMARKETS may lose more than half of their card-carrying customers if
they decide to charge shoppers extra for paying with debit and credit cards,
according to the Credit Card Research Group (CCRG). They would lose just as
heavily if cards were banned.
The CCRG says any surcharge of card customers or boycott of cards by big
grocery retailers will cost them billions of pounds in lost sales.
The forecasts are from a survey of cardholders by Gallup which shows that
customers are angry at threats of either not being able to use their cards
or being made to pay more for their goods than people paying in cash.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Wages and migration in America: a lesson for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL take more than the abolition of national border controls to raise
international labour mobility within the European Community. The combination
of distinct national cultures, histories and languages is likely to mean
that the current low levels of cross-country migration within Europe,
relative to that between US states, will persist for some years after 1992.
But not, perhaps, for ever. The US evidence suggests that a single market
for European goods and services, combined with a single currency, may lead
to persistently high national unemployment differentials unless workers are
prepared to move between regions; and empirically, in the absence of border
controls, unemployment is the main reason for migration.
The fabled mobility of Americans explains why the US has not been plagued by
persistent high regional unemployment differentials. The current high
unemployment regions in Britain, Germany or Italy also had the highest
jobless rates a decade ago; but the US does not have a regional unemployment
problem.
Yet the US does have persistently fast and slow growing states, as the upper
charts show. Those states which had the slowest employment growth rates in
the 1950s and 1960s - New England, the mid-Atlantic and the rust belt states
of the mid-west - also tended to have the slowest employment growth over the
past two decades. The fastest growing states over the past 40 years have
been those blessed with sun, oil or both.
Swings in the fortunes of particular industries and commodities, combined
with a high degree of regional industrial specialisation, also mean that
individual states regularly diverge from their long-run growth paths. Slow
growing Massachusetts had one of the fastest growing employment rates in the
first half of the 1980s as its high-technology industries benefited from the
rise in defence procurement. Fast-growing Texas was hit by the fall in oil
prices in the mid-1980s: employment in Texas fell, unemployment rose and
relative wages declined.
Yet state unemployment rates quickly returned to their long-run average
levels, even though the shocks to employment are not fully reversed. Mr
Olivier Blanchard and Mr Lawrence Katz of MIT and Harvard University find
that negative employment shocks lead to a rise in unemployment and a small
decline in labour force participation. But this effect disappears after five
to seven years.
It is out-migration of unemployed workers, rather than in-migration of
companies attracted by low wages, that explains how US states adjust to
regional shocks. Mr Blanchard and Mr Katz, in a forthcoming Brookings
Institute paper, estimate the average response across all 51 states to an
employment shock. They find that a fall in state employment of 1 per cent in
the first year is reflected in a rise in the unemployment of 0.32 per cent
and a fall in participation of 0.17 per cent: of the 100 workers who lose
their job, 30 stay unemployed, five drop out of the labour force and 65
leave the state. But this migration eventually erases the effect on
unemployment and participation rates. Falling relative wages do attract some
new jobs into the state, but the effect is weak and the fall in employment
is never fully reversed.
Europe can expect to suffer similar swings in national regional fortunes.
The single market programme is likely to encourage a similar pattern of
regional industrial specialisation within Europe; and monetary union will
prevent national governments from using exchange rates to offset demand or
supply shocks which adversely affect national industries.
How will Europe cope with these demand shocks? Probably not very well. The
US evidence suggests that European workers will have to be more prepared to
travel, accept greater swings in their relative wages than occurs between US
states, or, alternatively, suffer persistently high unemployment. That there
is both more migration and wage flexibility between US states than between
British regions does not bode well for the future.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Water and sanitation listed as top priorities for developing
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the world's most pressing problems can be traced to one vital
resource: water. All too frequently it is either scarce or contaminated.
The World Bank report puts dirty water and inadequate sanitation at the top
of the developing countries' priorities.
While rivers in high-income countries are becoming cleaner, they are not
improving in middle-income countries, and in poor countries they are
actually getting dirtier.
Much of the contamination is caused by disease-bearing human waste. As
surface water becomes less usable, people turn to ground water. But this too
is liable to increased pollution from seepage of improperly disposed
chemicals and other hazardous wastes.
Although progress has been made in bringing sanitation to the world's
population, little has been done to treat human sewage. In Latin America, as
little as 2 per cent of it receives any treatment. It is estimated that
worldwide 1.7bn people are without access to proper sanitation. It is also
calculated that at least 170m people in urban areas still lack a source of
drinking water near their homes. The number in rural areas without safe
water is put at 855m.
Twenty two countries face a permanent and severe water shortage; 18 more go
dangerously short in years of poor rainfall.
Because of the big role played by water in bearing diseases such as typhoid
and cholera, a clean-up in the water system can bring rapid benefits to
human health.
If all those people now without safe water and adequate sanitation were to
receive it, the World Bank estimates that 2m fewer young children would die
of diarrhoea, and hundreds of millions of people would be spared various
infectious diseases.
But it is an enormous task. In Nigeria, for instance, providing access to
clean water for the whole population by the year 2030 would mean increasing
the number of urban mains connections four times, and of rural connections
almost nine times.
The World Bank recommends an action programme for more efficient management
of water resources. This would include providing at full cost those services
that people want and are willing to pay for, such as supplying water and
collecting waste. Both community organisations and the private sector have a
role to play in providing the right response, the report says.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Plans for a better world could cost Dollars 75bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE crunch in the World Bank's report is over the cost of its proposals. The
total sum needed to finance work on water and sanitation, electric power,
road transport, emissions, agriculture, population and female education
could reach Dollars 75bn (Pounds 42.3bn) a year by 2000.
This would be over and above investments which are already being made, and
would amount to 1.4 per cent of the GNP of developing countries. But the
report is quick to point out that these additional investments should pay
off because countries with good economic policies grow twice as fast as
those without.
Much of the money will have to come from the developing countries
themselves. But more must come through an open international trade system,
and adequate access to the international capital market. A further source
will be official aid from the developed nations.
The World Bank tries not to be daunted by the task ahead. Despite what the
doomsayers predict, poverty could be eliminated in the next generation, the
world's water-based problems could be solved and food production raised
without harming the environment. But it will all depend on rising incomes,
investment, education and increased employment.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Advice for Nato's former enemies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO'S FORMER adversaries will receive advice in meetings in London and
Brussels this week on how to run western-style defence ministries and
convert their bloated defence industries to civilian use.
Senior defence officials, military officers and parliamentarians from the
former Warsaw Pact are attending a seminar in London today and tomorrow on
managing defence in a democratic system.
The meeting could lead to secondment of UK staff to eastern European
capitals.
It has been organised by the UK Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence and
Royal United Services Institute as part of a co-operation process launched
by Nato late last year. Talks will focus on issues of budgetary and
parliamentary control and will include discussions on the handling of last
year's Gulf campaign and on Northern Ireland - an area where the
relationship between civil and military powers is, to say the least,
problematic.
A further three-day seminar is set for Nato headquarters in Brussels on
Wednesday to discuss defence conversion.

FT  18 MAY 92 / UN peacekeepers pull out of Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations peacekeeping forces yesterday left Sarajevo, the capital of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, as Serb irregulars tightened their grip on the republic.
A convoy of 40 vehicles, carrying 80 UN soldiers and personnel, including
General Satish Nambiar, the Indian force commander, yesterday split in two
and headed for safety in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and Belgrade, the
Serbian and federal capital.
This followed the withdrawal on Saturday of some 200 peacekeepers, which
left about 120 soldiers and unarmed military observers in the besieged
capital.
The UN was forced to pull out by increasing violence in the fighting between
Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, and the mainly Moslem Bosnian
forces for control of the capital.
Although a lull in the fighting was reported yesterday, a demand by Bosnian
authorities for the federal army to quit two barracks in Sarajevo was
expected to lead to new clashes.
Mr Hajrudin Somun, an official of the Bosnian presidency, also demanded that
the army leave their weapons.
Bosnia's poorly-armed forces have been unable to stop Serb irregulars from
seizing control of two-thirds of Bosnia's territory. Belgrade radio
yesterday reported that Serb forces surrounding the eastern town of Gorazde
demanded that Moslem forces surrender in order to 'liberate' the town, near
the River Drina which marks Bosnia's eastern frontier with Serbia. Gorazde,
which is 70 per cent Moslem, is one of the last outposts of Moslem control
in eastern Bosnia.
The European Community and the US have placed most of the blame on Serbia
for destabilising Bosnia. International attempts to stop the violence in
Bosnia have so far failed to force Serbia, under President Slobodan
Milosevic, into a change of policy.
Instead, in an effort to further isolate the young republic, the Serb-led
federal army yesterday refused to allow journalists to cross into Bosnia
from Serbia.
The UN withdrawal from Sarajevo, which will remain the symbolic headquarters
of peacekeeping operations in neighbouring Croatia, is likely to demoralise
its battered population. Crowds of Moslems threw lilacs and cheered the UN
convoy, though it was forced to stop at dozens of Serb barricades as it
crawled through Bosnia.
But Serb villagers, showing their anger at international diplomatic pressure
against Serbia, spat and jeered as the white UN lorries passed through
self-proclaimed Serb territory. Most Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of the
4.35m population, oppose independence, which is backed by Moslems and
Croatia.
Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the north-eastern city of Tuzla feared that
the army would retaliate for the death of nine federal soldiers on Friday
night.
Local authorities said fierce explosions shook Tuzla and Bihac, in
north-west Bosnia, when the Serb-led federal air force detonated explosions
at airports, including underground runways and hangars.

AFGHAN Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Masood met hardline guerrilla chief
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar but the two rivals failed to resolve their differences,
Tehran Radio said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
The radio, quoting an Afghan Defence Ministry source, said the two met
outside the Afghan capital Kabul on Saturday.
'During the meeting Hekmatyar once again insisted on his demands, saying
that General Abdul Rashid Dostum's forces should leave Kabul. Masood,
however, opposed his demands,' the radio said.
Gen Dostum's Uzbek forces defected from the former government of President
Najibullah and were crucial to Mr Masood's capture of Kabul and his eviction
of Hekmatyar's men from the city later.
The Defence Ministry source said Mr Hekmatyar and Mr Masood would meet again
on Sunday for a second round of talks.
Guerrillas loyal to Mr Masood drove Mr Hekmatyar's forces out of Kabul in a
battle for control of the capital earlier this month. Mr Hekmatyar's forces
later shelled Kabul but the capital has enjoyed relative calm since the
start of a ceasefire 11 days ago.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Government intervention likely in Bombay SE

THE BOMBAY stock market, which has been rocked over the last three weeks by
India's worst financial scandal, is to reopen today with expected heavy
government intervention aimed at warding off a further crash in prices.
The market will open to an official announcement that Mr Harshad Mehta, the
Bombay broker implicated in the scandal, and his family, still have unpaid
commitments for share purchases over the last month of between Rs650m-700m
(Pounds 13m-Pounds 14m). Mr Mehta, his wife and brother were suspended from
membership of the Stock Exchange on Friday after the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) froze his assets and seized share certificates.
The CBI will meet at the same time with the Stock Exchange authorities to
see whether share certificates in his possession can be released to fulfil
sales he made during the last two accounting periods.
The reopening today of Bombay and India's other main exchanges comes after a
weekend of nervousness at the immediate future of the market. It is feared
that both the police and tax inquiries into the affairs of Mr Mehta - the
driving force of this year's bull market - could lead into further unknown
minefields.
In a market with limited liquidity, the state-owned financial institutions
are expected to intervene strongly to hold up prices and to protect the
small investor - many of whom began purchasing late in the bull run.
Mr M R Mayya, the Bombay Stock Exchange executive director, said yesterday:
'We are trying to stabilise the market. We are finding ways and means to do
it.'
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Finance Minister, gave a similar message to investors
at a meeting he held with bank chairmen to discuss financial sector reform.
He said there was no need for panic or despondency. But reaffirming the
government's commitment to prosecute those involved in fraud, he said that
those found guilty would not be spared.
It emerged over the weekend that the Reserve Bank of India (the central
bank) is to call in the IMF to help computerise its supervision of security
trading. The Reserve Bank's ledger of inter-bank trading in government
securities had fallen one month behind in April because each entry is made
by hand.

RELIANCE, the petrochemical group controlled by the Ambani family, has
become the first Indian private sector corporation to raise equity capital
on the Euromarkets.
The group confirmed yesterday that it had launched its Dollars 100m (Pounds
56m) issue to help finance a gas cracker three weeks ago and that the offer
would close at the end of this week.
Bankers involved in the issue claimed that Dollars 400m had so far been
subscribed.
The disclosure caused surprise because last week - with the share price
under pressure in Bombay in the wake of the nation's worst financial scandal
 -the group had said that it was planning to launch its issue towards the
end of June.
The authorised issue is in a range equivalent to Rs250-280 (Pounds
4.90-Pounds 5.50) a share - based on an anticipated price-earnings ratio in
March 1993.
On the Bombay stock market, Reliance's price recovered to Rs296 on Thursday
after dropping to Rs270 on May 12.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Armenia attacks key town in Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARMENIAN military formations have taken advantage of the political
instability in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to launch a direct assault on
a key town in Azerbaijan. Armenia is trying to create a land bridge between
it and the disputed Armenian-dominated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in
Azerbaijan.
The creation of a land link between the Armenian republic and its ethnic kin
in Nagorno-Karabakh would elevate the increasingly bitter guerrilla campaign
into a full-blown military confrontation between the two Caucasian
republics. Such a war would threaten to draw in not only Russia and other
former Soviet states, but also Turkey and Iran, which border Armenia and
Azerbaijan to the south.
Baku itself was reported calm yesterday, after the opposition Popular Front
had taken control of the parliament and TV station following the deposition
of President Ayaz Mutalibov. His brief reinstatement last Thursday by
supporters in the parliament sparked mass demonstrations and sporadic gun
battles.
Spokesmen for the Defence Ministry and the Popular Front said yesterday
troops had been withdrawn to the capital from Lachin, situated between
Nagorno-Karabakh and a finger of Armenian territory which pokes into
Azerbaijan, reducing the strip of land between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh
to a few kilometres.
Mr Azad Ali-Zade, the Defence Ministry spokesman, said yesterday that
Armenian forces were attacking Lachin from both Armenia to its south-west
and Nagorno-Karabakh to its east. He denied an Itar-Tass report that an
Azeri tank column from Lachin attempted to retake the town of Shusha within
Nagorno-Karabakh, the last Azeri-held stronghold in the enclave, whose loss
last week sparked off the attempt to reinstate Mr Mutalibov.
Mr Mutalibov first lost his presidential seat in March, following Azeri
reverses in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. Acting presidential power has
passed to Mr Yagub Mamedov, leader of the parliament, but he wishes to
resign because of ill-health. Mr Mutalibov's whereabouts are unknown.
A number of senior members of the Popular Front have been appointed to
cabinet posts or as first deputies to cabinet ministers - with the Front
dictating the appointments formally sanctioned by decrees of Mr Mamedov,
whose resignation has been rejected.
The move by Armenia comes after it signed an agreement on collective
security with five other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
at a summit in Tashkent on Friday.
Azerbaijan, with Belarus, Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine, did not sign  - a
division in the states which could indicate a further deepening of distrust
among them, and possibly an attempt on Azerbaijan's side to appeal to one or
more of the non-members of the collective security agreement for aid.

FT  18 MAY 92 / The European Market: High-tech future for food retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE structure of the food retailing industry varies enormously across
Europe; how pizzas, paellas and pasties are sold remains a largely parochial
affair.
Europe's food retailing markets are still dominated by domestic companies -
with the possible exception of French hypermarkets in Spain. Those in
northern Europe are characterised by a few, powerful grocery chains while
the southern sunbelt boasts highly-fragmented regional industries.
Although they have similar numbers of consumers, Italy has three times as
many food retailing outlets as the UK, for example.
But in spite of the differences, food retailers across Europe are facing
many common challenges: flat sales; a static and ageing customer base; the
increasing internationalisation of their supplier base; and perhaps most
important, inflated demands for variety, quality and choice.
In order to respond to such changes, J. Sainsbury, the leading grocery chain
in the UK, launches more than 1,000 own-label products every year and stocks
more than 15,000 lines in its bigger stores - almost twice the number of a
decade ago.
The future velocity of change will be even more daunting, if the experience
of the US is any guide. Last year alone, according to one observer, food
makers launched 123 new cereal products, 64 new flavours of spaghetti sauce,
and 69 new variations of disposable nappies. There are more than 30,000
lines in the average US supermarket.
Against this increasingly complex background, food retailers have to
generate growth by squeezing more profit out of the same sales volumes
through productivity improvements and greater distribution efficiency. Some
observers believe recent technological developments have brought scope for
vast structural change across the European grocery trade.
Mr John Hollis, a senior partner at Andersen Consulting who has conducted a
study of the European market in the 1990s for the Coca-Cola Retailing
Research Group, says: 'Over the next five years we will see a major change
in the way the grocery industry organises itself.'
He believes differences in distribution efficiency will mark national
industries, with the implication that companies which can develop a
successful formula will be able to translate their success into foreign
markets.
The ultimate dream for retailers is to develop a 'stockless distribution
chain' with suppliers which will give them enormous cost advantages by
reducing the need for expensive storage space.
The report suggests the two main routes to this are electronic point of sale
(Epos) equipment, which scans the bar-codes on all products sold, recording
supermarket sales patterns throughout the day, and electronic data
interchange (EDI), which creates an information network between retailers
and manufacturers allowing both to align their operations more closely to
sales patterns.
Some of the most skilled practitioners of these developments have been the
big UK retailers, which have introduced Epos equipment, stopped direct
manufacturer supplies to their stores and centralised their distribution
functions.
This process has reached the stage where Tesco has been able to open a
supermarket in Leatherhead, in Surrey, with no warehouse space at the back.
Instead, it receives its goods through a series of meticulously-calculated
daily deliveries.
But the Andersen report suggests that such companies have as yet fully
tackled only half of the distribution chain. The challenge in the 1990s will
be to attack the manufacturing end through speedier exchange of sales
information using EDI networks, as Tesco is beginning to do.
To be effective, such partnerships will require a high degree of
transparency and trust. Retailers have to trust manufacturers with sensitive
sales information and be confident they can deliver to tight lead times,
while manufacturers have to open up their operating procedures to the
retailers' scrutiny.
But if the two sides fail to establish such partnerships an alternative
scenario may emerge. If food makers can adopt highly flexible manufacturing
methods and create joint distribution networks with one another, they could
perhaps create entirely new retail channels, bypassing traditional
supermarkets altogether.
Stores may simply become compact 'idea centres' where customers pick what
they want to buy from a display of products and later collect ready-packaged
bundles of goods from a nearby distribution centre.
Or the dream of every couch potato may be realised, with electronic home
shopping and direct delivery becoming economically feasible.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Lamont to face pressure over VAT
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S European Community partners and the European Commission are likely
to put Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, under pressure
tomorrow to abandon his hard line against legally binding EC rates of value
added tax (VAT).
EC finance ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss for the first time the
most sensitive aspects of indirect tax harmonisation, including draft
directives which would give a legal form to last June's historic agreement
on VAT and excise rates.
Ministers agreed then to keep to a 15 per cent minimum standard rate of VAT
from January 1 1993, to abolish special top rates on luxury goods, and to
simplify reduced rates.
Mr Lamont won almost all the concessions the UK required - the right, for
example, to keep zero-rating on certain household necessities - but the
Commission has so far shied away from asking Britain to back a legally
binding directive. Like all EC tax measures, the directive on the table
tomorrow requires the unanimous approval of the 12 member states.
The British government does not see the need for legal constraints on VAT
rates and is also suspicious of Commission-inspired measures which bind UK
fiscal policy.
British officials in Brussels refused to comment at the weekend about
whether the chancellor's position had changed since last June, when a
succession of meetings was required even to reach a broad political
agreement.
Moreover, the ministers are unlikely to reach formal agreement on any of the
fiscal measures under discussion tomorrow. These highly sensitive areas
include a revived proposal to impose VAT on art works and collectors' items,
and measures to enshrine last June's agreement on harmonised excise duties
on alcohol and tobacco.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Tough entry proposals for new EC states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants to set high entry requirements for new members
of the EC before the Community's next constitutional review in 1996.
This was the main outcome of last week's closed Commission debate on
enlargement, at which all but two of the 17-strong EC executive agreed to
shelve plans to seek a redistribution of power among Community institutions
to accommodate new members.
Because early membership will allow such countries as Sweden and Austria to
take part in the 1996 review, intended to launch the next phase of the
European Union agreed at Maastricht, Brussels wants to commit entrants
before then to accepting the logic of greater integration - including an
eventual common defence policy.
The Commission fears that, otherwise, member states like the UK will be
encouraged in their efforts to dilute integration.
The confidential discussion document setting out the implications of opening
the EC to up to 30 members makes clear that the Commission is looking at a
radical reform of the Community power structure in the medium term, as new
waves of members come in from Nordic and Alpine countries, eastern Europe,
and the Mediterranean.
Last Tuesday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, denied to Danish
journalists that he had suggested strengthening the powers of the EC
executive at the expense of small member states.
The denial followed an attack on Mr Delors by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
Danish foreign minister, who warned him that rumours of the Commission's
plans were jeopardising the outcome of the June 2 referendum in Denmark to
ratify the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu) and
political union.
The confidential document is drawn up by the Commission's Enlargement Task
Force, to assist the Commission in preparing a report on 'widening' the EC
for the Lisbon summit on June 26-27. It includes as possible reforms:
a 'group-presidency' of three member states to replace the current system,
whereby the presidency rotates each six months alphabetically among the 12,
regardless of their size and administrative capacity. The group formula
would have a president and two vice-presidents who would share presiding
over internal EC business each four months; these groups would rotate
alphabetically each year, but with 'modulation to avoid conjunctions such as
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg', the document says. It leaves open the
sensitive issue of whether 'big' states should always lead the group.
a strengthened executive 'combining elements of presidency and commission,
and accountable to parliament and council.' Like much of the document, this
suggestion is accompanied by a question mark.
an extension of majority voting. The current qualified majority system
requires 54 votes, or 71 per cent of 76 votes, apportioned according to size
of country. The document's most radical suggestion is to 'freeze the
qualified majority at its present level of 54 votes, so that each successive
enlargement (with more votes added to the total) reduces the relative level,
from 71 per cent progressively towards 50 per cent.'
These formulae would favour member states like Germany, concerned to
strengthen integration while opening up the EC, as well as France, which
wants to 'deepen' before any 'widening'. Senior Brussels officials make
clear that consideration of them has been shelved, so as not to endanger
ratification of Maastricht by the 12.

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT 6.55am today, at the fish auction in Skagen, Danish foreign minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen was due to begin a six-day campaign to persuade Danes to say
Yes to the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
His 33-meeting campaign, by far the most energetic by any politician, may
have a crucial influence on the vote in a referendum on June 2. Opinion
polls indicate that the result could go either way.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen begins his campaign after a week in which he forced Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, to deny a rumour that
he and his staff were considering a plan to limit the influence of the EC's
smaller nations.
Denmark will be the first of the EC countries to approve or reject
Maastricht, and only one other country, Ireland, will be holding a
referendum.
'It is not Europe's future which is at stake. If Denmark says No, we shall
see a new Maastricht Treaty with 11 signatures, and in practice a new Rome
Treaty with 11 signatures,' he predicted.
Among other things, Denmark, one of the Community's largest agricultural
exporters, would risk losing the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy,
he said.
If the vote is No, the Danish government will ask the other governments for
a renegotiation of the Maastricht Treaty, but Mr Ellemann-Jensen, foreign
minister since 1982, regards renegotiation as a non-starter. 'The treaty is
a Pandora's box which no one wants to open. So we shall have to see what we
can save from the wreckage.'
Pro-Maastricht politicians in the opposition Social Democratic party say the
foreign minister's enthusiasm for Europe and his plain-speaking about the
consequences of rejection amount to scaremongering and may help to ensure
that the treaty is voted down. But their party, which favours the treaty,
seems to have given up. Its recently elected leader, Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, has only four public appearance meetings on his calender for the
coming two weeks, and two of those have nothing directly to do with
Maastricht.
'It is not surprising if I am beginning to feel somewhat lonely on the
barricades,' says the foreign minister
European opinion polls consistently show the Danes to be among the most
sceptical about the European Community, but Mr Ellemann-Jensen regards this
as misleading.
It is connected with the fact that the Danes take themselves seriously. 'We
have more thorough debates than anyone, amounting almost to self-torture.
There is no other country where the Maastricht Treaty has been examined in
every detail, as it has in Denmark, both before and after it was signed.
'But I might discreetly remind you that we are the nation that tops the list
of those who live up to their obligations. We are the country which has gone
furthest in introducing the rules for the internal market and which has the
fewest cases brought against it in the European Court.'
Danish doubts about European union he ascribes partly to past failures to
draw attention to the political aspects of European co-operation. In 1972,
when there was a referendum on joining the EC, the issue was pork prices,
and in 1986, when there was a referendum to approve the Single European Act,
the issue was competitiveness. 'So it is something new when we now come
clean and explain that it is primarily a political question. It has caused a
good deal of confusion.'
In both 1972 and 1986 opinion polls also showed the voters to be sceptical,
but when it came to the point there were large majorities in favour. And in
1992, 'I am convinced we shall see a Yes,' says Mr Ellemann-Jensen.

FT  18 MAY 92 / Golden triangle hits note of northern confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUPER-RICH, inhabiting a little-known golden triangle of rural England,
are helping to alter the traditional image of the down-at-heel north.
Just six months after opening an office in Harrogate, North Yorkshire,
'accountants-to-the-rich' firm of Saffery Champness, is earning fees of
Pounds 1m a year, recruiting extra staff and taking on more office space.
And this at a time when accountants nationally have been cutting back and
axing staff in the face of the recession.
North Yorkshire's 'golden triangle', which straddles the A1 Great North Road
between York, Wetherby and Harrogate, boasts more super-rich (minimum
qualifications Pounds 20m of net worth) than any other part of the country
outside Belgravia and Mayfair in London.
The county has always had rich landowners but now it has become a desirable
place to live for rich entrepreneurs like Mr Tony Clegg, former chief of the
Mountleigh group. He lives at Whixley, midway between Harrogate and York.
The triangle's wider fame is that Marston Moor is in its middle. It was here
in 1644 that Cromwell's Ironsides defeated the dashing Prince Rupert's
cavalry, giving parliament control of the north.
In modern times, the rich have been waging a different kind of war against
parliament, saving as much as they can of their wealth from the taxman and
their children's inheritance from the state. Saffery has been acting as a
specialist soldier-for-hire in this field since 1855, but has only just
deemed the north of England worthy of having its own office.
Mr Keith Weston, a Saffery Champness partner who has now totally forsaken
London for the north, said his whole year's budget for new business had
already been beaten by 100 per cent as a result.
He now sees Yorkshire's golden triangle as far too limited. Still pinching
himself with disbelief that this really is the down-trodden north of London
mythology, he has drawn a new one, with Newcastle, Liverpool and Grimsby at
the corners. This takes in the rich pastures of Cheshire and the Derbyshire
Peaks, as well as the rest of Yorkshire and Humberside.
The firm is strong in Scotland, where its Aberdeen and Edinburgh offices
claim to act for most of the people who own that country, but has all its
other 12 branch offices below a line from the Severn estuary to the Wash,
which marks the north-south divide. One of its busiest offices is even
further south, in the Channel Islands,
Mr Weston has also discovered that Leeds is full of good solicitors, such as
Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Hepworth and Chadwick, and Simpson Curtis, offering
London standards of service at northern prices ' a discount of up to 50 per
cent that will save the rich even more money.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Resdidential Property (1): It's a long
haul back to normal - In spite of the Conservative election victory, the UK
housing market is still under a cloud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEX CATALANO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING TO anecdotal evidence, estate agents are seeing more potential
housebuyers crossing their threshold. 'After the election there was a little
flurry, but Easter, which is historically a good period, was dead,' says
Nigel Conradi, marketing director of Nationwide Anglia's estate agency
chain. Nevertheless, the mood in Nationwide's 400-odd branches is more
positive: 'One of our managers reported that sightseers are back.'
In addition, the Building Societies' Association reports that net new
commitments in March were 28 per cent up on February. But this only brings
the figure back to the level of late summer, 1991. However, most forecasters
and estate agents predict that it will be a long haul out of the current
trough. No one now expects to see any growth in real terms in house prices
over 1992.
Lloyds Bank, which has one of the more optimistic outlooks, thinks there
will be a 3.25 per cent nominal increase over the year; with inflation at 4
per cent; this translates into a real fall. Others, such as the Woolwich
building society and Dr John Wrigglesworth of stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew, forecast that prices will remain static at best or fall further, by up
to 2 per cent in nominal terms.
Even estate agents, often accused of talking the market up, are braced for a
slow recovery. 'It's going to take a long time for house prices to get back
to where they were two years ago,' says Paul Taylor, of Savills, who deals
in the higher-priced London properties. 'Nobody is better off; people's
ability to pay is no more than it was before the election.'
But affordability is not the problem. Over the last two years, the
combination of falling house prices, lower interest rates and rising incomes
has brought the cost of buying a house back within sight of the
all-important first time buyer.
There are two measures of affordability: house prices as a proportion of
earnings, and mortgage payments as a proportion of earnings. Long-term, the
average house price has been 3.5 times average earnings; during booms the
ratio accelerates up past 4, while in the troughs it has fallen back to
about 3. Nationwide's calculations put it at 3.11  - the lowest since 1971.
At Woolwich building society, Martin Ellis has concentrated on measuring the
costs for first-time buyers. His figures show that mortgage payments as a
proportion of earnings shot up to an unprecedented 31.8 per cent in 1988 as
interest rates were raised. Since then the proportion has fallen to equal
the longer-term average of 21 per cent in the last quarter of 1991; further
mortgage rate cuts and house price falls during early 1992 will have reduced
it further.
Moreover, the position for first-time buyers is particularly favourable. At
the present Pounds 42,389 the average price is 13 per cent lower than the
1989 peak, while special discounts offered by mortgage lenders have taken
their initial interest rate below 10 per cent.
All these numbers suggest that a recovery should be already under way.
Normally, at this point in the housing cycle, activity  - though not prices
 - would be picking up. But buyers have stubbornly refused to re-enter the
market. In 1991, there were only 1.3m transactions, 40 per cent off the 1988
peak and 6 per cent down on 1990. The first quarter of 1992 was even worse
for volume and according to Nationwide's index, average house prices
declined a further 2.7 per cent, making a total fall of 16 per cent since
the peak in 1989.
Part of the 1992 slump is being blamed on pre-election jitters. The Labour
party's proposals for a higher tax rate on incomes over Pounds 40,000 and
higher National Insurance contributions for those earning more than Pounds
22,000 inhibited prospective purchasers, as did the possibility that a
Labour victory might imply higher interest rates.
'By the end of March we were seeing a lot of cancellations of offers  - as
high as 40 per cent in some offices,' notes Nigel Conradi. In other cases,
buyers were hedging their bets. 'People who were ready to exchange contracts
were postponing until after the election, and in one or two cases making
exchange conditional on a Conservative victory,' says Yolanda Barnes, of
Savills' research department.
Now that the election is over, buyers appear to be waiting to be convinced
that the economy is reviving. 'The only ingredient missing in the market
place is confidence; the difficulty is trying to predict when it will
return,' says John May, joint chief executive of Hambro Countrywide.
'Confidence' is shorthand for a mixture of economic facts and feelings that
will give potential buyers the courage to complete on a property. The first
of these concerns is unemployment, or the fear of it. As the jobless total
has risen, people's ability  - and willingness  - to take on a new or larger
mortgage has evaporated. However, the trend here is positive; although the
absolute number of jobless is still rising, the rate of the unemployment
increase is slowing.
Second, because of recession, those still in employment are lowering their
sights. Although earnings are still rising in real terms, expectations of
future growth are softening. At the higher end of the income scale, there
are additional considerations. According to Yolanda Barnes, losses incurred
by Lloyd's of London members have dealt a big blow to the more expensive end
of the housing market.
Third, the recent falls in house prices have shaken people's faith in bricks
and mortar as an investment. Unlike most other goods, demand for
owner-occupied housing tends to drop as prices fall and increase when they
rise; economists describe this behaviour as 'perverse.' During the latest
slump, this effect has been amplified because, unlike in previous downturns,
house prices have dropped in nominal as well as real terms. Until they
stabilise, potential buyers  - especially first-time ones  - will hold back.
However, according to estate agents, many vendors are still having
difficulties in accepting lower prices. 'The problem is, there is a wodge of
sellers where the prices are lower than the equity in the house  - they
cannot be realistic. Then there are those who want to move but don't have
to. They don't need to be realistic,' says Conradi.
A plea for realism cuts across the price range. At Savills, Justin Marking
finds himself trying to persuade sellers of up-market country houses to
knock 10 to 20 per cent off their price expectations. 'The key in this
market is to set a competitive guide price. If it is too high it puts people
off even viewing the premises,' he says. Savills has just produced a list of
guide prices for three types of country residences.
Then, too, there are the figures for mortgage arrears and repossessions.
Their effect is harder to gauge. Although at record levels, repossessions
represent only some 1 per cent of mortgages outstanding. However,
repossessed houses do occupy an important position in the market, at the
bottom of the housing chain. Until they are taken up, prices will languish.
Moreover, arrears combined with price falls have clearly pushed some
homeowners into a valuation trap: their mortgage is now higher than the
value of their property. According to the Council of Mortgage lenders, there
could be 580,000 of these, mostly first-time buyers. Wrigglesworth puts the
figure at 1m. These are the 'can't sell' group, members of which will have
to wait until prices rise.
At present, the experts' consensus is that it will be mid- to late 1993
before there is any real growth in house prices. Lloyds is forecasting a
nominal price rise of 8 per cent; the Woolwich puts it at 4.3 per cent. By
then, buyers will have gathered enough courage to re-enter the market and
the backlog of unsold houses should be cleared. After that, house prices
should respond to more 'normal' market forces of growth in incomes,
inflation, and new supply: long-term, the rises in the UK have averaged at
3.5 per cent per annum.
However, two new factors will tend to dampen growth in house prices. The
first is Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. In
the past the UK's relatively high inflation rate during booms has
contributed to housing's appeal as an investment. This is because inflation
simultaneously erodes the real value of mortgage debt while pushing up
nominal incomes and house prices.
Membership of the ERM is expected to bring lower inflation rates and, in due
course, more stable and lower interest rates. 'We will still see housing
cycles, but with inflation being less rapid it will not fuel such rapid
prices rises so the peaks won't be quite as high,' says Martin Ellis.
The second dampening factor involves demographic trends: specifically, the
UK's ageing population structure. The 'baby boomers' of the 1950s and early
1960s provided a bulge of first-time purchasers in the 1980s. They are now
on the downturn, although the rate of household formation is not likely to
slacken until the second half of the decade.
In addition, the number of elderly people who are owner-occupiers is also
set to rise sharply, and with them, the number of houses inherited. About
two-thirds of these properties will be sold almost immediately, increasing
the supply of houses available. However, it is estimated that only 20 per
cent of the beneficiaries will spend most of the proceeds on property.
Taken together, all these factors point to a pattern of steady,
unspectacular growth in house prices: lower peaks and less painful lows.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Two centuries of scams and crashes: As the New York Stock
Exchange reaches its 200th birthday, the trading floor remains as noisy as
ever. Soon, all that might change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

'THE VISITOR finds himself in the vestibule of a vast chamber, which
stretches a furlong deep from Broad to New Street. At the farther end . . .
is a huge basin-like enclosure, filled with human tumult. Peering down
through the high-vaulted, dimly lit space, the eye sees nothing but excited
faces, arms flung wildly in the air, heads appearing and disappearing - a
billowy mob, from which surges up an incessant and confused clamour.'
SINCE James K Medbery penned this portrait of the New York Stock Exchange
trading floor more than 120 years ago, the quills and ledgers have been
replaced by computer screens and electronic tickers, but the ghost of any
trader from those days would find the tumult, confusion and excitable
clamour of today's exchange remarkably familiar.
The exchange, which celebrates its 200th birthday this weekend, has survived
technological revolutions, a mass of regulations, new locations, wars,
scandals and crashes, but the people who work the market are the same as
ever, and the way stocks are traded in the great citadel of American
capitalism remains, superficially at least, chaotic and colourful. Even so,
the last great revolution - the introduction of computers - now threatens
its very existence.
In 200 years the NYSE has moved many times, from a shaded spot under a
Buttonwood tree on lower Wall Street, to an upstairs room in a popular
downtown coffee house, to the temporary accommodation of various
institutions during the 1800s and finally to its present home at 11, Wall
Street, where it was transformed by technology. The computers of the 1970s
and 1980s brought faster transaction times, improved communication of price
and trade data, and a leap in the capacity to handle orders.
Unfortunately, the new science carried a cost, most visibly in the
vandalising of the elegant lines of George Post's splendid 1903 interiors.
More subtly, however, electronic trading threatens the very idea of a single
location for a stock exchange. Medbery would be sad to see today's room,
with its marble walls and towering windows hidden behind huge brown pipes
carrying cables to video screens that loom over trading posts like the legs
of giant metal spiders.
Computers were only the second great technological revolution to shake up
the exchange, however. The first occurred in the mid-19th century, when
within a decade or so the telegraph, the telephone and the stock ticker
transformed price reporting and financial communications. It was around this
time that the 'specialist', the intermediary on the trading floor whose role
is to bring buyers and sellers together, emerged. This, however, was not the
result of clever invention, but, so the story goes, of a curious accident.
In 1875, a broker called James Boyd broke his leg. Although he could no
longer move around the trading floor, he was determined to carry on making
money. So he set down a chair in the middle of the floor and restricted
himself to a single stock, Western Union.
Other brokers, knowing that Boyd was stuck in his chair, began to entrust
him with the stop and limit orders to buy and sell if prices hit specified
levels. This allowed them to go about their business without fear of missing
a crucial turn in the market. So successful was Boyd, that other brokers
joined him at trading posts fixed to the floor, and the specialists were
born.
While Boyd and his predecessors as specialists have evolved to become the
focal point of trading at today's exchange, it is the speculators who, over
two centuries, have probably contributed the most to the development of Wall
Street's great money merry-go-round.
From Samuel Beebee and his bull pools and bear raids of the early 1800s, to
Ivan Boesky and his greedy insiders trading ring of the late 1900s, the
brave (and often foolish) gamblers who handle securities like chips in a
casino have been inextricably linked to the fortunes of the NYSE.
In the earliest years, during the late 18th century, when there was no
organised regulation of financial markets, speculators found the perfect
outlet for their risk-taking passions in the primitive securities markets
that grew up in the tiny streets of downtown Manhattan. One of the first of
their breed was William Duer, a speculator whose reckless attempts to corner
the market in several big stocks during early 1792 led to the first great US
securities crash, and ultimately to the formation of the exchange.
Others followed in Duer's footsteps such as the fearless Jacob Little, who
earned the sobriquet of 'The Great Bear' such was his fondness for selling
stock short. Little's attempt to manipulate the market in Morris Canal &amp;
Banking Company shares in 1835 was a classic of its era. Little joined a
band of Boston speculators, and bound himself under a penalty of Dollars
25,000 that he would not sell the stock below Dollars 90, and that he would
do everything to push the price higher.
Little quickly realised that his plan was doomed. He quietly sold his stock
to his partners in Boston, who were forced to buy to keep the price up. The
Boston speculators lost huge amounts when the stock subsequently crashed,
upon which Little calmly sent them his forfeited Dollars 25,000, a trifle in
comparison with his winnings. As William Armstrong wrote in 1848, the rage
of Little's partners was unbounded, 'and they asserted in a very emphatic
manner that if Little ever visited Boston he would inevitably part company
with his ears.' Little eventually paid for his mischiefs in 1857 when he
went bust owing an extraordinary Dollars 10m after he sold 100,000 Erie
Railroad shares short.
Sometimes fleecing gullible newcomers to the market was almost too simple.
Attracting investors to a new stock issue under false pretences provided
some of the easiest pickings. An 1827 newspaper advertisement ran: 'To
Capitalists - An Interest in a Valuable Charter for Sale.' The ad promised
an income of 8 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent on their stock, coupled with an
assurance that 'the whole capital can no doubt be returned in about three
years.' No mention was made, however, of what the 'valuable charter' was,
nor was there any word of who was behind the issue.
Insider trading, so fashionable in the 1980s, was also rife.
Speculator-politicians were in a particularly strong position to exploit the
market. One such schemer was Senator Kemble of the New York state
legislature, who in 1835 pulled off a coup involving the Harlem Railroad
Company. After a passionate speech by Kemble in Albany opposing the capital
enlargement of the Harlem Railroad, lobbyists for the company returned to
New York convinced that any capital enlargement bill would fail. Their
confidence spread to the exchange, and sent the price of Harlem sharply
higher.
Kemble, meanwhile, was in the market, instructing his broker to sell the
issue short. Then, he forced a bill through the legislature ensuring the
enlargement of Harlem's capital. Not surprisingly, the news sent the stock
into a freefall, making Kemble a much richer, man.
The crooked Senator got his comeuppance not long after when an investigation
into his actions forced him out of the legislature in disgrace.
The great speculators who dominated the NYSE's formative years did not all
end their careers in ignominy and failure. Few were more renowned for their
successes than Cornelius Vanderbilt and Nathan Prime, both
multi-millionaires and blazers of various financial trails that Wall Street
takes for granted today. Vanderbilt was famous for his ability to influence
the entire stock market by his actions. Rumours that he had suffered serious
injury in a fall were enough to send the market tumbling 5 per cent. Nathan
Prime, meanwhile, was the first of many to earn the label, 'The King of Wall
Street'. Prime is generally credited with having been the country's first
investment banker. He also speculated in stocks and bonds, owned
considerable property interests, and bankrolled shippers and merchants.
Unlike the gregarious and sociable Vanderbilt, Prime could not enjoy life
outside his work. Walter Barret, writing in 1864, described Prime's sad
demise after his retirement: 'All seemed fair in the future for old Mr
Prime. Vast wealth, excellent sons, daughters all well married, he had
nothing else to do but live and enjoy himself. Did he do so? No. The strange
fancy seized upon his mind that he was becoming poor - that his destiny was
to die in the almshouse. Under this singular monomania, and hallucination of
mind, he cut his throat with a razor and died in an instant.'
The suicides of powerful speculators became synonymous with the NYSE much
later on, during the great crash of 1929 when newspapers published
breathless reports of penniless financiers leaping from skyscrapers. The
market's decline was so dramatic and the bankruptcies so widespread during
the 1929 crash that it was widely reported that clerks in downtown hotels
were asking guests whether they wanted a room for sleeping or jumping.
There were no mass suicides 58 years later when the NYSE faced a second
great crisis, the crash of October 1987. Yet the shock at the collapse of
that bull market seemed just as great to those who lived through it.
Art Cashin, a broker with almost 30 years experience on the floor at the
NYSE, remembers the 1987 crash as an almost surreal experience. 'After the
Dow was down over 200 points (on Black Monday), people had that look you see
when movies go into slow-motion. People were functioning, but they weren't
relating to what was going on around them.'
Although specialists, brokers and investors were hit hard in 1987, the
exchange's system itself stood the test. The computer technology introduced
in the 1970s coped with the huge orders during the worst of the panic. The
technology, however, did leave some scars. Computerised program trading
(programs automatically buy or sell at pre-set prices) of large bundles of
stock was widely blamed for exacerbating price volatility during the panic.
The case against progam trading was never convincingly proven, but the
controversy was enough to persuade the NYSE to introduce 'circuit breakers'
that limit the use of programs during volatile days.
Ironically, while technological change has produced enormous benefits, it is
now threatening the exchange's most famous asset - the trading floor. Rival
electronic markets that allow trading via computer screens have been picking
up business from the NYSE and are growing in popularity among investors. As
exchanges throughout the world move the physical trading of securities from
giant rooms to a chain of decentralised offices linked by computer, the
likelihood has increased that the exchange's great floor, with the human
tumult and confused clamour that so enchanted Medbery, will (as it has in
London) one day be silenced.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Inflation rise blamed on Budget tax measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S rate of inflation rose last month, ending a downward trend which
began in January.
Between March and April the retail prices index (RPI) rose by 1.5 per cent,
pushing the annual rate of inflation in the 12 months to April to 4.3 per
cent, up from 4 per cent in the year to March.
Although it was disappointing for the government, economists shrugged off
the increase, attributing it to the distorting tax effects of the March
Budget.
Sterling closed unchanged in London at DM2.9375.
A measure often taken as the underlying rate of retail price inflation - the
RPI without mortgage costs - showed a year-on-year rise in April of 5.7 per
cent, unchanged on March.
The Treasury said the rise was due to 'special factors', adding that the
underlying inflation rate would fall in the coming months.
According to the Central Statistical Office, part of the increase was the
result of last year's cut in poll tax bills dropping out of the index. The
RPI was further boosted by excise duties which rose by more than the rate of
inflation in the Budget, it said.
Most economists expect inflation to continue its downward trend but some are
concerned at the high core rate. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB
International, Japanese bank, said: 'The message is coming through that
there is still some underlying stubbornness in inflation.'
Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said: 'Today's inflation figures show
no improvement. But yesterday's worrying increase in unemployment shows the
heavy price being paid. The government is suppressing inflation rather than
curing it.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Survival in a Sarajevo cellar: How Bosnians are coping with
life in a city under siege
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR more than a month now Mrs Milica Petrovic, a Serb, and her husband have
lived in a cellar in Sarajevo. Above ground, their house in the suburb of
Ilidza is being steadily destroyed as the war tears the city apart.
Grenades have been hurled into their yard, killing the sheep and chickens.
On Thursday, when the city centre and several office blocks and factories
were destroyed in some of the most brutal bombardments of the civil war in
Yugoslavia, the Petrovics were caught unprepared. They had only a handful of
raisins to eat.
For days there has been no electricity. The food stored in the freezer has
rotted. Milica says: 'The only time I am hungry is in the morning, when I
wake and there is silence - no shooting - then I realise that I haven't
eaten in days.'
All semblance of normality has broken down in Sarajevo as Serb irregulars,
backed by the federal army, besiege the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
There has been no milk or meat for weeks. Serb gunmen have manned
roadblocks, stopping all transport of foodstuffs and medicines. The biggest
problem is looking after babies and small children. There is no baby food.
About half of the city is without electricity, water and telephone lines.
The shelling over the past seven weeks has destroyed transport and
communications systems. Blocks of flats, factories, mosques, churches and
schools are charred skeletons.
Sarajevo was once famous for its lively mix of nationalities, Moslems lived
side-by-side with Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, surrounded by
snow-flecked mountains. The city is now pounded with shells and mortars from
the surrounding slopes and its people live in fear.
There are several city districts where people are imprisoned in ghettoes.
Attempts to leave one's house is tantamount to suicide. When the shelling
stops, the snipers take over. A trip to buy bread means risking death.
Mothers give their infants water mixed with sugar and bread soaked in water.
Women are giving birth in cellars.
But in the shelters everyone shares, down to the last cup of coffee and
cigarette, regardless of ethnic group.
'Bosnians have an expression 'nikako', meaning 'awful', that's how we are
living now. If you can call it that,' says Ms Envera Selimovic, a Moslem and
a journalist.
'Sarajevo still manages in some way to be what it was before - people try to
help, either with food or by taking care of each other's children. My Moslem
neighbour gave cooking gas to a Serbian friend who had no electricity,' says
Mrs Marijana Jovovic-Bilandzic, 31, a Montenegrin who is married to a Croat.
She explains the only time she felt panicked was yesterday when Radio
Sarajevo was cut off. 'I felt scared by the silence.' The only way to
communicate is via the radio which broadcasts messages giving news to
stranded relatives.
Amid these stories of everyday life in Bosnia, allegations of atrocities
committed by Serbs when seizing mainly Moslem neighbouring towns have
emerged. Diplomats fear the death toll is much higher than the official
figure of 1,320.
A witness from Bratunac, which is 64 per cent Moslem, tells how Serb
irregulars rounded up and shot dead several hundred Moslem men in the local
sports arena. Some refugees from Bratunac, on Bosnia's eastern border with
Serbia, say the men are still alive and are being held captive.
But Mrs Jovovic-Bilandzic warns: 'There is a darker side to this insanity.
An irreversible hatred erupts in a person who has lost a close relative. If
he is a Moslem he will hate and try to kill anyone who is a Serb.'
Ms Selimovic says: 'The policy of the Serbian Democratic party is to sow
hatred and create chaos. If it continues like this, they will succeed in
their goal.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / S African talks deadlock raises fears of new violence
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional talks reached deadlock yesterday, dashing
hopes for the early installation of a multi-racial interim government and
raising fears of renewed political violence.
A day of acrimonious discussions at the Convention for a Democratic South
Africa (Codesa) left the government and the African National Congress
divided over fundamental constitutional issues, but reluctant to end talks
which are due to begin again today.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, and President FW de Klerk set up an urgent
meeting last night to try to break the impasse. They were due to address the
Codesa session this morning.
Earlier, Mr Mandela indicated that pressure would be increased on the
government through mass popular protest.
Talks stalled over demands for what amounts to a white veto over the process
of writing a post-apartheid constitution.
'The government has not in substantial measure moved away from its desire to
exercise a minority veto over the future,' said Mr Joe Slovo, hardline
leader of the ANC.
The government accused the ANC of wanting to impose a Marxist constitution.
However, Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, said: 'The ANC has got no
choice. We have no choice. We must come to an agreement.'
Even though the 19 political groups represented at Codesa have met almost
continuously for the past week, negotiators have failed to agree on the
decision-making process within the body elected to write the constitution.
The ANC proposed that decisions be taken by a 70 per cent majority, with a
majority of 75 per cent to approve the bill of rights. If agreement could
not be achieved within six months, the ANC said decisions taken by simple
majority should be submitted to popular referendum.
The government accepted the majorities proposed by the ANC, but insisted on
a 75 per cent majority on the contentious issue of South Africa's future
status as a unitary or a federal state. It also rejected the idea of a
referendum.
The ANC is concerned that the government could muster an effective veto, in
alliance with other ethnic minority parties, if decisions were taken by 75
per cent majority.

FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Factors combine to send Dow
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
THE COMBINATION of bankruptcy filings by the property developer, Olympia &amp;
York, and expiration of stock index futures and options pushed US share
prices lower yesterday morning, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.79 at 3,353.09,
but lows were more than 20 below that. The more broadly-based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.06 at 410.08, while the Nasdaq composite
fell 2.03 to 574.43. NYSE turnover was 192m shares, and for the second
consecutive day declines outnumbered rises by 1,037 to 620.
A bigger-than-expected 0.9 per cent rise in April industrial production
failed to lift sentiment, which has been depressed since the Dow reached a
record high on Monday. Subsequently there has been concern that the market
may have been overbought in recent weeks.
The 'double witching' expiration of stock index futures and options added to
the downward pressure on prices late in the session, while investors were
also unsettled by the overnight news that O&amp;Y had filed for protection from
its creditors under Canadian and US bankruptcy laws. There was some support,
however, from the bond market, where news from the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve of a weakening in local business conditions lifted prices at the
long end, in the process lowering the yield on the 30-year bond to just over
7.8 per cent.
The troubles at O&amp;Y forced bank stocks lower, although they all recovered
some of the early losses. O&amp;Y's prime lending banks were hardest hit,
troubled by worries that they will have to make further bad debt provisions
or loan write-offs in the wake of the bankruptcy. Citicorp fell Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 19 3/4 , Chemical by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 1/2 , and
JPMorgan by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55.
Among others, Bankers Trust lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 58 1/8 and Chase
Manhattan was down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 29 3/8 , although BankAmerica
recovered to end up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 .
ADRs in Unilever fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 102 1/8 in busy trading after
the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate reported first quarter net income below
analysts' estimates.
Briggs &amp; Stratton fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 46 after Oppenheimer &amp; Co,
the broking house, removed the engineering company's stock from its list of
recommended issues.
Canada
TORONTO share prices spent the day inside a narrow range and closed steady,
with the coming holiday weekend seeming to have more influence on trading
than last night's bankruptcy filing by Olympia &amp; York Developments.
According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 3.12 points,
or 0.09 per cent, closing at 3,391.43. On the week, the composite gained
about 17 points, or about 0.5 per cent.
In today's trading, declines outnumbered advances by 261 to 254, the total
volume of 20.20m shares was below yesterday's 28.02m shares, and trading
value was CDollars 230.2m compared with CDollars 315.3 m.
There are fears that the lenders might become more reluctant to supply real
estate concerns with funds. That helped push Trizec -B- shares 1/4 lower to
6.O&amp;Y holds roughly 35 per cent of Trizec.
The banking group posted an index gain of 0.90 per cent with Canadian
Imperial Bank up  7/8 to 28  1/4 , Royal Bank of Canada off  1/8 to 23 5/8 ,
Bank of Montreal up  3/8 to 43  1/4 , Bank of Nova Scotia up  1/8 to 19  7/8
, Toronto Dominion Bank up  1/8 to 16  7/8 and National Bank of Canada up
1/4 to 8 3/4.

MR STEVE Miller, the investment banker in charge of Olympia &amp; York's
negotiations with its 100 bank creditors, is famous-ly laconic. Yesterday he
described O&amp;Y's decision to seek protection from its creditors under
Canadian and US insolvency legislation as 'like going for a walk, noticing
it is raining, putting up an umbrella and keeping walking . . . This (the
creditor protection) is the umbrella that allows us to keep walking'.
On the other hand, investors throughout the world are not viewing O&amp;Y's move
as a little light drizzle. The Canadian dollar weakened yesterday morning as
did stock markets in Europe, the Far East and North America, with bank share
prices particularly vulnerable.
The banks, owed Dollars 12bn by O&amp;Y and now facing substantial writedowns,
have had no doubts about the severity of the property group's problems since
it disclosed two months ago that it had run out of cash.
Bankers view the insolvency filings as a formal public acknowledgement about
the severity of this liquidity or cash crisis, rather than a sign that the
crisis has become much worse. The banks were always going to suffer losses
on their O&amp;Y loans, whether or not the company sought court protection from
creditors.
Although some banks have huge exposure to O&amp;Y, the biggest loans have on the
whole been made by the strongest banks. The two biggest lenders are Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada, each of which has an
exposure of Dollars 1bn. However, these two banks are so profitable that
even if they wrote off most of their O&amp;Y loans in a single accounting
period, they would probably remain profitable in that period.
The bank with the next biggest exposure to O&amp;Y, totalling around Dollars
800m, is Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Once again, it is one of
the world's most robust banks, although its exposure has provided valuable
propaganda for Lloyds Bank about the alleged weakness of Hongkong Bank's
credit controls - with both institutions competing to obtain control of
Midland Bank.
Citicorp, the biggest US bank, is the one financial institutions whose O&amp;Y
exposure, of about Dollars 225m, is troublesome. It has less capital, a key
measure of strength, than many of its peers and can ill-afford losses of any
sort.
This exposure is not life threatening. But it is a particular embarrassment
to Citicorp's top management, led by the chairman Mr John Reed, who have
staked their jobs on rebuilding the bank's capital to acceptable levels by
the end of the year.
There is, however, a separate danger for banks, which at the moment is
unquantifiable. O&amp;Y's filings could damage confidence in the New York,
Toronto and London commercial property markets, where O&amp;Y has the bulk of
its assets and which are already in the grip of a severe recession.
If commercial property prices in general fall further, then other property
companies could fall into difficulties. And banks with loans to those
companies could face further losses.
This was the risk which prompted governments and central banks in the UK,
Canada and the US to consider providing help to O&amp;Y so that it would not
need to make the insolvency filings. The most useful form of help discussed
was a bridging loan to be provided by the Canadian government to O&amp;Y to
facilitate the sale of a Toronto office block, the Exchange Tower.
But in the event, the authorities concluded that the risk of a 'systemic
crisis' in the property market was overshadowed by the political problems of
being seen to help bail out one of the world's richest families. They
thought that commercial property prices had already adjusted to take account
of O&amp;Y's problems before the filings. The prices might not have that much
further to fall so no bridging loan has been forthcoming.
As a result, O&amp;Y concluded that it would not be able to raise enough cash in
the coming few weeks to satisfy the competing demands for immediate
repayment of several groups of creditors. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's
president, noted yesterday that it was becoming increasingly difficult 'to
be all things to all lenders'. Furthermore, the company was concerned about
the large numbers of cross-guarantee and cross-default provisions on its
Canadian assets.
The threat that creditors would seize O&amp;Y assets is the 'rain' referred to
by Mr Miller. O&amp;Y believed such precipitate actions would undermine its
attempts to organise an orderly reconstruction of its overall debt.
O&amp;Y, led by its self-effacing founder, Mr Paul Reichmann, will now try to
obtain the agreement of all its creditors to this reconstruction plan. The
key elements in the plan, which were put to O&amp;Y's 15 biggest bank creditors
last week, are that principal payments on Dollars 12bn of debt should be
deferred for five years and substantial interest payments on Dollars 4bn of
this should be made in the form of new O&amp;Y shares.
The filing under the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act allows
O&amp;Y to halt payments on around CDollars 8.4bn of principal debt, and
CDollars 600-CDollars 700m a year in interest. The company hopes that the
protection will not be required beyond October 21, although other corporate
restructurings - much smaller and less complex - have usually taken
considerably longer than initially expected.
Murmurs of discontent were already evident on Thursday night when O&amp;Y argued
its case in a Toronto court. Lawyers for Bank of Nova Scotia expressed
concern about transfers of assets between those parts of the company which
were protected from creditors, and those which were not.
There was also concern about what the filing might do to the value of shares
and other O&amp;Y assets pledged as collateral for its loans.
The creditors are now likely, however, to get considerably more information
on O&amp;Y than they have in the past. The court order includes the appointment
of a partner of Price Waterhouse in Toronto as an 'information officer'. He
will monitor the company's cashflow and report regularly to the lenders on
O&amp;Y's financial condition.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: US creditors scramble to
assess likely impact

OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S US busi-ness associates, bank creditors and bondholders
scrambled yesterday to assess the likely impact of the company's US and
Canadian bankruptcy petitions, with several saying they thought the company
might eventually have to file on behalf of its main US property subsidiaries
as well.
O&amp;Y claimed its four filings for protection from creditors - under Chapter
11 of US bankruptcy law - were unlikely to affect the properties owned by
O&amp;Y's operating subsidiaries. This was because the US filings did not
concern O&amp;Y companies holding substantial portions of the 24m sq ft of
office space in New York and 12.7m sq ft elsewhere in the US.
But some O&amp;Y watchers, including a senior New York real estate executive who
is advising an O&amp;Y creditor bank, said there was a distinct possibility that
O&amp;Y would eventually have to seek a bankruptcy filing for its main US
property businesses.
He said: 'They may be able to save their US properties, but I think they'll
have to file for Chapter 11 to do so. There will have to be a master
financing at some point, internationally. Right now O&amp;Y needs so much new
cash - not just to service debt, but to pay for upkeep and make necessary
improvements in New York and elsewhere - that the size of the eventual
debtor-in-possession financing will be enormous.'
He and others predicted that O&amp;Y would have a difficult time trying to keep
its Canadian, UK and US problems separate. He said working through the O&amp;Y
problems could take two years.
At present O&amp;Y's US property assets remain essentially unprotected - exposed
to the potential impatience of creditors. The company said last night that
it would continue discussing restructurings with 'the few lenders in the US
whose loans are affected'. It said a reasonable solution could be found in
the US without resorting to Chapter 11.
But US bankers quickly started putting out the word that they were still
reviewing the situation.
The US banks with the largest O&amp;Y exposure - Citicorp with Dollars 380m,
Chemical with about Dollars 225m and JP Morgan with about Dollars 50m -
watched their share prices skid in early trading. Prices recovered by the
end of trading, with Citicorp down  3/8 at Dollars 19 5/8 , Chemical down
1/2 at Dollars 37 1/2 and Morgan down  5/8 at Dollars 55
Few analysts expect the O&amp;Y crisis to have much further impact on the
banking system. This is partly because most of the main bank creditors made
substantial bad debt provisions on their O&amp;Y debt in the first quarter of
this year.
Nor is the O&amp;Y crisis expected to have much of an impact on the already
depressed US commercial real estate market.
JP Morgan, which has led a group of other creditors in a move to foreclose
on a series of O&amp;Y interest rate swaps that were pledged as collateral on a
Dollars 160m loan, is expected to go ahead with the auction next Friday. The
planned disposal ought not to be affected because the O&amp;Y company in the US
used as the swap counterparty is not among those that filed for bankruptcy.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Canary Wharf tenants unmoved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, BETHAN HUTTON and ANDREW SLADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXISTING and prospective tenants at Canary Wharf were bemused but relatively
unmoved yesterday by news of Olympia &amp; York filing for protection from
creditors.
An executive of one organisation which moved to the development late last
year said: 'There was a certain amount of black humour between the staff
this morning because we were not thrilled to come here in the first place.
But I don't think it's of much direct concern.'
Mr Jim Butler, senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm
which is shortly to move its training centre and public sector consultancy
to One Canada Square, said he was not surprised by O&amp;Y's action.
'As a firm of accountants we always thought there was a strong likelihood
this would happen,' he said. 'I strongly belief Canary Wharf will go on.
It's the bankers who loaned money who are in trouble.'
Mr Robin Warrender, chairman of London Wall Holdings, the insurance company,
said: 'Obviously any situation like this causes grave concern.' London Wall
has signed a contract to take space in One Canada Square, but has not yet
moved there. Mr Warrender added: 'I still believe in the Canary Wharf
concept.'
The International Sugar Organisation moved into One Canada Square in
September on a 25-year lease at Pounds 25 per sq ft. An official said: 'We
hope we'll be alright . . . Whatever happens I suppose we'll just carry on
as usual.'
A number of existing or prospective tenants icily refused to comment on
developments, including several which are closely tied to O&amp;Y, such as
Lehrer McGovern, construction consultants to the group.
Mr Roger Colomb, a managing director at Texaco, which is moving 1,000 staff
to Westferry Circus in August, said the company was watching developments
carefully, but had not changed its plans. 'Docklands is still developing
along the lines that everybody thought it would, although the time scale is
slightly different,' he said. 'Certain things haven't happened as quickly as
one might have expected if we had been in a boom, boom, boom period, but I
still believe they will happen.'
A construction company project manager summed up O&amp;Y's problems as 'a
classic Catch-22 situation'. He added: 'They need to attract people down
here so that they can earn money, but because they've been in the press they
can't attract people down here.'
Marks and Spencer said it still planned to open a 12,000 sq ft food store in
the area. It saw Canary Wharf as 'a business opportunity to be captured'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A Pounds 70m DOCKLANDS office building, in the shadow of Canary Wharf,
yesterday became the latest casualty of the collapse of the London property
market.
South Quay Ltd, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft office block on the Isle of
Dogs, was put into administrative receivership early yesterday.
South Quay was established in 1990 as a separate company under a
restructuring of Wiggins Group, the publicly-quoted property developer and
housebuilder which had run into trouble as a result of its developments in
Docklands.
Wiggins' bankers, which include Midland, National Westminster and Hill
Samuel, agreed that South Quay's finances should be ring-fenced so no
liability would fall back on Wiggins. South Quay Ltd's only asset was the
Docklands office block, which was to be divided into units and sold to
investors seeking tax shelter benefits in the Docklands' enterprise zone.
The banks' patience finally ran out yesterday with only 10 per cent of the
building sold, 18 months after it went on the market. Mr Robin Addy and Mr
Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, the insolvency practice of accountants Coopers
Lybrand Deloitte, were appointed administrative receivers.
Banks are still thought to be owed more than Pounds 30m, excluding previous
losses on the development, which have been fully provided for by Wiggins and
the banks under the restructuring.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Shoring up a Thatcher
memorial - Philip Stephens says John Major faces a dilemma over aid for
Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATHER cruel joke circulating in the corridors of Westminster yesterday
was that Canary Wharf might soon be renamed the Margaret Thatcher memorial
themepark. After all it was the former prime minister's unashamed admiration
for the Reichmanns which led her government to offer substantial financial
and political backing to the project.
However, it is her successor, Mr John Major, who has to bear the political
costs of a series of decisions over the next few weeks which could well
decide the future not only of Canary Wharf but of the whole east Thames
corridor.
Mr Major faces a classic Catch-22 situation. If he agrees to commit more
public money to the project he would face fierce cross-party criticism that
he is simply pouring good after bad into a development which will never be
commercially viable. If he refuses, he could find himself blamed for putting
back by a decade or more the most ambitious urban regeneration programme in
the world. As yet there is no consensus among the ministers advising him on
how he should seek to break free.
His government's public position is straightforward enough. It remains
committed to building the extension to the Underground's Jubilee Line,
regarded as essential to the long-term viability of the development - but
only if Olympia &amp; York or any subsequent owner meets the agreement to
contribute Pounds 400m towards the project.
At the same time it is willing to underline its confidence in Canary Wharf
by relocating at least 2,000 and possibly up to 5,000 civil servants there -
but only if the rents are competitive.
Behind the scenes the judgments are not so simple. No one is keen for a
large injection of public funds. The recession has wrought sufficient havoc
with the government's finances to persuade even instinctively spendthrift
ministers that money is tight.
But Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is said to be among
those who believe that if push comes to shove the regeneration of Docklands,
which he nurtured during the early 1980s, could not be allowed to fail. One
minister said yesterday: 'We have already poured billions into Docklands. We
cannot let it collapse now.'
The Treasury does not see it like that. It has never been enthusiastic about
the Jubilee Line extension. It desperately needs to save money to bring down
a soaring budget deficit. It thinks the rail link is worth far more to the
owners of Canary Wharf than they are being asked for. Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary, is said to be ready to scrap the scheme if the commitment
is not met.
Mr Major's problem is that such a hard-line stance could well further
undermine confidence - who is going to take space without the firm promise
of an Underground link? It would also make a nonsense of the plans to move
civil servants into the development.
Officially, the Department of Environment is still looking at four sites in
Docklands for its 2,000 civil servants. In reality its senior officials say
that before this week's announcement it was close to clinching a deal with
O&amp;Y. But that deal - already involving higher rents than available elsewhere
 -could only be justified if the Jubilee Line were certain to go ahead.
So if the banks refused their share of the funding and the Treasury won the
Whitehall battle against further subsidy Canary Wharf would face the double
blow of losing the railway and a large prospective tenant.
The question the banks and ministers will be asking themselves is whether Mr
Major could stand by and watch the development collapse.
The prime minister has already agreed to the costly diversion of the Channel
tunnel rail link to east London to spur development in the east Thames
corridor. Immense political capital has been invested in the successful
regeneration of Docklands.
The Treasury insists there is no such dilemma. That whoever controls Canary
Wharf will see the sense of meeting the obligation to the Jubilee Line. The
government could then do its bit through the relocation of civil servants -
at suitably knocked-down rents. Not all of Mr Major's advisers are so
sanguine.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Markets resist ripples of
gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S problems provided a day of diminishing returns for
aficionados of gloom.
The group's decision to seek protection from its creditors under Canadian
bankruptcy laws helped trigger a sharp fall in Japanese share prices and
pushed the Canadian dollar to a two-year low against the US dollar in Asian
trading.
But losses in European share markets were limited, except for property and
certain bank shares, as the perception gained strength that O&amp;Y's problems
did not threaten the world's financial system. Analysts said widespread
discussion of O&amp;Y's difficulties in recent months meant that most markets
were braced for bad news.
Canadian financial markets proved again yesterday that O&amp;Y's problems have
been less disruptive than many had feared when news of the company's
troubles first surfaced in late March.
Tokyo bore the full impact of the bankruptcy filing, which came after
working hours on Thursday in Toronto. The 225 Nikkei share index closed down
730.33 points, or 3.88 per cent. Among weaker banks and real estate issues,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo bank lost 170 points to 1,250, reflecting press reports that
its exposure to O&amp;Y could be as high at Dollars 500m. Analysts said the
Japanese market's adverse reaction to the news partly reflected its own
worries about falling real estate prices. London's FTSE-100 index lost 20.8
points in its first five minutes of trading, as some bank and property
stocks were hit by the O&amp;Y crisis. But the index partly recovered in dull
trading to close at 2,682.6, down 12.1. Barclays Bank, which lost 11p in
early trading because of its Dollars 200m exposure to O&amp;Y, closed down 6p at
380p.
Wall Street stock prices fell, with banks - led by Citicorp - particularly
hard hit in heavy trading. Early hopes that the O&amp;Y affair would encourage
the Federal Reserve to announce a further cut in interest rates faded. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 15.79 points at 3,353.09. Canadian
bonds and treasury bills ended the day stronger while the stock market in
Toronto soon recovered from the initial shock of O&amp;Y. The TSE 300 index
closed 3 points up at 3,391.0.
The Canadian dollar recovered from its Asian lows with the help of central
bank intervention. The Bank of Canada intervened to support the dollar late
on Thursday night, after the currency dived by almost three-quarters of a
cent to 82.47 US cents. By the end of trading yesterday, the dollar was back
above 83 US cents. Foreign exchange dealers in London said several central
banks, including the Bank of England, intervened to prop up the Canadian
dollar.
The Bank of Canada signalled to the markets that it would support its
currency while a statement yesterday afternoon that the Canadian government
would not be prepared to help O&amp;Y out of its difficulties temporarily
boosted confidence in the currency, one London dealer said.
Paris also felt the backwash of O&amp;Y as bank shares headed lower in early
trading. But the market made good its losses, with the CAC-40 index closing
6.95 points or 0.34 per cent higher at 2,023.95.
Swiss shares in Zurich closed about one per cent lower after some selling of
banks because of O&amp;Y.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Greene King bids for Morland - WIC sells
28.5% holding and pledges 14.9% balance to Pounds 101m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE

<TEXT>
GREENE KING, the south of England's largest regional brewer, yesterday
launched a Pounds 101.3m hostile bid for Morland, its Oxfordshire-based
rival.
The offer, triggered by the Whitbread Investment Company's need to reduce
its holdings in regional brewers to comply with the government's beer
orders, was immediately rejected as inadequate by Morland.
WIC was Morland's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 per cent holding. It is
selling a 28.5 per cent stake to Greene King for Pounds 27.23m cash and has
agreed to accept the offer for its remaining 14.9 per cent if there is no
higher bidder.
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, warned shareholders that WIC was
'a forced seller . . . influenced by motives that are not relevant to other
shareholders'.
He added that WIC had to reduce its stake in Morland by November to ensure
that its associate brewer, Whitbread, did not have to free more of its pubs
from tied beer supplies.
Speculation now surrounds the future of two more brewers, Marston, in which
WIC has a 31.4 per cent stake and Brakspear, where Whitbread has a 27 per
cent holding.
Greene King, which had tried for nearly three months to agree merger terms
with Morland, is offering nine new convertible preference shares for every
two Morland shares, equivalent to about 477p a share. There is a cash
alternative of 450p.
The paper offer represents a 47 per cent premium on the Morland share price
in February when talks began and an exit multiple of 21 times Morland's 1991
earnings.
Morland's shares closed at 458p, down 27p while Greene King fell 7p to close
at 507p.
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said that a merger made commercial
and financial sense in the changing conditions of the beer market.
'Morland faces strategic difficulties as a small independent company, with
neither the strength of brands nor the critical mass to become an efficient
low cost producer,' he said. 'Greene King is the natural merger partner,
with an excellent fit between our trading areas and similar business
cultures.'
Mr Redman estimated that the acquisition would lead to cost savings and
improved margins which should benefit trading profits of the enlarged group
by an initial Pounds 2.5m a year.
The combined estate of more than 1,100 pubs would enable Greene King to
consolidate its position in southern England where its Abbot and IPA brands
already command a 20 per cent share of the market for cask conditioned ale.
Greene King would close Morland's Abingdon brewery, with a loss of about 100
jobs, early next year and convert the site to a distribution depot, Mr
Redman said. The future of Morland's beer brands, Old Speckled Hen and
Morland's Original, would be reviewed.
Greene King recorded a marginal decline in interim pre-tax profits to
November last year of Pounds 10.9m. Bad free trade debts and higher interest
charges depressed earnings.
Morland, which bought 100 pubs from Courage last year, increased interim
profits to March 31 of Pounds 3.06m a rise of 30 per cent.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Personal View: A spirit of solidarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HANS-DIETRICH GENSCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The antagonistic system of opposing values which divided European thought
and action for more than 40 years has come to an end. This has caused some
people in the west to lose their sense of direction. A return to old
hegemonic thinking appears, to some, to be easier than the creation of a
dynamic policy of responsibility founded on a peaceful European order.
Europe is one continent. Political and economic upheavals in any part of it
affect every European country. No one can insulate themselves from this. No
one can live on an island of the blessed.
I cannot repeat often enough the tenet on which German foreign policy has
been based since the radical changes in the east began. If eastern Europe
fares badly, western Europe, too, in the longer term will not prosper.
The west bears great responsibility for the development of political,
economic, social and military stability in the new European democracies.
That is not altruism. It is a necessary precept for stability in the region
ranging from Vancouver to Vladivostok.
The process of growing together is under way. It is taking place within a
series of complementary frameworks: the European Community, Nato, the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the Council of
Europe, the North Atlantic Co-operation Council and the Western European
Union.
The European Community and the western alliance are the cores from which
Europe can draw strength. These institutions must be further and decisively
developed - both internally and externally.
As far as the European Community is concerned, the discussion over
'widening' or 'deepening' poses the wrong alternatives. Enlarging the number
of members and deepening ties in the political, economic and security fields
are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who tries to propagate this belief is a
false prophet. Such people do not simply place obstacles along the path of
integration; they also do not understood the concept of European
integration.
The founding fathers of the European Community organised it on a
pan-European basis. On this point, the language of the Treaty of Rome is
unambiguous. The economic philosophy of expanding the Community to the north
and to the south was based on the aim of bridging gaps in prosperity, in a
spirit of solidarity. This applies even more to the goal of enlarging the
Community eastwards. Through the political integration of western Europe,
traditional sources of conflict have been put aside. They have been replaced
by a growing European awareness of interdependent interests. The national
conflicts and uncertainties caused by the collapse of communism in eastern
and south-eastern Europe have not spread. This is a positive result of
post-war political developments in western Europe, which must not be
underestimated.
In Maastricht we laid the foundations for a forward-looking Community
strategy of parallel enlargement and deepening. The momentum must not be
lost. The basic condition is that the treaty establishing political union
must be ratified by all member states before the end of the year.
It is imperative that the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in June,
should lay the groundwork for the shape of Europe in 2000, based on the twin
pillars of widening and deepening.
The prerequisites are:
By 1995 those Efta states wishing to join should be jointly admitted, in as
uniform a procedure as possible. The negotiations on accession must begin in
1993.
Even this first enlargement makes institutional adjustments necessary in the
Union. This applies to a redefinition of the composition of the European
parliament and of the number of commissioners. These questions must be
clarified by the end of the year.
As the next step, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland should be able to
accede to the Community. Europe's challenge for the coming years is to
create the economic climate under which this can happen.
The institutional basis of the Community must be further developed at the
1996 review conference which was envisaged at Maastricht. This includes the
shaping of the common foreign and security policy, with the prospect of a
common defence and the extension of the powers of the European parliament.
The other reforming states of central and south-eastern Europe, too, must be
gradually brought closer to accession through association. The former Soviet
republics must be made close partners of the Union as part of the new
eastern agreements.
People who hark back to yesterday's dreams may try to escape down
nationalistic paths of salvation. The only way of barring such routes is to
open the road to Europe. This demands great effort and solidarity. If we
fail in that task, we will face incalculable consequences for our own
stability and prosperity.
The author is German foreign minister. He retires on Monday after 18 years
in office.
This is the first in an occasional series on European issues

FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the
purpose and standards of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD B BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Handy's starting point for rethinking the company implies
that companies are all large quoted plcs and that shareholders are all
institutional. The total number of UK companies is 700,000, of which only
1,955 are quoted. Prof Handy's thesis can only, therefore, apply to just
0.28 per cent of companies. And although institutions own the majority of
shares, he should not ignore private shareholders, not least because they
'think and act' differently from institutions.
Prof Handy implies that shareholders are unfairly rewarded compared with
other stakeholders. It is misleading for him to quote the purpose of the
company as being to 'enhance shareholder value' and imply that company
results achieve this purpose. They do not. The average plc dispenses 50 per
cent of value added to employees and 5 per cent to shareholders in
dividends.
We do need to rethink the company. This needs to start from an understanding
of why the model of shareholder democracy no longer works so well. 'Most
large investing institutions have neither time nor inclination to exercise
their ownership rights' is a view in the US.
Barry Riley cites the triumph of 'managerial' over 'entrepreneurial'
capitalism and points to the 'hefty remuneration to top executives' as a
symptom.
The concept of shareholder democracy and the role of the private shareholder
should be central to our re-thinking. That is why several private
shareholders are establishing a UK Private Shareholder's Association to help
them perform more effectively their ownership role. Donald B Butcher,

<TEXT>
Sir, Recent reports of internal and external 'whistle-blowers' - such as
Graham Pink, sacked as a nurse from Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport - have
drawn attention to real or alleged sub-standard conduct in public services.
Whether the complainers are right or wrong, and whether their complaints are
public or private, everyone involved seems to pay a heavy price. One
whistle-blower is reported to have incurred costs of over Pounds 70,000.
Another has lost pension rights, probably involving a much higher figure.
The governor of the Bank of England, referring to corporate misconduct at
high levels, has counselled the need for eternal vigilance as preferable to
setting up yet more watchdogs ('Bank governor urges check on corporate
abuses', April 29). But will a concerned public be sympathetic to this
'leave it in our hands' approach?
These 'scandals' do not so much point to a collapse in business standards as
to a demand for higher ones.
There is now an embryonic 'business ethic' movement. There needs to be a
constructive debate on how to identify, maintain and spread acceptable
business standards. This is the only way to avoid the dubious gimmicks,
dogmas and false dawns that industry and management seem to attract.
Adam Smith's remarkable insights more than 200 years ago can provide some,
but by no means all, of the answers to the questions raised lately by the
Archbishop of Canterbury. They cannot provide a universal licence for
everything that happens in the marketplace. John Donaldson,

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Handy ('Priorities and purposes at the heart of capitalism',
May 12) ignores shareholder behaviour in his analysis. Shareholders invest
because they expect a competitive return. If 'more and more companies are .
. . putting customers and employees ahead of shareholders in the pecking
order', it is to be expected that their shareholders will sooner or later
realise that they are receiving less than the market rate, and will switch
their holdings into companies where shareholder interests are given more
weight.
The remark 'now . . . that the investing institutions own two-thirds of the
equity of British business . . . they must become guardians (though not
owners)' seems to hanker after the cosy corporatism of the Heath-Wilson era.
The priority in widening the benefits of capitalism should be to encourage
the break-up of these grotesquely large holdings and their distribution
among small investors, such as company employees.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Archbishop of Canterbury is right to question the principle that
companies limited by shares exist to maximise shareholder value, which is
the effect of company law. Prof Handy ('Priorities and purpose at the heart
of capitalism', May 12) is optimistic in thinking companies can acquire a
different purpose without a change in company law.
While voting power coincides with capital stake, and members retain the
right to appropriate the entire residual profit of a company, market forces
will ensure that the interests of the investors of capital will predominate.
Investors can be turned into Handy's 'financiers' only if there is an open
door to new investors on equal terms to existing ones (no pre-emption
rights), and if the directors have the power to repay costly capital in
favour of cheaper. Only then through the resulting limitation of the return
on capital, is there a chance for an objects clause, which includes the
interests of other 'stakeholders', to become meaningful.
That this approach can work is demonstrated by our own success in attracting
nearly Pounds 1.5m from private investors for investment on these terms in
non-profit enterprise in Third World countries. Mark Hayes,

FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: Partnership no help to schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss F M MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The 'partnership' between business and education that the government is
encouraging is well illustrated by the current initiative being promoted by
a well-known supermarket.
For Pounds 25 spent, you will earn a voucher which can be given to your
local school towards free computer equipment, which the supermarket is
offering: 300 vouchers will give you one piece of software; 300 vouchers
means you have to spend Pounds 7,500.
In my inner London primary school, we have collected 121 vouchers. Or, to
put it another way, the children and their parents have spent Pounds 3,025
for half a computer programme. To get a whole programme they will have to
spend another Pounds 4,475 by the end of next week.
The offer was due to close next week; but we are now told that it has been
extended until the end of the month, by 'popular demand'.
The children's expectations have been raised unrealistically. Family
tensions have risen as shopping habits have been changed for the good of the
school. And we have no chance of being able to collect another 179 vouchers.
The partnership appears to be loaded, not, however, to the benefit of the
schools. Next time we need some software, we'll go for a partnership with
parents and friends and leave 'business' out of it.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Ulster talks at risk in row over leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over the leaking of nationalists' plans for Northern Ireland
overshadowed negotiations yesterday on the province's future and reduced
still further the chance of success in the 'round table' talks in Belfast.
After an incident that deepened distrust between Unionists and the mainly
Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, said the leak 'must have been calculated . . .
to frustrate the talks'.
His statement after a plenary session and bilateral meetings with the party
leaders suggested that the day's exchanges had been dominated by the leak
and had led to a fresh delay before real issues are debated. Last year's
talks initiative failed because of similar seemingly small but deeply
symbolic rows. A further plenary session has been called for Monday.
The SDLP proposed the appointment of six commissioners for Northern Ireland.
Three would be elected locally and one each by the UK and Irish governments
and the European Community.
The plan has horrified Unionists - if only because of Dublin's enhanced role
in the province's affairs - and the leaking of the SDLP document has
increased pressure on Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the
Unionist leaders, from their more extreme supporters to resist concessions
to the SDLP.
Sir Patrick's statement was, however, agreed by all the party leaders. He
said: 'For my own part I'm wholly satisfied that anyone who leaked this
document had no vestige of authority to do so on behalf of any political
party.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Reservations on travel package: The doubts about moves to
protect tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Michael Heseltine, the new trade and industry secretary, wants an
early opportunity to justify his interventionist reputation, Britain's
package tour operators are eager to help.
Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Heseltine's predecessor, proposed new regulations to
help holidaymakers stranded abroad when their tour company collapsed. They
are needed by the end of the year to act on a European Community directive
on package holidays that requires buyers of package holidays, whether
domestic or foreign, to be protected against corporate collapse.
Holiday companies say the Department of Trade and Industry's proposals would
hugely increase costs and would, in some cases, offer travellers a lower
level of protection than they enjoy now.
Mr Lilley had proposed that travel companies make their own arrangements to
protect customers. They could either arrange a bonding or insurance scheme
to cover all money they received as pre-payment from holidaymakers, or place
all that money in a designated account. The money could be withdrawn only
when the service to which it related had been performed.
A travel organiser who failed to have adequate cover would have committed a
criminal offence, the department said, 'and this would be apparent if he
became insolvent'.
The travel industry's derision was uncontained.
Holidaymakers who had lost their money or were stranded abroad would have to
console themselves with the thought that at least their travel organiser
would be prosecuted. In addition, leaving pre-payments in a designated
account was impractical. Tour operators needed the money to make advance
payments for travel and accommodation.
Since the general election, the travel trade has been asking the department
to think again. It wants a licensing system that covers all package tourists
booking foreign holidays. sea.
Mr John Dunscombe, president of the Association of British Travel Agents
(Abta), said: 'We are an industry that depends on the total confidence of
the public.'
Customer protection is a travel industry obsession. Travel company failures,
such as the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group (ILG)
last year, are the tabloid reporter's dream. Poolside scenes of
holidaymakers facing the prospect of staying in Majorca forever are the
travel industry's nightmare.
The number of foreign holidays taken by British residents has increased from
8m in 1975 to 20m last year, of which 11m were charter airline package
holidays. The travel industry fears that a succession of company failures
would slow that growth.
The reality, Abta says, is that over the past 20 years no British tourist
has lost money on a foreign package holiday.
The industry's accumulated experience since the collapse of Court Line and
its Horizon and Clarkson Holidays subsidiaries in 1974 has led to the
establishment of a system of consumer protection which, Abta says, is the
most advanced in the European Community.
Providers of charter-based package holidays have to have an Air Transport
Organiser's Licence (Atol) from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They are
required to have a bond, usually equivalent to between 10 per cent and 15
per cent of turnover, to ensure that pre-payments are returned and
holidaymakers repatriated if the company collapses. That is backed up by the
Air Travel Trust Fund. Many ferry-based holidays, but not all, are also well
protected.
Companies selling ferry-based holidays often have a bond arranged by Abta or
another trade body. If the bond is insufficient to cover the consequences of
a company collapse, Abta's insurance makes up the shortfall. If that is
exhausted, Abta members dig into their own pockets, as they did in last
year's school-tour operator failures. Mr Dunscombe says, however, that an
unknown number of ferry-based holiday companies are selling unprotected
holidays.
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director of Eurocamp, which sells camping and
mobile-home holidays, says the level of his company's bond under the DTI
proposals would be between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of turnover. 'We
could do it, although it would be difficult for us. But it would drive
others out of business.'
The travel industry believes that the best way to implement the EC directive
is to require every company taking travellers abroad to be licensed, under
the control of a new independent authority set up to complement the existing
Atol system.
The consumer would be protected and the industry would be happy. The DTI's
new management should find the argument irresistible.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Blunkett urges party reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING reforms of Labour's organisation were called for last night by Mr
David Blunkett, a member of the party's national executive and campaign
manager for Mr Bryan Gould's leadership bid.
In a speech interpreted as an attack on the tightly knit group who ran the
general election campaign, Mr Blunkett said the party's defeat should prompt
a radical reorganisation that would switch the focus of its effort from its
headquarters to local activists.
He urged greater emphasis on campaigning and a redirection of the party's
resources from central to local level, alongside a move to strengthen
political control over communications' strategies.
Meanwhile, Mr John Prescott, Labour transport spokesman, has won the backing
of two union executives in his challenge for the deputy leadership of the
party.
Mr Prescott has made a strong bid for the union vote, warning against any
radical break in union-party links. With union backing he may put in a
strong challenge to Mrs Margaret Beckett, the favourite for the deputy post.
The two executives to back him are those of Nupe, the public-service union,
and GPMU, the print union. Both unions are conducting ballots of their
members so it is possible that the executive recommendations could be
ignored.
Mr Prescott, who is regarded as the candidate of the left, is unlikely to
receive the backing of the largest unions.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Ravenscraig to close by end of June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL is to bring forward the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks
in Scotland to the end of next month. It says market conditions mean there
will be no need for the plant's output after that date.
The company announced in January that it would close the remaining parts of
the integrated steel complex, at Motherwell near Glasgow, 'no later than
September'.
Shop stewards at Ravenscraig, which now employs 1,200 people, gave a
resigned response. Mr George Quinn, crafts convener, said: 'Most people
inside the plant will be relieved because they now actually know when the
closing date is. They are not hanging on.'
Opposition politicians in Scotland reacted angrily. The Scottish National
party said: 'We now face the scandal of an efficient, productive industry
being butchered while the largest single market for steel in Europe, the
North Sea, lies off our coasts.'
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, whom British Steel informed shortly
after releasing the closure date, said the early closure was regrettable,
although it came as no surprise. It was now time to concentrate on plans for
the future of the Lanarkshire area, where an enterprise zone is to be
created.
British Steel's action is a further sign of its difficulties. It said the
market for strip products, in which Ravenscraig operates, had not improved
since the January closure announcement.
Although demand in the UK was 'not too bad', the company said, there was
falling demand accompanied by uneconomic price levels in the European
market. British Steel's two plants in south Wales had stocks to cope with
current UK demand and any upturn from other markets.
The closure affects both Ravenscraig and the related ore and coal handling
terminal at Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde.
The company is providing a counselling service for employees and will
relocate some to other parts of the company.
The final rundown of Ravenscraig started with the closure of its strip mill
early last year, with the loss of 770 jobs. A further 1,245 jobs went last
summer when British Steel closed one of the two working blast furnaces at
the plant.
Last month Nucor, the US steel producer, said it would investigate the
possibility of establishing a 1.2m-tonnes-a-year mini-mill on a greenfield
site in Scotland. It ruled out taking over any of the Ravenscraig plant.

FT  16 MAY 92 / City puts rise in inflation down to special factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT the annual rate of headline inflation jumped to 4.3 per cent in
April failed to fluster the City yesterday with most economists and the
Treasury attributing the rise to special factors rather than underlying
inflationary pressures.
According to the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the 1.5 per cent leap in
the retail prices index from 136.7 in March to 138.8 in April mainly
reflected price rises for tobacco, alcohol, petrol and vehicle licences that
resulted from higher excise duties introduced in the March budget.
The rise was exacerbated by last year's Pounds 140 reduction in poll tax
bills dropping out of the index, although that was partly offset by much of
last year's increase in VAT also dropping out of the 12-month comparison.
Many of the increases for other goods and services were less than a year ago
and seasonal food prices fell by 1.9 per cent, the first April drop since
1972. That brought the year-on-year rate of inflation for seasonal foods to
minus 2.5 per cent, the lowest rate since February 1989, when it was minus
3.3 per cent.
The CSO said the fall was due in particular to plentiful imports and
home-grown supplies of tomatoes, lettuces and cucumbers, along with slightly
lower demand in mid April. Non-seasonal food prices also went down, falling
0.1 per cent on the month.
Prices in all the other components of the index rose in April, with tobacco
showing the biggest increase. The CSO said the average price of 20 king-size
cigarettes rose from Pounds 1.97 in March to Pounds 2.09p in April.
There were also steep price increases in the housing component of the index,
which rose 3.9 per cent on the month. The CSO said poll tax bills had
increased by 13.3 per cent on average, and water and sewerage charges by
10.1 per cent. Repairs and maintenance charges also rose.
Prices of household goods rose only 0.1 per cent on the month, the smallest
increase since 1967. That reflected discounts on furniture and furnishings.

THE ROW between Britain and Jersey over the dismissal of one of the island's

Earlier this week Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, angered many islanders
when he dismissed Mr Vernon Tomes as deputy bailiff, a post combining
judicial functions with the deputy speakership of the island's parliament.
The reason for dismissal was inefficiency in delivering legal judgments.
Now moves are afoot to split the post's functions. That would not affect
Jersey's distinctive financial regime or its status as an autonomous
territory under the Crown.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Final swaps test case settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST of six test-case actions in the High Court between banks and local
authorities over interest rate swaps transactions has been settled out of
court on undisclosed terms, John Mason writes.
NationsBank of North Carolina agreed terms with Hammersmith and Fulham
Council, which had faced a claim from the bank for Pounds 306,000 plus
interest of more than Pounds 150,000 and legal costs. The agreement means
that all six of the swaps test cases have been settled out of court.
A High Court hearing will be held on June 8 to determine whether new test
cases should be selected.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Tories urge aid for pensioners: Maxwell campaigners call on
institutions to establish fund to maintain payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX senior Tory MPs are putting pressure on banks and other financial
institutions that dealt with the late Mr Robert Maxwell, saying they have a
moral obligation to ensure that all Maxwell pensioners continue to receive
their pensions.
Mr Maxwell is thought to have siphoned Pounds 900m from pension funds,
public companies and banks, recycling most of it to other banks.
The campaign by the Conservative backbenchers urging institutions involved
in the Maxwell affair to set up a fund to maintain payments to the
pensioners will gather momentum next week when MPs meet some of the
companies.
The move follows yesterday's tabling of a parliamentary early day motion
advocating such a fund by six senior Tories, headed by Mr Spencer Batiste,
the MP for Elmet, near Leeds.
The motion says financial institutions that were 'unwise' enough to have
dealings with the late tycoon have 'a moral obligation' to ensure that
Maxwell pensioners continue to receive their pensions. Setting up a fund to
maintain payments until ownership of the main assets had been established
would be 'without prejudice' to the institutions' legal claims.
The attempt to enlist private-sector help follows failure to gain government
commitments of financial support. Ms Ann Widdecombe, a junior social
security minister, has said it would be premature for the government to
commit itself to any action.
On Tuesday Mr Richard Page, Conservative MP for Hertfordshire South-West,
and Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security committee in the
last parliament, are to meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, to
argue that the government should seek ways of keeping pension funds open
until investigations into the state of the Maxwell funds are complete.
Mr Batiste said: 'My impression is that at the end of the day there will be
a legal settlement involving financial institutions coughing up a fair
amount.' It would be wrong for the government, which appeared to have no
liability, to 'come forward and let those with liabilities off the hook'.
He admits to a strong interest as '240-odd' Maxwell pensioners whose
payments have been stopped live in Leeds.

FT  16 MAY 92 / 'Work of commission should cease to be legislative'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Extracts from Mrs Thatcher's speech at The Hague yesterday:
THE GERMAN QUESTION
If I were a German today, I would be proud - proud but also worried. I would
be proud of the magnificent achievement of rebuilding my country,
entrenching democracy and assuming the undoubtedly preponderant position in
Europe. But I would also be worried about the European Community and its
direction.
The German taxpayer pays dearly for his place in Europe. Britain and Germany
have a strong joint interest in ensuring that the other community countries
pay their fair share of the cost - and control the community's spending more
enthusiastically - without leaving us to carry so much of the burden.
Germany is well-equipped to encourage such financial prudence. Indeed, I
would trust the Bundesbank more than any other European Central Bank to keep
down inflation . . .
A reunited Germany can't and won't subordinate its national interests in
economic or in foreign policy to those of the community indefinitely. And
sometimes Germany will be right, when the rest are wrong, as it was over the
recognition of Croatia and Slovenia.
Nevertheless Germany's power is a problem - as much for the Germans as for
the rest of Europe. Germany is too large to be just another player in the
European game but not large enough to establish unquestioned supremacy over
its neighbours . . .
What follows from this is that German power will be best accommodated in a
looser Europe in which individual nation-states retain their freedom of
action . . .
EUROPE FREE AND DEMOCRATIC
Now - with the commission exploiting the Single European Act to accumulate
powers of greater direction and regulation - Europe is reaching the point at
which it must choose between these two approaches. Is it to be a tightly
regulated, centralised bureaucratic federal state, imposing uniform
standards throughout the continent? Or is it to be a loose-knit
decentralised free-market Europe of sovereign states, based upon competition
between different national systems of tax and regulation within a free trade
area?
The federalists at least seem to be clear. The Maastricht Treaty met the
commission's requirement for a 'single institutional framework' for the
community. Yet, before the ink was even dry on the treaty, it was reported
that the president of the European Commission was seeking more money and
more powers for the commission which would become the executive of the
community - in other words a European government . . .
Nor is there any mystery about the urgency with which they press the
federalist cause . . . A half-Europe imposed by Soviet tyranny was one
thing; a half-Europe imposed by Brussels would be a moral catastrophe
depriving the community of its European legitimacy.
THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION
In 1996, when the arrangements agreed at Maastricht are due to be reviewed -
and probably a good deal earlier - the community should move in exactly the
opposite direction to that proposed by the European federalists.
A community of sovereign states committed to voluntary co-operation, a
lightly regulated free market and international free trade does not need a
commission in its present form. The government of the community - to the
extent that this term is appropriate - is the council of ministers,
consisting of representatives of democratically elected national
governments. The work of the commission should cease to be legislative in
any sense. It should be . . . administrative.
CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE
Why need every new European initiative require the participation of all
members of the community? It will sometimes be the case - especially after
enlargement - that only some community members will want to move forward to
another stage of integration.
Here I pay tribute to John Major's achievement in persuading the other 11
community heads of government that they could move ahead to a Social
Chapter, but not within the treaty and without Britain's participation. It
sets a vital precedent . . .
If the European Community proceeds in the direction which the majority of
member state governments and the commission seem to want, they will create a
structure which brings insecurity, unemployment, national resentment and
ethnic conflict.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Accountants' pay rise trails national average at 6.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS' salaries grew by less than the average increase in UK earnings
last year in the face of large-scale redundancies, the annual survey from
Robert Half, financial recruitment consultants, showed yesterday.
Salaries rose 6.3 per cent, compared with 8.1 per cent in 1990-91 and a peak
of 13 per cent in 1988-89. UK average earnings in the year to February,
published on Wednesday, grew by 7.5 per cent.
According to the survey, the top 20 firms made about 1,000 professionals
redundant in 1991, and a further 2,000 from other firms lost their jobs.
It said that just over half of the companies questioned made staff
redundant. The proportion was highest in the west Midlands, where 61 per
cent of companies shed employees. Most who lost their jobs were clerical
staff.
Recruitment advertising declined by 60 per cent last year, while 21 per cent
of companies reported more than 200 replies to a single advertised vacancy.
Mr Grout said that while the quantity of job applicants had risen, the
quality had not, although he expected many higher-calibre candidates who are
currently employed to change jobs in the second half of the year.
Demand for individuals who have qualified with the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants was now higher than the demand for chartered
accountants, reflecting their greater commercial experience.
Nearly 60 per cent of companies offer some form of bonus in addition to
salary. Two fifths offer share options and season ticket loans and 28 per
cent have profit-sharing schemes.
The proportion of companies offering benefits was down slightly on previous
years, although Mr Grout said there was an increase in a 'flexible menu' of
benefits.
The estimated cost of two outstanding investigations by the accountancy
profession's joint disciplinary scheme is almost Pounds 1m, its annual
report showed yesterday.
A committee of inquiry into matters surrounding the Barlow Clowes group of
companies, and another concerned with Minet Holdings, WMD Underwriting
Agencies and Alexander Howden Group, are expected to cost Pounds 925,000
before resolution.
A third case into Milbury and Westminster Property Group was concluded last
November after incurring costs of Pounds 224,000.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Scandal forces Indian markets to close
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S stock markets were closed yesterday to prevent a further collapse in
prices after police seized assets belonging to Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay
broker under investigation for alleged fraud in the securities market.
Share prices , have swung wildly since the country's worst financial scandal
broke three weeks ago. Yesterday the Bombay Stock Exchange suspended Mr
Mehta, and the Central Bureau of Investigation froze his bank accounts and
impounded his share certificates.
Mr Mehta, the main architect of the bull run that more than tripled prices
over the last year, is under investigation for allegedly buying shares out
of funds illegally raised from the interbank market in government and public
sector debt.
His suspension was announced after a meeting he had last night with the
stock exchange authorities. Also suspended were his brother, Mr Ashwin
Mehta, and Mrs Jyoti Mehta, his wife.
Mr Mehta said yesterday that he would honour all his commitments and called
for a meeting with creditors to agree on a way to settle his debts. He said
creditors had 'no real reason to panic'.
He expressed his concern for investors who faced 'the melting of their
wealth.' He assured them 'the long term outlook of the country and the
market is very bright'.
The closing of the market came after a week in which the Bombay 30 share
index recovered some ground because of massive buying by the state owned
financial institutions after plunging violently with the uncovering of the
scandal.
The index, at 3,394, is 24 per cent down on its April 22 peak - but still
trading at historically unrealistic price/earnings ratios.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, is to review financial sector
reform at a meeting today with Mr S Venkitaramanan, the Reserve Bank
governor, and the heads of other financial institutions.
Bankers and government officials fear the disclosure of stock market abuses
could damage Indian hopes of tapping direct portfolio investment from
abroad.
The scandal could also make it more difficult for Indian companies to raise
funds on the Euromarkets. Reliance, the petrochemicals group controlled by
the Ambani family,is expected to be the first Indian company to
seekEuromarkets funds with a Dollars 100m issue in June.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday agreed in principle to rewrite the German
constitution to give the 16 German states much wider powers to control any
future transfer of sovereignty to the European Community.
The potentially sweeping agreement was outlined at negotiations in Bonn
between the chancellor and the state prime ministers, as a precondition for
their ratification of the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union.
Senior officials are fearful the deal - not yet finalised - will severely
restrict Germany's room for manoeuvre to negotiate with its EC partners.
It means in future any transfer of sovereignty to Brussels must be approved
by two-thirds majorities in both chambers of the German parliament,
including the Bundesrat, representing the states.
The deal proposed by the states would not be simply restricted to those
responsibilities which already belong to the 16 states - such as education,
police or tourism - but extend to any area of European political union, such
as defence and foreign policy.
The new article in the constitution to be drafted in the coming weeks will
set a 'united Europe' or 'United States of Europe' as a formal goal of the
German state, provided it is compatible with the principles underlying the
German constitution, democracy, federalism, rule of law, and social justice.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Prado to lose masterpieces: A new collection arrives, and
Guernica moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as Madrid prepares to receive a fabulous artistic windfall, Spain's
cultural bureaucracy is pillaging the long-established Prado museum of its
20th-century masterpieces.
This weekend the first of 900 paintings owned by Baron Heinrich-Hans
Thyssen-Bornemisza will be packed in Lugano, Switzerland, for eventual
hanging in a lavishly overhauled 18th-century building across the street
from the Prado.
Next week the trustees of the Prado will be told the Culture Ministry has
decided to remove Pablo Picasso's Guernica and put it in an arts centre
called the Reina Sofia, to be inaugurated next month.
'It is as if the Louvre was ordered to hand over its antiquities to a new
archaeological museum,' says Mr Alfredo Perez-Arminan, a former director
general of Fine Arts - a section of the ministry - and a prominent member of
the Friends of the Prado Association.
Fuelling the controversy is the fact that Picasso, who was briefly the
Prado's director, had specified that, once democracy was restored to Spain,
Guernica should hang in the nation's premier museum.
The searing canvas, which condemns the 1937 bombing of the Basque town of
the same name during the Spanish Civil War, was painted in Paris and hung in
New York until 1981.
Under the Culture Ministry's plans the Prado will also lose to the Reina
Sofia arts centre 63 preliminary sketches that Picasso made for Guernica,
and the small but strong collection of Juan Gris and Joan Miro canvases
donated to the museum by the cubist art historian Douglas Cooper and by
Miro's widow.
Mr Perez-Arminan points out that if the ministry rides roughshod over
donations made to the Prado, the museum can hardly expect to receive any
more.
'Why cannot the Prado be a proper home for Picasso, Miro, Gris and other
masters of our century?' asks Mr Francisco Calvo Serraller, one of Spain's
most influential art critics.
Laments among Prado supporters do not end there.
The Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, which will remain in Madrid initially for
nine years, will make the city a magnet for art-lovers. But it effectively
deprives the Prado of both funds and space for a long overdue enlargement.
A total of Pta9bn (Pounds 49m) was set aside from the state budget to
prepare the collection's new premises and to establish a fund that will
provide Baron Heinrich-Hans with an annual Pta500m for the loan of his
pictures.
Restoration work on the new Thyssen-Bornemisza museum was completed last
week and its roomy galleries will be opened in October. The magnificent
building was originally intended to house the Prado's outstanding collection
of Goyas and so allow the Prado space to exhibit masterpieces, among them a
unique series of Tiepolos, stored deep in its vaults.
The Culture Ministry says it has no money to offer the Prado alternative
accommodation. It did not skimp, however, on the main beneficiary of the
Prado's losses: Pta10bn has been spent to transform the Reina Sofia, a huge
200-year-old former hospital, into a modern art museum.
So much was spent on rebuilding the Reina Sofia that little was left to
augment a permanent collection that, save for legacies by Miro and Dali, is
judged to be indifferent.
The new centre's comparative poverty is the chief reason the Culture
Ministry gives for its decision to poach from the Prado. Critics say it
amounts to putting icing on a non-existent cake.

SIX republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) yesterday
signed a defence pact, but Ukraine, its second largest member, was among
five others that refused to join, Reuter reports from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
The collective defence agreement was trumpeted as a showpiece of the CIS's
fourth summit since it was set up last December on the ruins of the Soviet
Union. But in reality, it exposed the fragility and divisions within the
11-member grouping.
Russia, Armenia and four Central Asian republics signed the accord, which
commits signatories to come to the assistance of any member subjected to an
attack. Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan declined to
sign.
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, one of the CIS's strongest
advocates, said the pact established a formal base for the independent
republics' security.
All members of the commonwealth agreed in principle to implement the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, which calls for deep cuts in
conventional weapons.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said the high number of refusals in signing
the defence pact was a 'cause for regret and even a degree of
misunderstanding. We are talking here about collective security. The entire
world is moving towards this,' he said.
Mr Vitold Fokin, Ukraine's prime minister, said the pact was incompatible
with other commonwealth agreements, which had anyway failed to halt ethnic
conflicts.

HEALTH ministers yesterday delayed a decision on an EC-wide ban on tobacco
advertising until November at the earliest.
Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC health commissioner and the measure's strongest
advocate, now fears that the British, and the Danish - who hold the EC
presidency for the next two six-month terms from July - will give the
directive a low priority, in effect pushing it off the agenda for a year.
Ministers from Germany, Britain and the Netherlands - which form a blocking
minority - yesterday reiterated their objections to a ban.
Some states said it was contradictory for the European Commission to try to
ban advertising while it subsidised Community tobacco production.
The measure will now be discussed by national officials and should be tabled
again at the next health ministers' meeting in November under the British
presidency.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Japanese banks face 'serious' debt problem: Confidential
report puts bad and doubtful debts at Y42,000bn to Y53,000bn

<TEXT>
THE collapse of the Japanese property boom has left banks with a bad debt
problem that is 'serious but not lethal', according to a senior official of
the Bank of Japan, the central bank.
Yesterday, the stock market lost some of its recent gains, on renewed
worries about banks' exposure to property sparked by the troubles of Olympia
&amp; York. The Nikkei index closed down 730.33 at 18,074.27.
The central bank official said Japan's bad loan data were 'still a moving
target' because the commercial property market had not yet stabilised.
'Nobody at this moment can possibly have an accurate estimate because the
situation in real estate is so fluid,' he said.
The official said the Bank of Japan had been carrying out 'all sorts of
mental exercises' to calculate the possible magnitude of the problem.
A report circulating among bankers in Tokyo, said to be based on
confidential Bank of Japan data, puts the total bad and doubtful debts of
the banks and financial institutions at Y42,000bn to Y53,000bn (Pounds 177bn
to Pounds 224bn).
The report, obtained by the Financial Times, indicates total potential
problem loans are far greater than the banks or the authorities have
hitherto admitted. Moreover, the estimate is based on figures collected at
the end of last September. A further fall in land prices since then could
well have aggravated the position.
However, the figures add together different categories of problem loans  -
including loans on which at least some interest is being paid as well as
those where interest payments have stopped altogether. They are also
calculated without taking account of the value of collateral.
For the three categories of leading national banks - the top commercial or
'city' banks, the long-term credit banks and trust banks - problem loans
total Y26,400bn-Y35,400bn. This compares with a figure published by the
Ministry of Finance last month of Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn for loans at these banks
on which interest had not been paid for six months or more.
The contrast suggests that the ministry's figures could grow markedly in the
next year or two, as more loans move from the doubtful to the non-performing
category.
The report says estimated total problem loans of Y42,000bn-Y56,000bn account
for 6.5-8.7 per cent of total loans as at the end of September 1991. Of
this, some Y19,000bn-Y25,000bn are loans to property companies and a further
Y23,000bn-Y31,000bn are loans to non-bank financial companies, which in turn
lent heavily to property developers.
The biggest burden falls on city banks, with problem loans of
Y13,700bn-Y18,300bn. However, other banks have higher ratios of problem
loans to total loans - including long-term credit banks, trust banks and
non-life insurance companies.
Japan-based foreign banks also suffered damage - with some Y1,800bn-Y2,300bn
in problem loans, fully 16.2-20.7 per cent of their total loans in Japan.
This figure confirms anecdotal evidence of foreign banks lending to Japanese
non-banks relatively late in the property boom.

FT  16 MAY 92 / US output rise boosts hopes of recovery

HOPES of a sustained US economic recovery were bolstered yesterday when the
Federal Reserve reported a 0.5 per cent increase in industrial production in
April, the third consecutive monthly increase.
The figures were better than financial markets expected and partly reflected
a sharp rebound in car production. However, most sectors of industry have
shown a steady improvement since January.
Production has now almost retraced the falls of last autumn, when the
economy seemed to be heading for a 'double-dip' recession. Industrial output
stands 2.5 per cent above the level in April last year.
Manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent last month and 2.9 per cent in the
year to April.
The improved production figures follow reports of gains in both employment
and retail sales in April. On Thursday the Fed also reported a sharp rise in
the money supply, bringing it just above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per
cent target range.
Many analysts believe a quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates is
still likely in the next few weeks despite the improved economic figures.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Hint of new pay offer in German engineering row

GERMANY'S engineering employers yesterday hinted at an improved pay offer
and new talks with the engineering workers were agreed for today, the first
ray of hope in the country's embattled industrial relations.
Negotiations will be reopened in Karlsruhe for the key north
Baden-Wurttemberg area, home to such big engineering employers as
Daimler-Benz and Robert Bosch, and to 700,000 of Germany's 4m engineering
workers.
The region is the one which produced a breakthrough in each of the past two
years of engineering industry wage negotiations, giving rise to a degree of
optimism otherwise scarcely justified by the progress of the talks so far.
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of the Gesamtmetall employers'
organisation, indicated in a radio interview that a new offer was probable,
but he also insisted that the 5.4 per cent pay award agreed in the public
sector could not be a target for the engineering industry.
Mr Dieter Hundt, leader of the employers' side in north Baden-Wurttemberg,
said that after the collapse of last-ditch negotiations in both Hesse and
North Rhine-Westphalia it was still important 'to use every chance, however
slim, to come to an agreement at the negotiating table'.
At the moment the gap between IG Metall, the huge engineering workers'
union, demanding a 9.5 per cent pay rise, and Gesamtmetall, offering 3.3 per
cent, seems dauntingly wide.
Although some union leaders have suggested that a deal could be done around
6 per cent, the employers insist that is still too high.
After the talks were agreed, the IG Metall regional leaders agreed to
postpone the meeting of their wages commission until tomorrow, when it will
have to decide if the negotiations have failed, and whether to call a strike
ballot.
On Monday, the national leadership of IG Metall will decide which regions of
the country will hold strike ballots. and therefore which regions will be
hit by strike action from May 25, if no deal is forthcoming sooner. The
employers have threatened a widespread lock-out.

French prices rose by between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent in April, the
11th consecutive month that France's rate of inflation has been lower than
Germany's, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
This brings to 1 per cent the rise in French prices since the turn of the
year, or 3.1 per cent in 12 months, provisional figures show - a slight
decline in the annual rate, from 3.2 per cent in March.

THE Security Council last night demanded an immediate halt to fighting in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the withdrawal of Serb-led Yugoslav federal troops and
Croatian army units, and the disbanding of all irregular forces, Reuter
reports from the United Nations.
In a unanimous resolution, the council also demanded full co-operation with
a 14,000-strong UN Protection Force which is taking control of three heavily
Serb-populated areas of neighbouring Croatia to replace the Yugoslav army
and oversee the disarming of all irregulars.
The resolution calls on UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to study
ways of protecting humanitarian supplies, which have been looted by
irregular forces, and of ensuring safe access to the airport at Sarajevo,
the Bosnian capital, through which relief flights pass.
Ceasefires have been broken almost daily in Bosnia-Hercegovina, where more
than 1,300 people have died since its Moslem and Croat communities declared
independence in March against Serb opposition.

<TEXT>
THE Spanish government is to press ahead with tough new anti-strike
legislation after failing to reach agreement with trades unions in
negotiations last week, Peter Bruce writes from Madrid.
Just two weeks before a general strike planned for May 28, the government
has decided to abandon negotiations on the law with the unions.
The law, certain to be passed in the next few months, seeks to regulate the
way strikes are run. It would allow the state to impose minimum services
during strikes, fine or sack strike leaders, withdraw state subsidies to
unions, and give judges the power to decide whether a strike was political
and therefore illegal.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Russia ends controls on oil and gas prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA yesterday liberalised internal oil and gas prices as part of a
long-promised market reform which will hit faltering state-owned enterprises
and outlying republics hardest.
The government will continue controlling prices for oil and gas sold to
Russian enterprises - but at six times higher than the present artificially
low Rbs350 a tonne.
The system, expected to be put in place over the next fortnight, will be
enforced by fining suppliers who exceed new ceilings for energy prices.
The resolution, signed by President Boris Yeltsin, also says former Soviet
republics which do not have special arrangements for oil sales in bilateral
agreements with Russia will have to pay prices based on 'world levels'.
Dismantling state controls on energy prices is a key component of the
radical economic reform programme which Moscow has agreed with the
International Monetary Fund.
Yesterday's measures aim to stabilise energy prices but they will inflict
unpredictable hardships on inefficient enterprises, and will throw into
disarray the economies of other republics which do not have their own energy
supplies, or which, in the case of the Baltics, have no special deal with
Russia.
The new ceiling for oil prices charged to Russian enterprises will be
between Rbs1,800 (after which suppliers will be taxed up 90 per cent) and
Rbs2,200 (after which increases are a punishable offence). But these are
still considerably below the world market price.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Banks face Dollars 3bn losses on their O&amp;Y loans: Markets
shudder after world's biggest property developer files for insolvency
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL MARKETS around the world shuddered yesterday at the news that
Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, had filed for
insolvency protection in Canada and the US late on Thursday night.
As the markets recovered their poise, it emerged that banks face losses of
at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) on their loans to O&amp;Y.
The scale of banks' losses became clear after Citicorp, the biggest US bank,
said in a submission to the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that it had
written off Dollars 101m of its loans to the property developer and
classified the remaining Dollars 279m as non-performing.
Bankers said they believed other banks' losses on O&amp;Y loans to be similar.
Indeed, bank losses could be higher still, since Citicorp said it took the
Dollars 101m write off before the group made its filing for protection from
its creditors.
O&amp;Y insisted that Canary Wharf, a 10-year project started in 1987 and
costing up to Pounds 3bn, was unaffected by the legal moves in Canada and
would continue on schedule.
The reassurances helped to calm the London stock market, where bank and
property shares were marked down sharply at the start of trading but clawed
their way back by the end of the day.
News of Citicorp's losses was the most startling development on a day filled
with repercussions from O&amp;Y's move. Other developments included:
The disclosure by O&amp;Y's chief bank negotiator, Mr Steve Miller, that O&amp;Y is
hopeful the government will rent 500,000 square feet of unoccupied office
space at Canary Wharf. Such a move could save the Docklands development from
filing for insolvency protection in the UK. The government is being offered
the space, enough for 2,000 civil servants, at Pounds 15 a square foot.
A signal from Mr John Major that there would be no government 'bail-out' to
rescue Canary Wharf and, therefore, that it would only take the space at a
commercial rent. The prime minister's office also backed the Treasury's
refusal to reduce O&amp;Y's Pounds 400m contribution to the costs of extending
the Jubilee underground railway line to Canary Wharf.
However, Mr Miller hinted that construction of the Jubilee line could be
delayed by two years, to defer O&amp;Y's and its bankers' contributions to the
cost, though he hopes this can be avoided. The Canary Wharf banks are also
pressing for the final Pounds 300m tranche of the Jubilee payment to be
deferred for many years.
A preliminary decision by a caucus of bank lenders to Canary Wharf to keep
the Docklands project out of administration under UK insolvency procedures
until at least the end of May, though a formal decision will be made over
the weekend.
Pressure on the Canadian dollar, following O&amp;Y's insolvency filings, which
was stemmed by co-ordinated intervention by the Bank of England and the
Royal Bank of Canada.
Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's insolvency filing, under Canada's Companies' Creditors
Arrangements Act, initially gives O&amp;Y protection from its creditors in
Canada until October 21.
Thereafter, any agreement on restructuring its debt will have to be approved
by three quarters of each class of lender.
In granting the order, Mr Justice Robert Blair said the potential
implications of O&amp;Y collapsing were 'startling, far-reaching and worldwide.
'If such a cataclysm can be avoided, every effort should be made to do so',
he said.
O&amp;Y said yesterday that, during the period of protection, it would halt
payments on CDollars 8.4bn (Pounds 3.96bn) of its total CDollars 14bn of
debt, including CDollars 600m-CDollars 700m a year in interest. But it said
all other payments to employees, suppliers and tenants would be maintained.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, described the debt standstill as a
'surgical' move, and said it would 'provide the stability for operating
companies to concentrate on the long-term restructuring plan'.
He said that negotiations with lenders were 'making good progress'.
According to Toronto court documents, O&amp;Y will present a debt restructuring
plan by July 13 for approval of its creditors.
It will report on the status of debt restructuring negotiations on a monthly
basis, beginning on June 15, and a meeting of O&amp;Y's creditors must be held
by September 21, the court ordered.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Decision made to avoid disorderly assets liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S financial system would have faced 'tremendous risks' if Olympia
&amp; York had allowed its creditors to seize its assets, Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's
chief bank negotiator, said yesterday.
Mr Miller, a partner of the US investment bank James D Wolfensohn, said O&amp;Y
filed for protection from its creditors in Canada and the US on Thursday
night to avoid a disorderly liquidation of its assets.
He was being interviewed on O&amp;Y's private motor launch as he travelled along
the River Thames to catch a Concorde flight to New York.
Mr Miller, who said he had not slept in a week because of shuttling between
bank meetings all over the world, admitted that the insolvency filings would
nonetheless damage the property markets in Toronto and New York.
'O&amp;Y is the best property developer in the world,' he said. 'If even we
cannot withstand recession, confidence in the property markets is going to
be shaken.' But he predicted that the impact on the markets would be
'temporary'.
Mr Miller said that at the beginning of the week the company had started to
become convinced that it would need to file for protection under Canada's
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Chapter 11 legislation of the
US.
A series of creditors were threatening to seize assets worth hundreds of
millions of dollars. But it was the threat that there would be a domino
effect, leading to asset seizures by many other creditors, that finally
persuaded O&amp;Y on Thursday afternoon to make the filings.
He said that a big concern was that creditors in the US 'would . . . grab
Canadian assets'. These US creditors had this ability because many of the US
property loans were guaranteed by the O&amp;Y parent company in Canada. The
filings have removed this threat.
O&amp;Y also became concerned that it would be unable to make payments to
creditors whose loans were secured on a series of Canadian buildings and
that these creditors would therefore seize the buildings.
In other words, there was the threat that creditors would try to liquidate
billions of dollars of O&amp;Y's assets, which would have had a devastating
effect on the property market and could have led to colossal losses for
banks with property loans.
However, Mr Miller said he understood why the Canadian government had not
come to the company's aid by providing a bridging loan to facilitate the
sale of the Exchange Tower in Toronto. Mr Miller said the Canadian
government was prepared to provide the funds if these would have solved all
O&amp;Y's problems.
'When the cash crisis began (two months ago), the government thought the
loan would be a final solution,' he said. 'But it soon became apparent that
O&amp;Y's difficulties were far too bad to be solved by that.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Thatcher attacks pace of European integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher launched a fierce attack on the European Community's
federalist ambitions yesterday, calling for the creation of a looser
confederation that would return power to individual nation-states.
Speaking at The Hague to the Global Panel, an economic forum, the former UK
prime minister avoided directly challenging her successor, Mr John Major,
who has pledged to keep Britain at the heart of Europe.
But, speaking just days before an expected rebellion by anti-federalist
Conservative MPs against the prime minister's signature of the Maastricht
treaty, she did little to disguise her anger at the pace of European
integration.
She accused the EC of rushing towards a federalist structure before the EC
was enlarged to include eastern Europe. 'It hopes to construct a centralised
super-state in advance - and irrevocably - so that the new members will have
to apply for entry on federalist terms,' she said.
She warned that a tightly-knit Community would not be able to curb the
ambitions of a united Germany. Its power could be best 'contained' in a
looser Europe in which the US maintained a significant presence.
In a looser structure, other governments would be free to form a coalition
against Germany. By contrast, 'a common foreign policy . . . is liable to
express the interests of the largest single factor', she said.
Mrs Thatcher criticised the European Commission for drawing up directives in
'back rooms' and the European parliament for lacking Europe-wide political
parties and political debate.
'Instead of a centralised bureaucracy, the model should be a market - not
only a market of individuals and companies, but also a market in which the
players are governments,' she said.
European governments should be free to compete with each other for
investment. Rather than forcing governments to go forward together at the
same pace, the EC should allow a multi-speed Europe to emerge.
'We should aim at a multi-track Europe in which ad hoc groups of different
states - such as the Schengen Group - forge varying levels of co-operation
and integration on a case-by-case basis,' she said. The group is made up of
eight EC members committed to a free travel zone.
Mrs Thatcher was careful to praise Mr Major, saying that he had ensured
'that we would not have either a single currency or the absurd provisions of
the Social Chapter forced upon us'.
Downing Street was concerned not to provoke a public row. Despite
acknowledgment by senior ministers that the tenor of Mrs Thatcher's remarks
was seriously at odds with Mr Major's approach, officials said the prime
minister agreed with some of the detail of her remarks.
The focus of Mrs Thatcher's criticism was the European Commission and its
monopoly on the power to introduce legislation. 'The work of the Commission
should cease to be legislative in any sense,' she said. 'It should be an
administrative body.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Lloyds seeks small businesses'support in battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for Midland Bank hotted up yesterday as Lloyds Bank launched a
package aimed at persuading small businesses to support its takeover bid and
issued a direct appeal to its rival's shareholders.
The war of words continued when Sir Peter Walters, Midland's chairman, told
MPs that a Lloyds takeover would mean retrenchment, not growth.
Midland suffered a setback when the Takeover Panel said it could not appeal
against an earlier ruling that Lloyds must be allowed access to confidential
commercial information already supplied to Hongkong Bank.
Lloyds yesterday unveiled what amounted to a manifesto to customers, saying
what they would gain from a takeover of Midland. Small business customers of
the combined bank would gain, said Lloyds, because banking services would be
far superior to those already available in the UK. This was because a merged
bank would operate more cheaply and efficiently than the existing UK
clearers.
The proposals followed recent widespread criticism of the clearing banks'
treatment of small business customers.
Small businesses would benefit from a new Pounds 100m Lloyds Bank venture
fund administered in regional centres. It would enable them to obtain
venture capital of Pounds 5,000 and above as well as a new fixed-rate
lending scheme, backed by a Pounds 250m fund, making cash available for
between five and seven years.
The bank promised a scheme to enable small businesses to obtain cash when
large companies were late in payment. Lloyds also said it would not make
banking tariff charges in the two years after a business was set up.
Mr Bernard Asher, director of Hongkong Bank, said he expected that his
bank's bid for Midland would result in services to small businesses at least
as good as those promised by Lloyds.
Lloyds' proposals were immediately attacked by Mr Stan Mendham, chairman of
the Forum of Private Business. He said Midland shareholders should question
carefully the motives behind Lloyds' proposed takeover bid. 'Why is this
range of beneficial measures only possible under a hostile bid for Midland?'
Mr Mendham asked.

Kevin Sim Viking Pounds 17.99, 430 pages
THE FACTS are well established. Early morning March 16 1968 a company of US
infantrymen, led by Captain Ernest Medina and Lieutenant William ('Rusty')
Calley, arrived at the hamlet of My Lai in Son My village, Quang Ngai
province, in the northern part of South Vietnam. They were preceded by an
artillery barrage. Detailed to flush out a communist unit military
intelligence had falsely imagined to be in the area, the American warriors
were disappointed not to encounter a single enemy cadre.
But their bloodlust, primed by three months' fighting in one of the most
treacherous battle zones of the war, was not to be gainsaid. With impeccable
bestiality, and without one shot being fired against them, the members of
'Charlie' company spent the next few hours laying waste everything in their
path. Some four to five hundred babies, children, women and old men -
civilians all - were ritually slaughtered. Multiple rape, sodomy, mutilation
and torture were integral hallmarks of the atrocity.
There were two sets of victims: those killed, and those who perpetrated the
killings, the 'boys next door' turned murderers. The real culprit was the
very nature of the conflict. 'Vietnam' was what the North's commander,
General Vo Nguyen Giap, has said it was: a people's war. Famously, in their
efforts to expel the foreign invaders, the communist forces went amongst the
rural population of the South 'like fish swimming in water'.
In some cases that population was sympathetic to Hanoi, in others not. For
the US army however this provided intractable difficulties either way. The
fish and the water were interdependent, and there was no reliable means of
identifying and isolating the enemy. Any hamlet might or might not be a
communist stronghold.
Add in the gnawing terrors of jungle warfare, the increasing deficiencies of
American battalions in terms of training, acclimatisation, leadership and
discipline, the widespread availability of drugs, the sheer sense of
displacement, and My Lai-type episodes were inevitable. That at least is the
drift of Four Hours In My Lai, by Michael Bilton (a British television
documentary maker) and Kevin Sim (a British journalist).
Of the many accounts of My Lai, this may rightly be regarded as the fullest
and, for that matter, the most compellingly readable. The grim niceties,
both of the massacre itself, and of Charlie Company's war up until My Lai,
are accumulated tellingly. Twenty-four years on, in as far as that sort of
thing ever can live on the printed page, the horror is revived.
But what makes and breaks this account is the authors' handling of My Lai's
aftermath: of both the cover-up within the Quang Ngai-based 'Americal'
Division, that kept the episode under wraps for a year, and of the
subsequent 'trials'. Unlike other similar atrocities, of which there were
many, My Lai stuck to become a front page news story for two reasons: the
persistence of Ronald Ridenhour and Seymour Hersh in exposing it, and the
availability of colour photographs taken with his personal camera during My
Lai by army photographer Ronald Haeberle. Once these latter had appeared,
first in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, then in Life magazine, a media
avalanche was guaranteed.
Bilton and Sim have slogged through the vast reams of paper produced by two
overlapping US Army investigations, as well as transcripts of the actual
hearings. The result is an awesome picture of perverted justice. Resisting
all calls for an international or even independent tribunal, and responding
to pressure from Richard Nixon's administration and that part of America's
press that was rightwing and racist, the Army clung to its decision to make
My Lai an internal affair.
A virtual whitewash ensued. While the investigations incriminated, on
overwhelming evidence, 30 participants in the massacre itself, and 28
officers in the cover-up, only one man, the hapless Calley, was brought
properly to book in the resultant courts-martial. Once Medina and his
superior officer, Colonel Oran Henderson, had been acquitted, the phoney
legal process ground to a halt.
In a sickening cameo we are told how a cake 'complete with candles' was
introduced into the court-room to help Medina celebrate his 35th birthday.
'At the risk of poor taste,' quipped the judge, 'we wish you a happy
birthday.' As the American establishment successfully manouevred to defend
its chosen sons, My Lai collapsed into an unholy farce.
Yet it must be said that in dwelling upon the court scenes at Fort Benning
the authors have been sold a pass. Like nearly every other book about
Vietnam published in the West, Four Hours In My Lai focuses on America, and
the damage done to American self-esteem. The other half of the equation is
marginalised. Although Bilton and Sim dutifully record the eye-witness
accounts of a handful of survivors of My Lai, the engulfing sorrow that
still pervades Quang Ngai as a result of eight years' occupation by US and
South Korean forces is here unsung. Instead the reader is swamped by any
amount of often trivial biographical detail pertaining to the lives of
nearly every American mentioned in the text.
More seriously, in attempting to provide the massacre with background
context, the authors ignore what was the central feature of the South
Vietnamese state: that the mainly Buddhist masses were ruled by a venal,
largely Catholic oligarchy. It was the latter that the US strove to protect
and prolong. My Lai happened not just because, as Bilton and Sim suggest,
there was a dichotomy between notional principles and actual behaviour under
duress within the American army, but also because of a fundamental
disjunction between the rhetoric and the objectives of Washington's
policy-makers.

WHAT SHOULD a Detective Chief Inspector be like, ideally? More often than
not he is in early middle age, tall, reasonably handsome, long-suffering,
considerate of his lower-ranking colleagues, and patient with superiors,
even when they are obtuse, demanding and snobbish (a frequent sin among
Chief Constables). If he is not divorced or a widower, he is likely to have
an even more long-suffering wife, who thoughtfully leaves him cold suppers
or a casserole to heat up when she goes to bed before he gets home after a
hair-raising, frustrating day.
This could be a description, for instance, of Richard Hunt's DCI Sidney
Walsh, making his third appearance in Death of a Merry Widow (Constable,
Pounds 12.99, 191 pages). Walsh's private life is kept firmly out of the
picture: he exists only to investigate crimes, question, ponder, direct his
team and - on privileged occasions - have a hunch. Walsh stands in loco
auctoris, allowing us to get a closer view of the events as they develop.
The real protagonist is the victim, and Hunt - who has deservedly won praise
for his preceding novels set, like this one, in Cambridge - builds suspense
through the gradual revelation of the murdered woman's real and singular
character. The university is less prominent than usual, but there is still a
sense of a rarefied atmosphere, with the real world laying siege.
Dorothy Simpson's popular Inspector Thanet has a wife, Joan and two
children, both of whom give their parents few serious worries But the family
serves chiefly as relief, to show that cops do not always bring their work
home with them. In the latest, eleventh Thanet story (Wake the Dead, Michael
Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 250 pages) the author subtly provides a kind of manual
on how to interrogate a witness, how to weigh a reaction, how to pace an
approach, when to relax and when to pounce. Real policemen always claim not
to read crime fiction: they would do well to read this one, not least
because, like all of Simpson's work, it is admirable for its clean writing,
shrewd portraits and tight plot.
Charlie Salter, Toronto's less colourful but equally human and beleaguered
answer to Inspector Ghote, sometimes has rather more private life than he
can comfortably handle. In the newest story, A Fine Italian Hand (Collins,
Pounds 13.99, 190 pages), his wife Annie is off visiting her parents and the
two Salter boys are not much in evidence, so Charlie has more time to deal
with what seems to be a Mafia killing in the raffish theatre world. He also
has an innocuous encounter with a long-ago girlfriend. A pleasant adventure,
though without the excitement of some of the earlier Salter tales.
Sometimes understatement can be carried too far. Nothing understated - or
pleasant - where RD Wingfield's DI Jack Frost is concerned. As in all the
Wingfield books, Night Frost (Constable, Pounds 13.99, 312 pages) is awash
with blood and guts. The solution follows a now predictable pattern: initial
bewilderment, apparent discovery of the culprit, frustration when the
discovery proves erroneous, then final triumph. Frost's running battle with
his egregious Divisional Commander provides ample comic relief, when the
repetitious murders threaten to pall (problem: how to keep a serial killer
from being repetitious?), and his blissfully obscene language is a welcome
change from the prissiness of some other DI's.
Charlie Resnick, the equally rumpled, unruly anti-hero of John Harvey's
novels (the latest is Off Minor, Viking, Pounds 14.99, 260 pp.), bears some
resemblance to Frost, but is a more rounded, complete character, still
involved, however reluctantly, with his divorced, sick wife. He suffers
through his cases, too, and we learn his character as he deals with them.
Off Minor (the title is connected with Resnick's authoritative understanding
of classic jazz) shows Resnick at his best: sensitive, shrewd, independent.
He is a genuine creation. We read Harvey's books not just to find out who
killed whom, but to renew our acquaintance - our friendship - with the
unique Resnick.

IN THE MIRROR OF THE PA LECTURES AND ADDRESSES 1978-1990 by Ivan Illich
Marion Boyars Pounds 16.95, 231 pages
THERE WAS a time, so the Editor assures me, when no self-respecting
dinner-party conversation was complete without mention of the latest Illich.
One of the most widely read polemicists of the 1960s and early '70s, in
works such as Celebration of Awareness, Deschooling Society and Tools for
Conviviality he challenged many of society's most revered institutions -
education, medicine, its economic structure - and urged modern man to
rethink the basic tenets of his moral existence. Now, thanks to this latest
collection of lecture circuit offerings, a new generation has the chance to
evaluate Illich for themselves.
To call Illich utopian is no reproach. From Plato onwards, writers have used
a perfect world to prick man's conscience about his existing one. Illich
finds his lost world in the writings of the Middle Ages, when philosophers
ascribed a wholeness to the art of living. In modern times, he contends, the
mirror of the past has splintered into a confusion of competing disciplines,
governed by 'experts' who can formulate systems but who have forgotten how
to live.
But what would Illich's perfect world be like? Self-sufficiency is the key,
progressive industrialisation the enemy: 'Man should realise that for the
good of the individual as well as society, it is best that people keep for
themselves only as much as is sufficient for their immediate needs', he says
in an inaugural speech at the Ashram founded around Gandhi's hut. In
transport planning the motor car should come second to the bicycle. We
should dispense with architects and build our own houses. Architects can
design machines for living in but have forgotten what it is to dwell.
Economics draws forth Illich's bitterest tirade. Economics turns what were
traditionally accepted as blessings and banes into questions of scarcity and
provision. It means people lose their human dignity as 'persons'; they now
simply lay claim to 'lives': 'A Life' is amenable to management, to
improvement and to evaluation in terms of available resources in a way which
is unthinkable when we speak of 'a person.' He argues that medicine has
encouraged the pursuit of healthy bodies to the point at which life has
become a new fetish. In-vitro fertilisation and life-support machines have
meant that doctors have exceeded the boundaries between quickening and dying
which traditionally defined their domain. Physicians in the Hippocratic
tradition 'had to accept nature's power to dissolve the healing contract
between the patient and his physician.' An art of living only makes sense
alongside an art of dying.
What a culture bequeaths to each generation in terms of human goods, values
and excellences, economics merely flatten into needs: 'Society is now
organised on the utilitarian assumption that man is born needy, and needed
values are by definition scarce. In Japan, the old simply live in the
household, regardless of any perception of their needs. There the old are
given something best described as 'hospitality', but they 'need' neither
formal nor informal hospitalisation or care.' Discussing employment, he
argues for replacing wage-labour with 'unpaid activities which provide and
improve livelihood.' As for education, Illich would still 'deschool'
society: we should learn only what we need to know to make us happy and
competent in our immediate concerns.
What these essays demonstrate is that Illich has lost none of his power to
provoke and engage. On many issues, especially medical ethics and the
environment, time has proved him prophetic. He is brilliant at dismantling
the false images of the Age. He is less good at describing alternatives,
save for something smacking too much of hippy idealism. Perhaps we need an
updated study of the human virtues. More digging around in the works of
those medieval philosophers might help.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: London through a compassionate eye - Review of Doris
Lessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON OBSERVED by Doris Lessing Harper Collins Pounds 14.99, 214 pages
AROUND 1985 Doris Lessing - to the relief of the vast majority of her
admirers - returned to earth from outer space and gave us a major novel, The
Good Terrorist, short-listed for the Booker Prize. That, like her latest
book of stories and sketches, was an aspect of London observed; a London
still too much with us, the London of the homeless. Lessing took the lid off
a communal squat in which the clash of emotional, sexual and political
aspirations among the temporary family formed by its inhabitants was put
under fascinating scrutiny.
Lessing has indeed been observing the seamy, and the affluent, sides of
London for much of her career. Way back in 1960 Lessing set out in a work of
non-fiction, In Pursuit of the English, where she gave a deeply honest
account of her induction into the London of the working-class when she
arrived here from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Lessing was then a young
woman of 25 for whom England had throughout her childhood been 'a grail'.
There have been frequent interruptions for such things as the study of
Sufism, and travelling in order to sample life in troubled parts of the
world, Pakistan and Afghanistan - see The Wind Blows Our Words Away (a
Picador Original, 1987) - and of course into the stratosphere in her
multi-volume Canopus in Argos: Archives Series. But ever since that arrival
more than 30 years ago, Lessing has been living in - and that means bringing
her wise compassionate gaze to bear on - London.
It is, as she makes explicit in London Observed, that part of London whose
centre is West Hampstead and whose extent may be measured by the sections of
the Bakerloo and Jubilee Lines that run from there to Trafalgar Square. The
story printed here 'In Defence of the Underground' is 16 pages long, and
about medium-length for the collection as a whole. It describes a typical
journey made along this route. 'I like travelling by Underground. This is a
defiant admission', says Lessing. One assumes she was fortunate enough to
have had a seat for the whole journey.
The other passengers are codified collectively and then each is described
individually: 'In my half of the carriage are three white people and the
rest are black and brown and yellowish. Or, by another division, five
females and six males. Or, four young people and seven middle-aged or
elderly. Two Japanese girls, as glossy and self-sufficient as young cats,
sit smiling. Surely the mourners for old London must applaud the Japanese
who are never, ever, scruffy or careless?'
This persona of the sharp-eyed observer, who appears merely to describe the
external scene as well as she can, is one that suits Lessing's temperament
as a fiction-writer and which she uses with great assurance. Unobtrusively,
in this ruminating fashion, serious points are made, structures shaped out
of the steady march of mundane events. She does it again stuck in her car in
a traffic jam on Hampstead Heath near Kenwood - she doesn't always go by
public transport, it would seem - where neither of the two offending
vehicles was prepared on principle to reverse, thereby causing a long
tailback and tedious delay for other motorists frustratedly sounding their
horns.
And she does it often again in a whole range of local London settings where
a miscellaneous collection of people is brought together - the waiting-area
of the Casualty Department of a hospital; or various cafes in Hampstead or
Regent's Park where Lessing likes to spend time, sipping tea while
eaves-dropping on the other customers. A particularly good story of this
sort deals with the tension apparent between a couple enjoying some
refreshment in the park; they are observed in terms of their reactions to
the sparrows who land on their table pecking at crumbs. Again, nearby in
Queen Mary's Rose Garden, Lessing observes a young woman furtively taking
cuttings, and it leads the writer to speculate on the woman's relations with
her mother.
Every writer about London produces a completely different version of it. In
modern times the Londons of Orwell and Virginia Woolf are perhaps the two
extremities. Lessing's London spans both; she is at home with the former's
underclass as she follows a social worker into a tower block where he
attempts unsuccessfully to persuade a Pakistani woman to send her daughter
to a special school for autistic children; or when Lessing catches sight of
a young mother begging outside a supermarket, penniless because of a strike
by the staff of the DHSS.
Yet Lessing's range is such that she is no stranger to the world of Mrs
Dalloway. From time to time she takes us into drawing-rooms within earshot
of the sound of Big Ben and the division bells. 'Her' gives a brilliant
impression of a political salon in Westminster during the Thatcher era;
while 'Two Old Women and a Young One' chronicles a publishing lunch in a
chic London restaurant. One longer story with which this book ends take us
out of London altogether to a pleasant weekend country house where the
former and present wife of a successful man are assembled under the same
roof.
Taken as a whole the stories exemplify the point Lessing made in the talk
she gave on 'Women's Quests' at the 92nd Street Y in New York last year
(re-printed in the current Partisan Review, 2, 1992): 'So, all that great
explosion of energy (behind women's liberation) has ended up with a very
narrow section of the female population doing better than it did.' These
excellent stories deal with some of the women whom the women's movement has
passed by.

IN THE SPIRIT OF CRAZY HORSE by Peter Mathiessen Harvill Pounds 9.99, 646
pages
IF YOU think Rodney King got a bum deal, spare a thought for Leonard
Peltier. Since 1977, the American Indian activist has been serving a double
life sentence for the murder of two FBI agents after having been convicted
on the flimsiest of evidence.
Unfortunately for Peltier, there was nobody with a camcorder on the scene to
show what really happened. On the other hand, he does have Peter Mathiessen,
the distinguished writer and traveller, whose In the Spirit of Crazy Horse,
now released after nine years of legal wrangling, comprehensively proves
that Peltier is the victim of a perversion of justice every bit as cynical
as the one that caused the recent rioting in Los Angeles.
Peltier is a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a radical civil
rights organisation set up the 1960s to agitate on behalf of North America's
beleaguered native people. After a series of heated confrontations with
white authority, most notably occupations of Alcatraz Prison and Wounded
Knee, site of the 1890 massacre of innocent Sioux by the US Cavalry, AIM
were targeted by the FBI as a subversive organisation on a par with the
Black Panthers and the Weather Underground.
AIM's activity soon came to be centred on the sprawling Pine Ridge
Reservation in South Dakota, home of the Sioux descendants of Crazy Horse,
where violence, fuelled by government-sponsored goon squads, had become
endemic. The inevitable shoot-out took place in June 1975, leaving two
Federal agents and one Indian dead.
Although 30 AIM warriors were on the scene when the shooting occurred, only
four were charged, and just one, Peltier, was convicted. Even before the
prison door rang shut, however, gaping holes in the Government's case became
apparent. Ballistics reports had been doctored and denied, prosecution
witnesses coached and intimidated - the government never even established
that Peltier was on the scene, much less that he was the triggerman. As
Mathiessen patiently establishes, it was prejudice and a thirst for revenge,
rather than reason and prudence, that put Peltier behind bars.
But Mathiessen does more than simply unravel the government's prosecution.
He also establishes how the US government, through a policy that vacillated
between neglect and hostility, created the murderous atmosphere at Pine
Ridge, an atmosphere in which the seemingly cold-blooded execution of two
law enforcement officers could be seen as an act of self-defence.
The author then shows how the two agents may very well have caused their own
death by bursting into an Indian camp in a botched attempt to draw fire,
whereupon they could call in the cavalry to finish off AIM. But Mathiessen
lays ultimate blame for the whole affair at the feet of the military and
industrial interests who saw AIM preventing them from grabbing the rich
uranium deposits beneath the Black Hills badlands where the Sioux had been
exiled a century earlier.
Not surprisingly, Mathiessen's impassioned yet cogent book brought down the
ire of the authorities when first released in 1983, inspiring some Dollars
50m worth of libel suits which caused it to be withdrawn from circulation
for nearly a decade while the author and his publishers defended themselves
in court. Thankfully, Mathiessen kept on the case during the years, coming
up with an epilogue that provides what is perhaps the book's most
sensational bit of reportage - an interview in 1990 with a hooded, anonymous
AIM warrior who admits that it was he, not Peltier, who gunned down the two
agents at close range.
One of the book's most gratifying elements is the manner by which Mathiessen
balances his outrage at the treatment of Peltier and his people with the
cold, cool tone of the investigative reporter. He lets everyone have their
say, be they drunken goons or dedicated warriors, gung-ho FBI agents or
wizened Sioux medicine men. In the end, you are left with the feeling that
everybody involved with the shootings at Pine Ridge was a victim of a
government engaged in strip-mining not just the land but an entire people's
culture.
Upon finishing this book, one finds it impossible to believe that Peltier
can still be in prison. Perhaps the coming Oliver Stone film based on the
book will finally set the man free. And lest British readers feel too smugly
critical about the American judicial system as it lies exposed here, they
should bear in mind the fact that eight US courts defended Mathiessen's
constitutional right to express the opinion that various officials, from the
Governor of South Dakota right down to FBI Field agents, behaved like liars,
thugs and conspirators. In the British courts, he would have been paying out
money to the men who railroaded Peltier until long after the prisoner had
finished his term.

<TEXT>
THE NEW Horizon series will fall like manna from heaven into the hands of
eager self-improvers. This encyclopaedic series, new from Thames and Hudson,
consists of remarkably well-designed, alluring little books. They fit into a
pocket, take a mere hour or so to read, and cost Pounds 6.95.
Eventually, New Horizons will encompass every subject which might reasonably
excite a late-20th-century autodidact. The launch has brought us a dozen
volumes on such curiously miscellaneous subjects as Beethoven, dinosaurs,
Van Gogh, the history of polar exploration, Vikings, alphabets and
elephants. Many, many more titles are in the pipe-line; as the blurb puts
it, 'this is a truly ongoing global venture.'
Seekers after modest enlightenment in no less than 14 countries are able to
gorge on their versions of New Horizons, which is being simultaneously
published in 12 languages. Its country of origin, however, is France, where
Gallimard's very popular Gallimard Decouvertes now runs to several hundred
titles.
It will make an interesting comment on the intellectual culture of our times
to see which titles are translated for whom. British readers, one imagines,
are most unlikely to be given Carpeaux, Berlioz, or the Fronde. But will
Voltaire be deemed of sufficiently general interest to make it across the
Channel?
A New Horizon book is written in a bland, anonymous style with rather
irritating come-on headings in heavy type. Nonetheless, the content, which
for the most part is written by French academics, is eminently respectable.
Perhaps the best value book-buy I made last year, was one of the Decouvertes
series on French encounters with 19th century Japanese culture. Each book
includes short bibliographies and an 'archive' selection of documents -
although its French origins can make for selections which strike a British
reader as peculiar.
The design of these books is masterly. They are printed on high-gloss paper
and are crammed with a wealth of remarkably good colour photographs. Often
there is a run of full-page photographs; scenes from the Bayeux Tapestry,
Van Gogh self-portraits, portraits of Beethoven's lady-loves.
Exceptionally industrious picture-research has made New Horizons not only
extremely tempting, but surprising, too, even when one thinks a subject is
completely familiar. Viking: Lords of the Sea, for example, is full of
hilarious 19th-century history-paintings of Valkyries and pillaging
characters in cow-horn helmets. Beethoven, too, appears in truly dreadful
guises, playing The Mooonlight as bosomy female wraiths ascend from the
piano-strings.

WOULD A home in a Venetian 'palace' with your own private office wing, be of
interest?
After four years of selling London's Docklands as a smart place in which to
live, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley partner Stephan Miles-Brown is now offering
property in Venice, which he sees as an area worth watching. Lord McAlpine
and other British businessmen already have homes there, he points out.
Venice and Docklands, he says, have some things in common. Both were
important trading centres. Both have tall, flat-fronted old buildings
looking on to water. Each has an airport close at hand.
The old buildings that became fashionable housing in Docklands were
originally warehouses. In Venice what are offered are more likely to be
important mansions. For example, on sale is the principal part of Ca'
Lipomano, a 17th century palazzo. The property is on the island of Zattere
and overlooks the Giudecca canal. Little has been done to the exterior but
the interior has been restored.
There is a ground floor entrance hall with staircase and private lift. The
main section is the second floor apartment, with its high-ceilinged rooms,
stucco work, inlaid doors and frescos.
A 32 ft reception hall/dining room leads into the drawing room, formerly the
ballroom. There is a second reception room/music room. Doors at either end
of the apartment open on to balconies looking towards canals.
There is a study/bedroom, two other bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen, further
rooms and staff flat. The property has a walled garden leading to a water
gate and private quay on a small canal, the Rio Ognissanti. A three-storey,
3,600 sq ft office wing has been built in the garden. It can be reached from
the main building or from the water gate.
Frank Bonfanti, director, market and sales development Europe, for Kellogg,
who is selling the property, says that as the wing is modern and not listed,
a buyer might prefer to use it differently. It could, for instance, be
redeveloped into five small apartments, with a roof terrace.
Bonfanti and his brothers inherited Ca' Lipomano but have had to sell its
antique furniture to pay death duties. They are reluctantly disposing of the
property.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171) is seeking offers over Pounds 2.275m.

ROBERT Trent Jones, the world's most prolific designer of golf courses (he
has more than 500 courses to his credit) bought 2,500 acres of beautiful
countryside in the south of France, outside Vidauban in Provence. That was
about 20 years ago
He wanted to build Europe's largest golf resort, where he could ensure that
the best land would be used for golf. As he knew from experience:
'Developers too often want to take the best land for housing, and leave the
dregs for the golf course.'
Les Domaines de Vidauban, 15 miles inland from St Tropez and St Maxime, in
the foothills of the mountains of Maures, is now taking shape. It will be
not only Europe's largest but also its most expensive golfing resort.
One of the first buyers of a Pounds 2m villa, Alain Prost, the former world
motor-racing champion, has been made president of the Golf Club even before
the first of three 18-hole golf courses is completed this autumn.
Robert Trent Jones, now 85, has undertaken the design and construction at
Les Domaines de Vidauban with his elder son Bobby. Bobby has 130 courses to
his credit, including the new one at Wisley, Surrey.
Though Robert Trent Jones bought the land at Vidauban with the help of Jaime
Ortiz Patinho, a Bolivian tin magnate, they decided not to undertake the
Pounds 600m development themselves. They brought in Pierre Schnebelen, who
developed the ski resorts of Tignes, Val Thorens and Valfrejus. Schnebelen
has been building international resorts for 30 years, but this is his
largest project.
At Les Domaines de Vidauban, he is associated with Malik Bencheghib, of
Fonciere Malbe in Paris. Other backers include the French hotel group Accor,
Interconstruction, the firm of contractors which built the Grand Arch at La
Defense, Paris), and the Doliner group.
In addition to its three challenging golf courses, Les Domaines de Vidauban
will have six hotels, 225 shops and restaurants, a tennis ranch with 40
courts, a polo centre, two artificial lakes for water sports, botanical
gardens, parkland, and three villages with a total of 2,000 villas and
apartments.
The first championship golf course, with wide, lush fairways threading
through the elegant umbrella pines and cork oak of this part of Provence,
will be ready for play in September 1992. The second course will open in
1993, the third in 1994. Accor, whose managing director, Sven Boinet, was
French amateur golf champion, will open its first four-star hotel in 1993.
Showhouses in the first of the three villages are for sale at prices ranging
between Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 500,000. More than 60 of the 750 villa
plots around the golf courses have already been sold; on these, houses will
be built which will cost from a minimum of Pounds 600,000 for half an acre,
up to Pounds 4m for eight acres.
Many of those who have already bought villa plots are industrialists with
businesses in Sophia Antipolis, the decentralised commercial centre about 25
minutes from Vidauban. It can take between one and two hours to get from
Nice or Cannes to Sophia Antipolis in the summer - which is why one German
industrialist, who has had a home in Theoule for 16 years, took only two
days to decide to spend Pounds 1.3m on a villa at Vidauban.
Pierre Schnebelen says: 'One of the great surprises is the number of people
who want to live here all year. Our average price of property may be Dollars
1m, but for Dollars 1m here - which is the price of a small apartment in
Nice or Cannes - one can get a villa with a swimming pool and half an acre
of land.,'
International businessmen are likely to be attracted by the fact that you
can get to Vidauban on the A8 motorway from the airports at Nice or
Marseilles in less than an hour, or from Toulon airport in 15-20 minutes.
'We are targeting the buyer who wants to play golf on a Robert Trent Jones
course, dine in St Tropez, anchor his boat in Port Grimaud, spend a day on
one of the beaches at Pampelone, ride on horseback through the Maures
mountains, enjoy almost Californian spaciousness and yet be only a few
minutes away from the motorways and the airports,' says Schnebelen.
At present there are more than 300 golf courses in France. 100 more are
being built, but the French Golf Federation says that more than 500 new
courses are needed within the next five years to satisfy the demand.
Schnebelen and Bencheghib (of Fonciere Malbe) see Les Domaines de Vidauban
becoming the golfing capital of Europe, attracting those who go now to the
Costa del Sol in Spain or the Algarve in Portugal.
Robert Trent Jones says: 'When finished, Vidauban will rank high among my
finest works, from the standpoint of marvellous golf courses as well as
unparalleled facilities for the combination of golf and business.'
Les Domaines de Vidauban has a sales office on site (telephone
010-33-94-7355-87). The agents in the UK are Don and Catherine Law, of
Guildford, who specialise in the sale of property in France under the name
Le Cl (telephone 0483-68846).

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (8): A guide for
exiles in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMPTED by the increasing demand for information about life as a resident
in France the French Chamber of Commerce in Britain has published Living as
a British Expatriate in France. Its contributors are specialists in their
subjects and most have experienced life as exiles.
What the expat will certainly need, the book's authors emphasise, will be
documentation, patience and a sense of humour, plus plenty of passport
photographs, translations of birth and marriage certificates and evidence of
divorce if applicable.
Keep travel tickets or, in some way, ensure that you have evidence of your
date of arrival in France. Proof of employment may be required and so will
stamped addressed envelopes.
There is a section on how to go about renting or buying a property. French
legislation on rentals has changed in the last decade and the law is
reasonably protective of tenants. There is information about employment
rights, taxation, the French health system, insurance and education.
The final section deals with retiring to France, with special reference to
tax implications.
The French Chamber of Commerce in Britain previously produced books on
Buying Residential Property in France, and Setting up a Small Business in
France.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (7): Devon's cream on
sale at a reduced price - From cottage to estate this is a good time to buy
in wild and beautiful Devon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVON is a county that rewards exploration on foot or on horseback; its
lanes, fashioned more for cart than for BMW, are ill-suited to cope with the
3.5m tourists who migrate there each year.
The county's coastline reflects a relentless, losing battle with the
Atlantic and the English Channel; ghostly remains of the fishing village of
Hallsands, near Salcombe, are testament to the unequal struggle.
Inland, above the fertile and tranquil river valleys, two features dominate
the county: Dartmoor, 365 square miles of ancient granite and gentler
Exmoor, 265 square miles with three 'turrets', Withypool Common, Winsford
Hill and Exmoor Forest.
It can be wet on Dartmoor: 100 inches of rain a year, more than three times
more than on the south coast. Exmoor usually has a more benign climate,
although a freak storm in 1952 caused the devastating flood in Lynmouth,
killing 31 people and destroying 100 houses and 28 bridges.
Lovers of these great national parks ride or stride across them. The really
adventurous journey round the entire boundary, earning the title 'bounders'
 -not a task for the faint-hearted.
The decline of mining has left tourism and agriculture as the county's main
sources of income. Visitors spent Pounds 813m in Devon last year.
The journey by road and rail is fast and easy; you really know the holiday
has started when the train thunders alongside the beach at Dawlish,
'birthplace' of Nicholas Nickleby and favourite holiday spot of Jane Austen.
For many, the call of the west gets louder with each passing holiday; soon
local estate agents will be bracing themselves for this year's round of
'agent-baiting' - people, bored with the beach, who are 'thinking of buying
a holiday home'. This year they will benefit from prices that have fallen by
as much as 45 per cent from the highs of four years ago.
There is now something for most pockets but the stuff of dreams does not
come cheap. The county has more than its share of retired people, many of
whom choose a cob cottage with a thatched roof and a stone plinth - 'a good
hat and a good pair of shoes', as the locals would say. At the last count
22.6 per cent of Devon's population was above retirement age, compared with
the UK average of 18.4 per cent. The figure would be higher if Plymouth were
discounted; a quarter of the population lives there.
At the last census in 1981 the number of second homes owned in Devon was
4,647, a rise of about 1,200 on the previous decade; and the number of
holiday letting units was 8,171. These figures rose sharply in the boom
years of the 1980s but it will be a few months before the exact number is
published in the new survey.
Devon is the third largest county in the UK. Its property opportunities are
many and varied. But all categories have suffered in the recession. Tim
Burrage, of Stags, reports a quickening of the market after a quiet winter,
although most interest was for town property.
'The country property market does not get into full swing until the early
summer; but the market is likely to remain sluggish until we have some
encouraging economic news and an end to forced sales and repossessions,' he
says. Curiously, falling house prices in counties closer to London have
damaged house sellers' prospects of achieving good prices in Devon.
James Wilson, of Wilson and Wilson, a company that specialises in finding
property, says: 'Buyers who hitherto looked at Devon can now afford to buy
in places that were formerly out of reach - counties such as Dorset,
Hampshire and Gloucestershire.'
However there are signs of life in the Devon housing market. Neil
McClintock, of Gribble Booth and Taylor, reports a 'storming start' to the
year, particularly at the lower end; and Andrew Viner, of Viner Carew, has
also seen an increase in inquiries and viewings, although most sales are
still to first-time buyers. Hambro Countrywide also reports an increase in
activity.
According to West Country House Search, based in Sherborne, the past 12
months alone has a seen a fall in prices of around 25 per cent; it is, says
the company, a good time to seek out that holiday or retirement home.
For those keen on equestrinism therer are many tempting properties on
Dartmoor and Exmoor.
Millerson, a new company formed by Geofrey Miller after his own Cornwall
company was absorbed into Hambro, specialises in property on Dartmoor and by
the Tamar, the river that separates Cornwall from Devon and the rest of
England.
He showed me a farm house with 19 acres close to Lifton, nine miles from
Tavistock, with views that would have been amazing had the previous owner
not erected an ugly (and definitely removable) modern barn. There were also
some fine traditional stone outbuildings; offers around Pounds 300,000 were
sought last year but a more realistic 'over Pounds 200,000' is now
suggested.
Millerson also handles Marystow Cottage, near Chillaton, a bright modern
home built on the site of a cottage that was destroyed by fire. Again the
views would make a city stockbroker's heart stop, and equestrians will drool
at the traffic-free lanes and bridleways that abound there. The price guide
is Pounds 235,000 but, as with all Devon property now, try an offer.
Stags, which has a wide range of property from little cottages, such as one
for Pounds 45,000 at Halberton, near Tiverton, up to large estates, has
several interesting equestrian properties; not least is Weatherham Farm,
close to Dulverton, on the Devon/Somerset borders. Again some work is
required, but with 13 acres, outbuildings and an annex this house, with its
access to Exmoor and unlimited riding, will not stay long on the market. A
price guide of Pounds 230,000 is given.
Several of the properties had that essential feature - a trout stream.
Typical of the Devon house is Lower Northcott Farm, thatched, with 12 acres
close to Cullompton. A price of Pounds 320,000 is sought. My choice for star
billing was a magnificent 14th century house three miles from Dulverton,
perfect except for some rather modern roof tiles; it has 14 acres on the
very edge of Exmoor and a price of more than Pounds 400,000 is sought.
Strutt and Parker has just sold two cottages, one buyer believing that the
market had reached its lowest point; he intends to let the property for two
years after which he will retire there. Dunsford Mill, at West Anstey, on
the southern fringe of Exmoor, with 29 acres and a barn with planning
consent, had a price guide of Pounds 200,000. Cubby Close, a Grade II
cottage on a long National Trust lease, in the Culm Valley, had been offered
for about Pounds 135,000.
There is everything the rider (or walker) could desire at Rudge Farm, at
Lustleigh, including direct access to the moor at Lustleigh Cleave. The
early 19th century house also has that other essential - a cellar. There are
20 acres, with indoor and outdoor schools, stables, outbuildings, a coach
house and thatched bothy. Knight Frank and Rutley suggests Pounds 325,000.
If you tire of mucking out and yearn for harbour views, with no garden to
worry about, there is Harbour Side, a charming little cottage in Hope Cove,
near Kingsbridge. Marchand Petit recently reduced the price of this little
two-bedroom bolt-to Pounds 85,000.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (5): From servants'
quarters to luxury homes and back / A look at the market for mews cottages
in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMBLE London mews cottage, cheaply built, poorly lit and with primitive
sanitation, has mirrored the changing patterns of home ownership in the
capital.
When they were first built they were mean little dwellings, with no windows
at the rear lest the family in the big house should feel overlooked. Infant
mortality in the mews was twice as high as in other streets.
Most of the 12,000 mews cottages in London were built in the 19th century,
providing outbuildings, carriage garages and servants' quarters to the big
houses bought from speculative builders by wealthy traders.
East London was inhabited entirely by the poor, where prevailing winds
wafted the smells of Victorian life, so most mews cottages are in the west.
Not that the occupants enjoyed a high standard of living. Ragged children,
unspeakably close encounters with primitive sanitation and visits of
tumbrils clearing steaming mounds of 'rose fertiliser' were the daily
scenes.
The size of the mews reflected the size of the main house. A really
successful man would possess a phaeton, or landau, with a landaulet or
brougham for his wife: a two-carriage family.
Many a mews became little more than stores and workshops once their original
purpose ceased. Cars replaced horses slowly in the capital, but in 1896 the
law requiring a car to be preceded by a man with a red flag was abolished
and the speed limit was raised to 14 mph (oh, to be able to drive so fast
now). Dobbin's days were numbered.
The cottages have come a long way since they housed the coachman, footman,
groom, horses and fodder; most of the big houses have been converted into
flats, the mews being sold off separately, some for Pounds 1m or more.
However, there is a growing demand from international billionaires for large
London houses with accommodation for chauffeurs and butlers and stabling for
Rolls-Royces.
A perfect example of the clock turning back is at 50 Holland Park, a grand
house converted back from flats on the ground and lower floors, with an
enchanting mews cottage immediately to the rear, separated by a tranquil
courtyard garden and conservatory.
The Victorian mansion has a floor area of more than 5,000 sq ft, with at
least six bedrooms; the mews has a garage at street level and a large studio
above, greatly improved by the windows added to the rear.
The price of just below Pounds 2m suggested by Aylesford with Savills is by
no means excessive by London standards.
Mews cottages appeal to the romantically inclined; often they have been
customised to owners' preferences. The trouble is that new owners then want
to change everything; so money spent on interior design is seldom recouped.
The owner of 24 Jay Mews, a semibreve from the Albert Hall, spent a fortune
converting the little house in the best possible taste. It will be a tragedy
if someone rips it all out, but it could happen. The moral is: do not spend
money on home improvements unless you are going to enjoy them yourself.
The cottage has three bedrooms; its features include a two-floor
conservatory and a little roof terrace, giving an illusion of great space.
Aylesford with Chesterfield give a price guide of Pounds 465,000  - probably
not a lot more than the previous owner spent on the elaborate conversion
work.
One of the London's most extraordinary mews houses is a flooded immitation
Roman temple - actually a swimming pool with the mock temple built of Bath
stone.
The owners of 50 Reeves Mews, in Mayfair, overcame the mews' lack of
internal light by building an elliptical skylight. The three-bedroom house
is full of surprises, hence the rather high guide price of Pounds 1.75m
which Chesterfield, with Sotheby International Realty, places on it.
Mews property became so popular a few years ago that French-born Antoine
Lurot started his own agency, Lurot Brand (now trading as the London Mews
Company), specialising in the little homes.
'When I started the business I toured London on my motor cycle getting to
know every mews - some people got rather suspicious,' says Lurot.
'Now we have mews cottages to suit most pockets, ranging from Pounds 65,000,
for an admittedly rather short lease, up to Pounds 2m for a very large
cottage in Mayfair.'
Barnard Marcus is another agent with a good crop of mews homes at present. A
neat three-bedroom home in Logan Mews, Kensington, with generous living
space instead of a garage on the ground floor - off-street parking is
possible - is on sale at Pounds 350,000.
Rather cheaper, at Pounds 205,000, is a two-bedroom home in St George's
Square Mews, described as one of Pimlico's quietest cobbled backwaters.
There is a garage and a balcony at a cottage back in Holland Park Mews. John
D Wood is selling the three-bedroom home in this quiet, cobbled mews with a
guide price of Pounds 345,000.
David Forbes, of Chesterfields, says London's mews homes have special appeal
to people whose main residence is in the country.
'They like the peace and quiet of the mews and also the security that the
lack of access from the rear usually gives; the rising popularity of the
mews is directly in proportion to the growth of the parking problem in
London,' he says.
Chesterfields recently sold a mews house to a man who lived nearby, simply
on the strength of the garage space available for five cars. The mews has
come full circle.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (3): Storing some
Welsh energy - A project that is part of the garden festival in Ebbw Vale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MILLIONS who will tramp through the 142-acres of Garden Festival, Wales,
in Ebbw Vale during the next five months will, among other things, see three
of the most energy-efficient houses in the land.
A mountain of more than 1.5m cubic metres of toxic slag from the valley's
steelworks has been removed giving local residents an extra half hour of
daylight. Good earth now replaces the slag, host to 300,000 trees, half a
million shrubs and countless bedding plants.
Ironically, British Steel (the cause of the original chronic pollution), is
building one of the three houses in Green Street. British Gas is building
another. The most efficient is the Catnic House, built by Custom Homes,
based in Redhill, Surrey, a company that specialises in energy efficient
timber-frame homes for self-builders.
All three houses score above nine out of 10 in the government's new energy
scale; well above the present minimum building regulation standard.
The Custom Homes house scored 9.7 on the energy scale, achieved with 6in of
insulation in the walls and 9in in the roof. Numerous other features -
double-glazing, low-emission glass and a heat-recovery unit  - have all
contributed to make this a home that is snug without fug.
Christopher Heath, managing director, says: 'The extra cost involved in
achieving this high efficiency was relatively small, below Pounds 2,500,
when compared against the normal price of Pounds 132,000 for a home of this
size.'
Energy efficiency has become a significant factor in house-building. For
decades the UK has lagged behind Scandinavian builders, but now the new
British home can at least hold its own. The movement towards energy
efficiency is an urgent one. Well over half the carbon dioxide emissions are
the result of domestic use; a reduction is vital for our survival.
Central heating alone produces more than 50m tons of carbon dioxide each
year. Most house-builders continue to emphasise what the industry calls
'kerb appeal' - that is, houses that look good to go home to. Companies such
as Laing Homes and Admiral Homes are leading the way among volume builders
in providing homes that have kerb and wallet appeal.
Admiral was the first to achieve a remarkable maximum energy efficiency
rating of 10 with one of its houses; a fine achievement but (like the
skating champion who scores six out of a possible six) one which leaves no
room for improvement. Tours of homes in Scandinavia leave me with the
impression that there is still room for greater efficiency - so the
ludicrous situation of builders scoring 11 out of 10 could soon be with us.
Laing Homes is to be congratulated for its 'green' initiatives in Cheam,
London. Facilities at Cheam include bottle banks, water butts for irrigating
the garden, low-energy lighting in the flats and communal areas. Not only do
the flats at Woodland Rise achieve an energy efficiency score of 9.9, but
residents also receive a copy of environmentalist Jonathon Porritt's book
Save The Earth.
Martin Laing, Laing Homes chairman, who is also UK chairman of the Worldwide
Fund for Nature, has given environmental practice notes to his staff,
suppliers and sub-contractors, covering such items as company cars and CFCs.
The company builds predominantly on 'brown' land: land which has already
been built on. As many trees and hedges are retained as possible.
The Cheam flats cost from Pounds 46,000. At that price, many potential
buyers may be green with envy.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (2): Homes for
hedonists / A look at the luxurious lifestyle offered by several new
developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROUND of golf, a few sets of tennis, or perhaps a game of squash, followed
by a swim, a massage, a hair-do and a gourmet meal - that is the lifestyle
offered at one of England's leading developments; and all without leaving
the front gate.
The Americans call it a total leisure concept; that is to say, homes that
are built within a secure environment with their own gardens but with shared
facilities for all the popular leisure activities.
The building and running costs of even a swimming pool or tennis court put
them beyond the reach of many home buyers; a private golf course is too
expensive for most millionaires. The answer, therefore, is communal
facilities.
Pre-war builders of the golf course and houses at St George's Hill, in
Weybridge, certainly had the right idea, but until now very few developers
had the courage, or the funds, to build a private golf course for their home
buyers.
Hubert C Leach, developer of Hanbury Manor, close to Ware, in Hertfordshire,
has turned the old manor house (a former convent) into a splendid hotel and
leisure club, with views across a lake and 200-acre parkland and golf
course. Nearby the company is building mews houses and a number of large
Jacobean-style houses, the latter costing form Pounds 500,000; the smaller
homes start in price at Pounds 160,000.
All buyers receive membership of the leisure club, but those fortunate
enough to be able to afford one of the big houses get golf course debenture
as well.
Not every development has sufficient room for a golf course, but many do
have space for swimming and tennis. Cala Homes (South) recently completed
Grenehurst Park, close to Dorking, Surrey, is a development of flats within
an old mansion and large houses in the grounds. Owners have shared use of
many facilities, including an indoor pool, gym and tennis courts.
Croudace Homes puts strong emphasis on the 'green' elements within its
Richmond Park Heights development, at Kingston Hill, where there are nine
acres of woodland and gardens. Focal point is a beautiful 42-foot swimming
indoor pool. There are 42 homes costing between Pounds 195,000 and Pounds
248,000.
Luxury and leisure should not be available for only the wealthy, however, at
least that is the philosophy of Fairbriar Homes and Charles Church, both of
which have developments aimed at the less-affluent buyers.
Church's flats in Kingsmead, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, provide a
secure inner garden, and a pool and leisure centre. flats, which have views
of river and woodland, cost from just under Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 99,950.
On an awkward corner site in Purley Fairbriar Homes has built its French
Apartments, looking away from the busy main road. There are tranquil
gardens, bisected by a stream, and cars are hidden in a covered park giving

FT  16 MAY 92 / Despatches: Tourists forsake the beaches and choose to go
slumming instead - Rio de Janeiro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE'RE GOING to see something very special today,' enthuses Leny, the buxom
tour guide. 'We're going to see a slum.' A ripple of guilty excitement runs
through the tour bus, like a Women's Institute group watching the curtain go
up on a naughty movie.
Forget the golden beaches, the beautiful women, the Sugarloaf mountain.
Rio's latest tourist attraction is its favelas, the teeming shanty towns
clinging to the hills.
A slum may not seem the most obvious place of interest for anyone visiting
Latin America's top resort. Rio's favelas are renowned for violence rather
than scenic beauty. They are mostly controlled by drug traffickers and are
hideouts for kidnap gangs and death squads. They hit the news with the
periodic discoveries of clandestine graveyards, or during raids when the
Brazilian police burst in firing, or when mudslides caused by heavy rains
result in the collapse of the poorly-built houses, killing hundreds.
But they are home to a third of Rio's 9.6m population, and are impossible to
ignore in their prime positions on the hills, overlooking the city's five
star hotels and luxury apartments. And, apparently, they are what tourists
really want to see. A survey by a group of travel agents found that 80 per
cent of tourists in Rio listed favelas among the places they would most like
to visit.
The first group to try the experience sets off from Copacabana amid great
excitement, still slightly hungover from the previous night's samba show.
They begin to look more hungover and less convinced about the wisdom of the
idea as the tour bus climbs a narrow, cobbled street along which the
buildings become progressively more decrepit.
Eventually, it halts at the foot of a stairway leading to Morro da
Providencia, overlooking the centre of the city. Literally 'Providence
Hill', this is Rio's oldest favela and has its origins as a military
watchpost built in 1830.
Tourists of all ages from Australia, Canada, Argentina and the US pile out
of the bus trying to look cool but speaking just a shade too loudly, and
glancing around furtively for weapons and kidnappers. An Australian
housewife endeavours to hide her pallor under her tan as a local reporter
tells her that Rio averages 25 murders a day and that this favela is one of
the most violent.
'This is the reality of Rio,' yells the irrepressible Leny as she leads her
flock through rubbish piles, stepping over sewage pipes and cockroaches and
trying not to fall over the women washing clothes or men skinning fish on
the path. Cameras click as future Peles perform impossible feats with
footballs. Young boys beat drums while girls in skin-tight dresses show off
their prowess at samba and that sexy hip-sway with which Brazilian women
apparently are born. On the steps, a group of unshaven men old beyond their
years drink neat cachaca, a pure sugar cane spirit, and blink bloodshot eyes
at the new arrivals.
Morro da Providencia is in good condition as favelas go, but its foreign
visitors cannot help wrinkling their noses as they enter the shack-like
houses. Most of the 80,000 inhabitants are marginals from Brazil's
poverty-stricken north-east, forced by hunger to migrate but finding little
better in the big city.
Many of the tourists are involved in social work and are keen to see the
conditions. Denis, a huge black American over from New York for carnival,
drawls: 'This is nothing, man - I work in Hell's Kitchen every day.'
Philosophising, he muses: 'Poverty is poverty, man, whether in New York or
Rio.'
Manoel, president of the residents' association, has done a sound job in
convincing his members that the tour is a good thing. The idea came to him
on Copacabana beach while talking to a group of Argentinian visitors who
told him of their desire to see the 'other side' of Rio. After agreeing
security with police and drug traffickers, he contacted travel agents and
Favela Tours was born.
Tourists pay Dollars 25 (Pounds 14.10) each for the privilege and Manoel
plans two tours a day. Part of the profits will go to the association to
build a creche and supply food for the needy, together with other facilities
that the government fails to provide. 'All the government gives us is
police,' notes Manoel.
The tour is shepherded by local teenagers wearing white T-shirts stamped
'Favela tours.' Solicitous in the extreme, they are there to hold Doreen's
elbow as she just avoids falling into one of many holes, and to prevent
Brian stepping too close to the edge while admiring the view of the city.
The idea is that locals, most of whom are unemployed, will abandon crime and
instead make money selling Favela Souvenirs such as key rings and T-shirts
emblazoned with the inevitable slogan: 'I visited Rio's oldest slum.'
As Leny hands out T-shirts in return for a 'donation,' she coos to her
charges: 'Did you enjoy it?' 'Yes,' comes the resounding chorus, many
scarcely masking their relief at not having been shot or kidnapped. Gilles
Moreau, a chartered accountant from Canada, says with a grin: 'My holiday
snaps will not be what people were expecting at all.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / The princess and the peeping toms / Finding the voyeurism of
the British media offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONDAY the many millions who watched ITN's news bulletin were
unwittingly and at a stroke turned into voyeurs.
The television company had - at who knows what price? - bought films from
some international peeping-tom, showing the Princess of Wales stripping off
at the side of the swimming-pool of the British embassy in Cairo. The
peeping-tom effect was enhanced by the fact that the film was framed by
bushes in the shape of a keyhole - the cover for ITN's paparazzi. Inadequate
cover, as it happened, because the Princess eventually noticed the intrusive
lens, and rushed away from the pool, understandably very upset.
Naturally, ITN did not have the courage to show this part of the film - it
is important to their conceit that viewers should not realise they are party
to a deeply resented intrusion.
I don't want to sound too much like Sir Bufton Tufton, Private Eye's
imaginary Tory right winger, but I cannot believe that in the golden days of
Sir Alastair Burnet, ITN would ever have dreamt of such an illicit piece of
snooping.
Illicit, but not technically illegal. In Britain we have no privacy laws,
except, anomalously, in the field of computerised information. The French do
have such laws, which may explain - if good food doesn't  - the decisions of
characters such as the Duke of Windsor and Sir Oswald Mosley to settle
there.
Perhaps it also explains why France has no newspaper quite like the Sun,
which excelled itself in hypocrisy on the morning following ITN's drooling
poolside voyeurism.
'Diana's fury at TV peak show' was the front-page headline. And, of course,
inside, the newspaper published stills of the film, which, as they
themselves report, so distressed the Princess.
Another paper reported that, while Fleet Street's finest had turned a blind
lens, freelance paparazzi had been led up to a long-distance vantage-point
by Egyptian security men - in exchange for a peek through the zoom lens at
the undressing Princess.
ITN had clearly decided that their viewers were on the same moral level, as
these venal Egyptian 'security' men, and perhaps they are right, though I
doubt it.
It has long become clear that the popular press, and perhaps now the
television companies, are obsessed with the Princess of Wales, subjecting
her to far more scrutiny, intrusion and comment than any other members of
the royal family, including the monarch. And even newspapers such as The
Times, fired by the arrival of overnight colour-printing, do not like a week
to pass by without a picture of the Princess of Wales.
The main reason, I suspect, is no more complicated than the fact that the
lady is astoundingly beautiful and photogenic. But it cannot be right to
reduce her to the level of a kind of royal Brigitte Nielsen. Unlike the
starlet, the Princess does not wish her partly clothed body to be the
fantasy of men from Egypt to Edgeworth, and, unlike her husband and many of
her in-laws, she does not go on television programmes and chat shows to
promote some new book or collection of etchings.
The spokesman for ITN, Glyn Mathias, said last week, when asked to justify
the use of his company's peeping-tom journalism: 'There was a legitimate
news interest.'
Mathias was, I am sure, referring to the forthcoming book on the Princess of
Wales by a Mr Andrew Morton, about which every British newspaper, with the
exception of the FT and the similarly high-minded Independent, has been agog
for weeks. According to advance reports, the book's most astounding claim is
that, some years ago, the Princess of Wales attempted suicide.
If that is true, one would not have to be a qualified psychiatrist to hazard
that such despair could have been the result of the constant, intense and
heartless intrusion of the press and television into the Princess's private
life. But somehow I do not expect the journalistic 'royal rat pack' to press
this point.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The guru who gives babies a human voice / Interview with
Penelope Leach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Thursday was a big day for Penelope Leach. The woman who has encouraged
millions of parents around the world to treat their babies and toddlers as
free-thinking young human beings had just scored a triumph. The Scottish Law
Commission recommended that the slipper, the belt and the ruler should be
outlawed as intruments of punishment for children - a ban for which Leach
has been compaigning for years. 'I'm being rung for comments all the time,'
she says, inhaling deeply on a cigarette and running downstairs to the pine
kitchen in her north London house for another cup of coffee.
Throughout our conversation the phone keeps ringing, and not just about
smacking. Leach is being invited to write articles and asked for views on
child modelling, day care centres and other assorted themes. Indeed, she
has become a rent-a-quote expert. But she sticks to her liberal principles.
She is AGAINST smacking, regimentation, bottle feeding and communal child
care. She is FOR demand feeding, democracy within the family, and attending
to a baby as soon as it cries.
What makes her feel so strongly about it all? Did she herself have a
desperately strict upbringing that she is rebelling against?
'I'm afraid you are on a bad wicket there,' she says. 'We were a very close,
extended family. We were part of an arty tradition. My mother was a writer,
my stepfather was a painter and sculptor. We were never smacked - my mother
believed it was important that children should be allowed to argue, reason
their case, be heard.'
It was revolutionary stuff in those days. Dr Spock, Leach's forerunner and
inspiration, was still unknown in England. Baby and Child Care, which dared
to question the strict rules by which post-war children were brought up, was
not even published in Britain until 1955. Four decades later, it is almost
impossible to find an expert who is not in broad agreement with some variant
of the liberal ideas Spock introduced. And Leach, with her smash-hit book
Baby and Child - which has sold 2.5m copies in the US alone and has been
translated into 28 languages - is one of the loudest voices in the new
orthodoxy.
But isn't it odd that there seems to be a consensus on such an unscientific
business as bringing up children? Are the child-care experts so slavishly
fashion-conscious that they follow the liberal school for now, ready to
change everything should the mood swing back to discipline and routine? Or
is it that the liberals are, somehow, right?
Leach laughs and, after a bit of thought, plumps for the latter explanation.
'People have just recognised something that has always been perfectly
obvious. Children are people and it is more sensible to treat them as
people. It is better for everyone if you do.'
Her trademark is to write explicitly from the baby's point of view which,
she argues, is the same as the parent's. Surely, though, this is nonsense. A
two-year-old's interest is to throw toys all round the floor, but the
exhausted parent's is to get them cleared up as soon as possible and get the
child off to bed.
'Of course, the interests are not the same in that sense,' Leach replies.
'But what I passionately believe to be true is that getting it right for the
child is to get it right for the adult. You, as a parent, need the room to
be cleared up but you can't - you physically can't - force your child to
pick up the toys. If you want them up, well, look at it from her point of
view. By making it part of a game, or part of a race, you can get it done
and everyone will be happy.'
I look unconvinced. Might it not be quicker and easier just to exert your
will and put up with the screams?
'The issue here is power,' she says. 'Parents who say: 'What matters is my
power, my authority over the child' ' - she looks disapproving and takes
another long puff on her cigarette - 'those parents do not want my book.'
But even if you accept that parents should not be on a power kick - which
scarcely seems controversial - surely it is still unrealistic to expect
weary mothers and fathers to come up with a fun game at the end of the day.
Leach looks out onto her sunny garden backing onto Hampstead Heath, quite
unruffled.
Confident in her own ideas, she treats dissent with tolerance, almost with
sympathy. 'If people disagree with something I have written, then that at
least makes them think and helps them work it out in their own minds.
'When people complain that I have too idealistic a view of parents and
children, I say you have to aim high. We teach people to drive well, and to
observe speed limits, but that doesn't mean we always obey them. I am not
saying we can all do it right, but you have to aim high.'
I am still worried. I wonder if aiming high is responsible for all those
loving parents who bring their children to dinner parties and proceed to
keep them up throughout the meal, and those anarchic households where
toddlers rule the roost. Hasn't there been too much of democratic tolerance
and seeing the child's point of view?
Leach takes no responsibility for such behaviour. 'Children need adults, and
being an adult is about setting limits. People are extraordinarily bad at
setting limits.'
But how do you police the limits once you have set them - especially if,
going by her book, you are not allowed to punish and must avoid conflict?
'If you've set good limits, you don't have to police them,' she insists. 'A
good limit is one the child can't break.'
I wonder if someone with these views has children of her own, or has been
blessed with such good ones that conflicts never arose. This is another poor
wicket. Leach shudders. 'My daughter, in particular, was a difficult
toddler. Very difficult indeed. She was highly strung, very bright,
strong-willed, and understood an awful lot more than she could do.'
Didn't this experience of a difficult child make her question the views she
had formed, both as an academic and then while carrying out practical
research with thousands of parents?
'You don't believe things if the data contradicts them - at least, not if
you are any good. I had written about the validity of avoiding
confrontation; and when I got myself into a confrontation situation with my
daughter, it simply proved to me that this disastrous scene could have been
averted if I had seen it coming and taken another route.'
But what about ordinary mums? Does their experience also tally so well with
the Leach doctrine? Or are they leaving children to cry behind closed doors
knowing they will fall asleep eventually?
Leach, who speaks and writes with evangelical fervour, sighs. 'I come across
too many people who do not realise that very young children have feelings,
and that they matter. People still say of a three-year-old, in complete
amazement: 'She knows what she thinks]' On a good day, they think it is
quite sweet if a toddler has its own point of view; otherwise, they think it
extremely disrespectful'.
Leach feels, however, that most people have accepted the theory of modern
child-care - even if they do not actually put it into practice. 'Take breast
feeding,' she says. 'All the evidence we have is that breast feeding is
better for the child. Yet, fewer and fewer mothers breast feed in hospital
and an infinitesimal number go on until the baby is six weeks old. This
raises a difficult dilemma. If you, as an expert, believe differently from
common practice, then by stating your views you risk making a lot of people
very cross. If people don't want to breast feed, that is fine. But they must
accept that books should not blur the decision just to make them feel
better. Parents do not want to be lied to.'
Such intransigence has got Leach into trouble. Her opposition to communal
care for very young children has gone down badly with some working mothers.
'The media tends to leap to the conclusion that I am against women working,
but that is not true.' She adds, however: 'We need to recognise that work is
not everything. Our caring roles are just as important as our working ones.
We must de-genderise home-based roles. If women take equal responsibility in
the market place, men must do the same at home.'
It is easy to argue that this predictable stuff is distant from present-day
realities. But Leach, who still clings to a belief in flower power and
peace, might say justly that this is the reason it needs to be said - again
and again and again.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Ready to go federal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD A week's holiday last week, so I did what I often do when I need to
escape London's clammy clasp. I patted the Rover reassuringly, stowed my
flannel and tennis racket in the boot, and headed for Calais.
I was bent on using my holiday for one of the most rarified forms of travel
possible: mindless travel, travel without maps or mission and almost without
purpose, except to roam through countries that are more attractive, more
prosperous, more cultured, better managed, better funded and in most ways
better teed-up for the next millennium than stuffy little Britain.
First I went to Epernay. Then I turned left: Clermont, Baden-Baden,
Augsburg, Linz, Krems (in Austria, not far from the Czech border, as far
east as I got), Bad Ischl, Salzburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Antwerp, Brugge,
Calais.
Eight days and seven nights. 2,251 miles. Travelling mindlessly but with
admiration and envy for so much of what I saw as I and the Rover traversed
the heart of the apple strudel: the core of western Europe.
According to a calculation I made while eating lunch in a small town in
Germany, it could be argued that 93 per cent of the world's worth, the
planet's purpose, is concentrated in western Europe. South America? Who
needs it. North America? How callow. Africa? A lost cause. Asia? Trying
hard, admittedly. Australasia? Addicted to sex and whimsy.
If I was a Euro-enthusiast before I started my journey, I have become a
Euro-fanatic. How I now abominate the Euro-septics. I believe they are
rabid. If you ask me, Europe should move to outright federalism as swiftly
as possible.
I want one army, one navy, one air-force, one parliament, one queen, one
president, one chief executive, one flag (very small), one currency, one set
of taxes, one language, one summer sport and one winter sport, one main way
of cooking estouffade a la provencale, one way of spelling Cologne, one BBC
(but with dog-meat-and-gameshow channels permitted regionally), one
Archbishop of Brugge, a permanent home for the Olympics (not in Greece), one
set of motoring laws, one price of petrol, one opera (which is probably one
too many), one school curriculum and one railway gauge.
I am serious about this, because it struck me on my journey that this weary,
wracked planet is on the lip of a great breakthrough. If western Europe goes
federal, there is at least a sporting chance that the rest of the world will
follow. It will want to join Europe. We shall have a world government. Also
a world army, navy, air-force, queen, currency, flag, opera, etc.
On my journey, I made a small discovery that helped convince me that Europe
is ready to go federal. The French are not as bad as we think. In a back
street in Epernay, I had a flat tyre. I know nothing about such things, but
was immediately approached by two Frenchmen. Before I could say Delors],
they had changed the wheel for me.
They offered me coffee. They looked shocked when I fiddled with money. Their
generosity and helpfulness were instantaneous and unqualified. Like you, I
have long been speechless at the French talent for getting up the nose. But
they are visibly mending their ways.
The borders are open anyway. You can drive from Calais to Krems without
anyone looking at your passport. In eight days and 2,251 miles, the only
person who examined my passport was a government snoop at Dover, when I
recrossed the Channel.
We had a sharp exchange of words. 'You look surprised to be asked to show
your passport,' said this moron.
''Surprised' doesn't quite encapsulate it,' I said. 'Look at it my way. I am
a European. I have just crossed from France. They didn't ask to see my
passport. Neither did the Germans, the Belgians, nor the Austrians. I have
neither left nor entered Europe. I stand for one world, one currency, one
queen, one language and a permanent home for the Olympics (not Greece). I am
now entering a fringe region - a place of tattiness and snooty accents, of
rudeness and suspicion.'
The officer's retort was couched in dialect. 'On yer bike,' he snarled.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: 'Renata' in recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALINA Gorchakova is the young Russian soprano who had a triumph as Renata,
the possessed heroine of Prokofiev's Fiery Angel, at a Prom last year, and
again last month at Covent Garden, and on Thursday gave a recital on the
South Bank. More precisely she is 28, West Siberian and at least as much a
mezzo as a soprano: her gorgeous middle register, broad and liquid,
stretches up toward Wagnerian heights, but also down to a pungently precise
chest-voice.
One of these days, she may have to choose; there are too few operatic roles
that exploit a range like hers, and too many of the other ones trade upon a
specialised vocal compass. In the Purcell Room, where she sang Rakhmaninov
(mostly standards) and Tchaikovsky (mostly standards too), her top voice
tended toward shrillness - but there anybody's would, at that volume. 'The
higher, the louder' seemed to be her maxim.
Gorchakova has next to no recital-experience, one gathers, since her
enormous operatic potential was recognised and seized upon so early. I
regret having missed her Renata at the Royal Opera, which must have
exercised her powers to the best possible advantage.
In her mere songs with piano (Iain Burnside, expert but over-insistent),
Miss Gorchakova was unstinting of voice and conventionally sincere in
feeling. Rakhmaninov and Tchaikovsky alike were enacted in tasteful dramatic
tones and dignified operatic gestures. Those had to do duty for the missing
nuances which should have brought the songs to sharper individual life.
All of it was honest (and loud), but most of it was expressively bland.
Nonetheless, the evergreen 'None but the lonely heart' sat beautifully on
her best register; and by and large, the voice itself was such a free,
opulent pleasure that one could only sit back and enjoy. Still, it would be
exciting some day to hear her exploring songs in subtler detail - less like
an all-purpose diva, more like a committed interpreter.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLACE'S policy of 'come one, come all' indicates a generosity of
artistic nature that verges on the saintly (and few saints, on pyre or rack,
have known the torments that a gently raised critic suffers when faced with
some of the Euro-trash on offer). The Place's assumption that from a flood
of nincompoopery something valuable might emerge bore fruit a couple of
years ago when the Flemish choreographer Wim Vanderkeybus first came to
London. His was a dance theatre of blatant physicality, where risk-taking,
and the body launched Exocet-like on a destructive path, was a searingly
effective means of expression.
Vanderkeybus has returned to The Place with his latest creation, Always the
Same Lies. It is a piece which proclaims the continuing ferocity of his
movement style, but shows that style now sitting at odds with pretention,
chit-chat, and politely anarchic games. (Much sticky fun is had by the cast
in throwing, and dropping, eggs.) The show lasts ninety minutes, of which
half is devoted to bad behaviour: there is something infantile in the
tantrums, the secret little activities, that serve as breathing-space
between bursts of wild and exquisitely gauged physical bravura. I cannot
believe that a creator as able as Vanderkeybus is beating his head against
the ancient stone-wall of People's Failure To Communicate, as his cast
babble in various languages. Nor that the caprices of a girl filling her
pockets with water, or another girl scraping her amplified boot over the
floor, serve any dramatic purpose.
The indiscernible theme to the evening is 'the life and memories of an
eccentric octogenarian seaman', and film clips mock and patronise an old man
in unedifying fashion. But the value of Vanderkeybus' work lies in its
daring, physical and emotional. For this we forgive the muddled dramatics,
the messy, juvenile sport. (Twice the cast throw garments at the audience
and then, like a child with a lost ball, ask for them back. Their bravado is
as hollow as their posturing). But there is nothing indecisive about the
movement made by the five men and three women, nor any uncertainties in the
visual power of the dance or the general design (a patchwork floor-cloth
that becomes a luminous back-drop is beautiful).
Three chairs, three hammocks, hang from the ceiling. The men play Tarzan
games, and plummet from the chairs; the women lie and swing in hammocks that
are like worlds for them. But the greater and most exhilarating part of the
text shows the cast racing in long loops around the dance area, ducking
under each other, crashing to the floor and moving on in bold phrases of
energy that argue split-second timing, extreme physical skill, vast security
of ensemble-playing.
It is a dynamic style owing much to 'slamming' (that dangerous punk-dance
fashion), and its tireless physicality, the sense of communicated bravado
and relentless tempo, more than compensate for its ultimately limited range
of effects. (Well, trapeze-artists and wall-off-death performers - whom
Vanderkeybus' troupe passingly resemble - have a no less limited resource of
tricks). It is in this that Vanderkeybus' true theatre resides. Angry,
desperate, bitterly mocking - and exhausted by these emotions - it makes the
intervening muddle seem even less convincing.
Wim Vanderkeybus is at the Place until Saturday, May 16. His visit is
supported by The Ministry of the Flemish Community in Belgium.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: An apology for a film festival / Finding two survivors
and a stretcher case at Cannes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY THE other night Cannes had something worth shouting about.
'Magnifique]' cried a thousand festivalgoers as they watched. 'Sensational]'
'Sacre bleu]' 'The best thing we have seen so far' (Translate into the
languages of your choice).
The cause of passion was a firework display. As bouquets of light burst over
the bay, we all wondered why it had taken twenty-odd tons of gunpowder to
prise open emotional responses left untouched by the films. This spectacle
was a film in part. But what a film: laser-projected images of fire and war
and clinching couples - Gable and Leigh, Garbo and Boyer, even Krushchev and
Castro - thrown onto a giant floating screen as the real fireworks exploded
all around.
They say that human beings are united by adversity. But Cannes,
pre-fireworks, had been the grimmest get-together in Cote d'Azur memory.
Normally goodhearted festivalgoers avoided each other's eyes lest colleagues
had even worse tales of aesthetic debacle to tell than they. 'Did you see
the Icelandic film about despair in the fishing industry?' (Asdid
Thorodssen'd Island). 'No, but I bet it wasn't as bad as that talkative
Canadian movie about the gay murderer who drones on about why he killed his
lover with a kitchen knife' (Jean Baudin's Being At Home With Claude).
'Well, at least it wasn't an ice pick. Do you know, I just saw the 23rd film
in which . . '
Enough. From a festival resembling an unpleasant accident, let me pick out
two unscathed survivors and one partial stretcher-case that smiled for the
cameras. From Sweden Bille August's Best Intentions has a script by - oh how
we need him now - Ingmar Bergman. The film surges majestically through the
century's early years as Bergman recreates the romance and marriage of his
own parents. He is a cold-eyed Lutheran pastor, she a walking nervous
breakdown. Between them, in snowscapes and lakelands that dazzle the eye,
they create the conditions of elegiac dementia into which young Ingmar could
be born.
This is a prequel to Fanny And Alexander. It is also a flexi-movie in the
same vein. A 4-hour TV serial co-exists with the three-hour film seen at
Cannes; and indeed our only reservation is that we feel we could buy this
story by the yard. (Why not five hours - seven - ten?) But Bergman has lost
none of his skill at paring emotion to the bone and beyond to the marrow.
Quarrel scenes have a lacerating force; reconciliations a melting poignancy.
As for director Bille August, he was the last non-American to win a Cannes
Golden Palm with Pelle The Conqueror and he may be the first non-American to
end Hollywood's three-year run in 1992.
The other alive-and-kicking festival item, shown non-competitively in the
Directors Fortnight, was Stacey Cochrane's My New Gun: a blissful black
comedy about a young New Jersey suburbanite (Diane Lane) whose life is
transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband
(Stephen Collins).
Direct and indirect results: two woundings, one near-fatal case of food
poisonning, the discovery of a lost Country and Western singer in hiding
(Tess Harper), an adulterous romance and a friends' wedding that almost
models itself on one of those famous bloodbath nuptials beloved of Dynasty.
The film is sly, wise and very very funny. So at best, with its
spot-the-star cast and trigger-happy satirical zest, is Bob Roberts. Tim
Robbins, deified by Cannes as the star of Robert Altman's anti-Hollywood
spoof The Player (current Golden Palm favourite), wrote, directed and gave
himself the lead role in this Awful Warning romp about a pop singer turned
neo-fascist senatorial candidate.
Gore Vidal turns up as a waspish political veteran and Giancarlo Esposito as
a radical black journalist; plus Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Alan Rickman
and more stars than you can find walking the Croisette. If you were watching
for political subtlety, you would leave after five minutes. Robbins's
targets are made of straw and he peppers them with a blunderbuss. But the
film boasts a snazzy storytelling style - all Steadicam bustle and spitfire
close-ups - and makes deft use of newsreel mock-ups in the style of Citizen
Kane.
Elsewhere, films are going down with all hands at Cannes 1992. Even the ones
that begin with a blaze of ambition - like Vincent Ward's globe-hopping
Eskimo-makes-good tale Map Of The Human Heart or Fernando Solanas's sardonic
history of post-Columbian America The Voyage - are soon sinking towards
oblivion. And as films clock up 2-, 3-, 4-hour running times, panic is
caused in the scheduling department. Some critics have turned up for 8 pm
screenings only to be told that the film began at 7. Not surprisingly, they
adjourn to the nearest bar to fill up with four-star Fernet Branca.
Is there a moral in the artistic decrepitude of this festival? Yes. I
suspect we are seeing the convergence of two catastrophic tendencies to
create a Chaos Theory of late-century cinema. To the East as I speak, Europe
is breaking up as a once-rich consortium of individual cultures. It is
becoming a wasteland for co-production carpetbaggers. (Look and quail at
Cannes samples like The Last Butterfly, a Nazi melodrama with Tom Courtenay
adrift in ill-dubbed Czechoslovakia). And to the West, America is hurling at
us its short-attention Video Age no-brainers. Woe upon a festival that has
to open with Basic Instinct and close with the new Tom Cruise vehicle.
No wonder Britain, secure in a middle ground, has contributed two of the
three current favourites for Golden Palm. If you have shirts, prepare to
shred them now. Put one third on Robert Altman's The Player; one third on
Howards End; and one third on Terence Davies's touching self-portrait in
celluloid The Long Day Closes. Screened last night, this proved a hit with
everyone except the French. But then who sets store by the French these
days? They were responsible for mounting this apology for a film festival.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Alive on Broadway / Review of the 'Tony' nominated New
York musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE MAY be hope after all for the American musical theatre. Rumors have
circulated for years that it is slowly dying, overwhelmed by the British
mega-musical, but a lively Broadway season indicates that perhaps it was
merely hibernating. The big box-office hits this year, Guys and Dolls and
Crazy for You, are American to the core, and this spring's most exciting new
productions, Jelly's Last Jam and Falsettos, show the presence of talent
that just might revivify the industry.
This Broadway year (from May 1, 1991) started dismally, with only 10 new
productions opening in the first 26 weeks (as opposed to 14 last year), but
perked up considerably in its second half, with the opening of nine musicals
and 20 plays. Theatre attendance this spring is at 82 per cent of capacity
(last year it was at 70 per cent), and the League of American Theatres and
Producers reports that this will be the most profitable season in Broadway
history - box office grosses may top Dollars 285 million, up Dollars 18
million from last year.
As the cost of producing on Broadway mounts, so does the importance of the
Antoinette Perry ('Tony') Awards. Winning Tonys gives productions
credibility to punters, and that means increased sales. This year's Tony
award nominations were made on May 4; the Annual Tony Awards (the 46th) will
be bestowed by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres
and Producers on May 31 at the Gershwin Theatre. Jelly's Last Jam earned the
most nominations - 11 - and was nominated in every possible category.
Jelly's Last Jam is bookwriter/director George C. Wolfe (The Coloured
Museum, Spunk)'s examination of the life and work of jazz pioneer Jelly Roll
Morton (1891-1941). Unlike Five Guys Named Moe, which strings together Louis
Jordan's music around the flimsiest of plots, Wolfe's musical is at once a
celebration of Morton's music and a complex, adventurous investigation of
the artist's life. On the eve of Morton's death, in a 'lowdown club
somewhere's 'tween Heaven 'n' Hell', the mysterious Chimney Man (powerfully
played by Keith David) takes Morton on a guided tour through his life,
forcing Morton to face the hypocrisies - a light-skinned Creole, Morton
called himself white and hated 'niggers' - and hubris - he claimed to have
invented jazz single-handedly - which, Wolfe argues, hindered Morton's
artistic and personal development.
Jelly's Last Jam secures Wolfe's status as one of American theatre's most
innovative auteurs. From the musical's first moments his energy and
imagination blast through the theatre, with the Chimney Man's gripping
invocation to the company's ecstatic 'Jelly's Jam' to his sly tweak of the
cliched Big Entrance - Gregory Hines as Morton ascends slowly on a platform,
back to the audience, and pauses just long enough to tantalise before he
turns.
Hines earned his fame as a tap dancer, and as the production's star, tap he
must and does through Morton's life, which, unfortunately draws attention to
Jelly's Last Jam's only major flaw - an uneven and sometimes inadequate
book. The musical never reveals just what Morton's unique contribution to
jazz was; the audience learns more about Hines's exceptional tapping skills
than Morton's musicianship.
The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly the women: Tonya
Pinkins, as Anita, Morton's lover and business partner whose voice and
presence make 'Play the Music for Me' a steamy highlight; Mary Bond Davis as
Miss Mamie, in whose club Young Jelly (Savion Glover) first encounters Jazz;
Ann Duguesnay as Morton' s Creole Grandmother; and Mamie Duncan-Gibbs,
Stephanie Pope, and Allison M. Williams as the Hunnies, who function
variously as Morton's backup group, bodyguards and musical tour guides.
Though musical theatre aficionados have known about his work for years,
mainstream recognition has evaded composer/lyricist William Finn. Broadway
has not been ready for sung-through musicals peopled with 'homosexuals,
women with children, short insomniacs, and a teeny-tiny band' and 'Four Jews
in a Room Bitching'. Finn's finally made it to Broadway with a dream
production of Falsettos - two of his 'Marvin Musicals' - March of the
Falsettos and Falsettoland - presented as one evening.
With Stephen Sondheim, Finn is pioneering the genre of music theatre, which
uncovers plot thorough melody and lyrics, using little spoken dialogue. For
his subject matter Finn looks no further than the world immediately around
him; he displays the complexities, inanities and tragedies of contemporary
life in a voice both screamingly funny and achingly honest.
In the first act of Falsettos, Marvin (Michael Rupert) has left his wife for
another man, but coming out is not a cure-all. He is still neurotic.
Everyone in Falsettos is in therapy or a therapist. Mendel, Marvin's
psychiatrist, ends up marrying Marvin's ex-wife, Trina.
The second act moves from the late 1970s to 1981, and 'something bad is
happening' - young men, including Marvin's lover Whizzer, are dying. From a
lighthearted, even silly tale of an individual domestic situation, Falsettos
becomes the tragically familiar story of a makeshift family gathered at the
bedside of a formerly 'healthy young bachelor'. Aids is never mentioned by
name, but it becomes Falsettos' unifying structure and the focal point of
its characters' lives.
Rupert, though a touch WASP-ish to be a perfect Marvin, sings the role
beautifully, earning a best-actor Tony nomination. Stephen Bogardus,
perfectly cast as the chiseled Whizzer, and Chip Zien, a loveably obnoxious
Mendel, were overlooked in the best supporting actor category. Barbara
Walsh, nominated as best supporting actress, gives a performance of
remarkable depth and wit as Trina.
Both Jelly's Last Jam and Falsettos are strong contenders for the Best
Musical Tony. They still might lose out, though, to Crazy For You, a glitzy,
hollow mish-mash of Gershwin hits which feels like a tired revival, and is
actually a rewrite of the Gershwin's Girl Crazy, but has been placed in the
Best Musical category because of a new book by Ken Ludwig.
The remaining nominee in the Best Musical category - Five Guys Named Moe -
is mismatched against its American competition. What seemed a delightful
entertainment in the seedy charm of London's Theatre Royal Stratford East
comes across as shallow and silly in the New York production, despite
Cameron Mackintosh's laboured efforts to simulate the Theatre Royal's
riotous atmosphere on Broadway. The pre-interval conga conspicuously ends up
in 'Moe's' - the cafe-bar Mackintosh built onto the Virginia Theatre for
just this purpose. The audience at Five Guys resented being force-fed fun.
Guys and Dolls, this year's mega-hit, is a shoo-in for the 'Best Revival'
Tony, as predicted or, more accurately, predicated by the New York Times. No
amount of press hype, however, can disguise the emptiness of Jerry Zaks'
production. Its various elements are good enough: the material, of course,
is among the best of the genre, Tony Walton's sets and William Ivey Long's
costumes are eye-catching, and the performers, particularly Faith Prince as
a chirpy Miss Adelaide, Nathan Lane as Nathan Detroit, and Walter Bobbie as
Harry the Horse, do nicely-nicely, thank you, but there's no driving
inspiration behind this production and no chemistry between the characters.
The entire effect is disunified, dispirited, and depressing.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Hit and miss Schnitke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUSIC of Alfred Shnitke forms the backbone of the London Sinfonietta's
current South Bank series. Alongside Shnitke's Concerti Grossi and his
Fourth Symphony, which gets its London premiere next Thursday, there are
premieres of three British works - by Nicholas Maw and James MacMillan so
far, and by Benedict Mason in the final concert.
Shnitke is very much the flavour of the moment in Western Europe. Max
Loppert reported from Amsterdam on the premiere of his first opera, Life
with an Idiot a month ago, and the Sinfonietta's survey follows in the wake
of the Barbican's major Shnitke celebration last year. Those concerts were
splendidly supported and rapturously received. The new series so far has
attracted less attention, perhaps because the first concert had to compete
with Philip Glass strutting his endless stuff in the Festival Hall, while
this week's clashed with a performance of Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony.
There is a serious risk, too, of over-exposing a highly circumscribed
talent. The more one hears of Shnitke's music, the more one realises how
hit-and-miss it is, and how its superficially seductive synthesis of such
disparate musical elements works expressively on some occasions, surreally
on others, while misfiring completely far too often. So the First Concerto
Grosso from 1977, which Antony Pay conducted in the first concert is one of
his successes, but the orchestral version of the 1985 Trio Sonata proved to
be a dogged, overlong failure. At another extreme the Concerto for Piano and
Strings, in which Paul Crossley was the excellent soloist on Thursday, seems
undisciplined and unfocussed, piling up grandiose gestures from shards of
the old Tsarist National Anthem, echoes of Shostakovich's Second Piano
Concerto, and fistfuls of tone clusters.
The new works promised much more. Both Maw and MacMillan were writing for
the Sinfonietta for the first time, and it was intriguing to discover how
Maw in particular would pare down his usually luxuriant orchestral palette
to the band's slender resources. In fact his Shahnama is scored for a decent
body of strings alongside the single wind, and generates some passingly
luscious sounds around its Brittenish gestures. But it emerged as a rather
thin sequence of movements, inspired in an almost programmatic way by
Persian paintings of the 15th century; each of the nine movements carries a
descriptive title, and in the score Maw allows for them to be played in any
order.
Perhaps in a truly punchy, alert performance Shanama would emerge more
positively. But the Sinfonietta under Pay was not at its best in the first
concert, though it had tightened up considerably for the second, conducted
by Martyn Brabbins; MacMillan's new Sinfonietta was cleanly and often
eloquently projected.
MacMillan's music becomes ever clearer in its outline and more direct in its
emotional impact. The new piece is cast as a 20-minute arch, beginning with
chant-like melodies before erupting with Varese-like violence into a
grotesque march, which veers in and out of focus before subsiding into the
quietude of the opening again. It is effective, well-paced and worryingly
soft-centred. MacMillan remains an exceptional talent, but one whose voice
still seems to be seeking its most convincing tone.
Queen Elizabeth Hall, London; final concert May 21

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Vintage models help to put a
spring in the market / Finding that collectors are willing to pay plenty for
old-fashioned styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people own a wrist watch, probably a quartz model powered by a battery.
But some may still retain the first watch they ever had - which, almost
certainly, will be of the wind-up variety.
These old-fashioned mechanical models appeal far more to watch buffs than
the mass-produced modern product. Add an element of power dressing  -
through the clout of recognised up-market brand names combined with imposing
multi-function displays on the dials - and you have the essence of a serious
market for collectors. This goes some way towards explaining why a Patek
Philippe perpetual calendar and moon phase wrist watch - one of only three
examples in a platinum case - went on to sell for Pounds 308,000 after being
taken into Sotheby's for a chance valuation.
Patek is the leading name among the big six of the collectors' world (the
others being Rolex, Vaucheron + Constantin, Jaeger le Coultre, Audemars
Piguet and Cartier). Patek is the Rolls-Royce of the industry, while Rolex
has the most rugged appeal and Cartier the edge for style. The undoubted
cachet of Cartier - especially for watches in the now timeless Art Deco
style, for which the company is known best - has meant that Cartier's are
the only second-hand women's watches of serious market value.
While women still prefer a new watch, vintage models remain a male preserve
in much the same way as classic cars. Gone, though, are the days when
current models of complicated watches produced by the big six (basically,
reviving types made in the 1950s and '60s) habitually made more at auction
than their list price.
The three leading watch auctioneers - Sotheby's, Christie's and Antiquorum
of Geneva - now report sales of current production models at or near list
prices. This is a direct reflection of a slackening (but not collapse) of
demand because of the recession, which has meant that manufacturers' waiting
lists have all but disappeared.
One exception is Rolex. Its Submariner and Daytona models still have long
waiting lists - distinctly Italian-led - and anyone lucky enough to secure
one can sell it for an immediate profit.
Theme sales have been one way of trying to maximise results in an
increasingly choosy market. The first of these, by Antiquorum for Patek in
its 150th anniversay year, was nearly a sell-out. The same auctioneer
concentrated this time last year on Breguet, but the market was much more
finicky and the sale, although yielding a satisfactory total, was by no
means a runaway success.
Swatches have been the surprise ugly ducklings in this field since, in the
public's mind, they mix mass production with a hyped fashion appeal. But not
all Swatch models are made in high-number series; take, for instance, the
two Velvet Undergrounds enveloped in black or white stocking mesh which sold
for Pounds 7,000 at Christie's in London on May 8.
This sum - at the bottom end of the estimate - for these 1985 models,
produced in 500 examples only, was still a respectable performance in a
themed section of a general sale which, the auctioneers admitted was not as
buoyant as had been hoped, and contained a high level of casualties. Thus
the Swatch market is coming of age.
American, German and Swiss collectors have been concentrating on the more
unusual examples, such as variants of production models, test pieces,
prototypes, and hybrids such as those made by Swatch employees for their own
amusement. One such 1984 hybrid made the highest price of Pounds 8,460 at
the April Antiquorum sale.
Pocket watches are a much older market which, at one stage, threatened to
become inactive. While 18th and 19th century decorative watches are still
not the hot properties they used to be, prices have held on to the 30 per
cent rise at the start of last year. Thus, an Empire-period enamelled gold
watch now makes Pounds l,800 compared with the Pounds l,200 it used to
fetch. This, though, is still less than the Pounds 2,500 such a watch would
have made late in the l970s.
There must be bargains here, if only a new generation of people collecting
decorative pocket watches could be inspired. Sotheby's in London seems to
have a very good selection in its next sale on June 4, with more than 200
lots.
But whereas decorative watches are plentiful, high-precision pocket models
from the Iate 19th and early 20th centuries are in such short supply at
auction that they always achieve good results. For example, Pounds 100,000
was paid at Antiquorum's April sale for a 1902 watch by Charles Frodsham of
London. This 18-carat gold model was a minute-repeating, keyless pocket
chronometer with one-minute tourbillon and seconds split chronograph with
60-minute recorder.
Humbler hunter and half-hunter cased pocket watches still represent great
value at auction, selling for little more than the gold value of their
cases. Anything of this type with a reliable movement should be desirable.
Antique clocks are a quieter market than 18 months ago, but the change of
emphasis is in the speed of sales rather than price. Dealers report that
interest has held up, but that each sale takes much longer to complete after
the initial enquiry.
Prices at auction are stable and, for some types of I8th and 19th century
clocks, are even ahead of the supposed peak of the market late in 1989. But
one investor, perhaps reflecting the view of many others, expressed surprise
recently at the very reasonable price level of antique clocks; he said it
was well below what it would cost to make an equivalent today. Of course, a
newly-made clock can never have the same appeal as an antique which has
stood the test of time in terms of design and mechanism while attaining a
pleasing patina of age.
These days, good style is much more important for buyers than the narrow
historical band of 1680-1720 clocks upon which collectors concentrated in
the 1950s, '60s and '70s. In this context, verge escapement clocks used to
be the only ones considered; now, anchor escapement clocks of the Regency
and Victorian periods no longer suffer from the snobbery of the past. A
Regency chamfer top bracket clock of good colour and proportions can make
just as much as a mid-Georgian verge bracket clock.
It is on these lines that Garrard, the Crown jeweller, is organising its
exhibition, Master Clockmakers: the Golden Age of English Horology 1680-1900
(May 18-30), with exhibits both on loan and for sale. The exhibition
emphasises the essential quality of English antique clocks (regardless of
the importance of the maker) as was required by the regulations of the
Worshipful Company of Clockmakers when it was set up in the 17th century in
the City of London. Prices range from Pounds l,800, for a Victorian rosewood
bracket clock, to more than Pounds 1m.
Clocks by Tompion, Quare and Knibb and the other British 'greats' also are
carried by Woodburn, near Tonbridge, Kent. These include a longcase clock by
Gray and Vulliamy which makes an interesting comparison with one by the same
maker at the Garrard exhibition. Meanwhile, Asprey, which deals also in
continental clocks, is planning to show at the Grosvenor House antique fair
a very grand ormolu-mounted empire period clock by Breguet which is very
similar to one in the Queen's collection at Buckingham Palace.
Bracket and longcase clocks are the staple of the English market. Bracket
clocks are comparatively simple to set up at home, so long as they are on a
level surface, but longcase clocks present greater problems. Once bought,
there are the difficulties of getting the case to stand level and, having
set up the movement in the case, getting the pendulum to swing evenly in
beat. There is also the question of deciding if the movement and the case
really belong together and if they require any restorative work.
An auction usually will be the cheapest way of acquiring a longcase clock -
providing you feel competent to assess what is on offer and cope with any
work needed. If you are in any doubt, always ask the auctioneer for his
opinion.
A dealer, on the other hand, will offer fully-restored clocks in working
order and with a guarantee of authenticity, for he is bound by the Trades
Description Act. A working relationship with a respectable dealer can pay
dividends, and he should be prepared always to buy back his old stock if
your circumstances change.
You can acquire a respectable, but not outstanding, long-case clock for up
to Pounds 2,000 at auction, although you should reckon on having to spend at
least a quarter of that again to put it into good order. But this is the
lower end of the market; you can easily spend into five figures both at
auction and at a dealer. Indeed, the more expensive the type of clock, the
closer the prices at the saleroom and the dealer's. This, potentially, makes
a fully-restored and guaranteed clock from a dealer very good value.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Why it simply has to be . . . a
real little gem - What really matters when you buy a keepsake?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANITA LOOS, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liz Taylor and that vast sisterhood of upfront
Hollywood ladies had no doubts about the matter - when it comes to jewels
what really matters is quite simple; are they real and are they big?
These sentiments may seem a little bold for Britain, in or out of recession,
but there is no getting away from it that when it comes to rites of passage
in a woman's life - her 21st, her engagement, wedding, first child and
ensuing anniversaries - nothing but real will do. Some fake pearls? A bangle
from a boutique down the road? A witty ring? Well-designed they may be, fun
too - but appropriate? No, never.
So, although costume jewellery sales may go on booming, and may have a place
in the daily lives of most of us, any man wishing to celebrate a big day in
the life of his nearest and dearest would be wise to remember to make it
real.
This is true no matter how far down the financial scale you look. When it
comes to engagement rings, for instance, what every bride longs for, the
jewellers tell us, is a ring with a real stone. Times may be hard, wallets
thinner but no self-respecting first-time bride will want to waft up the
aisle with anything less sparkling on her finger.
Some 74 per cent of all first-time brides, we learn, go for diamonds at an
average cost of Pounds 270 a time and, perhaps most surprising of all, in
these modern, unisex days it is not all one way - 90 per cent of all grooms
want a wedding ring and one in five of those will choose one with diamonds.
No matter how hard the times, the need for these 'necessities' as they are
known in the jewellery trade, goes on for ever. But while 'necessities' may
be their bread and butter, any jeweller who hopes to survive into the 1990s
knows well enough that changing times require changing attitudes.
As the number of coronations, grand balls and royal marriages dwindles, so
more new-money and growing professional classes have emerged to keep the
accountants happy. All these changes are faithfully reflected in the wares
the big jewellers offer. Matching sets of tiaras, necklaces and ear-rings
ablaze with precious stones are thinner on the ground. Gold bracelets and
chic little brooches that could sit happily on a working suit, cuff-links
for a smart French cuff, are brought well to the foreground.
Rosamund Monckton, managing director of Tiffany, 25 Old Bond Street, London,
W1, saw the way the wind was blowing: 'I personally go through the sales
slips every day to see what is moving.' She made sure that she was
plentifully supplied with affordable middle-range jewellery. (Affordable, of
course, is a moveable feast, but we are talking Bond Street here and
affordable could be anything from Pounds 400 to Pounds 10,000).
Tiffany, of course, has always had the work of people like Elsa Peretti and
Paloma Picasso, known more for the panache and impact of their designs than
the high price-tags of the materials. This may not be the stuff that brings
the Maharajas or the Saudi Princesses running but, more to the point in
these egalitarian days, it is just the thing that many a successful
professional woman might buy to celebrate a promotion and that a salaried
professional man could afford to treat his wife to.
But, even at jewellers known more specifically for their haut joaillerie,
such as Boucheron, 180 New Bond Street, London, W1,the view is that all this
talk of gloom and doom has been overdone. Certainly 1991 was not a good year
but, as Daniel Reveyron of Boucheron says: 'If you take a long-term view
much more business is being done today than 15 years ago. 1991 may have been
down when compared with 1990 and more particularly with the late 1980s but
compared with 1975 it is still incomparably up.
'Society these days is infinitely richer, far more people can afford a pair
of diamond earrings or a good gold bangle than 20 years ago. Go to the first
room in the British Museum and what do you find? - weapons and jewellery.
Adornment of the person is an ancient tradition. The desire for jewellery is
old and deep and it will take more than a recession for people to stop
buying.'
The key, though, for Boucheron too, has been to provide plenty of choice in
the 'affordable' range. For instance, Boucheron's puzzle jewellery - for
women rings and bracelets start at Pounds 620 for a ring, Pounds 1,800 for a
bracelet, and for chaps, cufflinks start at Pounds 425 a pair - has been a
steady seller all through the dark days. Women choose gifts formen when
Christmas or a birthday comes up, men buy them all the year round. They are,
you might say, a piece of affordable fun. You can add to them as the years
go by and change the look, with the variety of optional inserts, from day to
day.
At Asprey, too, the word is that everything that is small and reasonable,
whether it be a little pearly delight or a small diamond number is still
selling well - provided it is somewhere in the magic band of Pounds
1,000-Pounds 4,000.
They look back with wonder at the heady days of the late 1980s when several
times a year they could sell Pounds 500,000 'suites', when men would buy
each other hugely expensive watches to celebrate a deal, when everybody was
high on profits and bonuses and price seemed no barrier. These days they
make sure that there are gold earrings, cuff-links or silver bracelets at no
more than Pounds 500 a time and these seem to keep the tills ringing and the
volumes up.
And as for watches - the days when a watch was purely functional are long
gone. When a woman needs a pick-me-up, or what a friend calls some 'retail
therapy' she may buy herself a lipstick or a designer jacket. When a chap
needs to cheer himself up or a reward for a job well done, a watch is what
he goes for. And not just any old watch - expensive, designer-labelled,
big-status stuff. Just as no woman ever had too many designer jackets, so it
seems, the man about town cannot have too many watches.
Hennell, of Bond Street, London W1, reports that the value of every sale is
down but by dint of producing a new collection of 'affordable' jewellery -
in its case this means the Westminster and Fleur de Lys ring collection and
some 18 carat gold jewellery at around a Pounds 3,000 a time - volume is
still holding up well.
But, needless to say, the desire for a little decorative quelque chose is
not confined exclusively to the rich. When a few years ago the Daily Mirror
asked its readers what they most wanted to find in their stockings on
Christmas morning, it found that most women hoped for a pair of diamond
ear-studs.
Some of the middle-market chains, such as Beaverbrooks with its 27 stores
specialising in gold jewellery in the north of England and Scotland, report
that overall there was no falling off of sales at all - 1991 figures were up
on 1990 which in turn was up on 1989. Sales of 18 carat gold moved ahead of
those in 9 carat - no-one wants to throw away money on things with little
intrinsic value. Better a smaller piece in 18 carat gold than a larger one
in 9-carat seems to be the message.
So when it comes to cheering themselves up she likes nothing better than a
bauble and he could be nicely consoled with a dashing pair of cuff-links or
a big-name watch. Times are nothing like as hard as they have been made out
to be.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Robotic production falls out of
favour / Finding a growing market for mechanical time pieces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GOODALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who appreciate fine time pieces have long preferred mechanical watches
to their quartz counterparts. This year is likely to prove a turning point
in the revival of interest in high quality mechanical watches For some
years, mechanical horology has been undergoing a revival, but only recently
have fresh advances in technology enabled Switzerland's master watchmakers
to achieve what they would have previously considered impossible.
People who spend thousands of pounds on a gold watch like to own a product
that has been assembled or finished by a craftsman whose skills have been
handed down from father to son for many generations. Mechanical watches that
emerge from a production line may be high in quality, but the type of watch
most likely to appeal to a collector will have been assembled, checked and
regulated by hand.
Although the finest mechanical watches are made using modern equipment to
allow even greater precision and improve parts of the production process,
mainly at the design stage, no machine can match the patience and skill of
the engraver who decorates a movement or case, nor the craftsman who
painstakingly pierces the dial and movement of a skeleton watch to make it
almost transparent.
A growing number of collectors delight in acquiring these miniature marvels
of engineering, whether modern or vintage.
To understand the watchmaker's achievements it is worthwhile considering
what a marvel he produces. If the mainspring of a watch were left to itself
it would uncoil in seconds, causing the wheels inside and the hands to spin
at a tremendous rate. In order to control the rate at which this pent-up
power is released, horologists invented the escapement, which releases the
driving power of the spring a little at a time, causing the familiar ticking
sound.
The work done by the escapement is extremely demanding. In an ordinary
mechanical watch, the balance wheel swings 18,000 times an hour and the gear
train moves forward 432,000 times in 24 hours. In six years, this represents
almost one thousand million impulses.
If a mechanical watch varies by one minute a day, it has a precision of
99.93 per cent - a good example should be seven times more accurate, to
within one minute a week. This is a remarkable achievement for a mechanical
measuring device small enough to fit on the wrist and which provides up to
100 years of service.
Quartz watches have been available for over 20 years and today their
accuracy and reliability are taken for granted. They accounted for more than
90 per cent of all Swiss watch exports last year and an even higher
percentage from Japan. However, last year the number of mechanical watches
exported from Switzerland increased by 23 per cent. Although these 2.6m
units represent only 8 per cent of all watches exported, they account for a
staggering 44 per cent in value terms.
The past 20 years have seen quartz movement manufacturers rapidly develop
and perfect their technology. Few challenges are left, and to the serious
collector, the watches have less character than mechanical timepieces.
This is reflected in the annal watch and jewellery fair at Basle, in
Switzerland. where the most interesting new products this year were
mechanical watches and little innovation can be seen in the world of quartz
watches, although the styling of cases, bracelets and straps continues to
evolve.
However, there is one important exception: the movement that uses a
conventional quartz movement for accuracy and adds to it high-precision
micro-mechanics to provide the additional information which a complicated
watch has to display.
While Swatch has produced 100m watches in the past 10 years, at the opposite
end of the market Patek Philippe is careful not to expand production at the
expense of quality. In April this year it unveiled two important new models,
a minute repeater wristwatch with a tourbillon escapement, and a minute
repeating perpetual calendar with a fly-back calendar hand.
The former will cost about Pounds 250,000, while the latter will be around
Pounds 350,000. In the next 12 months it will probably be able to produce
only five pieces of each for world-wide consumption, such is the skill and
time needed to produce each watch. During the Basle fair, where both watches
were shown for the first time, orders for six of each were received from
London stockists alone.
Watches and watch movements enjoy fashions, like any other luxury product,
but the cost of developing entirely new movements is so great that watch
fashions change more slowly than others. For several years, for example,
moon phase dials were in vogue but now interest in the moon is definitely
waning.
Last year mechanical and quartz 'complicated' watches - models with many
dials and many functions - took centre stage, and this trend seems likely to
continue. The popularity of the chronograph - the watch with a built-in
stopwatch - continues. Many more perpetual calendar watches - which show the
date and allow for leap years - are on the market. Minute repeater watches,
which delicately chime the time on command, have also kept Swiss watchmakers
busy over the past year.
So much research, development and investment go into the production of new
complicated movements - especially the mechanical models - that
manufacturers hope they will remain in production well into the future. Each
year it seems more unlikely that the previous year's achievements can be
surpassed, and yet further technical refinements and improvements in quality
appear.
'Limited editions' became popular last year but too many Swiss watch
companies jumped on the bandwagon, and supply outstripped demand. This year,
the few limited editions being offered are of genuine interest, such as the
limited edition reproduction of Cartier's famous Crash watch, or an unusual
elongated oval design known as the Baignoire Allonge. The unique flip-over
Reverso 60th by Jaeger-LeCoultre, of which only 500 were made, was sold out
long ago. Now, however, the Reverso is enjoying renewed interest and a book
about the history of this classic watch is on sale.
Vacheron Constantin has long been respected as one of Switzerland's finest
producers. This year it has introduced a minute repeater watch which is an
exact replica of one of the company's models from the 1930s. It is a
masculine model in an 18 carat yellow gold or platinum case and owes its
revival to advanced technology. The thin hand-wound movement has a power
reserve of 48 hours and strikes on demand the hours, quarters and minutes,
using two gongs. Only 200 pieces of this limited edition are to be made.
Blancpain is one of the most respected names in watchmaking and noted for
its determination not to make a watch containing a quartz movement. Instead,
it has concentrated its efforts on perfecting some classic models. This
year, it has created the world's slimmest self-winding chronograph with a
flyback hand, and added to it a perpetual calendar mechanism. It contains
388 parts but the movement is only 27mm in diameter and just 6.95mm thick.
Chopard, a family-owned company in Geneva, is unusual in that it makes its
own fine watches but is also renowned for its diamonds and gem-set jewellery
too. Its timepieces include the Happy Diamonds collection of
diamond-encrusted jewellery watches, with loose diamonds rolling around the
outer part of the watch case.
Piaget - long associated with jewellery watches - now makes many fine pieces
in plain gold cases. This year, it is paying a tribute to Georges Piaget,
the company's founder, by reproducing the characteristics which prevailed 50
years ago in Georges Piaget Watch. A round, classical watch, it is being
issued in a limited series of 500. It has a hand-wound mechanical movement
2mm thick, first developed and produced in 1956 and which still forms the
basis of the entire Piaget classic watch line. It is manufactured entirely
within the Piaget workshops and requires 870 separate operations. The
movement of the numbered edition from 1 to 100 in platinum is elaborately
engraved by hand and is a superb example of the engraver's art.
Ebel has produced the left handed watch. Designed to be worn on the right
wrist by left-handed people, the 1911 is a special version of a popular
design. The left-handed version has the date at nine o'clock instead of
three o'clock, so it is not hidden by the sleeve, and the winding button is
on the left of the case, making time and date setting easier. It is believed
to be the first series-production timepiece of its kind.
Cartier has recently opened its own watch factories to reduce its dependence
on outside producers. The results promise to be exciting, now that design,
development and manufacturing both movements and cases can be done in-house.
One of the most exciting examples is the important new Tank B asculant - the
Rocking Chair watch. In the familiar rectangular tank shape for which
Cartier is famous, the inner part of the case is pivoted in the centre so
that the watch case can be turned face-down on the wrist.
Gucci Timepieces has earned itself a strong reputation for making fashion
watches. Now it is enhancing the range with an 18 carat gold collection. The
lines are clean and simple and the gold is either carefully polished or
satin finished. Gucci watch prices are now from Pounds 599 up to Pounds
8,400.
Bertolucci is a brand which combines Swiss precision and Italian design
flair. It became well known for its Pulchra line, inspired by seaside
pebbles. A new collection, Docta, features similar rounded styling. In the
Pulchra line it has introduced an advanced self-winding mechanical model
with a perpetual calendar.
In the past 12 months one curiosity has grown in popularity among Swiss
manufacturers: jumping hours. Such watches have a conventional hand to
indicate the minutes and seconds, but the hours are shown in digital form in
a window. The term 'jumping hours' is derived from the practice of ensuring
that the hour indication jumps to display the next hour. One example is
being introduced this year by Audemars Piguet, combining a minute repeater
watch with a jumping hours display. The watch shows the hour through an
aperture in the dial and displays minutes and seconds on hands in the normal
way. On demand the repeater function strikes the hours, quarters and minutes
using three different tones.
International Watch Company, one of the manufacturers favoured by
collectors, introduced a grand complication wristwatch two years ago, a
watch which has always been considered the pinnacle of the watchmaker's art
in pocket watch form. The much smaller wristwatch version, is an even
greater achievement. IWC is the only company to have succeeded in achieving
regular production. The grand complication is only available in platinum.
When introduced the price was Pounds 85,000; now it is Pounds 87,500. It is
only possible to make 50 each year and the company now has orders on its
books for another seven years.
Interest in fine watches is spreading, but the number of watchmakers is
strictly limited. So demand often outstrips supply - a situation that tends
to attract still more collectors, for who wants to collect anything which is
freely available?

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Makers ride the recession -
Industry continues to tick over nicely / Marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GOODALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S watchmakers are coping well with the recession. No big company
has gone out of business and global production rose in 1991.
Attitudes have changed considerably. In most western countries, consumers
take much more trouble over the choice of their watches than they did.
The arrival of the Swiss plastic Swatch 10 years ago (100m had been produced
by last month) provided the catalyst for change and led to watches
attracting much more attention than ever before.
Indeed, Swatch marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Swiss industry,
which had suffered from Japanese domination of quartz watch production in
the 1970s.
There were suggestions at the end of the 1980s that the popularity of the
Swatch had peaked. But sales have continued to rise and it has become a cult
product.
Industry insiders tell the story about one American dealer who took a gamble
two years ago and agreed to exchange an 18ct Patek Philippe rose gold watch
for a Swatch Jellyfish.
Today, the dealer and his customer from Italy joke about the remarkable
state of affairs in which the plastic Jellyfish has a higher auction value
than the gold Patek.
This bizarre deal highlights the two most interesting sections of the watch
market. The Swatch has become highly sought-after by collectors: even some
of those who traditionally have been attracted to some of the finest watches
ever made collect the modern plastic watch, too.
In Italy, some Swatch models are in such demand that a black market has
developed. But it is elusive almost everywhere.
This unlikely obsession with inexpensive Swatches has not hurt the rest of
the trade. Top-quality gold watches have ridden out the recession more
successfully than most fashion items, and some manufacturers have waiting
lists of years, rather than weeks or months, for their most prized pieces.
Swiss and Japanese manufacturers each have concentrated on clearly-defined
market goals. Citizen and Seiko have put their efforts into developing
technically-advanced quartz movements which can be produced in vast numbers.
Nobody could fault the quality of these or the cases, and they offer good
value for money.
Although both companies would like to break into the luxury end of the
market, they have failed to make as much progress as they would like. But
they have put much effort into broadening their appeal and selling more
watches at prices up to about Pounds 500. Their technically-advanced
movements have played a big part in this drive.
While the Swiss have had phenomenal success with Swatch, they also reign
supreme in finest gold watches through a comnbination of styling and the
excellence of their quartz and mechanical movements. Ironically, the
Japanese market is very important for many top-line Swiss brands.
One Swiss company, Tagheuer, has made particularly strong progress. In the
past seven years, its turnover has increased sevenfold.
The decisive factors in its success have been demand in the sports market -
which is its speciality - and the ability to define a clear and precise
marketing strategy, as well as developing a strong product line. Its links
with the McLaren motor-racing team helped it gain publicity and it is now
the official timekeeper for Formula 1.
Hong Kong has produced huge numbers of watches over the past 10 or 15 years
but these mainly have been digital - and the market for those is shrinking.
Earlier this month a British company, Time Products, announced it had closed
Remex, its Hong Kong watch subsidiary, because it was no longer competitive
against the Swiss and Japanese.
A potential new watch giant is, however, starting to flex its muscles - not
in Europe, Hong Kong or Taiwan, but in India. Titan Watch, a division of the
country's largest company, decided in 1985 to open a watch factory.
Two years later it was in full production, using machinery supplied by
France Ebauches and Citizen. By the end of 1991, Titan had well over 60 per
cent of the Indian quartz watch market.
It plans to enter the UK and French markets at the beginning of 1993,
placing a strong emphasis on design, market research, advertising and all
the other ingredients which are vital to the establishment of a new brand.
Already, the factory in Tamil Nadu employs 2,000 people and is one of the
best-equipped and most modern in the world.
When Titan comes to Europe, it will do so not with cheap watches but with a
range designed by some of Europe's top designers. Titan is now beginning to
produce its first prototypes in gold.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Baubles on a budget - Patricia
Morison set out with Pounds 1,000 to see what she could buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS easy to spend a fortune on jewellery, but these are difficult times,
so I set out round the dealers of London to find what treasures I could pick
up on a budget of Pounds 1,000.
Unless you have plenty of time, buying at jewellery sales is a non-starter.
And even though you might strike lucky at an auction, even allowing for
payment of commission and VAT, it is easy for an ignorant buyer to come
unstuck in the sale-room where, after a month has elapsed, there is no
come-back.
Secondhand jewellery dealers need to carry a big stock; they charge a
mark-up of 300 or 400 per cent on a piece they have 'bought well' at
auction, but someone who buys from a reputable jewellery dealer, and finds
there is a problem, should expect redress.
Even if a piece simply looks wrong, a good dealer should offer to exchange
it or refund. Membership of BADA and LPADA is a useful badge of
respectability. But always obtain a fully descriptive receipt of your
purchase. For example, if the brooch is sold as Art Deco, be sure those
words appear on the receipt.
Anyone setting out cold around London's antiques and collectibles shops
could usefully buy themselves The Collector, a monthly magazine costing
Pounds 1 which gives an area by area directory of shops. It is widely
available in antique shops and hotels; or ring/fax 081-740-7020.
Burlington Gardens in the West End is an elegant corner in which to start
the hunt for period jewellery, although a budget of Pounds 1,000 turns out
not to offer very much. The casual purchaser of jewellery is a far less
common creature these days, and prices are currently depressed - 10 per cent
down, according to one dealer. So do not to be deterred by the smart suit
and plummy accent - make the dealer an offer.
Blane Thompson at Silver, 3-5 Burlington Gardens, says period and antique
jewellery becomes a better buy in a recession. The high street chains
selling new jewellery have fixed profit margins, whereas dealers in old
pieces can afford to drop their prices. Second-hand jewellery is a better
buy because, with a modern piece, a purchaser is paying for the workmanship;
making jewellery is skilled and time-consuming.
What if you should fall on hard times? When purchasing a second-hand piece,
Thompson says, 'most jewellers will be prepared to give you what you paid,
plus the added value if it has gone up.' Silver specialises in Art Nouveau
and Lalique (unaffordable with a budget of Pounds 1,000) and traditional
English jewellery.
The Victorian pieces which fall within budget tend to be conventional and
rather heavy. The introduction of platinum, around 1900, allowed jewellers
to make really fine settings. Edwardian rings, set with a large tourmaline,
cost about Pounds 1,000. A pretty Tiffany gold openwork flower-brooch in
gold and rubies is Pounds 750; a black enamel, seedpearl and diamond brooch
costs Pounds 800. Brooches, rings, and pendants are more likely than
earrings to come within the budget.
Buyers with a sense of history tend to like Victorian gold posy rings and
mourning rings, which range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000, and Roman
intaglios in Victorian settings - intaglios and cameos could well be Italian
fakes, but that merely adds to the period flavour.
Across the way at Harvey and Gore, Pounds 1,000 will take you back as far as
the late 18th century, with a pair of keepsake bracelets of painted ivory
(called 'bone' these days), enamel, hair, and gilt. Pretty Georgian brooches
and chokers of imitation diamonds made of paste may cost in the region of
Pounds 500; unfortunately they are extremely fragile.
At Grays Antique Market at 58 Davies Street and in the mews behind, prices
are lower. These days, almost the only sounds on a weekday are the cries of
dealers calling dejectedly to each other, like sea birds on a deserted
coastline.
At Licht and Morrison, specialists in antique and period jewellery, it
becomes clear that quality Art Deco pieces are over budget. Attractive
Victorian pieces, such as a delectable pearl and diamond bangle and a chunky
diamond brooch in 15 carat gold, cost Pounds 1,500-Pounds 1,900. For rather
original pieces, try Donohoes in Davies Mews, which specialises in 'artist's
jewellery' and rather wonderful Holbeinesque pieces - Victorian pastiche
which makes you feel like Mary Stuart on a good day.
For something solidly English and distinctly cheaper, consider Whitby jet
and its look-alikes - there was simply not enough jet to satisfy the
Victorian passion for the stuff. Allison Massey in Grays Market is the only
dealer who specialises in jet.
Massive-looking carved chokers and necklaces (jet is extraordinarily light),
tiaras and chokers in reddish-hued 'French jet' (which is probably not
French and certainly not jet), are also affordable. The medium - 'jet,' in
fact, is glass - allows far more delicate workmanship. But it is black-as
your-hat Whitby jet which has the literary cachet, thanks to the
poet-lover's gift in A S Byatt's recent novel, Possession. What better - or
better-value - keepsake of a romantic visit?

FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: The growing struggle for pole
position - Notice a switch by marketing-minded watch manufacturers from
sports to arts sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN NIGEL Mansell wins a Grand Prix and Nick Faldo holes in one they do it
for love of the sport, for prize money - and for the watch manufacturers. In
recent years the watch companies have become very marketing minded, spending
lavishly on advertising, on sponsorship, and on corporate hospitality. Many
major sporting events, and some in the arts, are underpinned with watch
money.
To a great extent this is a natural consequence of the watch manufacturers'
successful development of ranges of sports watches; it adds conviction if
their brands can be seen on the wrists of successful sportsmen and women.
Zeon, which expects to sell 2m watches in the UK this year, confirming its
status as market leader in terms of units sold, attributes much of its
growth to its decision to sponsor racing driver Nigel Mansell in 1988.
The advertising campaign built around Mansell and its range of sports
watches, secured Zeon the retail distribution and window displays which
powered its growth. However, it is alive to the fact that Mansell might
retire after this Grand Prix season, and it is investigating links with
other sports personalities. Zeon also supports motor cross from its Pounds
500,000 promotional budget.
At the other extreme from Zeon is Cartier. It sponsors uremittingly
up-market events - like the Cartier International day at the Guards Polo
Club in Windsor Great Park - where it would expect to meet existing or
potential customers. Just to make sure the audience meets its needs, Cartier
jets in guests from throughout the world who are more than happy to rub
shoulders with the Royals who regularly turn up in force.
Cartier has extended its sponsorship into its Racing Awards, which are
unusual in that the accolades go to the best horses of the year rather than
trainers or owners. The company is also unusual in backing the arts through
the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art, an arts centre on the outskirts
of Paris, which it is stocking with modern art.
Generally, while arts sponsorship has grown rapidly, watch manufacturers
have preferred to concentrate their money behind sport. This is changing.
Raymond Weil backs the arts in Switzerland and Belgium and Patek Philippe
celebrated its 150th anniversary with a gala concert in Geneva. Its UK
operation entertained guests at Garrards, the Bond Street jewellers, with
music by the London Symphony orchestra. Given the up-market profile of the
arts, and its ability to cross frontiers, stronger links with the watch
manufacturers seem certain.
In the meantime, the obsession with sport continues apace, mainly because it
is proving good for business. TAG-Heuer provides an obvious example. It has
stormed ahead in a generally static market with a heavy promotional drive
for its range of sports watches, much of it built around its sponsorship of
sport.
It has not been half-hearted. Just before the start of the current season it
took over from Longines as the sponsor of Formula One motor racing. The
price was high - the company admits that its annual budget has risen from
Dollars 8m to Dollars 10m - but the global coverage, and the identification
of prospective customers with the sport, make the connection ideal.
It is unlikely to be taken for a ride: it knows something about motor sport
from its previous sponsorship of the McLaren team. In the US, where Formula
One is not so renowned, TAG-Heuer links with Indianapolis, while on the
continent, especially France, it panders to the national obsessions with
skiing and yachting. The expenditure seems to be paying off. The company has
managed to move up market, brand awareness has grown, retailers, who love to
be invited to a sponsored event, are stocking the sports watches, and sales
are higher.
Not every watch company is going for big glamorous events. Sector, with its
slogan 'No Limits', concentrates on off-beat sponsorships in which its watch
is identified with really challenging exercises, such as speed ski-diving,
trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific rowing, Antarctic exploration and the like.
It identifies with interesting personalities rather than stars, and expects
a public relations spin-off from the media coverage of their exploits.
This marketing concept was pioneered in Italy, where it has proved
successful, so much so that there is now a magazine, No Limits, which
retells the adventures of these hardy types with copious plugs for Sector.
The aim is to sell its brand of sports watches to armchair travellers
(prices range from Pounds 115 to Pounds 500) who like the knowledge that
their are 'no limits' to the hardiness of their watch.
Most other watch makers choose their sport and stick with it. Ebel backs the
Professional Golfers Association. It is the official time keeper for its
event, and leading players wear Ebel watches. Once again there is a natural
link between golf and potential customers (to say nothing of the corporate
hospitality of retailers at major tournaments.)
Seeing Ian Woosnam or Sandy Lisle swinging away with an Ebel watch on their
wrist is excellent publicity. For Corum the link is with the Admiral's Cup.
It has been supporting the event since it first produced a nautical watch,
with the hours marked by flags, in 1983, and is so happy with the connection
that it has extended its sponsorship to the French national team, which
repaid its confidence in winning the Cup in 1991.
Just as Corum hopes it has the backing of the world's sailors, so Breitling
is indelibly associated with aviation. It backs all the big flying events,
from the Jersey Air Fair to the Biggin Hill show, and has the Breitling
pilot on hand to perform stunts. But Breitling has added other sports to its
range: white-water rafting in France and three-day eventing in England.
And so it goes on. Audemars Piquet sponsors golfer Nick Faldo; Hublot is big
in golf and Alfred Dunhill in polo and golf. As the watch manufacturers
discover the commercial joys of branding, creating watches aimed at specific
markets, watches for golf, for tennis, for sailing, for sports generally,
but with spin-offs for the man in the street (or the woman buying a watch as
a present), so the links with sports organisers and sports men and women
grow ever closer. As well as the potential of free television coverage for
big events, the sponsors also obtain attractive entertainment facilities,
both for trade guests and existing and potential customers.
Sponsorship by the watch trade is now a multi-million pound business. But
the biggest coup of all - official timekeeper for the 1992 Olympics - has
cost Seiko nothing. It won this accolade in direct competition with Swiss
Timing, which handled events last time.
Along with IBM, which provides the computer data, it is the only brand name
to be seen on screen as the Barcelona games are transmitted throughout the
world. It will cost Seiko a great deal of investment to ensure that its
system works. It will be spending millions promoting the link. But it is
ironic that the ultimate sports event should be beyond the sponsors' purse.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Summer Festivals: Jazzing it up in unlikely places / Chasing
the blues around the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH

<TEXT>
From the Bude to the Isle of Bute, Summer brings out jazz festivals the
length and breadth of the country. Some of the best are held in the most
unlikely places. Grimsby, for example, has its South Bank Festival (July
3-5, Tel. 0472 342422) which is held in a 'marquee complex' and this year
features Phil Woods among scores of others. Crawley's civic Hawth Centre
will be the venue for the often avant-garde Outside-In Festival (September
5-6, Tel. 0293 553636). Featured projects here include The Dedication
Orchestra and Mike Westbrook's Orchestra.
The major events are in the last throes of programming and are as follows:
Glasgow International
July 2-11
(041) 552 3552
Carla Bley is composer in residence and the Festival organisers have
commissioned a new work from her for an orchestra which features Steve
Swallow. Other features of a tremendous programme are a reunited Miles Davis
Quintet with Wallace Roney depping for the great man; the Paul Motian Trio;
Elvin Jones' Jazz Machine and the McCoy Tyner Big Band.
Birmingham International
July 3-12
(021) 454 7020
The eighth annual Brum event, headliners include the unpredictable
soulfulness of Nina Simone and witty Mose Allison. The rest is a curious but
engaging mix ranging from the Ted Heath to the Budapest Ragtime Orchestras.
Edinburgh International
August 7-15
(031) 557 1642
A big one getting bigger, the Edinburgh International now has a full weekend
of blues, special venues for 'world music' and is preceded by the McEwan's
80/- Free Jazz Trail (August 3-7). The main events, which are held in the
Usher Hall and Queen's Hall, include Pat Metheny (see also Brecon); Bob
Wilber, Kenny Davern and Oliver Jones; Dick Hyman and Jay McShann in
concert. A Blue Note showcase is sponsored by Technics.
Brecon
August 14-16
(0874) 625557
Easily the most convivial of the UK's many jazz happenings, Jazz Aberhonddu
is also one of the best programmed. This year's headliners include super
guitarist Pat Metheny with drummer Roy Haynes and bassist Dave Holland.
Trumpeter Clark Terry leads an all star small group and the hugely talented
French pianist Michel Petrucciani puts in an appearance. The town's hotels,
bars and fields teem with music all weekend and 'stroller' passes are a good
bet. Book early.
Bude
29 August - 5 September
(0288) 356360/(0684) 566956
Most of the many minor jazz festivals happening in the UK are trad-oriented,
but Bude is the main event for lovers of Dixieland, New Orleans and good old
fashioned stomping music. Wear a silly hat and bring a pewter tankard.
Edinburgh TDK Round Midnight
31 Aug - 4 Sept
(031) 557 4446
Between them, Glasgow and Edinburgh host an indecent amount of top class
jazz. In the last week of the Edinburgh festival, TDK sponsors the Bob
Berg/Mike Stern Band, George Shearing with Carol Kidd, and Nana Vasconcelos
JAZZ OVERSEAS JVC Jazz Festival
New York 19-27 June
212 787 2020
From Carnegie Hall to Waterloo Village, NJ, George Wein's NY fest is a
nostalgic, star-studded affair. For his 75th birthday party (health
permitting), Dizzy Gillespie will be joined by Wynton Marsalis, Freddie
Hubbard and Jackie McLean; Lionel Hampton celebrates 65 years in jazz and
the MJQ, 40 years in the business; Gerry Mulligan leads a tentet. Tributes
for those no longer with us include Leonard Feather's concert for Stan Getz,
Arturo Sandoval remembering Clifford Brown and Illinois Jacquet saluting
trumpeter Buck Clayton. TV star Bill Cosby hosts an evening dedicated to
John Coltrane.
13th Festival Django Reinhardt
June 26-28
1 64 24 64 82
Samois sur Seine, near Fontainebleu, was home to the great Manouche
guitarist in his last years and the festival which commemorates his music
was once attended only by gypsies. The gypsy guitarists still bring their
caravans to the site, which is on the Ile du Berceau in the Seine, for a
programme which is almost entirely French.
Montreux Jazz Festival
July 3-18
21 963 8282/7474
Less a pure jazz festival these days and more a celebration of musical
tastefulness, the lakeside casino hosts C &amp; W (Emmylou Harris), pop (Simply
Red), blues (Eric Clapton), soul (Gladys Knight), and rock (Ringo Starr's
All-Starr band). There is some jazz, however, and the best nights are July
15 (Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter &amp; Co) and July 16 (The Brecker Brothers
with Mike Stern and Dave Weckl plus, on the same night, Jimmy Smith and
Jimmy McGriff).
North Sea Jazz Festival, The Hague
July 10-12
70 354 29 58
'One thousand musicians playing continuously and simultaneously on 13
stages,' is the frightening promise made by the North Sea Jazz organisers.
The gargantuan programme includes: female vocalists Roberta Flack, Betty
Carter, Dianne Reeves and Celia Cruz; the big bands of Lionel Hampton,
Illinois Jacquet, McCoy Tyner and Cab Calloway; Gerry Mulligan's Tentet; An
'organ explosion' which includes Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff and the Lester
Bowie Organ Ensemble; An Afro-Cuban, salsa and Brazilian section which
includes Tito Puente; a fusion bill with Chick Corea, Grover Washington,
Brecker Brothers and Spyro Gyra.
La Grande Parade du Jazz, Nice
July 11-21
1 46 21 08 37
A rich mix of mainstream and blue sounds is available at the Nice festival
this year with Lionel Hampton, Fats Domino, BB King and The Wynton Marsalis
Septet topping the bill. An African flavour is added with the appearance of
Youssou N'Dour, Mory Kante and Salif Keita (who appears with the Weather
Report pianist, Joe Zawinul's Syndicate).

FT  16 MAY 92 / Summer Festivals: A big year for Pesaro and major coups in
Seville
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICH
July 6 - 31
Festspielkasse der Bayerischen Staatsoper, Maximillianstrasse 11, D-8000
Munich 22, Germany. Tel: (89) 221 316
The opera festival offers new productions of Carmen (by Lina Wertmuller,
with Agnes Baltsa, conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli) and, in the small,
delightful Cuvilies-Theater, a rare modern revival of Henze's Prinz von
Homburg (conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, with Francois Le Roux, Helga
Dernesch and Peter Schreier). Otherwise, it is the Munich formula as usual:
end-of-season offerings performed by glossy names on little or no rehearsal
to often scrappy, lacklustre effect. Among them are La forza del destino,
Fidelio, Peter Grimes, Dvorak's Dimitrij, Der Rosenkavalier and Boris
Godunov, and Strauss's Intermezzo in the Cuvilies.
PESARO
July 31 - August 18
Rossini Opera Festival, Via Rossini 37, 61100 Pesaro, Italy. Tel 721-30161
Fax 721-30979
This is Pesaro's big year - the bicentenary of its most famous son. Rossini
will be celebrated in four opera productions: Il barbiere di Siviglia with
Cecilia Bartoli as Rosina, Semiramide conducted by Rossini musicologist
Alberto Zedda, La scala di seta with a cast of young Rossini specialists and
Il viaggio a Reims in the celebrated Abbado-Ronconi production. There will
also be a rare staging of the Cantate per I Borboni conducted by Riccardo
Chailly.
PRAGUE
May 12 - June 1
Prague Spring Festival, Hellichova 18, 11800 Praha 1, Czechoslovakia. Tel
2-530293 Fax 2-536040
Despite being swamped with tourists, Prague at festival time is still an
attractive prospect. Before the revolution, it was a showcase for Czech and
east European culture. Now it gives local audiences a chance to hear western
artists whose visits were strictly rationed under the Communists. Guests in
the remaining two weeks of this year's festival include Maurizio Pollini,
the Hilliard Ensemble, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and radio orchestras
from Berlin and Copenhagen. But there is also some more exotic fare, such as
Massenet's oratorio La Vierge at St Vitus Cathedral, the Prague Madrigalists
singing sacred music by Zelenka, and the Suk Chamber Orchestra playing
lesser-known Czech composers. Ulf Schirmer conducts the Czech Philharmonic
in the world premiere of a new work by Jan Hanus, and Vaclav Neumann
conducting Schnittke's Concerto Grosso No 5 at the final concert.
RAVENNA
June 22 - July 21
Ravenna Festival, Via Gordini 27, 48100 Ravenna, Italy. Tel 544-482494 Fax
544-36303
Riccardo Muti has hired the Vienna Philharmonic for the opening concert, and
Georg Solti brings the Schleswig-Holstein Festival Orchestra at the end. In
between are concerts conducted by Chailly, Pretre and Berio, and two opera
stagings: Donizetti's Poliuto (produced by Pizzi, with a cast led by Tiziana
Fabbricini and Dennis O'Neill) and Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto.
ST LOUIS
May 22 - June 21
Opera Theater of St Louis, with its picnics on the lawn, intimate theatre
conditions, performances all in English and general air of relaxed bonhomie,
is such a pleasure to attend that its rigorous performance standards (many
of America's best singers find their feet here) and adventurous repertory
are a special bonus. This year's new work is Judith Weir's The Vanishing
Bridegroom (US premiere), alongside Madame Butterfly, The Turk in Italy and
Britten's Dream.
SALZBURG
July 27 - August 30
5010 Salzburg, PO Box 140. Tel 043 662 8045.
This year the new festival director, Gerard Mortier, really begins to leave
his mark on the festival schedule. A much sharper profile is given to the
theatre offerings, with a new production of Julius Caesar by Peter Stein as
particular coup; and the choice of operas reflects a diversity and boldness
of choice unknown during the Karajan years. New productions of Janacek's
House of the Dead (staged by Klaus Michael Gruber, conducted by Abbado, with
Nicolai Ghiaurov, Barry McCauley and Philip Langridge) and Messiaen's St
Francois d'Assise (staged by Peter Sellars, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen,
with Jose van Dam) stand out among the big-name revivals of La clemenza di
Tito, Figaro, Die Frau ohne Schatten and Salome. Pierre Boulez leads a
concert series with the Ensemble Intercontemporain; the Los Angeles Phil, St
Petersburg Phil and CBSO (under Simon Rattle) are among the visiting
orchestras; and recitals by Margaret Price, Dmitry Hvorostovsky, Felicity
Lott and Fischer-Dieskauadd to the concert bounty.
The theatre offering this year is small but classy: a new production of
Julius Caesar by Peter Stein, the first German production of Stanislaw
Wyspianski's Wesele (The Wedding), and Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Jedermann
(Everyman), starring Helmut Lohner, performed outdoors at the Domplatz.
SANTA FE
July 3 - August 29
PO Box 2408 Santa Fe, New Mexico 87504. Tel 0101 505 982 3855
There are new productions of Don Giovanni and The Beggar's Opera this year
together with revivals of Fledermaus and Rosenkavalier; nothing about that
fare to send opera fanatics hot foot to deepest New Mexico. But the American
premiere of Von Bose's The Sorrows of Young Werther provides novelty and
genuine interest, and then there is the place itself - the most spectacular
setting for an opera house, surely, anywhere in the world.
SAVONLINNA
July 1 - 31
Olavinkatu 35, SF-57130 Savonlinna. Tel: 057 514 700
The main reason for a visit to the Finnish lakeside opera festival continues
to be the great stone castle courtyard in which it takes place: a
magnificent venue for opera. The programme itself - new Fidelio production,
Aida and Magic Flute revivals, touring American Porgy and Bess - lacks the
panache of the 1970s and early '80s; it is hoped the recent appointment as
festival director of Jorma Hynninen, a great Finnish singer long associated
with the venture, will do something to revive the pioneering spirit.
SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN
June 28 - August 23
Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Postfach 3840, D-2300 Kiel 1, Germany.
Tel 431-567080 Fax 431-569152
This young festival, masterminded by pianist and impresario Justus Frantz,
is like a musical mosaic, spread across some of the most attractive towns in
north Germany, in venues which give a more intimate festival atmosphere than
most. The North German Radio Symphony Orchestra opens the festival in Lubeck
(under Gunter Wand), and gives the closing performances of Britten's War
Requiem with John Eliot Gardiner. The festival orchestra will be conducted
by Maazel and Solti, and visiting ensembles include the CBSO with Rattle,
the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra with Jarvi, the Stockholm Sinfonietta and
the Lithuanian and Norwegian Chamber Orchestras. Recitalists include Rudolf
Buchbinder, the Labeque Sisters, Bruno Leonardo Gelber, Peter Schreier and
Hermann Prey.
SEVILLE
to October 12
EXPO '92, Seville. Tel (34 5) 448 0404.
This is a truly international festival with the major coups for Seville of
an Ingmar Bergman-directed Peer Gynt and Giogio Strehler's production of
Goldoni's Le Barruffe Chiozzotei. Seville's Central Theatre, specially built
to play host to 'new theatre tendencies' from across Europe, promises
several innovative blockbusters: the premiere of Steven Berkoff's Como los
Griegos, Greek; Robert Wilson's The Black Rider, the heady Tom Waits/William
Burroughs rock musical/cabaret that was the star of last year's Berlin
festival, and Jerome Deschamp's Lapin Chausseur from Paris. Spanish theatre
is well represented in both native and foreign offerings; the Georgian
Rustavelli Theatre visits with Calderon's Life is a Dream and the Royal
National theatre with Fuente Ovejuna
SPOLETO
June 24 to July 12
Associazione Festival Dei Due Mondi, Via Cesare Beccaria 18, 00196 Roma,
Italy. Tel 6-3210 288 Fax 6-3200 747
Spoleto offers a hot, hectic round-the-clock collage of events, spearheaded
this year by two opera productions - a rather odd attempt to revive
Visconti's 1959 staging of Donizetti's Le duc d'Albe and a new staging of
Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg directed by Spoleto's ageless festival
supremo Gian Carlo Menotti. The dance programme - in the atmospheric
settings of a Roman amphitheatre and a medieval church - embraces the
ultra-traditional Bolshoy Ballet, the contemporary Maguy Marin Company from
France and a troupe led by black American choreographer Bill T Jones. The
Italian-language drama programme, spread among Spoleto's cafe-style
theatres, totals seven plays, including a world premiere by Carlo Repetti
and Schnitzler's one-act Baccanale.
THREE CHOIRS
August 22-29
Festival Office, Community House, College Green, Gloucester GL1 2LX
It is Gloucester's turn to stage what most be one of Britain's oldest
festivals, and certainly the most hidebound: no prizes for predicting that
the programmes will include Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Herbert Howells,
with Lennox Berkeley and Gerald Finzi as strong probabilities too. But there
is also Janacek's Glagolitic Mass and Durufle's Requiem this year as well as
some commissions: from Hugh Wood for brass ensemble, and Philip Cannon for
the massed choirs of the three cathedrals.
VERONA
July 1 - August 30
Arena di Verona, Piazza Bra 28, 37100 Verona, Italy. Tel 45-590966 Fax
45-590201
Verona, the home of spectacular,open-air opera, has three Verdi operas and
one Puccini this summer. The first cast for Don Carlo includes Luis Lima,
Aprile Millo and Renato Bruson. There are four Aidas to choose from, and
Piero Cappuccilli sings the title role in Nabucco. Neil Shicoff and Cecilia
Gasdia look the most attractive pairing in La boheme.
VIENNA
May 9 - June 14
Vienna Festival, Lehargasse 11, A-1060 Vienna. Tel 1-586 1676 Fax 1-586
167649
Muti, Berio, Giulini, Maazel, Ashkenazy and Previn will conduct concerts in
the Musikvereinsaal over the next four weeks. Brendel, Studer, te Kanawa and
Prey are among the soloists. Opera is limited to the Brussels production of
Il barbiere di Siviglia and Harry Kupfer's Komische Oper staging of Carmen.
The theatre programme looks better. Claus Peymann opened the festival with
the world premiere of Peter Handke's Die Stunde da wir nichts voneinander
wussten (The time when we knew nothing of each other); there is a Brechtian
Macbeth from Katharina Thalbach, Romeo Castellucci's controversial Amleto
about a vanishing Hamlet, and Gunter Kramer's directs feminist Frederike
Roth's new play. Major productions continuing this year's European
love-affair with Spanish theatre include: the musical Zarzuela], Lorca's
Blood Wedding in a Romany version; a Thomas Langhoff Calderon premiere, and
the Flemish Need company's drama about Hemingway and Spain, Invictos, which
can play in four different languages.
WARSAW
September 18 - 27
Rynek Starego Miasta 27, 00272 Warsaw. Tel/Fax 22-310607
Despite Poland's acute economic and political problems, the Warsaw Autumn
Festival remains one of Europe's premier contemporary music events.
Stockhausen will be present this year to supervise three evenings of his own
music. Henze, Kagel, Birtwistle, Donatoni and Penderecki are also
represented. The Matrix Ensemble will perform Michael Finnissy's Vaudeville,
and Elgar Howarth conducts a Ligeti orchestral concert.
WEXFORD
October 22 ' November 8
Theatre Royal, High Street, Exford, Ireland. Tel: 0353 53 22144
The world's most convivial and adventurous opera festival continues this
year in classic form, with three well-contrasted choice from the favoured
out-of-the-way repertory. The Comedy of Errors by Stephen Storace, Mozart's
associate, plays in repertory with Mascagni's Piccolo Marat and Marschner's
historically important 19th century rarity, Der Vampyr. Also dotted into the
schedule: concerts by the cream of Wexford's young singers.
ZURICH
May 29 - July 7
International June Festival, Praesidialabteilung der Stadt Zurich, Postfach,
CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland. Tel 1-221 2283 Fax 1-212 1404
The focus is on Brazil, a theme better suited to photographic exhibitions,
literary readings and film than music. There is a sprinkling of Villa-Lobos
and some little-known 20th century Brazilian composers, but otherwise the
music programme goes its own way, with a new staging of Capriccio at the
Opera House, some starrily-cast repertory performances and a concert line-up
including Anne-Sophie Mutter, Yuri Bashmet and Maurice Andre.

AIX-EN-PROVENCE
July 13 - 31
Ancien Palais de l'Archeveche, 13100 Aix-en-Provence, France. Tel (16) 4217
3434
Only three full opera productions this year: new stagings of Don Giovanni
(with Andreas Schmidt) and The Rake's Progress (with Jerry Hadley and Dawn
Upshaw), and a revival of last year's smash-hit Britten Midsummer Night's
Dream. But opera is by no means everything at Aix. The pleasures of this
festival have quite as much to do with the well-devised concert series (with
its short 'Une heure avec' recitals by rising singers, longer ones by more
famous ones, and big choral events in the cathedral) - and with the place
itself, of course, a beau ideal among festival locations.
ALDEBURGH
June 11 - 28
High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk IP15 5AX; 0728 453543
Aldeburgh remains the quintessential English festival, suffocatingly so to
some tastes. The joint artistic directors Steuart Bedford and Oliver Knussen
have reinvigorated it of late, managing to do what seemed impossible a
decade ago, given Aldeburgh an existence and character that fulfil its
duties to the memory of its founding genius Benjamin Britten, yet strike out
on fresh paths. This year's highlights include a promised recital by
Sviatoslav Richter, while the Borodin Quartet and the Dutch
conductor/composer Reinbert de Leeuw are in residence; there is the premiere
of John Tavener's opera Mary of Egypt, new works by Knussen and Alexander
Goehr, and a staging of The Beggar's Opera given, naturally enough, in
Britten's own realisation.
AVIGNON
July 10 - August 3
Le Festival d'Avignon, Bureau du Festival BP 492, 84073 Avignon
Avignon is one of the many festivals gripped by Spanish fever this year.
Highlights should be Lluis Pasqual's two productions Le Chevalier d'Olmedo
by Lope de Vega and Los caminos de Federico, a composition of Lorca texts.
Alain Maratrat's musical Zarzuela] Historia de un Patio comes here after its
visit to the Vienna Festival; the French-Spanish text is by
champion-translator Jean-Claude Carriere, who did La Tempete for Peter
Brook. There is also a French version of Cervantes' Le Siege de Numance and
Pier Paolo Pasolini's play Calderon.
BATH
May 22 - June 7
Linley House, Pierrepoint Place, Bath BA1 1JY. Tel: 0225 463362/466411
The 1992 Bath programme could be categorised, unfairly, as enjoyable rather
than essential. No special infusion of festival-planning imagination seems
to have gone into the mixture of chamber-music programmes (with the Takacs,
Endellion and Lindsay among the quartets, Donohoe, Ousset and Lupu, among
the pianists, Dmitry Sitkovetsky and song recitals by Brigitte Fassbaender
and Stephen Varcoe) and orchestral concerts (including a Wells Cathedral
Gerontius conducted by Charles Groves). The once-proud Bath tradition of
contemporary music events has dried up: Capricorn (May 25) and the Nash
Ensemble (May 31) providethe trickle.
BAYREUTH
July 25 - August 28
Kartenburo, Bayreuther Festspiele, Postfach 100262, D-8580 Bayreuth,
Germany. Tel 921-20221
Placido Domingo's Bayreuth debut - in the title role of Parsifal for just
two performances - is a publicity coup for the festival in a year with no
new productions. Another debutant is Scottish conductor Donald Runnicles, in
charge of a revival of Wolfgang Wagner's innocuous 1985 production of
Tannhauser. Sinopoli returns to conduct Dieter Dorn's cool, intellectual
1990 staging of Der fliegende Hollander, and the Barenboim-Kupfer Ring has
its fifth and final year - with Anne Evans and Deborah Polaski sharing
honours as Brunnhilde. As far as Parsifal is concerned, many will happily
forego Domingo for the chance to hear the exciting Danish tenor Poul Elming
in the first three performances.
BERLIN
May 15-31
Berliner Theatertreffen, Budapester Strasse 50, 1000 Berlin, Tel (30) 254
890.
Hundreds of productions compete to be among the dozen invited to this annual
theatre showcase, so the quality at Berlin is always inspired. The exciting
prospect this year is the early modern revivals which hark back to Berlin's
heyday: opera director Ruth Berghaus' production of Brecht's Jungle of
Cities, Georg Trakl's Bluebeard, Barlach's Blue Boll, plus plays by Isaac
Babel and Sean O'Casey. Also marked in the choices this year is the
introspective shift in German culture: in 1991 there were only four German
authors; here there are nine. They include Botho Strauss with Schlusschor
(Final Chorus), a flamboyant play about German unity directed by Luc Bondy,
and Buchner, whose Woyzeck is reworked as a parable about 1990s adaptation
and aggression at the Volksbuhne in east Berlin.
BERLIN
September 2 - 27
Berliner Festspiele, Budapester Strasse 50, D-1000 Berlin 30, Germany. Tel
30-254890 Fax 30-254 89111
Czechoslovakia and middle European culture are the dominant themes of this
year's festival, which opened with the world premiere of Aribert Reimann's
new opera Das Schloss, based on Max Brod's dramatisation of Kafka's novel.
The concert line-up includes Czech repertoire conducted by Abbado, Rattle,
Muti and Haitink, all with the Berlin Philharmonic. Libor Pesek will conduct
the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and Jiri Belohlavek is bringing the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra. There will be a special focus on contemporary Czech
composers. Other unusual events include Sian Edwards conducting Frank Zappa,
and a Berlin SO concert featuring four members of the Sanderling family as
conductors and soloists.
BREGENZ
July 21 - August 23
Bregenzer Festspiele, A-6901 Bregenz, Postfach 311. Tel: (5574) 4920 228
The opera festival at the Austrian end of Lake Constance has won itself an
enviable reputation for the artistic seriousness and imaginative boldness of
its response to the requirements of both place and tourist audiences. The
big popular shows - this year, Carmen - take place on the stage floating in
the lake, with spectator seats tiered on dry land; in the nearby indoor
theatre there are modern stagings of rarer fare - this year, Berlioz's
Damnation of Faust in Harry Kupfer's production. At its best, a Bregenz
visit proves unforgettable. Also on the schedule: dance, theatre, and
concerts by the Vienna Symphony. BRNO
October 1 - 11
Brno Festival, Radnicka 10, 602 00 Brno, Czechoslovakia. Tel 5-27151 Fax
5-23671
There are still a few east European festivals which have not yet succumbed
to western commercialism, and which provide ample reward to those willing to
veer off the beaten track. Brno is one of them. This rugged Moravian city is
closely associated with Janacek, and this year's festival includes a new
production of The Adventures of Mr Broucek. But the main focus is on early
and baroque music. Brno's excellent local choirs will perform sacred music
by Zelenka, and there will be a staging of La rappresentatione di Anima et
di Corpo, a dramatic allegory by the late 16th century Italian composer
Emilio de' Cavalieri. The festival also pays centenary tributes to Honegger
and Milhaud, and includes a strong dose of contemporary Czech and Slovak
music.
BUXTON
July 15 - August 2
Buxton Opera House, Buxton SK17 6XN
The recent record of this once-promising opera festival has been dismal:
skimpy stagings, only middlingly cast and conducted, of operas requiring
much higher levels of expertise. The lovely spa town and its jewel of a
theatre deserve better. This year, Handel's Agrippina (directed from the
harpsichord by Roger Vignoles) and Rossini's Italiana in Algeri (conducted
by Jane Glover, the new festival artistic director, with Jean Rigby in the
title role) look more promising, on paper at least. Other events include
Schubert recitals by Ian Partridge, Benjamin Luxon and Sarah Walker.
CHELTENHAM
July 4-19
Festival Box Office, Town Hall, Cheltenham GL50 1QA; 0242 523690
Had it taken its courage in both hands in the 1970s, Cheltenham could have
established itself as the leading British festival for contemporary music.
But it didn't, and has subsequently spent too long trying to be all things
to all publics without really getting to grips with any of them. There has
been more shape and sense of purpose in the last five years - stronger
themes, higher profile events. Switzerland is the link this year, with good
helpings of music by Honegger, as well as works by Goetz, Holliger and
Martin, and performances of many of the piece commissioned by Paul Sacher
for his Basle Chamber Orchestra. But other birthdays are being celebrated
too - Hugh Wood's and Alexander Goehr's 60ths, Richard Arnell's 75th, and
the centenary of Howells.
DRESDEN
May 23 - June 8
Dresdner Musikfestspiele, Postfach 6, O-8016 Dresden, Germany. Tel 51-459
4040 Fax 51-459 3738
This is the first year that Dresden has merited a place on Europe's festival
map. The city's musical past is celebrated in operas by two Dresden
composers - a new staging of Weber's Der Freischutz and a production from
Stockholm of Johann Gottlieb Naumann's Gustaf Wasa. Other rarities include
Una Cosa rara by Mozart's Spanish contemporary Vicente Martin y Soler, and a
Polish production of Britten's Curlew River. The attraction of the concert
programme is a series of recitals in the newly-restored court palaces and
country houses in the region surrounding Dresden. For those able to find
accommodation (hotels still being in short supply), the city itself provides
such a fascinating study of historical reconstruction, botched Communist
town planning and delayed modernisation - with quaint gas lamps still lining
some residential streets - that no festival-goer will be disappointed.
DROTTNINGHOLM
May 22 - September 24
Drottningholms Teatermuseum 'Forestallnigar', Box 27050, S-102 51 Stockholm.
Tel: 08 660 82 25
After a period of retrenchment, the festival at the tiny 18th-century
Swedish court theatre has this year increased the number of performances - a
boon for all those who up to now have despaired of encountering the
Drottningholm miracle at first hand. This year's repertory includes stagings
of Salieri's Falstaff and Gluck's Orfeo (in the rare Parma edition, with a
soprano Orpheus) plus a new pastiche-style ballet on Beaumarchais's Figaro,
a visit from the Bavarian Chamber Opera with Hasse's Artigiano gentiluomo,
and concert performances of both Haydn's and Gluck's Armida operas.
EDINBURGH
August 16 - September 5
21, Market Street, Edinburgh, Tel 031-225-5756). Fringe: 031 226 5257
The Edinburgh Festival has a new director, Brian McMaster, formerly in
charge of the Welsh National Opera. He inherited an empty cupboard and a
deficit, and his first Festival necessarily looks threadbare at the edges.
There are no major overseas opera and drama companies visiting Edinburgh,
but the programme could be popular with the public. And there is always the
Fringe to offer excitement and variety in spades, plus the Film and TV
Festivals which overlap with the main festivities. Edinburgh at Festival
time remains the most artistically vibrating place in the world.
Music: There are four main themes to this year's Festival and two are
musical - the music of Tchaikovsky and a retrospective of Scottish music
stretching back to the 8th century Celtic chants. in honour of St Columba.
There will be at least 30 performances devoted to Tchaikovsky, including all
his symphonies and piano concertos. There will also be lesser known works
like the Cantata Moscow, and a concert performance of the opera The
Oprichnik. There will be three performances of the double bill commissioned
by the Imperial Theatre of St Petersburg from Tchaikovsky - the ballet The
Nutcracker, choreographed for the innovative Adventures in Motion Pictures,
and the opera Yolanta sung in English by Opera North.
The season of Scottish music culminates on September 5 with the Scottish
premiere of James MacMillan's Percussion concerto performed by Evelyn
Glennie. Other musical highlights include a double bill of opera written for
solo voices - Elisabeth Soderstrom singing Poulenc's La Voix Humaine and
Claudio Desderi Cimarosa's Il Maestro di Capella, and an opening night
concert performance of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron, with Willard White and
William Cochran.
Theatre: The two dramatic themes of the festival are the works of the
Glasgow born playwright CP Taylor, best known for Good and And a Nightingale
Sang, and of the great Edwardian playwright Harley Granville Barker.
including his masterpieces, The Voysey Inheritance and The Madras House.
Among the visiting companies are the National Theatre of Bucharest, with
Andrei Serban's trilogy of Ancient Greek plays, and Els Joglars from
Barcelona.
Dance: This year the festival is rather more enterprising - and modern  -
than heretofore in its offerings. The Spanish flamenco star Cristina Hoyos
will be seen with her troupe at The Playhouse, August 17-20. At the King's
Theatre, Pina Bausch and her Wuppertal Dance Theatre will show Cafe Muller
between Sept 3 and 5. Mark Morris will appear at the King's Theatre with his
Dance Group in two programmes that give a comprehensive view of this
fascinating creator: between August 18 and 20, his acclaimed version of
Purcell's Dido and Aeneas will show him as both Dido and the Sorceress, with
these roles sung by Della Jones; on Aug 22, 23,24, the Morris company will
present a triple bill of dance works: A Lake, Ten Suggestions, and Gloria.
On August 26, 28 and 29, a new version of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker will
be seen in a double bill with his opera, Yolanta. The Nutcracker will be in
a new version by Matthew Bourne, choreographer and artistic director of the
post-modern troupe 'Adventures in Motion Pictures', which will be augmented
to provide the dance cast.
Art: The visual arts have been the poor relation of the Festival in recent
years but for 1992 the Scottish National Portrait Gallery is presenting a
major retrospective of the work of the 18th century portrait painter Allan
Ramsey; at the National Gallery, an exhibition of Dutch art, including works
by Rembrandt, Vermeer and Hals; and Joan Miro sculptures at the Royal
Scottish Academy.
GLYNDEBOURNE
May 2 - July 23
Glyndebourne, Lewes, East Sussex BN8 5UU. Tel: 0273 541 111
This is the last season in the old theatre, before the massive re-building
programme gets immediately under way: for that reason it starts and finishes
a fortnight earlier than usual. Andrew Davis, the Glyndebourne musical
director, conducts two eagerly awaited shows: Trevor Nunn's new production
of Peter Grimes and and Graham Vick's of Queen of Spades. Cos fan tutte,
Jenufa (with the magnificent Anja Silja back as the Kostelnicka) and Death
in Venice (with Robert Tear) are the revivals.
HELSINKI
August 18 - September 6
Helsinki Festival, Unioninkatu 28, 00100 Helsinki, Finland. Tel 0-659688 Fax
0-656715
This year's theme is the Baltic Sea, with special focus on composers from
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and a 'Baltic marathon' concert by three
orchestras. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the 75th anniversary concert of the
Finnish Musicians Union, and other well-known Finnish artists taking part
are Leif Segerstam and Matti Salminen. The programme also includes a concert
performance of Die Frau ohne Schatten, Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio
and recitals by Natalia Gutman, Kathleen Battle and the Emerson Quartet.
HOLLAND
June 1-30
Holland Festival, Kleine-Gartmanplantsoen 21, NL1017 RP Amsterdam; 31 020
627 6566
Visitors to Amsterdam have difficulties with the Holland Festival. Its
events are scattered through June, and unless your time and resources are
limitless, it is hard to sample more than a fraction of the events on offer.
Much of the interest is operatic, and contemporary opera this year at that,
with the second-ever production of Nono's Prometeo and the Dutch premiere of
the latest instalment of Stockhausen's Licht cycle, Dienstag. There's also a
concert performance of Schreker's Der Schatzgraber and a visit to the
Concertgebouw by the Montreal Symphony under Charles Dutoit.
The Festival will also celebrate the 35 years of Hans van Manen's
choreographic career in programmes by Nederlands Dans Theater
(Muziektheater, Amsterdam, June 2,3,5,7; Dans Theater, The Hague, June
6.9.10.11.12); by Nederlands Dans Theater 2 at the Stadsschouwberg,
Amsterdam on June 12,13,14; and by the Dutch National Ballet at the
Muziektheater, Amsterdam on June 18 and 20.
HOHENEMS
June 12 - 28
Schubertiade Hohenems, Schweizer Strasse 1, Postfach 100, A-6845 Hohenems,
Austria. Tel 5576-2091 Fax 5576-5450
This small Austrian festival is known chiefly for the quality of its
recitalists, as well as for its huge contingent of British Schubert-loonies.
Andras Schiff will give a cycle of Schubert piano sonatas, Brigitte
Fassbaender will sing Winterreise and Andreas Schmidt tackles Die schone
Mullerin. Other recitalists include Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Alfred
Brendel, Margaret Price and Olaf Bar. Visiting quartets include the
Cherubini and the Emerson. Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra in a Schubert symphonic cycle.
LONDON, THE PROMS
July 17 - September 12
Promenade Concerts Ticket Shop, Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 2AP; 071 823
9998 (telephone bookings from June 8)
Though Russian music seems specially favoured and Haydn is healthily
represented, there are no special themes for this year's Proms, just what
seems on paper an unusually rich selection of orchestral goodies. As usual
the BBC's own symphony orchestra takes on the main burden of the concert
giving, but the roster of foreign orchestras boasts the Vienna and St
Petersburg Philharmonics, the Cleveland and the Concertgebouw; visiting
conductors include Boulez and Abbado, Rostropovich and Rattle. Opera
performances bring Boris Godunov from Opera North and The Queen of Spades
from Glyndebourne, while Rossini's bicentenary is celebrated by, of all
things, an evening of jazz arrangements. The new works look particularly
promising - commissions from Holt, Casken, Dillon and Sawer as well as
premieres of Goehr, MacMillan, Tavener and Takemitsu.
LUCERNE
August 15 - September 9
Lucerne International Music Festival, Postfach, CH-6002 Lucerne,
Switzerland. Tel 41-235272 Fax 41-237784
Of all European festivals, Lucerne has the most impressive line-up of major
orchestras - the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonics, the Royal Concertgebouw,
the St Petersburg and London Philharmonics, the Dresden Staatskapelle and
the Orchestre National de France. Giulini and the ECYO open the festival
with Beethoven's Ninth, Anne-Sophie Mutter will play a new violin concerto
by Wolfgang Rihm and there will be a series devoted to Les Six, including a
staging of Poulenc's Les mamelles de Tiresias and a performance of
Honegger's Christoph Colomb. Among the novelties introduced by incoming
festival director Matthias Bamert are a street music competition and an
improvisation concert. The lake paddle steamers, mountain railways, Alpine
views and Lucerne's clean efficiency are a permanent attraction.
LUDWIGSBURG
May 16 - October 4
Kartenburo der Ludwigsburger Schloss-Festspiele, Postfach 1022, D-7140
Ludwigsburg, Germany. Tel 7141-949610
Ludwigsburg, near Stuttgart, has a castle, theatre and church providing an
undisturbed atmosphere for music. This year's programme features Rattle and
the CBSO, Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, and a host of
prominent soloists, including Murray Perahia, Marilyn Horne, Nigel Kennedy
and Andreas Schmidt. There will be concert performances of Cos fan tutte
(conducted by John Eliot Gardiner) and Verdi's I masnadieri, a radical
staging of Die Zauberflote, and performances by ballet companies from
Stuttgart and Dusseldorf.
MONTPELLIER
July 13 - August 1
Le Corun BP 9214, 34043 Montpellier Cedex 01 Tel: 6702-0201
Montpellier, the Radio France festival, devotes itself to revivals of
off-the-beaten-track operas, interestingly chosen and cast, and interspersed
with a broad mixture of symphonic programmes. The 1992 offerings include the
original version of Aida (ie shorn of dance music added for Paris) and, in
concert form, Sacchini's Oedipe a Colonne, Puccini's early Edgar,
Franchetti's Cristofor Colombo and the premiere of Philippe Hersant's
Chateau de Carpathes.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Hospital talk - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY prove a handicap to Radio 4's new eight-part Thursday-morning
documentary The Hospital that its characters are real people - David
Loughton the actual Chief Executive, a real Sister, Maggie Kitchen, real Dr
Juan Valle, even a real patient Clara Johnson. Life in hospitals has become
almost as popular in our entertainment as football, but The Hospital cannot
attach adventures to Mr Loughton, Sister Kitchen and so on, like people in
The Archers (though 85-year-old Ms Johnson did have a fit on her way her
X-ray).
The Hospital, an in-depth study of Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry, is
strictly realistic. Some staff even wear tiny tape-recorders to record the
daily talk. The Chief Executive explained why the hospital has opted out;
later we heard some opposition shouting in a debate. Sister Kitchen was the
unhappy individual to sort out the shortage of beds.
The first programmes chiefly introduced some of the staff, but if Nurse A
loves Doctor B, we shall not know; such things are not for this series. Work
was only lightly dealt with. The patients are less sympathetic than the
staff, who seem optimistically caring, even when they must deal with people
like the businessman who said that he always felt out of breath when under
stress, even if he weren't really. I was on the side of the young women who
read out some of the standards they were expected to maintain. 'I wish we
could do all this,' one of them said.
Nothing about the hospital broadcasting system, if they have one. By ten
o'clock last Sunday evening, the patients should all have been asleep, so
they would have missed the unexpectedly fascinating Radio 2 Arts Programme,
celebrating the 150th anniversary of Arthur Sullivan, the one associated
with WS Gilbert. Naturally it included some choice G&amp;S bits; but it also
gave parts at least of the In Memoriam overture, the Tempest suite, the
cello concerto, Pineapple Poll, Thespis, a piano transcription of the
wedding march for the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), and of course
(this was Radio 2]) The Lost Chord.
The cello concerto and the Tempest music (more completely) were also in
Radio 3's morning Composer of the Week. There we had bits of Cox and Box,
Trial by Jury, Pinafore, Iolanthe and Ruddigore too - and some of those bits
are first-class music. I am specially glad, though, not to have missed Radio
2's actual Sullivan reminiscences.
If Sullivan is a great classical composer, why not Alan Ayckbourn as a great
English playwright? In 1956 I heard his Mr Whatnot, where half the dialogue
is in mime; 'They'll all write it off,' said that clever critic Philip
Hope-Wallace, 'but there's something there.' On Sunday Radio 3 gave us Man
of the Moment, a sad, sensitive story written as if for farce, with very
much there.
Briefly, bank-clerk Douglas (Jon Strickland) had, 17 years ago, attacked Vic
(Peter Vaughan), who was robbing the bank; and Vic shot Nerys, a pretty girl
colleague to whom Douglas was hopelessly devoted. Vic served nine years in
gaol, then became a television star, successful and arrogant. Meanwhile
Douglas had married Nerys, her face badly marred by the shot.
A television feature, Their Paths Crossed, brings them together in Vic's
smart Spanish villa. The intolerable Vic so insults his children's nanny
Sharon that she tries to drown herself in his pool; makes no effort to save
her, but his decent wife Trudy has inflamed Douglas just enough to prompt
him to push him in, and Sharon drowns him. The rest of the play shows how,
under the director Jill (Lia Williams, splendid), the fatal events are so
reorganised, televisionwise, that all ends without trouble. Gordon House was
the director.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Jewels in the St Petersburg crown - Cartier has jumped
on the historical bandwagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU were a Russian Archduke, or the wife of an American magnate, and
wanted a trinket to celebrate the New Year, 1890, you had a wide choice of
international jewellers to call on.
You might visit Boucheron or Chaumet, Faberge or Cartier. All these names
still exist in some form but only one, Cartier, has managed to maintain, and
build on, its historical pedigree. On Wednesday it unveiled an exhibition to
tingle the nerves of reactionaries everywhere  - a display in the Hermitage
in St Petersburg of 200 examples of its artistry, including jewels
commissioned by 19th century Russian aristocrats.
As a timely reminder of the Russian rush into the past, the body of
Vladimir, the Romanoff claimant to the Czar's throne who died recently in
the US, awaits interment in the city. He cannot join his forefathers in the
vault of the cathedral of St Peter and St Paul until the authorities drill a
hole through the concrete that the Soviets laid down in certain expectation
of no more Romanoff burials.
There might be a feeling that the people of St Petersburg currently want
more down to earth imports from the West - food perhaps or drugs - rather
than exquisitely crafted moustache trimmers or the Duchess of Windsor's
panther brooch, but such a view insults their pride. Shortages are seen as a
passing phase as Russia returns to its creative past in which jewels played
a major part. Having dispensed with 20th century heroes it they are putting
their trust in Faberge, or rather on his reputation, to restore prosperity
to their city. Already jewellery craftsmen are setting up to revive the
links.
Indeed there was some feeling that a Faberge show, planned for later this
year, had been elbowed out of the Hermitage by the Cartier display. There
was always a close friendship, amounting to rivalry, between the two firms.
Cartier was bowled over by Faberges designs in 1900 and copied his work on
enamels, perfecting strident colours as against Faberge's more muted
originals. It is thought that some of Cartier's pre-1914 jewels incorporated
work made by Faberge craftsmen.
Today Faberge's name is mostly associated with fragrances while Cartier had
managed to maintain, and to build on, its reputation. The exhibition in St
Petersburg is a brilliant, if expensive, promotional coup. If all goes well
Cartier might be selling to rich Russians around 2010, but having the seal
of approval of the Hermitage, the Palace built by Catherine the Great to
house one of the world's finest art collections, lifts Cartier's brand name
from a supplier of baubles to rich women to the creator of museum quality
artifacts.
It follows on a similar show, including many of the same jewels, in Paris in
1989. The bandwaggon moves on to Japan next year. Cartier's eyes are fixed
on the Metropolitan Museum in New York. If it can get in there the cynical
marketing message will have well and truly got home - buy a Cartier jewel
and you are acquiring the patina of the past, a name approved by museum
curators, rather than a cleverly assembled gathering of depreciating gem
stones.
Cartier has managed this because, in the early 1970s, it decided to
establish an archive of its past work and designs. Through selective buying
it has assembled around a thousand items, insured for Dollars 34m. Some of
its purchases were bargains - like the Duchess of Windsor bracelet, passed
over at the Sotheby's auction when prices were inflated, but acquired later,
when they had fallen sharply. Some were not - like the Dollars 2.3m it paid
for the Daisy Fellowes jewels.
The Hermitage exhibition, which lasts until June 21, covers the great period
of Cartier, from the 1860s to the 1930s. In the earlier decades Russians
were among the firm's best customers. They have a great love of gems,
derived from their own mines and from trading with the East, and they took
the finest stones to Cartier in Paris to be converted into jewels.
Unfortunately few pieces made for Russian clients are on display. So many
have been lost, the jewels broken off and sold since the Revolution.
The Cartier family left it late to visit Russia, 1904, by which time Faberge
dominated the scene, so there are few objects with a definite Russian feel.
The influence of Faberge on Cartier's output is marked, although the two
firms avoided a head-on clash: Faberge specialised in animal designs while
Cartier stuck with flowers.
Cartier will not do copies of its museum pieces - they would never look
quite right. Nor does it use many ideas from the archive. But the Cartier
exhibition, although it may be a clever marketing exercise, also presents a
more than decent show.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Drawn from the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent / Visit
the inaugural show in the Uffizi's new galleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAS THERE ever a more spectacular display of 15th century drawings? In what
is by far the most impressive exhibition of the year-long festivities in
Florence marking the fifth centenary of the death of Lorenzo the
Magnificent, the Uffizi inaugurates its six new galleries with a show of
some 187 Florentine drawings from the age of Il Magnifico.
The peerless Uffizi holding is supplemented by outstanding loans from the
world's great print rooms and private collections. Despite the insensitive
and all but information-free installation, the result is a rare treat - and
a show that is as revealing of the nature of Renaissance drawing as it is
ravishing to behold.
A great number of the sheets are indeed of exceptional beauty, not least
given the quattrocento Florentine's predeliction for delicate strokes of
silverpoint with white heightening on prepared paper tinted with anything
from amber to deep rose madder, mandarin or brilliant azure. As vivid
witness to the creative process so admired in our own age, these confections
make it hard for us to remember that they were never conceived as works of
art in their own right.
Old Master drawings have never been as prized as they are today. To the 15th
century artist, with rare exceptions, they had no artistic value beyond
their practical function, and certainly no commercial worth. They were
stepping stones to the creation of a finished work, be it - as this
exhibition amply reveals - a fresco, panel, canvas or print, a piece of
sculpture, a church, a candelabrum or even a machine for transporting
pyramids and obelisks.
The show's thematic sections emphasise the working procedure that evolved
into standard workshop practice during the 15th century, from the first,
rapid and experimental compositional sketch to the full-size 'cartoon'
pricked for transfer. It opens with copies made as an essential part of the
artist's training. We find Michelangelo looking to the monumental figures of
Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel, and Ghirlandaio drawing friezes from the
arch of Constantine. In view of the importance of Antiquity to the age of
Lorenzo, what could be a more appropriate first exhibit than Benozzo
Gozzoli's exquisite metalpoint on blue prepared paper after one of the
ancient statues of horse-tamers on the Quirinal?
An eloquent witness to the impact of the classical world on the perception
of the modern is Botticelli's drawing of a youth posed to echo the famous
'Spinario' or pickthorn. This silverpoint is among the reams of nude and
draped figure studies here executed at the dawn of the practice of life
drawing. They represent the first attempts to reproduce accurately the
appearance of man and the natural world. What is so extraordinary is that
there is so little grappling towards formulating a means of expression.
Drawing in Florence seems almost to have been born fully armed for its
challenges - like Pallas Athene out of the head of Zeus.
These sheets are attempts not only to explore the material universe but to
place man convincingly within it. Hence the desire to observe the
interaction of figures, telling gestures and emotions, drapery that
clarifies rather than masks human form, and landscapes drawn from the Tuscan
countryside that brought the sacred mysteries close to home.
Perhaps the most breathtaking sequence in the show is of eight carefully
wrought and boldly lit drapery studies, from Filippo Lippi to Piero di
Cosimo. Lorenzo di Credi finds volume with fine sweeping lines of
silverpoint and heightening. Leonardo's more painterly crisp, angular folds
and deep shadows emerge out of tempera on linen.
The presence of Vasari is keenly felt throughout, both as collector and as
the historian who did so much to promote the notion of a Laurentian golden
age of artistic patronage. One of the most extraordinary sheets here
belonged to the artist: Ghirlandaio's compelling death portrait of a
cabbage-nosed old man drawn in silverpoint and white heightening on rose
pink paper. Have such misshapen features ever been accorded so much grace?
By a peculiar irony, the artist's unflinching observation of the mask of
death was to bear unlikely fruit. If we turn from the drawing to the
artist's double portrait in the Louvre, we find the same old man -
miraculously alive, and with even more warts - being contemplated by his
grandson with the adoration the young accord only to the very old.
To Florentine theorists, 'disegno' (design as much as drawing) was an
instrument of the intellect and imagination. Its techniques and media
evolved to meet new artistic challenges. We find Pollaiolo, for instance,
embracing the obligingly quick and fluent medium of pen and ink to commit to
paper his notion of an unusually vigorous and energetic Hercules wielding a
blazing club to kill the Hydra. Filippino Lippi refuses to be constrained by
the precision of silverpoint, using it with astonishing brio for his sketch
of the litter-bearers for his fresco of John the Baptist raising Drusiana
from the dead. Black chalk was found to possess infinitely subtle tonal
range, the ideal medium for portrait heads. Red chalk, however, was an even
greater pleasure yet to come.
The show allows room for no less than 20 sheets by the fifth-rate goldsmith
and niello artist Maso Finiguerra, explicable only as an indication of the
rarity of drawings surviving from the 15th century. Understandably, it
devotes its last two rooms to Sandro Botticelli and his contribution to
Laurentian culture. Here are some of his remarkable illustrations to Dante's
The Divine Comedy, as well as figure studies, tempera cartoons and panels.
In the 'Adoration of the Magi' executed for Santa Maria Novella, we find the
young Lorenzo along with the elder Medici paying homage to the Christ Child.
What more perfect subject for bankers whose power rivalled that of kings.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: Two Welsh rivers with secrets to tell - Michael
Woods follows the glorious progress of the Wye and the Dee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALLING sun cast a golden light over the the bracken and the recently
mown hay meadows. Grey lines of bleating sheep followed grass ledges across
the steeper slopes and a shepherd on a pony, accompanied by three
tongue-lolling dogs, plodded slowly home.
Below, the silver river wound across the temporary flatness of the valley
bottom, a moment of calm before sparkling downwards once more through a
rapid rocky bed. In spite of the fine weather and the summer holidays, the
early evening Welsh countryside was empty of traffic. I had the road to
myself.
This was the upper Wye valley but it could equally have been the higher
reaches of the Dee, for both rivers share similar beginnings. The Dee first
sees the light of day in the southern part of Snowdonia national park,
leaving Bala lake and flowing eastwards away from the sea.
The Wye bubbles up from the slopes of Plynlimon and it, too, goes away from
the nearest coast in a south-easterly direction. Apart from having only
three letters to their names (it is surprising how many rivers, from the Fal
to the Tay, have short names), these two rivers have much in common.
Both rise in Wales but flow for part of their length into England where they
pass English cathedral cities. In the case of the Wye this is Hereford
where, presumably, there was a crossing-point over the obstacle of the
river.
The busy market area that has grown up there with its broad pedestrian
streets, stone cathedral and small portions of city wall still visible,
notably incorporated in a supermarket, seems to continue to view the Wye as
a nuisance, turning its back on the river and allowing little obvious access
to the water.
At Chester, the Dee is welcomed much more openly for the river was once the
life blood of this important Roman port, bringing trade from the sea long
before Merseyside was thought of. The battle to preserve the channel of this
constantly silting river was a long one, culminating in the canalisation of
the final stretch from Chester to the sea, significantly improving the
drainage of the adjacent farmland. The struggle for the old harbour has been
lost, and it is now the Roodee, the city's race-course.
A water tower stands some way from the Dee in the midst of whose waters it
was constructed in 1325. This tower is connected to the remarkable curtain
wall which forms a fine elevated pedestrian route around the city and can be
joined and left at any point in either direction.
It led me from the car park to the river where I found a busy waterside
scene. Swans and ducks came for bread, small boats were for hire and there
were regular trips on the large ones. A little downstream is the weir over
which flows a glittering but carefully regulated amount of river, for the
Dee is used as an open pipeline to bring water from the wet Welsh mountains
to Liverpool.
Particularly in their lower reaches, both rivers form boundaries, not only
between counties but between England and Wales. And both have their secrets.
Tucked away in the hills, along narrow lanes and up a steep drive, I
discovered Celyn Vale Nurseries, devoted entirely to the growing of gum
trees. The owner planted them originally to shelter his own land and
discovered that these fast-growing evergreens, if raised from progeny
growing naturally in the mountains of southern Australia and Tasmania, did
well in the Welsh countryside. Now their interesting, if ecologically
dubious, silver green foliage adorns this Welsh hillside.
In turn, the Wye has its chair bodgers, hardly a fitting name for members of
an historical craft, who hide themselves away in woods near Newbridge on Wye
and run open-air courses for budding bodgers.
Unlike those on the Dee, very many of the Wye towns and villages have
included the name of the nearby river in their own. Ross-on-Wye, which
occupies a commanding position on river cliffs practically overhanging the
water itself, is English, while most of the rest are Welsh. Hay-on-Wye,
though, would have you believe that it is entirely independent. This
so-called book capital of the world contrives, in a rather antagonistic way,
to declare itself a separate kingdom, which I felt gave an otherwise
pleasant town an unhappy atmosphere.
I much preferred the straightforward nature of the riverside notice at a
nearby village which read: 'Fishing only by permanent inhabitants of
Glasbury - unless with the prior permission of Major De Winton.'
The Wye, rejuvenated in the steeply-wooded Wye Valley, has Tintern, a
now-ruined testimonial to the efforts of monks of old. The Dee, as befits a
river flowing in the industrial north, has a more modern but still working
monument to man's ingenuity, the huge canal aqueduct near Llangollen.
In a trough of cast-iron over 1,000 ft long and built in 1795, the Ellesmere
Canal is carried over the River Dee whose brown tumbling waters rush over
rocks some 125 ft below.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: France in creole form - James Henderson
philosophises on a Caribbean beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAT and the glare of the Caribbean sun begin to play tricks on your
mind after a while. As I lay on the beach, the sea loomed at me in a surreal
blue and an outsize pelican wheeled in the sky.
And then it struck me - the absurdity of existence] After years of tittering
at existentialism, could it have finally happened? Being and nothingness on
the beach? Don't be ridiculous, I thought. Yet what more fitting place for
dreamy French philosophical ramblings than Martinique, traditionally the
heart of the French Caribbean?
France always had a more thorough-going attitude towards colonisation than
the British. Martinique has the strongest attachment to the metropole, as
mainland France is known. The best and worst of France seems to be there in
creole form: the bands of municipal strimmers, the well-dressed coquettes -
and that infuriating pout when they are refusing to help you.
The Martinicans are traditionally a bit more conservative than their
confreres in other islands. They also have something of a superiority
complex, which derives from their history as the senior French island,
through which all business with the metropole was conducted. The principal
port, St Pierre, was known as the Paris of the Lesser Antilles because it
followed French fashion so closely. The dou-dous (douces cheries) of
Martinique, mulatto girls of French and African descent, were famed as the
prettiest in the area.
A telling moment in the Martinicans' history came with the French
revolution. The ideals of liberte and egalite could hardly tolerate slavery.
But the royalist planters of Martinique preferred to call in the hated
English rather than lose their ascendancy.
Not so in Guadeloupe, the other large French island, which lies 100 miles or
so to the north. Here the patriotes gained the upper hand and the slaves
were freed. Today, Guadeloupe is a departement with the same status as
Martinique, but it has always had a slightly more detached feel about it.
One of my favourite Caribbean beach bars is on the north coast of
Guadeloupe: Chez Francine is a log cabin with covered terraces lined by
sandy walkways, set in a garden of banana and bougainvillea, all shaded by
coconut palms. The view is superb, particularly as the sand turns golden in
late afternoon light.
Lying in a hammock in scenery like this is a time-honoured pastime here.
There is something about the climate which seems to encourage it. In fact,
the Carib and Arawak Indians, who lived here before Columbus arrived,
actually invented the hammock.
Francine herself disturbed me from my reverie as she rode up through the
trees on a mountain bike, followed by her loping dog. Her hair was
straighter than most Guadeloupeans' and her eyes were slightly pinched -
characteristics of the Caribs, she told me.
Over soursop milk and accras (codfish batter balls), we chatted about
aphrodisiac cookery and about Guadeloupe and the metropole. Perhaps it was
the Carib in her, but she found it difficult to feel a national identity
with France.
As the sky darkened, the tree frogs began to peep rhythmically on the cool
air. And with them came one of the Caribbean's only afflictions: sandflies.
They are so small that you can barely see them, but they pack an infuriating
itch, from your ankles to your knees. Francine spun the top of a rum bottle
and told me to rub some into my legs.
St Barts, France's smallest but probably best-known Caribbean island, only
watched the Revolution from the sidelines because it was not French at the
time. It was on loan to Sweden for 100 years, in return for a warehouse in
Gothenburg.
Today St Barts is a classic Caribbean playground, as only the French could
conceive - neat and very chic. Here, tanned beauties idle by in only a
nuance of a bathing suit and their pig-tailed boyfriends tame the flightiest
windsurfers; in the evening they repair for dinner a deux and jazz. The
requisite transport on St Barts is a mini-moke or a Suzuki four-wheel drive;
wherever you are, they seem to be zipping by. You can tell a hip place by
the 150-yard line of them parked nose to nose.
And there is not much in the way of philosophy to be found in St Barts,
either, except a thoroughly 20th century pleasure principle. Thus it was
that I was chattering with Chantal, champagne flute in hand, high on a
balcony above Gustavia, the town.
Chantal was a stylish nymphette - knee-length shorts and earrings that might
have doubled as tennis racquets - and she was a Bartheleminoise of only two
months' standing. She was really from Lyon. She was out there helping to run
a dive- shop. We stood listening to Gerschwin and Cole Porter and she
pointed out one or two of the celebrities that St Barts seems to collect.
To be honest, they were lost on me, but then the drink was having its
effect. Besides, I was beginning to fear another attack of the absurd, this
time brought on by a huge earring that was threatening to swing round and
hit me. Slightly dazed, I headed for my hammock.
Getting to the French Caribbean from the UK involves a change of aeroplane:
Air France flies to Martinique and Guadeloupe daily from Paris.
In Martinique stay at the Novotel Diamant (tel: 596-764242) or the Auberge
de l'Anse Mitan (885999) on the beach; in Guadeloupe, Le Hamak (590-885999)
or the lower-key Toubana (882557); in St Barts, there is hilltop luxury at
the Francois Plantation (590-277882), the new Ile de France (276181) on the
beach, or the fun of La Banane (276826).

FT  16 MAY 92 / Motoring through France: Coping with the autoroute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time my wife and I drove to the south of France we went in our VW
Beetle. It took the best part of three days, with two overnight stops.
If nearly three days seems a long time to get from Calais to Le Lavandou,
remember that in the early 1960s there was virtually no autoroute in France.
Most of the N-roads (routes nationales) had changed little since Napoleon
had lined them with plane trees to shade marching troops from the sun.
Stretches of cobblestones were still in place which is why French cars were
noted for their soft seats and resilient suspensions.
Driving through France on the autoroutes is now so easy - and even the
cheapest family-type cars so good - that a determined driver can make the
700 miles (1125 kms) from Calais to the Mediterranean in a single day. But I
would not recommend it. For a solo driver, more than 12 hours at the wheel
almost non-stop has to be fatiguing. And for the unfortunte passengers, a
feat of endurance. They are, after all, supposed to be on holiday, too.
Before anyone reaches for pen or phone to tell me how they have driven from
Calais to the Mediterranean in ten hours or less, I would say this.
You may (like me) have got away with cruising naughtily at well over 100 mph
(160 kph) on the autoroute in the past but you are unlikely be so lucky
today. Enforcement of the 81 mph (130 kmh) limit that drops to 110 kmh or 68
mph in wet weather grows stricter by the month, as speeding Britons are
finding to their considerable cost.
Quite apart from the on-the-spot fine, remember that the delay while the
police do the paperwork (and where was your grandmother born, monsieur?)
will ruin your average speed anyway.
So where to stop overnight? Assuming a mid-morning Dover-Calais crossing,
Avallon is convenient. It is almost at half distance between Calais and,
say, Marseille.
Which hotel? As you will be spending your own money, not a company's, try
the Relais Fleuri. Leave the A6 at Avallon, take the first right after the
peage and in three minutes it is on your right. We discovered it about 15
years ago. Our usual Avallon hotel, the Chapeau Rouge - not expensive, even
though the restaurant used to have one star in Michelin's Red Guide - had
been going downhill. It was time for a change. Relais Fleuri, a simple motel
with a restaurant in an old farmhouse, was cheap, comfortable and
convenient. Now it is twice the size, no longer so cheap (about Pounds 75
for a double room and dinner) but still fair value. Be on the road by 9 am,
do not linger over lunch and you should be in good time to dine anywhere
between Narbonne in the west or Menton in the east.
This assumes all goes well on the autoroute. It probably will if you avoid
weekend travel, especially on the Paris-Lyon A6 and Lyon-Marseille A7,
between mid-July and the end of August. They become so congested that rush
hour travel on our own M25 London Orbital motorway seems quite tranquil by
comparison.
What about the dreaded Paris peripherique? It is often, but not always, a
thrombotic ordeal. A north-south driver can dodge some of it by leaving the
A6 just after Charles de Gaulle airport, taking the A3 and joining the
peripherique at porte de Bagnolet. On a good day it is then only 15-20
minutes to porte d'Italie and the easily missed slip road for the southbound
A6 to Lyon.
If you have great confidence in your navigator, miss the perepherique
altogether by going from the A3 to the A86 and then the N186 which connects
with the A6 just north of Orly airport. Be sure to have a good map such as
Michelin's spiral bound motoring atlas of France. I would not cross the
Channel without mine - or its companion, the Red Guide to French hotels and
restaurants.
The good news is that from June 19 it will not even be necessary to take the
busy A1 and A6 autoroute for most of a fast drive to the south. The
long-awaited missing link in the A26 between Chalons and Troyes is due to
open that day.
This lightly used autoroute joins the A5 near Langres and continues south as
the A31, by-passing Dijon and connecting with the A6 at Beaune. Think of it
as a French equivalent of the M40 extension, which lets people like me reach
Birmingham from south of the Thames without going near the M1.
The 202 miles (325 kms) of the A26 from Chalons to Calais via Reims must be
one of Europe's easiest drives. Returning from Geneva a couple of months ago
there was so little traffic from Reims onward that I set the cruise control
at 140 kph (86 mph) - just a wee bit over the limit  - and left it untouched
for more than an hour. Try doing that on any British motorway.
I have no favourite stopover in the Champagne country but recommend lunch or
dinner at La Terasse in Epernay. It has just one knife and fork in Michelin
but a three-course tourist menu of good quality is stylishly presented and
costs little more than a decent pub lunch in Britain. Going to Epernay means
leaving the autoroute but I reckon La Terasse is worth the detour.
French motorways are really quite civilized even if driving behaviour on
them is sometimes anything but. There are frequent stopping places with loos
and picnic tables. At the big service areas you can eat pretty well.
Britain's motorway restaurants lost their greasy spoon and
chips-with-everything reputation long ago. But I still look forward to lunch
at a l'Arche or a Court Paille cafeteria on the autoroute more than I would
at a similar place on a British motorway.
You pay a toll to use French motorways, except those around big cities like
Paris. At the moment, driving a car from Calais to Marseille costs FFr284
(about Pounds 30) in tolls, more if you tow a caravan or trailer. A credit
card like Visa or Access does nicely at the peages.
But why rush down to the Mediterranean as quickly as possible? A more
leisurely journey by N and D (departmental) roads will prove it really can
be better to travel than to arrive.
The main and minor roads of France carry much less traffic than their
English (though perhaps not Welsh or Scottish) equivalents. Most of them are
very well surfaced. Signposting is easy to follow once you get used to the
idea that an arrow pointing to the left or right may actually mean you go
straight on.
You will save on tolls but spend a lot more time and, of course, more on
overnight accommodation. But who knows? Thirty years from now you may
remember every detail of your slow trip to the Mediterranean. The quick ones
you may prefer to forget.
If you are taking your car across the English Channel by the short sea route
from Dover to Calais. P &amp; 0 and Sealink Stena have their best ships on the
run - superferries almost as big as ocean-going liners.
Use club class if you are not going to eat and consider a few pounds extra
worth spending to be able to read the papers and drink coffee (both free) in
the peace and quiet of a nicely furnished lounge.
Hovercraft (from about 35 minutes) are faster but that is about the only
thing in their favour.

FT  16 MAY 92 / America's Cup: Know-how sets up US triumph / Analysis of the
reasons why Italy's sailors look certain to founder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN optimism about winning the America's Cup evaporated 14 minutes into
Thursday's race. Il Moro di Venezia had started in a favoured position, to
windward and slightly ahead of the US boat. As the two yachts drag-raced off
to the left of the course, America3 pulled gradually ahead. No wind shifts,
no tactics - just pure speed. Goodnight, Venice.
America3 went on to lead by 24 seconds at the weather mark and scarcely
faltered in marching to a winning margin of 1 min 4 secs. It put the team
built by energy tycoon Bill Koch 3-1 up in the series. Until that crucial
moment after the first quarter-hour, there had been some ambiguity in each
of the three previous races.
The initial encounter, last Saturday, was a typical first-day muddle. The
huge spectator fleet of more than 700 vessels was spread across the first
leg of the course, causing race director Tom Ehman to utter the immortal
phrase: 'Anyone between the Il Moro yacht and Tijuana is in the wrong place.
Please head inshore.' Then, Il Moro's skipper, Paul Cayard, made an
uncharacteristic gaffe at the start gun, putting the red yacht over early.
He was 30 secs behind America3 up the first leg of the course, a margin that
scarcely varied during the 20-mile race. Observers drew the conclusion that
the boats had equal pace after America3's cautious victory.
Thrills and spills during Sunday's race again obscured a few vital
statistics. Off an equal start, Cayard was able to push Il Moro fractionally
ahead of America3 as they worked up the beat. The crucial manoeuvre was a
tack right up onto the white boat as it swerved to duck the stern of Il
Moro. Cayard had already given warning that he would use hand-to-hand combat
as a substitute if his boat lacked speed. 'I like it when yachting gets
physical. Perhaps I should have stayed with basketball,' said the San
Franciscan who has been sailing for Italy since 1989.
Twice more in that thrilling race, Cayard poked America3 in the eye to stop
it getting past. As they ran in shoulder-to-shoulder at the first leeward
mark, he turned Il Moro sharply towards the US yacht. Obliged by Rule 38.1
to avoid a collision, helmsman Buddy Melges at the wheel of America3 turned
too abruptly and collapsed the spinnaker across the mast, slowing the 75 ft
boat to a crawl. At the finish, where the two-second margin was the closest
in America's Cup history, Il Moro achieved its victory only because its
gigantic white spinnaker billowed across the line ahead of the Americans.
'It was kind of harrowing sitting there waiting for three minutes while the
race committee decided who had won,' said Cayard.
These dramatics, far from amateur, gave further scope for the wishful belief
that the Italians had a competitive boat. An accountant's analysis, however,
would have shown that they threw everything including the kitchen sink at
opponents who, on that day, were unable to mobilise their own capacity.
Race three provided a big win for America3, yet the validity of the result
was obscured by a decisive Cayard misjudgement at the start. With a big
left-shift to the breeze imminent, he opted for the penalised right side of
the course. He said later he knew almost immediately it was a mistake; but
being so far to the right, and the entire quarter-mile length of the start
line away from America3, exaggerated the effect of the shift. 'I decided on
the wrong side and then I invested heavily. Like buying into the stock
market in October of '87. It was Black Tuesday,' he added.
With the series at 2-1 to the Americans, the bald scientific truth - that
Koch's Dollars 75m (Pounds 42m) programme, drawing heavily from US military
and space know-how, had produced a faster boat - was still obscured by
drama, sentiment and kidology, the traditional side orders at the America's
Cup banquet. The main course, however, is always a fast boat. 'Boat speed is
a science, sailing is an art,' Koch has said often over the past few months
in San Diego. He has used the axiom to pacify those romantics who criticised
his juggernaut programme, bristling with scientists and researchers. What
Koch has not added is that the former will nearly always defeat the latter.
Any European nation planning to spend the cost of a brace of warships on an
America's Cup challenge should pause for a history lesson. Since the Second
World War, the Americans have won 44 races in these best-of-seven contests,
the foreigners just eight. To become the 28th defender of the Cup, Koch
admitted to pouring 10 per cent of his net worth into this campaign. When he
won the first race of the final - not the cup itself, mark you - Koch set
off a Dollars 50,000 firework display that evening in the garden of his home
adjoining the San Diego Yacht Club.
When Italians want to obscure the cost of things, they quote sums of lire
with so many noughts that calculators short-circuit. Nevertheless, the
Montedison chemicals and plastics conglomerate is willing to break
commercial cover and own up to spending 'in excess of Dollars 60m' on its
sponsorship of the five-boat Il Moro di Venezia programme. Montedison
celebrated its victory last Sunday over America3 with up-market full-page
ads.
Any analysis of the 1992 cup produces one stark conclusion. Of 10 syndicates
involved, the two that spent the most money finished up in the final.
Critics said it had simply become a wallet contest. Perhaps it had been so
since the first race in 1851; anyway, arguments about cost are nothing new.
Harold Vanderbilt spent so much on his 1937 Ranger campaign that it became
an issue in the US presidential election.
A harder question to answer in 1992 is whether the stakes are now so high
that a willingness to play is prima facie evidence of a shocking lack of
financial judgment. Will the cup become solely the playpen of nautical
egomaniacs with inherited fortunes?

FT  16 MAY 92 / Cricket: Careful Hattersley plays a dead bat - Teresa McLean
talks to a lover of Yorkshire sports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHICH British politician is this being asked about cricket?
'Do you like one-day cricket?'
'I hate it. I can see it's necessary for financial reasons, but it destroys
proper cricket. No player can go from a Sunday afternoon slog to a three- or
four-day game where he needs to work out tactics and play strokes. One-day
cricket is ghastly.'
'Who is your favourite modern cricketer?'
'Graeme Hick. He has class. A fine, high-class batsman.'
The answer is Roy Hattersley, who was a batsman himself before politics
stole him. Having started as an opener and slip fielder, he went on to be
captain, No 6 batsman and patroller of the third man boundary for Sheffield
City Grammar School. He played some cricket at Sheffield University.
I bet he played all his strokes with proper style. He is a conservative man,
deeply loyal to his upbringing or, as he put it, 'a very tribal person.' He
has always admired batsmen with perfect technique and was anguished to hear
a cricket coach a while ago advising Hick to adopt a more open stance.
'Imagine, advice like that . . . to a batsman like that.' We shook our heads
quietly for a moment, in regret.
Hattersley's childhood heroes were the great Don Bradman and the idol of
every Yorkshire boy in the 1940s, Len Hutton. Tradition for Hattersley does
not just mean technically correct cricket; it means cricket and Yorkshire
combined, with football a fundamental part of this life-giving mixture.
I met Hattersley in his office in the House of Commons, with little cascades
of papers, packets and files all over it, an air of hard work, a desk
covered in letters awaiting replies and a Sheffield Wednesday rosette on the
wall opposite the desk, where its owner can see it at the lift of his head.
A Yorkshire emblem to keep spirits up. At times like this, after Labour's
general election defeat, spirits are bound to be drooping and Hattersley
looked vaguely tired and unbuttoned. Both he and his brisk Scottish
assistant, who guided me through many corridors to his room, then through
many more to the 'strangers' canteen' and the way out, looked a bit
battle-weary.
Nor did Yorkshire cricket seem the ideal topic to cheer a Yorkshireman just
at the moment. On the other hand, it could not be avoided.
'Do you still watch Yorkshire cricket?'
'Sometimes, but it's very hard. I can go to see my mother on a Saturday,
then watch Sheffield Wednesday play football for a couple of hours in the
afternoon. But I can't do that with cricket; it needs hours of watching at a
time.'
'Still, you'll go and watch the Headingley Test, won't you?'
'Oh, I expect so, for a while. But what I want is to watch Yorkshire play
cricket.'
There is a clear sense that Hattersley is only in the south because he can't
help it. Anywhere except Sheffield is away from home and while Yorkshire is
home country, it has some far-flung boundaries, away from the Sheffield
heartland. He will try to go to the Oval Test for a few hours, but if he
does it will be partly out of a sense of solidarity with the 20,000-30,000
people from Pakistan in his constituency (Sparkbrook, Birmingham), many of
whom will be there to support their team.
I asked him if he approved of Yorkshire's new policy of importing players,
like all the other counties, instead of maintaining their long-standing
policy of recruiting only Yorkshiremen. He talked his way from principle to
common sense with good Yorkshire pragmatism, having overcome his doubts and
reservations by talking to the county's players.
'Too often they reached the point of needing to get the last few opposing
batsmen to win, but not being able to do it.'
He discoursed at some length on the subject but the thrust of his argument
was that Yorkshire signed the Australian Craig McDermott because they badly
needed a fast bowler to partner Paul Jarvis. Once they had collected the
required capital and lost McDermott, it would have been stupid not to spend
the money on someone else. That has turned out be the brilliant young
Indian, Sachin Tendulkar.
'Don't let me waffle on all the time,' Hattersley added, looking at his
watch, 'I have to go in 10 minutes.'
I got more personal. It is not easy with Hattersley, who is a polite and
friendly man but, I felt, a slightly impersonal one. He welcomed me with a
big, warm hand-shake, but had a pre-occupied air while we talked.
Nevertheless, when I asked him if he still played cricket, he rewarded me
with a response of real feeling.
'No. It's one of the very few regrets of my life, giving up cricket. But I
wanted either to be very good or not to play at all. I didn't want to be a
fat, old player who should have retired years ago.'
He mentioned his weight and his age several times. He has always been on the
heavy side and enjoyed telling me about playing in a recent charity match at
which he had given advance warning that he would need a very large pair of
trousers. He was delighted to find that the enormous pair of flannels they
produced were far too big for him.
Charity matches are the only ones in which he takes part nowadays, and he
brushed aside any suggestion that he should start playing seriously again.
There is a good House of Commons team, which he described with pride. He
told me it boasts Peter Brooke as one of its distinguished players, but
Peter Brooke, unlike him, never gave up playing. Hattersley's 58 years have
included over 20 without bat in hand and the most he can do now for the
Commons team is tell others of its merits.
I asked him if he could also tell me, as a parting shot, what he reckoned
was the political equivalent of a wet afternoon watching Yorkshire do badly
at Bramall Lane? He could, wistfully. It summed him up.
'Looking back on it, it had a sort of romance, being huddled on the terraces
in the damp, with a few others. The closest to that in politics would be an
early spring dawn on the terrace of the House, after an all-night sitting.
You don't want to be there, but you know you've been in on something.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Travel: Awful intimacy with tablemates worth Dollars 500,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL, Travel Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE DEFINE our horror journeys according to our tastes, said novelist Martha
Gellhorn, whose own definition of what makes a journey wholly or partially
horrible was boredom.
'Add discomfort, fatigue, strain in large amounts to get the purest-quality
horror,' she wrote in Travels With Myself And Another, 'but the kernel is
boredom. I offer that as a universal test of travel; boredom, called by any
other name, is why you yearn for the first available transport out. But what
bores whom?'
One sort of travel that did not appeal to her was grand culture touring  -
the antiquities of Greece, Ethiopia's Coptic churches - with a charming
scholar-lecturer to inform and instruct.
But cruising was just as bad, even though it was a 'super delight' to large
numbers of travellers. 'It bores me even to think of such a trip, not that I
mind luxury and lashings of delicious food and starting to drink at 11am
with a glass of champagne to steady the stomach. But how about the organised
jollity, the awful intimacy of tablemates, the endless walking round and
round because you can't walk anywhere else, the claustrophobia?'
I was reminded of Gellhorn's views on cruising when stepping aboard the
10,000-ton Royal Viking Queen, operated by Royal Viking Line, which recently
made her debut in the luxury category at the tip of the top of the cruise
market. The Queen cost Dollars 86m (Pounds 48m). She takes 212 passengers
and boasts 135 crew, one of the highest crew-to-passenger ratios (1 to 1.6)
in the cruise business. Naturally, she is completely air-conditioned.
She is the cutest little number, a draught of 17 ft enabling her to navigate
small scenic waterways such as the Corinth Canal, or to breeze along the
Guadalquivir river to Seville, the Seine to Rouen and the Thames to the
Tower of London. The Queen was built in Bremerhaven, Germany, and sailed her
inaugural voyage (Palm Beach to San Francisco) a few weeks ago.
Every stateroom on the Queen is an outside suite with 5 ft windows and
panoramic ocean views. Measuring at least 277 sq ft (some are much larger),
all suites have marble bathrooms with shower and bath, walk-in cupboards,
TVs, video recorders, telephones, fridges and personal security boxes. Each
suite, says Royal Viking flirtily, can be stocked with queen-size bed or
twins.
We are talking enormously detailed comfort here. We are talking first-rate
food - sorry, cuisine - in what the marketing folk, bless them, are pleased
to call 'a wide scope of dining options - from romantic stateroom repasts
and casual, poolside snacks to formal, candlelit occasions with fellow
passengers in the sumptuous Royal Viking Restaurant.'
We are talking on-board lectures, part of a programme of 'enrichment
activities.' We are talking whirlpools and a jogging track; a beauty salon
and a health and fitness centre which has an aerobics room, exercise
equipment, steam rooms, sauna and massage; a night club, casino and
'air-conditioned mahogany water taxis' (ship's tenders to you and me) to
transport Royal Viking Queen passengers ashore in the world's 'most exotic
destinations.'
We are talking ship's decks inlaid with polished teak (hand-selected from
timber farms, not ripped from virgin rainforests) and luxurious furnishings,
including tapestries.
We are also talking exceptionally large cruise fares.
Just before the Queen's inaugural voyage, I spent three nights aboard her
cruising prettily from St Maarten to Miami. On the first evening -
presumably on the strength of my brass-barnacled blazer and my Jermyn Street
necktie - I was invited to join a power-dining table hosted by Hans Golteus,
president and chief operating officer of Kloster Cruise, parent company of
Royal Viking Line, who claims that in the Royal Viking Queen and the
(larger) Royal Viking Sun he operates the two best ships in the market.
The luxury category of the world cruise market contains eight ships,
amounting to fewer than 3,000 berths. Royal Viking says it has about 25 per
cent of the UK market for luxury cruise holidays (say 4,000 in total) with
Cunard enjoying the bulk.
According to Golteus, the average daily price paid by US clients for a
two-week cruise on the Queen is Dollars 9,500 per person. In the UK, his
henchmen say the average price being paid by UK clients for cruising on the
Queen is Pounds 9,500 per person for two weeks: apparently, Britons tend to
take longer cruises, and book more expensive accommodation, than their US
cousins.
Could the Royal Viking Queen possibly show a meaningful return on her
Dollars 86m cost? Golteus's reply was charming and convoluted, but the gist
was that, well, yes, quite possibly she could; that the luxury cruise market
is expected to show further significant growth; that Americans are starting
to travel abroad once more, and that the Royal Viking Queen is attracting
rather younger passengers than the Royal Viking Sun (55+ vs 65+). These
passengers' net worth is put at well in excess of Dollars 500,000.
Are you worth more than Dollars 500,000 net and unbothered by Martha
Gellhorn's worries about cruising? I have looked up a few prices for you.
Next Saturday, the Queen leaves Venice on a 14-day cruise to Monaco. The
fares from the UK, including scheduled economy-class flights, range from
Pounds 5,839 (basic suites) to Pounds 10,942 (Owner's suites I &amp; II) per
person. That is: a minimum of Pounds 417 per person per day.
As a matter of fact, the Queen leaves Venice at midnight and arrives in
Monte Carlo at 7am on June 6, so you are really on board for 12 1/2 days and
13 nights: a minimum of Pounds 467 per shipboard day. Or Pounds 875 per
shipboard day if ensconced in one of the Owner's suites, whose dimensions
and appointments you would scarcely credit.
As well as flights, the price includes gratuities for cabin stewardess and
dining room waiters; pre- and post-cruise hotel accommodation (where
indicated), but not hotel meals; all necessary transfers; internal UK
flights.
Not included: shipboard drinks and shore excursions. Single accommodation in
standard double staterooms may be offered, says Royal Viking, at a premium
of 50-100 per cent on the per-person cruise-only fare. The fare for a third
adult in a double suite is the minimum package fare for that cruise. Early
bookers enjoy a 5 per cent discount.
Six of the Queen's cruises before August 22, start or finish in London (eg:
starting July 25, 14 days, London-Copenhagen). After that, jaunts this year
include: October 9, 10 days, Venice-Istanbul, Pounds 4,399-Pounds 8,079 per
person; November 13, 11 days, Mombasa-Capetown, Pounds 6,093-Pounds 8,262;
December 20, 17 days, Singapore-Sydney, Pounds 8,056-Pounds 11,739.
The last word on the Royal Viking Queen can be left to her architect,
Norway's Bjorn Storbraaten. 'When we started designing the ship,' he says,
'we decided to make it without a lot of gold, diamonds and fancy things. We
decided to make a ship that was very friendly, very intimate.' Nevertheless,
he reckons he has created a luxury cruise ship without peer.
Me, I haven't got Dollars 500,000 to rub together, net or gross.
Royal Viking Line is at Brook House, 229-243 Shepherds Bush Rd, Hammersmith,
London W6 7NL. Tel: reservations: 0800-181193 or 071-734-0773;
administration: 071-493-6041.

FT  16 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Eye-catching shapes to put you in the shade
 -Expensive sunglasses are no longer just for poseurs. They are becoming an
essential fashion accessory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME USE them to hide their hangover, some to look glamorous, some to seem
famous and others just to 'avoid having to say hello'. And some people, of
course, even wear them to protect their eyes. We are talking about
sunglasses, the ubiquitous shades without which no Grand Prix race, film
festival or fashionable night happening could take place.
Shades these days are more than just a passing fad. They are part of the
growing essentials of the fashionable person. Ritzy designers worth their
logos turn them out in droves. Men and women no longer content themselves
with a single pair for serious jet-lag or the tropical sun - in fashionable
circles they are bought like handbags, a pair to match the mood and
occasion.
For those who think that shades are only for poseurs, it is worth saying
that this is simply no longer true. The evidence is piling up that, these
days, eyes need protecting from the bad rays of the sun - the UVAs, Bs and
Cs - that are increasingly penetrating the thinning ozone layer. All have
long ago been identified as being harmful to the retina and contributing to
the growth of cataracts. Of all the rays, invisible ultra violet radiation
is the most dangerous to the human eye and, of course, not easy to identify.
For instance, in Namibia, which I have just visited, inside the
characteristic thick morning mist rolling in from the Atlantic shore hover
highly dangerous ultraviolet rays.
So, having agreed that shades these days are more than just a glamorous
fashion accessory when strong sunlight or ultraviolet rays are around, how
do you choose them?
The temptation is to begin with the frames. Thick tortoiseshell from Giorgio
Armani, solid black from Valentino or little round metal ones from Romeo
Gigli? A tempting roll-call but - hold your horses - take a look at the lens
first - most of the big names produce lenses of high optical quality and
lenses is where you should really start.
Daska Barnett, President of the North London Optometrists Society advises
checking on the label to see if a lens is produced to British Standard 2724
 -not easy to do as many, particularly the most fashionable sunglasses, are
imported. Good opticians, however, will give advise and most will not deal
with lenses which are not up to proper optical standards.
The British Standard classifies sunglasses into several categories of which
the most relevant are for:
Cosmetic Purposes (mainly just a fashion accessory, these lightly tinted
glasses will not protect against significant sunlight);
General Purposes (will reduce glare in bright conditions, including driving
in daylight);
Special Purposes (which means they will reduce glare in abnormal conditions
such as sailing and skiing).
Either glass or plastic or glass lenses will do. Plastic lenses can protect
the eyes just as well (provided, of course, they have the UV filter) but
they are slightly easier to scratch unless they are coated. On the whole,
plastic is better for action sports and glass should certainly not be used
unless it has been toughened. Glass is usually slightly heavier than plastic
although it can be made a lot thinner and so is cosmetically better for
those who have a heavy prescription.
Some manufacturers, such as Luxottica, produce lenses of tempered crystal,
making them more resistant to scratching and breakage.
Remember that the colour of the lens has nothing to do with how much UV
protection they provide. If lenses are coloured, but do not protect against
UV rays, Daska Barnett says they are more damaging to the eyes than wearing
no glasses at all. The eye, noticing that it is dark, dilates making it more
vulnerable to the sun's rays, whereas usually in bright sunlight an eye with
no glasses over it uses its own protection system by contracting the iris
and allowing fewer rays to penetrate.
If you have not bought a pair recently you may need to sit down before you
consider the matter of price. A designer name, such as Armani or Valentino
will cost anything from Pounds 85 to Pounds 160, while Yves St Laurent
starts at Pounds 110 and at Cartier, a Pounds 290 price tag, if not de
rigueur, is reeled off without a blush.
A designer name is not just a way of paying a lot of money for something
that could be bought cheaper - designers have to solve complicated
functional and technical problems as well as producing frames and lenses
that give the consumer the image he is after. A canny manufacturer such as
Luxottica needs designers such as Armani and Valentino not just for their
names, but to make sure his ranges are at the forefront of fashion.
Ever since Bausch &amp; Lomb was asked to produce anti-glare glasses for fighter
pilots in the 1930s and came up with the functional Aviator shades,
sunglasses have joined that troupe of accessories that tell the world more
about you than you may wish it to know.
For years Ray-Bans (as they came to be called), Aviator and Wayfarer shapes
were the only frames to wear (they still are perenially, classically
fashionable) but these days the choice is vast.
At Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge store, a snazzy new sunglasses
department has just opened and Daniela Rinaldi, the buyer, tells me the two
current looks are big arms, wide eyes, wide-frames in tortoiseshell  -
Persol, the Italian brand, at about Pounds 99, Cutler &amp; Gross (cats-eyes
shaped, tortoiseshell frame) at about Pounds 70 - and small-round metal
frames (here the lead brands have to be Gaultier, at anything up to Pounds
300, and Romeo Gigli).
Confident extroverts could go for Moschino - lots of cheeky designs like
credit cards and combs on the arms, spots and colour, Dame Edna-style
jewel-encrusted frames, all jokey, fun and slightly tongue-in-cheek at
prices ranging from Pounds 105 - Pounds 185.
Almost every manufacturer these days has to offer its own version of the
shapes now in fashion - little round metal glasses, Jackie O, Grace Kelly,
teamed with Hermes-style silk scarves (think of the Riviera circa 1960 To
Catch A Thief time). For the shapes without the chichi price tags,
Mazzuchelli is a name to look out for - most lie in the Pounds 59 - Pounds
69 bracket.
Serengeti's is a good photochromic range - traditionally fashionable with
toughened glass making them safe. The Aviator shape sells the best in that
range.
For drivers looking for protection, it would be hard to beat the Serengeti
range. Dolland &amp; Aitchison, a chain of some 500 opticians around the UK,
reports that Serengeti is one of its best-selling ranges. Not cheap - prices
range from over Pounds 100 to Pounds 250 - they sport specialised
photochromic lenses. The glass is toughened and the lens is graded in colour
so that it is darker at the top, giving more protection when looking into
setting or rising sun, and lighter at the bottom so that the driver can
still see the dashboard.
Persol, it seems generally agreed, does the best fold-ups at about Pounds 99
but it also has a popular Italian cats-eye style - wide-armed in
tortoiseshell, also at about Pounds 100.
For those who wear glasses all the time, there are two solutions. Clip-ons
were once considered naff but these days they are all part of the look. Dark
clip-ons start at Pounds 5.99 and designs get better all the time.
Best of all for the four-eye set has to be prescription lenses. Dollond &amp;
Aitchison opticians is at the moment offering tinted prescription lenses for
Dollars 59 in plastic or metal frames in reasonably fashionable styles
(including a wide variety of aviator designs). Bi-focals will cost a little
more.
Those who - whisper it quietly - are prone to sweating might look at
titanium frames. These are extremely light and so cause less pressure and
the metal is unaffected by acid in the perspiration. A good range to look at
is one produced by Luxottica.

IN 1851 there were 38,000 shoe makers in London Andrew Lawson's book,
Handmade in London, tells me. Today, I would bet my shirt the numbers were
well under 100. Price and the proliferation of good quality factory-made
shoes has put most out of business.
However, my mail, filled with the cries and whimpers of those with
strange-shaped feet, with bunions and other problems, would seem to indicate
that there is still a need for a hand-crafted bespoke shoe - if only it
could be had at an affordable price. With that most eminent cobbler, John
Lobb, charging from Pounds 995 (plus VAT) for a first pair of shoes and a
usual waiting list of between three to four months, a pair of bespoke shoes
has become a luxury beyond the reach of all but the few.
However, at 4 Paddington Street, just off Marylebone High Street, London W1,
is James Taylor &amp; Son, which has been providing hand-crafted shoes and a
raft of other shoe services since 1857. Prices there are not cheap - how
could they be with skilled labour and fine leathers costing what they do? -
but they offer considerable value for money.
Top of the James Taylor range is, of course, the made-to-measure shoe, not
cheap at Pounds 595 plus VAT, but it is Pounds 400 less than Lobb's. Made on
the premises by craftsmen who use individual lasts and fine leathers from
goats, calves, kids, lizards and sheep, they can, within reason, make almost
any style but, of course, like any fine cobbler specialise in classic
brogues, Derby's and all the rest. Delivery is usually about two months.
There is an intermediate service where measurements are taken and sent to a
factory (John Locke) specialising in traditional fine footwear where they
are made on a standard last that accommodates the measurements as nearly as
possible. This is not, obviously, the same as having an individual last made
to fit just your feet but they find that on the whole most feet can be
happily accommodated.
Delivery of these takes about two months and prices are from Pounds 350 (inc
VAT) for women, and from Pounds 380 (inc VAT) for men. There are lots of
useful ancillary services as well. Besides a range of ready-made shoes
(Crockett &amp; Jones classic men's styles, Finn Comfort walking shoes, Status
Shoes to give more height), James Taylor will alter or adapt existing shoes,
whether their own make or not, and will repair and hand-sew soles or polish
shoes. It will make to measure foot supports for long arches and
metatarsals, raise heels to balance unequal legs and in general do anything
to make your walking life more comfortable.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Food and Drink: FT duo wins food award
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE 1992 Glenfiddich Awards, made to those who have helped raise the
standards and enjoyment of what we eat and drink, the Weekend FT food and
wine page had three of its writers shortlisted.
Jancis Robinson was nominated for drink writer of the year, Nicholas Lander
for restaurant writer (they are pictured below) and Philippa Davenport for
cookery writer.
Our husband and wife team, Jancis Robinson and Nicholas Lander, won the
third category for which they were entered when their television series
Matters of Taste (C4) was voted television programme of the year.
The food book of the year was awarded to Elisabeth Luard for The Flavours of
Andalucia (Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 14.99) and the overall trophy to Claudia
Roden. Roden has written extensively on the cooking of her native Middle
East and her book on Coffee (Penguin, Pounds 4.99) remains one of the most
enjoyable on that subject.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Scales of excellence for fish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WRITING is on the wall: Europe will soon be awash with AOCs, DOCs and
DOGs - government certificates applied to every form of quality food and
drink. It appears to have been the Spanish who first had the bright idea of
taking the Denominacion de origen used for their wines and extending it to
food, but the French were not slow to catch on.
Now Brussels is learning of the pressing need to protect the best Norman
carrots with an appellation controlee. If they succeed, the carrots will
enjoy a similar stature to the best of burgundy or claret. And where are the
British in all this? Simply nowhere. There isn't even a working translation
for appellation controlee.
These thoughts occurred to me as I was tucking into some of the best lamb I
had ever tasted. The lamb came from the Shetland Islands; from a dwarf,
native breed which feeds on seaweed. This gives the flesh a delicacy of
flavour which outstrips even the famous salt-meadow lamb of the Cotentin
Peninsula in Normandy. Yet no one seems to have had the idea of marketing it
elsewhere in the British Isles.
Shetland Salmon is a further case. There are now 59 salmon farms in the
Shetland Islands making what is acknowledged to be the best of all British
farmed salmon.
However, once again there has been no move to integrate the salmon into the
European quality system bar awarding the fish a quality seal on the islands
themselves.
It was indeed salmon and not lamb which took me to the Shetlands. I
accompanied a party of Master Chefs led by their president, the Earl of
Bradford. All the chefs agreed that salmon was too good a seller to be
limited to the wild salmon season; all except one had used farmed salmon
when no wild fish was available; all of them left the Shetland Islands
impressed with what they had seen.
Pretty well all the chefs admitted a preference for wild fish, but they had
reservations: a young grilse was too small and tasteless, while an old fish
caught in the river was of no use at all.
If the quality of farmed fish was never equal to the strong flavour of the
best wild salmon, it was always better than the worst wild fish.
One of the chief problems up to now, however, has been the oiliness of
farmed fish. This oil comes from their feed, which is made up of shrimps and
fish offal and their indolent, idle lives.
With a farmed salmon, Gerald Roser of Rosers in St Leonards told me, you had
to be pragmatic. If it was oily you marinated it and served it as gravad
lax. Martin Lam of London's Escargot agreed, except that he felt the
solution was to grill the oily fish, and grilling accorded well with modern
conceptions of how salmon should be prepared.
The oiliness of the tame salmon, however, may soon be a thing of the past.
Efforts are now being made to lessen the oil content in the feed and to
starve the fish for three weeks prior to slaughter, thus ensuring that the
fish uses up some of its oil.
Tests will determine the oil content so that it will be possible to choose
an oily fish for grilling or the barbecue or a drier fish for poaching.
The oil was also a result of the overcrowding in the pens, the best of which
are out at sea in the Shetland voes or bays. In farms like that of Gibbie
Johnson in Vidlin efforts have been made to give the salmon more room to
swim about. It is still not ideal, however, and a submerged camera shows the
rather miserable fish looking like commuters on the London Underground, only
occasionally rising to the surface for a spirited leap before returning to
the crowded depths.
The fish may feel it's a dog's life, but the system appeals to the many
local otters. John White of the Shetland Salmon Company told me that the
otters managed to get into the pens and take random bites out of the fish
they found too large to lift. They took the smaller fish on to the pen
walkway and there enjoyed an al fresco picnic.
The farms have served the local community. The Islands' population has
dwindled to about 25,000 over the past decades, with many of the crofters
emigrating to New Zealand where life is somewhat less arduous compared to
farming this beautiful windswept archipelago.
First came the oil, then the salmon farms. Now a ghillie working for Gibbie
Johnson earns as much as Pounds 20,000 a year and doesn't risk his life out
on the high seas. An appellation controlee (or whatever you call that in
English) might be a fine reward for the people who have revitalised the
agricultural vocation of this most distant outpost of the British Isles.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Shoppers go for a wholesome option / A look at US
wholefood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'PLEASE, Mommy, can I have a rice cake?' The cry echoes down the wide,
pristine aisles of the Bread and Circus Whole Foods supermarket in Hadley,
Massachusetts.
Other shoppers smile benignly - naturally, kids are welcome at Bread and
Circus. The store even provides miniature shopping carts so that kiddies can
pretend-shop while Mom and Dad do the real thing.
The detail is typical of the family-oriented, wholesome philosophy behind
Bread and Circus, and similar temples of healthy consumerism popping up in
suburbs throughout the US - Mrs Gooch's in Los Angeles, Fresh Fields in
Washington DC, Whole Foods in Texas and the San Francisco Area, and
Alfalfa's in Denver.
The wholefoods supermarket trend combines the current national obsessions
with health and fitness, food safety, and ecological correctness, with the
familiar, self-indulgent pleasure of that most American of entertainments -
shopping.
Bread and Circus operates six stores in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and
is the undisputed industry leader, according to Chris Kilham, whose
Massachusetts-based Cowboy Marketing provides consulting services to natural
foods and natural products companies. 'Bread and Circus standards of product
purity and customer satisfaction are the best in the business,' says Kilham.
For anyone who's spent a Saturday afternoon fighting for the last packet of
frozen peas in a narrow aisle at a UK supermarket, shopping at Bread and
Circus is no less than a revelation. Passing time in the Hadley store is as
soothing as new age music.
The store is uncrowded, the shelves fully stocked, the produce-section
bursting with bright, beautiful fruits and vegetables. Bread and Circus
offers naturally-raised meats, a fresh fish counter, wholesome prepared,
packaged, and frozen foods, as well as cruelty-free health care products, a
florist, and nutrition department.
Fresh-scrubbed young people working behind the bakery counter cheerfully
interrupt their discussion about multicultural college curriculi to recite
the ingredients of any of the baked goods on offer. The friendly woman with
short grey hair in the dairy section offers samples of Bread and Circus'
impressive array of cheeses, and in the cooking demonstration area, tutoring
is available in the preparation of wholefoods breakfasts of kasha and
yogurt.
If all this leaves the shopper weak-kneed and hungry, there's the Bread and
Circus in-store cafe, with an ambiance so pleasant that locals go there even
when they're not shopping to sip cappucino and nibble on whole-grain
muffins. Bread and Circus even provides reading material to browse through
during breakincluding A Guide to the Benefits of Fiber and Every Day Ways to
Greener Living are available from the nutritional and educational consumer
information section, and the book department prominently displays The Bread
and Circus Wholefood Bible.
Shopping at Bread and Circus is an education for those who think wholefoods
eating means a no-fun diet. The wholefoods movement sprung more from concern
for safe food than healthful food: what you get at Bread and Circus will not
poison you, but it will not necessarily make you thin, either. Its cheeses
may be only the purest available, but triple cream brie is triple cream
brie, and the gooey rolls and cakes in the bakery, even if they are baked
with whole-wheat flour, add the same inches as their conventionally-prepared
counterparts.
Natural foods supermarkets thrive in affluent and educated suburbs; a
whopping 80 per cent of Bread and Circus' customers have college degrees.
Shopping at natural foods supermarkets costs, on average, 20 per cent more
than at conventional supermarkets, but experts and shoppers agree that
natural foods supermarketing requires a reconsideration of the notion of
value.
A whole-grain loaf may cost more than an equivalent amount of white' bread,
but that money buys better-quality food that improves the consumer's health.
As the Bread and Circus promotional literature puts it: 'Comparing the price
of our wholefoods with the prices of conventional foods is like comparing
apples with oranges.'
The story behind Bread and Circus has been, until recently, archetypical of
the trade: the store's founders, Anthony and Caroline Hartnett, are natural
foods enthusiasts who still run the privately-owned company. Anthony
Hartnett, born in County Clare, Ireland, became interested in natural foods
by reading an article about macrobiotic cuisine in the London Evening
Standard; his Louisianian wife is a macrobiotic chef.
They opened Green Acres, the first natural foods store in Dublin, Ireland,
in 1972, before they came back to the States to open the first Bread and
Circus in 1975. Bread and Circus is now the largest wholefoods retailer on
the East Coast, with annual sales exceeding Dollars 55m and over 650
employees.
Similarly, Sandy Gooch founded Mrs Gooch's Natural Foods Markets in 1977
when she discovered that it was nearly impossible to find wholefoods in the
Los Angeles area. Mrs Gooch's is now a seven-store chain that takes in over
Dollars 85m a year and employs 800 staff. Mrs Gooch's wholefoods doctrine is
even stricter than Bread and Circus's allowing no chocolate, caffeine, or
alcohol.
A concept this timely could not stay in the family for long. 1991 saw the
opening of Fresh Fields, the first wholefoods supermarket chain founded not
by natural foods zealots but by businessmen, including Leo Krahn, the
75-year-old founder of the Staples Dollars 340m cut-rate office products
chain. Purists scoff at Fresh Fields' unideological stance and lax
standards, but their stores are doing well, further encouraging natural
foods marketing into the American mainstream.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Drink: The gentle giant of Park Avenue - Jancis Robinson
goes to New York to meet the world's most influential wine merchant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US may no longer enjoy its mid-1980s status as the wine world's biggest
spender, but Abdallah H Simon is still the lynchpin of the international
wine trade.
This is not just because he is such an important customer - his Chateau &amp;
Estate Wines Company sells up to 40 per cent of America's imports of fine
wine, notably classed-growth bordeaux - but also because he is the only wine
merchant to be taking decisions crucial to the world's wine trade with the
benefit of four decades' experience.
A measure of the breadth of that experience is that Simon must be the only
Chevalier of France's elite Legion d'Honneur to be a graduate of England's
Southport College, the University of Beirut, the Iraqi army and, when he
finally managed to escape rising anti-semitism in his native Baghdad in
1943, the US forces in Europe.
It was a seminal bottle of Ch Latour 1929 that propelled him from the family
textile business into the fledgling US wine trade to which he has applied
his business skills for 40 years, 18 of them creating Chateau &amp; Estate, an
empire to his own specifications within America's leviathan of liquor,
Seagram.
Revered by all who matter in America's wine business, he is of course
courted assiduously by some of the world's grandest wine producers. It would
be reasonable therefore to expect a certain arrogance in the man, but from
Bordeaux to the Bronx it is agreed that the softly-spoken 70-year-old Simon
is, above all else, a gentleman.
The US wine trade needs Simon. His honour and old world manners legitimise
it. His warehouses feed it. His salesmen service it. His company effectively
finances its investment in the now all- important wine futures market. (In
many states, including New York, customers cannot be invoiced until the
goods are delivered, which may be two years after wine futures are reserved
 -hence some cancellations, notably of the somewhat stolid 1988s, which have
not smoothed Monsieur Simon's biannual path to Bordeaux.)
But the wine world needs the man himself at least as much as the
corporation's ability to finance two to four years' stock. His contacts in
France are personal and unparalleled. Only a handshake seals C &amp; E's
agreements with the 200-plus regular imports listed somewhat incongruously
in Seagram's corporate Brand Index, from St Emilion first-growth Ch Ausone
to Trimbach's obscure Liqueur de Framboise raspberry syrup.
In New York Ab Simon has additional duties as arbiter, father confessor and
sounding board. 'Don't ask me about him, I tend to get emotional,' says
Marvin Shanken, hard-bitten publisher of the industry's most-read
publications, 'I really love the guy. Whenever I've had controversy as a
journalist, whether he represents the wines himself or not, he's always
given me an honest appraisal.'
Michael Aaron, head of New York's most traditional smart wine merchant
Sherry Lehmann, readily admits: 'If I formulate an idea about something, I
call Ab to see what he thinks. He's a positive asset to the whole industry
because he really understands the whole picture.'
Understanding the whole picture nowadays means much more than being able to
speak French and German and eat with a knife as well as a fork. It means
coming to grips with America's increasingly faddish wine buyers, all of whom
depend on the same two or three authorities to tell them, through
controversial scores out of 100, exactly what to buy. 'Scores? Well, look,'
says Simon 'we're novices in the wine market. Our consumers need to be
guided. And the scoring system has definitely been very good for business.'
American collectors today will buy only those years sanctioned by the
oracles, which means that C &amp; E sold 1.5m bottles of 1989 classed growth
bordeaux, but less than a fifth of that so far of the less-publicised 1990s.
If Ab Simon earned the respect of the wine world by well-publicised efforts
to hold down prices of the 1986s, his most expensive mistake was buying the
overpriced, unloved 1984s in order to keep his allocations with the
chateaux.
That small but vigorous American minority prepared to pay Dollars 20 for a
bottle of bordeaux nowadays has been primed to scorn 1984, which is why C &amp;
E's 1984s (even the fabulous Chateau Petrus of which C &amp; E are given 90 per
cent of the US allocation) are still being offloaded, via French and even
British merchants, into French supermarkets.
Simon has learnt his lesson. 'The 1984s highlighted for us that the US
consumer needs a strong, clear image of a vintage. For that reason we won't
be buying the 1991s, except for taking up our small allocations of the first
growths, because the image of the 1991 harvest is so confused. And the 1991s
are coming out at prices that are too high, higher than the 1987s which are
not exactly selling, as we say, like hot cakes. The 1991 vintage is not for
us in terms of futures and I don't think it is for the US market even after
it has been bottled.' (Take that, Bordeaux.)
He was to communicate all this to Christian Moueix of Ch Petrus over lunch
the next day (he lunches about twice a week at the famous Four Seasons
restaurant just below his quiet Park Avenue office). That night he and his
popular wife, Francine, with whom he always travels, were still hosting a
15-wine dinner for 50 at 11.30. Those of us three decades younger found it
quite punishing.
But Simon says he has no plans to retire, and that last year's heart surgery
should have set him up for many years more. 'I try very hard to do the right
thing,' he claims as his motto. But there are those in the wine trade who
feel that no eventual successor could possibly match his probity - and there
are those who fear an option with very much more serious consequences, that
Simon alone is capable of keeping Seagram's faith in the exceptionally
labour- and capital-intensive fine wine market.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: Asparagus by post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCINDA DE LA RUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING flowers are in their full glory, the afternoons are longer and
English asparagus is being harvested. I look forward to this as much as I do
the first crop of English strawberries. Sadly the asparagus season is too
short - only two months, from May 1 to Midsummer's Day - but somehow that
makes it all the more delicious.
Michael Paske offers us a rare treat of asparagus by mail: fresh asparagus
grown in Cambridgeshire and East Anglia can be sent to you in 1 kilo (2.2
lb) boxes with a choice of jumbo or medium spears, or those very special
thin, delicate ones. The boxes cost Pounds 10.50 each and this includes
postage and packing. If you really want to spoil someone why not send a
basket or small hamper filled with asparagus and tied with ribbons and
decorations together with a message card? This will cost from Pounds 38.
Do not worry about having to eat all the asparagus within a day or two of
delivery because it freezes well after a quick blanch and it is such an easy
option if you are entertaining. Simply steam it for five minutes and serve
with lemon juice, olive oil and shavings of fresh Parmesan. It makes a
delicious starter.
British asparagus is thought to have the best flavour and texture in the
world because the stems grow so slowly in our rather iffy climate. But if
Midsummer's day passes you by, and you find that you are too late for
English asparagus then Michael Paske can send you fresh asparagus from the
US, Chile, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand at any other time of the year.
(Tel: 0400-50449).

FT  16 MAY 92 / Food: An Italian takeover in Japan - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE winemaker, busy restaurants selling their wine by the glass or
bottle are the most effective and obvious way of making new customers. Many
wine makers spend a great deal of time drinking their own wine in
restaurants around the world as a way of promoting sales.
No-one does it more assiduously than Angelo Gaja, the top winemaker in
Barbaresco, Italy, who has seen exports of his wines to Japan soar as the
Japanese have fallen in love with Italian food.
In 1988 there were 72 Italian restaurants in Japan; today there are more
than 1,000 and by the end of 1994 it is estimated there could be as many as
2,400.
The quality of these restaurants is very high, too. Gaja confessed recently
that the best Italian meal he has had in the last six months was in Tokyo at
the Ristorante Manin (tel:0120-11-3778) when his menu included risotto with
squid ink, pasta with Japanese mushrooms and stewed ox tail.
Last month the Enoteca Pinchiorri opened in Tokyo (tel: 03-3289-8081)
borrowing its name and style of cooking from the now world famous Enoteca
Pinchiorri in Florence with Giorgio Pinchiorri, the owner of the Florentine
restaurant, acting as consultant.
At its opening dinner to 480 Japanese businessmen, diplomats and journalists
it served a typical Italian menu which included Tuscan squid salad, sea bass
with thyme and olive oil, lobster ravioli and a range of top Italian wines
to match.
                           *      *      *
For originality of concept and design Belgo, a new restaurant specialising
in Belgian food and beers, is hard to beat. In an ultra-modern, basement
conversion the food is good and more varied than just moules and frites (my
waterzooi, a Belgian fish and vegetable stew was excellent), the selection
of more than 20 Belgian beers exciting, and the waiters' uniforms, purple
monks habits with black aprons, unforgettable.
It is open all week from 12 noon to 11pm, 72 Chalk Farm Road NW1. Tel:
071-267-0718. Bookings taken on the day only. Approx Pounds 20 per head.
                           *      *      *
News of two new London restaurant openings and three going out off their way
to attract new business.
Stephen Bull has opened his second restaurant, a bistro and bar, at 71 St
John Street, EC1 (071-490-1750) and Antony Worall-Thompson has moved on to
dell'Ugo, a multi-layered Italian bar, cafe and restaurant at 56 Frith
Street, W1 (071-734-8330) with a particularly interesting menu.
The Inn on the Park, W1, (071-499-0888) has responded to the recession by
sharply reducing margins on its wine list and Al San Vincenzo, at 30
Connaught Street, W1, (071-262-9623) is replacing its set-price-only menus
with a no-minimum-charge policy to attract more diners more frequently.
Martin's, at 239 Baker Street, NW1, (071-935-3130) has been refitted as a
bar and bistro serving three courses at around Dollars 20 per head.
                           *      *      *
The 1992 Andre Simon Memorial Award for the best food book of the year went
to Arabella Boxer and Tessa Traeger for A Visual Feast (Century, Pounds 20).
Oz Clarke took best wine book of the year award for New Classic Wines
(Websters/Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 19.99).
A special commendation went to John and Sally McKenna for their Irish Food
Guide (Estragon Press, Pounds 9.95). The McKennas have just produced three
new more detailed guides to Ireland for 1992 - 100 Best restaurants, 100
Best Places to eat in Dublin and 100 Best places to stay in Ireland (Pounds
4.99 each).
                           *      *      *
Prisoners Abroad is a charity which cares for the 600 British people
imprisoned overseas. One of its supporters is also a collector of fine wines
who has donated a wonderful range of bottles for a special wine dinner to be
held on June 29 at Shampers, Kingly Street, London W1. The wines include
mature vintage champagne and white burgundy, magnums of Chateau Leoville Las
Cases 1981, and bottles of Montrose 1971, Lafite 1966, Domaine de la Romanee
Conti Richebourg 1982 and Dow 1963. There are 16 places available at the
dinner and interested bidders should phone Mark Astarita at Prisoners Abroad
(071-833-3467) who is hoping for offers of a minimum Pounds 100 per place.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The rush to beatify an impatient saint: The controversy over
a campaign by the secretive Roman Catholic group Opus Dei to make its
founder a saint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE arcane process of beatification has become the subject of an unseemly
controversy.
Tomorrow, before an expected crowd of 200,000 pilgrims, who have travelled
from all over the world to St Peter's in Rome, Pope John Paul II will
beatify Msgr Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer, the founder of the Roman
Catholic movement, Opus Dei.
In so doing the Pope will place his seal of approval on the life and example
of this Spanish priest from Aragon who died in 1975. He will also confirm
the secretive Opus Dei movement as one of the most powerful forces in the
contemporary Catholic Church.
Beatification makes a person a saint and is the final step before
canonisation which guarantees a place in paradise. Canonisation can proceed
quickly or take centuries. But beatification automatically draws a cult of
sanctity.
The cult of sanctity around Escriva has aroused both extreme devotion and
deep suspicion. The crowds of devotees who have come to Rome to venerate his
corpse attest to his popularity. But his beatification has upset many
Catholics, not least among the Jesuit community who mistrust Opus Dei's
conservative bent.
Critics say he is being beatified with undue, even offensive, haste. Corners
have been cut and hostile witnesses ignored by a powerful lobby which fears
Escriva may be viewed differently by another Pope.
Part of the controversy concerns the saint-making process, streamlined by
Pope John Paul II in 1983. This produced the biggest shake-up in the 400
year existence of the Congregation for the Cause of Saints which judges each
case or 'cause'. This Polish Pope believes the modern Church needs fresh
saints to provide new role models for the faithful; and he has done more
than any other pope to create saints from different backgrounds and
different countries.
By 1989 after ten years in office, he had beatified 123 people against a
total of 79 by the previous seven popes this century. At a time of
increasing ecumenicism, this continued belief in the value of beatification
remains one of the greatest divides with the Protestant churches. The
effects of Martin Luther's denunciation of the abuses of the cult of saints
and their relics, which led to the Protestant break with Rome, have not
disappeared.
Equally controversial is the figure of Escriva. Critics say he was too
ambitious, too irascible and too involved with Franco's regime to attain the
'heroic virtues' of a saint. This scarcely squares with the image projected
by his promoters: a combination of spirituality, charity and temperance with
a deep understanding of the problems of coping with a materialistic society.
And in Opus Dei, Pope John Paul II sees an ideal instrument to combat the
decay of religion in industrial societies. It is well organised, discreet,
conservative and rich. It has the funds to help in the re-evangelisation of
eastern Europe. The movement was accorded the unusual privilege of a
personal prelature in 1982, the Pope giving Opus the right to appoint its
own bishops.
Escriva founded Opus Dei in 1928, conceiving it as a group of lay people and
clergy to spread the Catholic word through their daily working lives. He
expected devotees to win converts by example. His philosophy was enshrined
in a book, El Camino (The Way) published in 1939. It is a curious mix of
unoriginal homely aphorisms, common sense advice alongside puritan zeal and
exhortations to success. The novelty of his message lay in the emphasis on
members continuing in their chosen jobs - indeed this was seen as how they
could best serve Opus Dei.
Devotees are expected to contribute from their salaries and to hand over
inherited money, this has created the wealthiest modern Catholic movement
and led to complaints that Opus Dei retains a sect-like hold on its members
alienating them from their families.
Opus benefitted from close links with the Franco regime. This spread its
influence and popularised the view that its members were an influential
free-masonry. Although education was strictly state controlled, Opus was
allowed to open a private university in Pamplona and establish Spain's
first, and still most prestigious, business school in Barcelona. Escriva was
astute in encouraging Opus to 'fish' for future elites in the universities -
a policy it also followed in Latin America.
Opus technocrats were willing to enter government under Franco, and in a
field restricted by the exclusion of liberals and anyone to the left, they
were the best talent available. At least four Opus members were ministers
under Franco and they were instrumental in beginning the liberalisation of
Spanish economy in the late 1950s.
But Opus' financial history has been chequered. The 1962 liberalisation of
banking laws pushed by Opus member Mariano Navarro Rubio was seen as an
attempt to break the monoply of the big banks to allow Opus financiers a
share of the action. The most spectacular financial collapse during the
Franco era involved Opus connections with the textile group Matesa, which
fraudulently obtained export credits. And though denied, it is suspected
that Opus backed the earlier career of Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos, the founder
of the Rumasa banking empire which was forcibly taken over with massive
debts in 1982.
Escriva's sponsors glossed over both the political connections of Opus and
the financial dealings of its members. Of more concern to his detractors are
his personality and ideas. Msgr Luigi de Magistris, one of two members of
the eight-man panel of theological consultors in the Congregation for the
Cause of Saints who voted to suspend the Escriva cause, raised serious
doubts about his humility. He referred to Escriva boasting about depriving
himself of water and his vain-glorious mortification.
Escriva claimed a vacant noble title to become the Marquis of Peralta.
Although this was reportedly done to please his mother, it was a curious
move for a future saint. Maria del Carmen Tapia, an Opus 'numerary' from
1948-66, has just written a book given much publicity in Spain. She claims
he insulted her, had no respect for women and when at table always insisted
on being served first.
He was a man obsessed with what others thought of him, she says. Opus,
insists Tapia, is a sect which even in Escriva's life-time practiced a
fanatical cult of its leader. Tapia, who lives in the US, claims she was
used by Opus to smuggle money from Spain to Italy. She was not able to put
these allegations before the beatification process as she was considered a
hostile witness.
Another unheard hostile witness, Father Vladimir Feltzman, who resigned from
Opus in 1985 after 22 years, says Escriva was ambiguous in his attitude
towards Hitler. He also says the founder of Opus was so upset by the
liberalising trend of Vatican Council II that he flirted with the idea of
allying himself with the Greek Orthodox Church in 1967. Opus spokesmen have
denied this.
Escriva also had antagonistic relations with the Jesuits, the most liberal
arm of the Church. He sacked his Jesuit confessor, Father Valentino Sanchez,
in an argument over Opus.
These criticisms might seem the natural response to a movement which has the
Pope's ear and powerful friends in the Vatican. They also stem from a sense
of unease that Opus represents a return to conservatism in the Church,
overturning the liberalising influence of Vatican Council II.
Mons de Magistris summed up the concerns of many saying: 'It seems to me
totally ill-advised to assume the responsibility of assessing his heroic
virtue at a distance of only 14 years.' He said 'several decades' should
pass to let passions cool.
The 18 volumes of the Bibliotheca Sanctorum list more than 10,000 saints.
Many are early martyrs or were created before the process of saint-making
was formalised. In the eighth century when the rules were imprecise, the
vulgarisation of saints was stimulated by an order that every Church altar
to be a tomb containing a saint's relics. Not until the 16th century, after
the Protestant break with Rome, did the Vatican establish full control with
clear rules.
Over the past 1,000 years, two thirds of all persons beatified have been in
orders, and almost the same percentage have been male. A study in the early
1980s of causes pending, showed that 156 of the 268 adult candidates came
from religious orders and that 65 per cent came from Europe's largest
Catholic countries: Italy and Spain. Candidates from the large European
countries stood a better chance because the religious hierarchies there
understood the saint-making process and have the time to pursue a cause.
Only three popes in the past 900 years have become saints: Celestine V (who
renounced the papacy in 1294), Pius V (1566-1572) and Pius X (1903-1914). As
one Vatican observer said: 'We need good popes, not saints, and popes often
create many enemies.'
A 'cause' must begin with sponsors ready to demonstrate their candidate has
a specific or universal message - or that their lives lives represented a
relevant example to the faithful. Over 6,000 letters backed Escriva's
candidature, including recommendations from 69 cardinals and 241
archbishops.
The 1983 beatification reforms cut the time sponsors had to wait before
submitting a cause from 50 to five years. The next step is to obtain the
Pope's nihil obstat, or formal approval to proceed. This is perhaps the most
'political' phase, reflecting the prevailing climate for the type of saint
preferred.
The present Pope has been cool towards proceeding with the beatification of
Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador who was murdered by right-wing
gunmen at the altar in 1980 because of the latter's identification with
Liberation Theology. On the other hand, he encouraged the cause of
Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish Franciscan monk, who died in the Auschwitz gas
chambers to save a companion. (Martyrs are meant to die for the faith but
the Pope created a new category of martyr for charity).
The nihil obstat for Escriva was given in 1981, six years after his death.
Once passed this hurdle, sponsors must have the funds to prepare a positio -
a sort of theologian's brief comprising a justification for sainthood,
biography and exposition of virtues.
The sponsors can 'angle' their material, the staffing of the tribunals and
the selection of witnesses who give evidence about the 'servant of God'. For
Escriva the main testimony of over 450 pages came from his personal
confessor and heir, Bishop Alvaro del Portillo. Mons de Magistris in his
judgment of the cause said this testimony should be excluded as too partial.
The Escriva Rome tribunal documents weighed 86 kilos. His complete positio,
one of the largest ever, was delivered to the Congregation for the Cause of
Saints in Rome: within seven years of the nihil obstat.
One innovation under Pope John Paul II has been the elimination of the
Devil's Advocate who probed the weakness of a saint's cause in a
courtroom-style confrontation. The Pope's supporters say this removed a
time-consuming ritualistic process. However, the positio is now less likely
to be opposed.
The candidate's tomb is opened for verification and future veneration of the
corpse. (It does not matter if it has decomposed). A group of medical
experts is called in to verify a miracle performed by, or in the name of,
the candidate. The miracle is seen as a 'divine sign' of the candidate's
choice by God. Martyrs do not require miracles before beatification but they
are essential for canonisation.
Almost all miracles relate to unexplained cures of physical infirmities.
(Escriva is credited with the miraculous cure of a tumour on a Carmelite
nun). Advances in medicine and science make miracles more suspect and
difficult to prove; and the Pope has reduced from two to one the number
necessary. The absence of a miracle can delay causes indefinitely.
The sophistication of science and the greater access to archive material
combined with a scepticism about miracles makes the beatification process
more vulnerable.
In this sense, Escriva could become a test case if details emerges that
reveal his life was less than saintly. Kenneth Woodward, an American
religious journalist and author of a study of beatification Making Saints,
warns that there is 'a very real possibility that archive material will turn
up reflecting negatively on the candidate.' He adds: 'The potential
embarrassment to Escriva, to Opus Dei, to the Congregation, to the Pope and
to the Church is obvious.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Hannibal-style habits / Consider the evidence of human
sacrifice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS HUMAN sacrifice a nasty habit or is it deeply rooted in tradition? The
truth is: a bit of both, and archaeology keeps finding new and startling
evidence of the practice where we least expect it. Recently I saw the latest
find, among the foundations of a new hotel at Amathus, near Limassol in
Cyprus. The Phoenicians of Lebanon probably introduced the practice: they
had a long history of human sacrifice, and were a power in Cyprus. But other
stories come to mind, from Greece, from Abraham and Isaac, and that of the
Lindow Man, a well-manicured, upper-class 25-year old who was hit on the
head, garroted and had his throat cut before he was placed in a marsh in
Cheshire as an offering to the Celtic water god. The custom of offering
young humans to a god as gifts is old and universal, but not frequent. It
was best to give one's own child, preferably a first-born male; if he was
not available, a daughter would do, or prisoners of war. In Greek stories
the habit is not common. It was seen as something reprehensible that created
blood pollution, but at times could not be avoided. The tragedians made good
use of it. When the gods deny the Greeks a fair wind to sail to Troy,
Agamemnon, their leader, has to sacrifice his daughter Iphigeneia. His wife
Clytemnestra is furious and has 10 years at home during the siege of Troy in
which to nurture her bitterness. When Agamemnon comes home she hurls snide
fury at him, encourages him into a hot bath and stabs him. The next step is
for their son Orestes to kill his mother, for which he is condemned to
wander in exile, until he reaches the Crimea where he is reunited with his
sister Iphigeneia, and the pollution ends.
It is difficult to find examples of human sacrifice from the 5th century BC
when the tragedians were writing about it. But 800 to 1,000 years earlier,
in the Bronze Age, it was certainly happening. Children were buried under
thresholds, presumably as an offering of first fruits for the prosperity of
house and home. At Knossos in Crete childrens' bones were found a few years
ago with butchery cuts as on animal bones. They are probably the left-overs
of cannibalism, perhaps a ritual to avert a disaster.
The leading sacrificers of the ancient world were the Phoenicians, who
traded throughout the Mediterranean and founded colonies in Sicily, Sardinia
and North Africa. At their settlement at Carthage in Tunisia - Rome's great
enemy - you can see the place of sacrifice, called a tophet, by the harbour.
Here thousands of vases were found, all of the same type, containing burnt
childrens' bones and animal or bird bones. Stones mark the sacrifices.
The victims were placed in the hands of a bronze statue, wrote Diodorus
Siculus, and then dropped into the flames. Relations were forbidden to weep,
perhaps because tears diminished the sacrifice or perhaps rather that they
were inappropriate when it led to a desirable end: the children's
deification. The young blood rejuvenated the god and bound him to the person
who had offered it.
But in 310 BC, after Agathocles of Syracuse defeated them, the Carthaginians
thought they had offended the gods by replacing nobles' children as victims
with children of low birth. When to make amends they decided to offer 200 of
the best, so many noble parents volunteered their young that they had 300 to
choose from. They also sacrificed prisoners of war, 3,000 of them after they
captured Himera in Sicily in 409, and continued these gruesome habits for
centuries, until the Romans defeated them and stopped the bloody business.
The newly-discovered tophet in Cyprus is on the Phoenicians' route to their
western settlements. Now cleared by archaeologists, it looked like a disused
rabbit warren when I saw it last month. Like Carthage, it is by the sea. A
slope runs up from the beach and vanishes beneath the concrete of what will
soon be bedrooms in the Four Seasons Hotel. Five hundred pots were found, as
at other tophets all of the same shape. Originally there would have been
many more.
Children, animals and birds burnt in tophets give poignancy to the story of
Abraham and Isaac.
When they reach the high place on the mountain, Isaac, carrying the wood for
his own pyre, asks: 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?'. And at the
last moment when Abraham has the knife in his hand, God stops him. He may
substitute a ram, a male sheep, caught in a nearby thicket.
The tale leads straight to the theology of the sacrifice of Jesus, God's
only son and also the lamb of God.
If you have booked into the hotel at Amathus and have a room on the beach,
sweet dreams, and sleep well.

FT  16 MAY 92 / As they say in Europe: Exciting times for the Swiss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE EXOTIC, mysterious land at the heart of Europe,' is not a slogan of the
Swiss Tourist Board. Few would believe it because nobody takes the slightest
interest in what is going on there. As a result there is a lack of awareness
of the crisis which grips the country. Tomorrow there is the referendum on
whether it should join the IMF and World Bank.
Switzerland jostles with North Korea and Cuba for the honour of being the
most important country outside the two institutions. If it enters it will be
in the wake of such riff-raff of the international financial community as
Azerbaijan. It would be joining at a time when the IMF is preparing to
bankrupt itself in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the economies of the
former Soviet Union. So why should a supposedly hardheaded banking nation
enter at this juncture?
It is essential, says the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, even though 'Switzerland
needs no credits from the international community to build schools and
hospitals and in the foreseeable future the franc will not be shaken by
deficits and speculation.' That such a prospect can even be contemplated may
shock outsiders but this is by no means shocking to a nation mired in a
crisis of identity.
The same edition of the NZZ used its front page as a vehicle for a study of
where various European countries stood in the post-Maastricht debate penned
by the editor-in-chief, Hugo Butler. The main item on page one of the NZZ is
not necessarily the most interesting topic of the day, far from it. Yet the
article was not without surprising twists.
The headline tried to maintain standards: 'Between economic community,
internal market and political union: Paths and cul-de-sacs in the European
process,' but the agonising over what Switzerland should do about Europe
provided the unexpected. 'The European problem facing Switzerland today is
quite different from that of 1940. At that time it was a question of
sheltering under the spines of the hedgehog and maintaining a free
resistance in the Helvetic Redoubt against Hitler's dictatorial 'New
Europe.''
It is astonishing that anyone ever made such a comparison with 1940. It
seems the conventional picture of Switzerland needs some revision. Let us
begin by returning to that unnecessarily firm denial that Switzerland needs
World Bank money, and imagine that it is a very interesting country.
Today, bookshops there are stacked with thick, best selling tomes with
titles like Switzerland at the Crossroads: The Illusion and the Dilemma.
Whatever the NZZ says, uncertainty runs deep for many reasons. A substantial
portion of national income has been lost through the global war against
drug-money laundering. There has been a savage reduction in the number of
corrupt dictators who kept their hands in the national till and needed a
safe haven to protect the proceeds. There is the Euro-threat to numbered
accounts. The rate of inflation is higher than in Britain and the franc is
weaker than the pound.
The country is plunged in angst. So it was that the biggest Zurich paper,
the Tages Anzeiger, carried a lengthy piece on 'Sullenness, suffering, pain,
misery and disgust' on the city's trams. Jurg Rohrer studied personal
relationships between passengers. The result provides a nightmare picture of
a society in turmoil. 'General sullenness is the normal atmosphere in the
tram. It eliminates the power of speech from the passengers the moment they
enter; as a result there is no conversation on the tram. Sullenness demands
no special cause, merely being in the rattling transport cage with its
clammy hanging straps suffices, even without the dandruff on the nearby
shoulders and the pungent perfume from under them.'
That creates the right atmosphere for the sociological analysis: 'One person
is sitting by the window. Another sits down in the next seat: Why beside me?
The uneasiness which stems from the proximity of a stranger is expressed by
turning the head away, but that brings other problems in its train when the
tram is at a stop and another tram stands at the platform. It appears that
everyone is caught in a frozen stare, for on the other side yet another
stranger sits, thereby threatening eye contact through the windows. So all
heads face sternly forward at tramstops, only to twist towards the window at
the moment of departure. The measure of the unease on the double seats can
be seen in the speed with which the victims flee to any single seat that
becomes available.'
The fear and horror of life on the Zurich tramway system is of course merely
a metaphor for life in contemporary Switzerland. The times are changing.
Even so their fellow middle-Europeans, the Viennese, still sneer: 'Our
central cemetery is twice the size of Zurich, and twice the fun.'

Nezavisimaya Gazeta of Moscow asked the American economist, Igor Berman, to
characterise the state of the Russian economy. 'The situation is hopeless,'
replied the distinguished visitor.

FT  16 MAY 92 / No peace for hippies: Alternative lifestylers love Cork. But
increasingly, the feeling is not reciprocated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENISE HALL

<TEXT>
WEST Cork, in the Irish Republic, has a reputation for peace and
tranquillity; a kindlier way of life. Recently it has begun to attract some
unconventional settlers. Drawn by the availability of small tracts of land,
and the (often mistaken) impression of dole on demand, they have deserted
England for Ireland - and found their prospects equally bleak.
These young, jobless English settlers live in old buses, caravans, or tepees
of the type popular with their 1960s' soul-mates in west Wales's Teifi
valley. But as recession has gained a grip on England, especially, many
native Irish have had to return home - perhaps as many as 25,000 in the past
year. Often, they have no work and little money, swelling further the
numbers who depend on benefits. In rural areas such as west Cork, a
long-term solution to this dilemma is going to be hard to find.
For those alternative lifestylers who do want it, work is near-impossible to
find, particularily in the more remote areas, and dole is no longer the
foregone conclusion many new arrivals imagined it to be.
Recently, a young Englishman living in the Skibbereen area was denied relief
on the ground that he had 'deliberately made yourself unavailable for work
by moving to a rural area.' He believes, however, that the decision was
based more on the way he looks and the fact that he is not an Irish
national. He claims some local officials are showing a growing hostility
towards his kind.
Local people increasingly are uneasy about the numbers of alternative
lifestylers arriving in their area and fear an influx of drugs,
sheep-worrying, by dogs unused to their free-ranging sheep, and an increase
in petty crime. They have the uneasy sense that, somehow, west Cork has
become a Mecca for people with a value system very different from their own.
After a combined police/customs action in Bantry - which many believe was
designed to shake up the new arrivals - a leading solicitor said publicly
that he was 'increasingly concerned about the amount of non-nationals
settling in the area.' It was understood generally that he was not referring
to the more affluent owners of shore-front homes.
'We're used to people who look different, practise strange religions, and
want to live in tents in the woods,' said one Glengarriff local. 'But, just
lately, these people coming in seem to have changed. They don't have the
easy-going attitude hippies had 10 years ago. And some of them are dirtier,
arrogant. They really seem to think the world owes them a living.'
Andy Ridgeway, a newly- arrived alternative lifestyler, says his friends in
England regard west Cork as a great place to live, uncrowded and
undemanding. 'Most of the people I know who have come here are fed up with
the political climate in England. And there's not much chance of jobs there,
anyway. We buy buses, caravans, put whatever money we can raise into
converting them. Then we go on the road, do odd jobs, travel. We can't
afford to buy places or pay rent, so what else is there for us?
'A lot of people I know have been called in on dole reviews, asked why they
came here in the first place, and told they should go back to wherever they
came from. And it always seems to be non-nationals. If we're all part of the
EC now, though, how can they ask people questions like that? And what would
happen if they started throwing Irish people off the dole in England for
similar reasons?'
If living in a rural area is to be accepted as valid grounds for denial of
benefit, it is not only non-nationals who could be in trouble.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Serene in Africa's Camelot - Nicholas Woodsworth takes a
train ride to the Cape Town of his youth and finds little has changed around
Table Mountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRAIN that trundles southwards out of the Adderly Street station every
half-hour or so has not changed in 25 years. Its carriages are still a dull
rust-red. They still smell of heated metal, faint perspiration, and the
fresh, salt tang of air blown in through open windows. Their seats, a
rubbery blue vinyl, still stick to the back of the legs on hot February
days.
We are capable of blurring events which occured only yesterday, but there
are childhood images and memories, retained randomly, which keep their
definition forever. For me, rattling through the leafy suburbs of Cape Town
not long ago, this train was full of such memories.
The last time I rode down the curving scythe of the Cape peninsula I was a
12-year-old in shorts, navy blazer and school cap. More often than not these
trips were frantic races against the clock, panicky executions of prep not
done or last-minute crams for impending Latin tests.
But on this particular morning I was anticipating a rather different kind of
test. I had changed. Had Cape Town changed? Would I, after an absence of 25
years, be able to recognise the place I had grown up in? In the life of some
cities, a quarter of a century is no time at all. But after a political ice
age, South Africa is undergoing daily, dramatic transformations. The train I
was sitting in had changed not at all. What, I wondered, lay on the other
side of these station platforms?
                         *       *      *
If I was somewhat hesitant and confused about what change is bringing to
Africa's most beautiful city, it was partly because Capetonians themselves
are currently in the same state of confusion. After more than 300 years,
they are prepared to admit, just about, that Cape Town is an African city -
not the historic starting point of white, colonial expansion northward, but
the end point of a vast continent, culturally and racially diverse, that
sweeps southwards.
This is a new view. Not far from the railway line, on the slopes of the
sharp peak flanking Table Mountain, is the city's memorial to Cecil Rhodes.
Here, escorted by eight bronze imperial lions, stands the statue of a
mounted rider who stares with determined confidence, out across the Cape
Flats, to some distant goal far up the length of Africa. Dedicated to the
man who dreamed of creating a white dominion stretching from the Cape to
Cairo, the statue is named, simply, 'Energy'.
After decades of national division, violence and deep moral malaise,
Capetonians seem finally willing to let the spirit of Rhodes rest. Like most
other white South Africans, they see the inevitability of finally
accommodating themselves to the continent they live on. The energy of white
enterprise in Africa may still direct them, but the determined confidence is
gone - today they look to the future with a great deal of uncertainty and
soul-searching.
Perhaps more than other whites, they fear the risk of loss, for until now
the Cape has offered them a life quite unlike that found elsewhere in South
Africa. Two factors - history and climate - make it unique.
Cape Town is an old city. Some 300 years ago, when Dutch colonists first
confronted local Hottentot and Bushman tribes here, it may have been on the
cutting edge of events. But since then the frontier, and history, has moved
on; the great tides of conflict that have swept over South Africa - black
against white, Boer against Briton, Xhosa against Zulu - have risen and
fallen time and again on the high veldt far to the north.
Without a large black population forcing confrontation and change, the city
has usually sat on the sidelines of the country's dramas and crises. Its
largest group, more than 1m South Africans of mixed race, live in the
townships of the Cape Flats and seem hardly to intrude on the life of the
peninsula. It is Cape Town's 300,000 whites who have created and enjoy its
affluent, privileged life-style.
Genteel and old-fashioned, dignified and somewhat aloof, the city today is
like a great aunt who has found a chair in a quiet corner of the drawing
room. From the calm of the Cape peninsula she can observe, without becoming
too deeply involved, the brash and unseemly behaviour of her younger cousins
in the Transvaal and Natal; it is Johannesburg and other volatile cities,
she knows, that will argue out the future of the feuding family that is
South Africa.
For her part, she carries on concocting what she has always has - the good
life. In politics her white electorate, far from the centres of tension and
conflict, can afford a liberal vote, and worry far more about recession,
unemployment and rising crime than the prospect of a black president.
Politics, in fact, is not really what interests this city at all.
Held in thrall by a balmy Mediterranean climate and a stunning maritime
topography, Cape Town tends, rather, to a sensual, outdoors view of life.
Along the 45-mile length of the Cape peninsula Nature conspires to prove,
whatever evidence exists to the contrary elsewhere, that life is rich,
generous and pleasurable. Capetonians are only too ready to believe. They
flock to the peninsula's beaches, cycle its mountain roads, roam its
fragrant forests and vineyards, sail its surrounding oceans.
With the massive bulk of Table Mountain looming over sidewalks in the very
centre of the city, this is a place where beauty is unavoidable. If
Johannesburg worries about the price of gold and Pretoria fusses over the
minutiae of administration, that is their problem. What preoccupies Cape
Town is cricket, the ambient water temperature off Clifton beach, and the
prospects of buying decent sausage for next weekend's braai, or outdoor
barbecue.
                         *       *      *
To me, wandering about the city's southern suburbs, Cape Town's essentially
hedonistic character seemed to have changed little. Beyond the railway
platforms, I found myself once again in a Capetonian version of Camelot, an
idealised, suburban England moved far away to a sunny, affluent antipodes.
In Newlands, I walked past ivy-covered houses set in well-manicured gardens.
The trees were still as shady, the swimming pools as turquoise, the BMW's as
well polished a they had ever been. Not even the clubby laughter and the
leisurely thock . . . thock . . . thock sound of tennis in the fresh morning
air had changed.
In Rondebosch I visited my old secondary school; cheesecutter hats, the fag
system and caning still make Tom Brown look like a contemporary there, but
what are these inconveniences compared to the joys of a long and glorious
rugby tradition? In Kenilworth, I sat in a pew at Christ Church, listening
during choir practice to the same Anglican hymns that I had mumbled my way
through there.
Taking myself off through the winding lanes, elegant estates and white,
Dutch-gabled farmhouses of Constantia, I met former schoolfriends, the sons
of wealthy professionals, who are now wealthy professionals themselves. It
seemed one generation had simply taken over from another.
Had nothing changed at all? Physically, there are few dramatic alterations
to life in Cape Town so far. A small number of the faces under those
cheesecutters are now black. In the high-rise suburb of Sea Point,
better-off mixed-race and Indian families have begun buying property. In
some of the less expensive restaurants and bars in town there is a
scattering of non-white patrons. The places where different races can and do
mingle are limited - where apartheid is no longer operative money is, and
shall continue to be far into the future.
None the less, such minor transformations are signs of enormous shifts in
attitude and willingness to change. Where other places have been pushed
forward struggling, Cape Town has stepped more or less gracefully. If there
is uncertainty and doubt about the future, there is also a good measure of
hope.
Sitting at Claremont station, waiting for the train back to the city centre,
I talked to a young woman with little money, background or education, but a
great deal of ambition. In a class of eight in her secretarial course at
night school, she was the only white. A few years ago she would never have
attended such a course, much less admit that she enjoyed the company.
More liberal, under less racial strain, and benefitting from a relaxed
attitude to life, Cape Town stands a better chance of success in the new
South Africa than her sister cities. Like the train of my memories, the city
has hardly changed, and the destination of a non-racial society remains a
great distance off. But the passengers now at least seem willing to chance
the ride.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: Euphoria over the Euphorbias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S Chelsea flower show offers a crash course on an intriguing
plant: the euphorbia. Oxford University's Botanic Garden is sending a
special exhibit to instruct us in the 'frogspawn bush' and its thousands of
cousins.
Euphorbias or spurges have a long history. According to Pliny, Euphorbus,
court-physician to King Juba of Mauretania, made use of the latex they
contain for medicinal purposes. Euphorbias have also been used for making
furniture cream and waterproofing. North American euphorbias have proved a
sensationally fast emetic, and Indian euphorbias go into making fireworks.
For years euphorbias have been known to gardeners as an exceptionally
valuable and varied foliage plant - although not one to everyone's taste.
They provide eye-catching tints of acid yellows, oranges, blue-greys, pinks,
and burgundy, at any level from the rock-garden upwards. The most
eye-catching features in many a herbaceous border at present are massive
clumps of Euphorbia characias, waving their lime-green heads at
shoulder-height.
Timothy Walker, superintendant of the Oxford Botanic Garden, is known by his
staff to be quite potty about the euphorbia. In a manifesto written for
Chelsea, he acclaims it as nothing less than 'the most horticulturally
valuable genus in the plant kingdom'.
The Botanic Garden grows more than 100 different species in cool-houses or
outdoors. Or rather, it did; a vicious frost last November killed about a
quarter of the collection.
Oxford biology undergraduates meet the euphorbia early in their career. It
is held up as a prime example of how remarkably well a single genus can
adapt to different environments. Euphorbias can be found growing wild in
English woods, Anatolian pastures, Russia (E. soongarica grows to six ft in
one year), and the Himalayas. What cactuses are to the deserts of South
America, euphorbias are to Africa's infernal regions.
Botany students linger over the euphorbia as a taxonomic brain-teaser. In
Walker's words, it is 'the flagship of the lumpers'. Taxonomical thought is
divided into two camps. 'Splitters' argue for the ruthless division of large
families, whereas the more genial 'lumpers' would like to leave well alone.
The euphorbia, they maintain, is one vast family of about 2,000 true
species, although some experts have numbered as many as 3,000. As for its
sub-classification, the euphorbia still awaits a taxonomist with the stamina
to come up with a wholly convincing arrangement.
Taxonomic puzzles tend to leave gardeners cold. However, anyone with a taste
for one-upmanship will enjoy acquiring the word 'cyathium', the correct name
for the euphorbia's strange frogspawn-like 'flower'. It could even be useful
to get a clear view of those whorling bracts, male glands, and more or less
warty ovaries. They will reveal whether your E. characias is subspecies
characias from the Mediterranean, sporting black male glands with short
horns, or E. subsp. wulfenii from the east, with yellow glands and long
horns.
And yet, growing in the garden's demonstration beds is a handsome hybridised
characias with glands which are neither eastern nor western, but somewhere
in between. Part of the fascination of euphorbias is their promiscuity and
variability. Rather like snowdrops and hostas, euphorbias are good news for
the specialist nurseryman.
At Oxford, would-be collectors of garden-worthy euphorbias get a useful
start in deciding which of the selected forms is desirable or bearable. You
have to be blessed with subtle colour sense to be able to place a fiery
shocker like E. griffithii 'Dixter', and the various forms of 'polychroma'
can be hard to take.
Experienced gardeners will also spot thugs likely to stage a hostile
take-over bid for any garden, notably 'cyparissias' and that evil little
biennial 'stricta'. In autumn, some of the most brilliant plants in the
garden are the euphorbias, especially villosa. This four-foot high floppy
plant is staked in a masterly way using woven birch-prunings. This ingenious
method was devised by Mr Robinson, the popular superintendant who held sway
from 1942 to 1963 - a short career, given the legendary longevity of the
Oxford garden's superintendants over 300 years.
The current superintendant and his staff are working to conserve a
remarkable euphorbia: stygiana. The rarest of them all, it grows on small
craters in the Azores; the plant recently brought back to Oxford was one of
only 10 specimens left in the wild. Rather surprisingly, this succulent,
sprawling plant, with candy-pink stems, has adapted well to life by the
river Cherwell. Students at the garden have managed to propagate it by
air-layers, so it may not be long before the euphorbia's fans can try it for
themselves.
The Oxford University Botanic Garden's exhibit can be found at the
educational end of the Great Marquee.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: A vintage year is on the cards - What the Chelsea
flower show offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS weekend the Chelsea flower show enters the last days of preparation in
readiness for the judges, visits by Royalty and the special charity preview
on Monday, May 18. The show is an astonishing success story; exhibitors are
just as eager to get a place in the show as the public is to see it.
Tuesday and Wednesday, from 8am until 8pm, and Thursday from 8am until
3.30pm, are reserved this year for members of the Royal Horticultural
Society. Only Thursday, from 3.30pm to 8pm, and Friday, from 8am until 5pm,
are available for non-members.
All tickets for the charity preview were sold a long time ago, and other
bookings are so advanced that the only sensible advice for anyone who still
hopes to see the show, but has no ticket, is to ring the credit-card booking
number (tel:081-900-1919) and find out what is still available.
The show's catalogue reads like a Who's Who of all the famous names in
commercial horticulture. Indications are that 1992 is to be a vintage year.
Whether interest centres on the open-air gardens or in the floral displays
packed in the great three-and-a-half-acre marquee - said to be the biggest
tent of its kind in the world - or in the close-packed exhibits of glass
houses, garden furniture, ornaments, machinery and sundries which line
avenues and fill odd places, this is a show which needs all the time that
can be given to it - and will still leave much undiscovered.
Among outdoor gardens is the large rockscape made by David Stevens for B &amp;
Q, the do-it-yourself chain, which is constructed using a beautiful
grey-blue quartzite rock in a natural way. Quartzite is an environmentally
friendly rock, the quarrying of which does not harm any ecological
situation. Stephens has used it cleverly in a landscape complete with
crofter's cottage, stream, cascades, pool and a variety of flowering and
foliage plants.
Different in style and purpose are two small gardens made by Faith and
Geoffrey Whitten, entitled Moving Home, and Moving Garden. As the names
imply, these suggest a sequence of gardens for a young couple moving up in
the world. Free use is made of container plants, to make the transfer from
one garden to another easy and inexpensive.
Elizabeth Banks Associates has gone in for sheer fantasy in what it calls a
Paradise Garden, with five gazebos, numerous rills of water and a Turkish
tent, which are said to represent the exoticism of Persia.
Gillian Temple Associates has made a roof garden for Fisons, the
fertilisers-to-pharmaceuticals group. A large number of features have been
included, such as raised timber beds, glazed pots, sculpture, a water
feature, a kitchen garden, a cut-flower area and a conservatory. Full marks
for ingenuity but probably none for restfulness.
More practical is the urban oasis designed by David Pearson for Yardley,
suitable for the back garden of a terraced house with provision for outdoor
living. It has raised beds, turf walls, arches, and space has been found for
salad vegetables, flowers and herbs. Rosemary Verey describes her design as
suitable for a London garden, but it would equally suit any small garden
surrounded by other buildings.
The staff and inmates of Leyhill Open Prison are back - this year with a
garden planned around a mulberry tree. It has an historical theme:
pre-Victorian to the left; Victorian to the top right; modern in front.
Judging by Leyhill's past efforts this should be an interesting exhibit.
The students of Merrist Wood College can always be expected to do something
original, and this year they have made what they call a hillside chalet
garden: a wildflower meadow and a chalet verandah spilling over with
colourful pelagoniums. It is a simple study in contrasts.
Pershore College of Horticulture is also a regular source of original
design. This year its students are making a garden which represents a
disused industrial site. Plants grow in cracks in the walls and various
man-made features worn away by water are included, but the focal point is a
derelict pump house and slate column split by gushing water. This is a essay
in ingenuity but not, perhaps, one meant to be copied.
Nor, probably, is the Uzbek Source Garden, made in the face of great
logistical difficulties by Ravil Abdullin from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to
represent the extremes of soil and climate in that part of central Asia. It
includes features from the immense desert regions to those of the more
fertile environments of meadows and thickets and it also finds space for the
flora of the mountain ranges.
The main marquee will be packed with exhibits from the large and spectacular
to the small but fascinating. Hillier Nurseries says it is including in its
exhibit of trees, shrubs, roses and herbaceous perennials the largest tree
ever shown in the Chelsea marquee: an English oak, 8m high, and an essential
part of the traditional English garden.
Trees are also an important feature in the Notcutts Nurseries Exhibits - '40
trees for 40 years' it says, to represent the years of the Queen's reign.
But no doubt, if all goes well over the weekend, Notcutts will not stop at
this number. It has an interesting range of trees, some in cool storage to
hold them back, others in greenhouses to hurry them along, some just
naturally ready. One that seems certain to be there is an unusual, small
growing, pink-flowered mountain ash named Sorbus hostii.
Three Counties nurseries is making a spectacular display of garden pinks
aided by Dartington Crystal, the glass manufacturer, which has provided
about 100 special crystal vases and bowls for the blooms. Stephen Bailey is
also showing an extensive selection of pinks and carnations containing a
number of new varieties. There will also be some of the latest hybrid
alstroemerias creating so much interest.
Numerous rose exhibits are included, some shown in the traditional way, as
cut flowers, some as naturally growing plants which, although a less
spectacular type of display, always seems more interesting and revealing.
David Austin Roses is an exhibitor showing growing plants flanking a central
path and covering two walls. (Look out for some fine shrub varieties of the
type Austin calls English Roses.)
Mattock's Roses are including plenty of perpetual flowering ground cover
roses. Cants is to have a spectacular display of cut flowers, and the
exhibits from Peter Beales Roses is based on a new dictionary of roses
resulting from the combination of two earlier books written by Beale, one
called Classic Roses, and the other 20th Century Roses. The new book, Roses,
is lavishly illustrated and the exhibit highlights some of its features.
Bulbous plants are numerous and varied, from the many small species - the
speciality of companies such as Broadleigh Gardens and Avon bulbs - to the
great spectaculars of Walter Blom and Son and Van Tubergen, which this year
is including a new red, pink and greenish white hippeastrum, rather
unattractively named Spotty.
Someone always seems to hold back a good display of daffodils for Chelsea;
this year it has been done by J Walkers Bulbs. It says it will replace much
of the exhibit halfway through the week, so it will be as impressive on the
Friday as for the Monday judging.
Stapeley Water Gardens is making a water-lily pool with a Monet-style bridge
to celebrate its acquisition of Latour-Marliac, the water-lily specialist in
the South of France, where many of the best new varieties have been raised.
Cannington College holds the National Collections of argyranthemums and
osteospermums. It is making an exceptionally fine exhibit of these South
African daisies, and has itself raised some of the varieties.
Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries, from Cornwall, is bringing many rare and
some slightly tender trees and shrubs to the Chelsea show, as well as a big
collection of hybrid lilies, mainly of the popular groups known as Mid
Century and Oriental.
Some spectacular exhibits have come from overseas. These include one from
the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens in South Africa, which not only shows
beautiful proteas, but also several succulents being shown for the first
time.
Machines, tools, garden sundries and buildings of many kinds, as well as an
enormous array of ornaments and garden furniture are being shown at Chelsea
once again, in bewildering number and variety.
Some of the statues are above average in quality, but for sheer enterprise
pride of place must go to Oak Leaf Conservatories. This company, engaged to
restore the dome of a magnificent Victorian conservatory at Broughton Hall,
proceeded to dismantle it, brought it to its workshops for repair, and has
now re-erected it temporarily at Chelsea before returning it to Yorkshire,
where it belongs.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: Why the best is bound to be absent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEATHER has been kinder to Chelsea flower show exhibitors than in any of
the last three years. It is the first green spring for much too long and no
doubt the sights will be wonderful - both the flowers and the gardening
public in the flesh.
Certainly, garden accessories will be ever more in evidence, although I know
before I start that I will never bring myself to afford a pseudo-Victorian
greenhouse. Before we are all swept away with Marquee Madness, I would like
to put in a word for things which will not be there.
They are not only the large numbers of gardeners who cannot face
traffic-jams and do not like coaches. They are fields of unattended
buttercups, now at their best; the last of the Pheasant Eye narcissi among
cow parsley and long grass; huge lilacs bulging over urban walls; woods of
bluebells which refute the notion that our world is already warming; clouds
of flower on the best of all late-flowering cherries, the white Prunus
longipes, with blossom dangling on long stems, like cherries, fit to be worn
as earrings.
Nothing mature can be shown at Chelsea, nothing as tall as the off-white
Staphylea, which is dominating one of my local bus-stops, nor the huge bulk
of single-flowered white Rubus Benenden, the stems have such a freshness
throughout the summer. Chelsea is artificial, a suspension of disbelief.
This weekend I can still disbelieve it, especially when looking at the
daphnes in my garden.
Of all the noble families, daphnes are particularly ill-suited to
flower-shows. I have never seen a really happy daphne at Chelsea, except for
a female namesake, and I doubt if we ever shall. Right now, some of the best
forms are at their peak, but daphnes would refuse to move to a show because
their roots detest disturbance. Whatever you see next week, it will not be
fully indicative of May's best shrubs.
Over the years I have grown about a dozen varieties, killed a few of them,
and left others behind when moving house. I have tangutica progressing
slowly but healthily from cuttings; my retusa is less than one foot high and
wide after nine years; I no longer have the scented white-flowered
blagayana, which hugged the ground for five years and threw off a wonderful
sweetness until it died, as usual, before reaching middle-age.
I have had Daphne odora - both green and golden forms - in pots and under
windows, often developing those bare lower stems and rather pale buds, which
never match the bushes beside other people's doors. This golden-leaved
daphne is one of the essential plants, easily rooted from cuttings. Its
master, the late E A Bowles, once wrote that it needs 'a corner outside by
kitchen and chimney, the sort of place where the cat goes to bed and where
blue bottles sit on the wall in late autumn.' There are no flies on the cats
who visit from neighbouring gardens.
These daphnes are not all easy, but I have at last found the best for my
type of gardening, late in my progress through the family. It is not the
tall, easy Daphne Somerset which is leafy and makes a broad, unusual hedge.
It is the daphne from Naples, which reached England in the Regency era and
has behaved with quiet good sense ever since. I seldom notice it in other
gardens, except in the forecourt of Jenkyn Place, near Alton, Hampshire,
where I first woke up to its merits. It grows about two feet high; it is
completely hardy; its rather dark leaves are evergreen and vaguely reflect
light; it will grow on any soil, hot, acid or not, so long as the drainage
is sharp and the roots are free from interference. It seems to revel in
rotted pig manure, and its flowers are a muted rose-pink, which lasts for
about a month, until late May. It has a glorious scent, especially on cold
evenings.
For impact, exhibitors would probably prefer my other performer, a ruby-red
mat of flowers, which is known as Daphne Cneorum eximia. I am hesitant about
the name because all our true eximia derives from a wonder plant, owned by
the late A T Johnson, one of those rare gardening columnists who added as
much to nursery-lists as to the newspaper columns. His daphne hugs the
ground and has flowers of a rich red with a notable scent.
Some of the forms on sale seem to me to be paler than others: the
founder-parent is said to have grown to the amazing width of 6 ft. I can
almost vouch for this size on a plant in a previous garden: it grew in full
sun and the rich soil which this easy variety likes. It derived from a
cutting of a marvellous parent, still to be seen this month on the old rock
garden at Waterperry, open to the public, near Oxford.
I have never seen the Neapolitan daphne near Naples. I have never seen
Cneorum, except in the Dolomites among powder-blue alpine clematis. In the
Pyrenees, there have been reports of a plain Daphne Cneorum, which is even
more sumptuous. This weekend, I would settle for the easy eximia, one of
those scented shrubs which exhibitors may show in miniature on a table for
alpines at Chelsea, but which will never be seen on exhibition at its true
width and glory. Some of the best things in life cannot be shown off: it may
help to remember this law of nature when you struggle to see through the
crowds what exhibitors can still display at its best.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sinful windows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN YEARS ago I committed a sin: by unwittingly having two plastic windows
installed on the ground floor of this Grade II listed building. Nobody
noticed, however a recent event has attracted the council's notice. I have
been told to replace with wood ones. I Understand that after a period of
seven years they have become an 'established fact'. Is this correct?
The former four-year rule does not apply to development after 1963. You can
invite the Council not to exercise its power to serve an enforcement notice,
but you cannot establish a legal claim to the right to keep the offending
windows.

<TEXT>
MY HOUSE is on a narrow unadopted lane which serves several other properties
and is marked as a bridle path. The owners of the properties have right of
way over the lane, but other motorists use the lane as a short cut, and
drive along it at unsafe speeds.
I should like to install 'sleeping policemen' humps in the lane to make high
speeds impractical, but I believe that I need the permission of the owner of
the lane to do this. I have been unable to discover who owns the lane. What
can I take to find the owner's name and address? If I am unable to obtain
this information, can I go ahead with the alterations?
It is correct that you need the permission of the owner of the soil of the
lane. You can make a search of H M Land Registry to find out if the land is
registered land, and if so who the owner is. If it is not registered you may
be unable to find out who owns the lane. If so, you would still go ahead at
your risk as to the cost of reinstating if you decide to install the humps.
MY PROPERTY has a very old dry stone wall as its boundary and is adjoined by
a narrow road just wide enough for one vehicle. I believe it is classified
as a No 4 road. This road is now used by tankers and other heavy vehicles.
The wall, upright in 1976 when we moved here, now lies at an angle and has
fallen in some places.
I have been in touch with the council who admit some liability as our garden
is approximately 2 ft lower than the road and the wall helps to support the
road. What is then council's legal liability? We have a shrub border in
front of the wall and as we are both OAP's would not be able to dig up and
replant if these were damaged in further falls.
If the wall supports the road it may be part of the highway, in which case
the local highway authority has a duty to repair it. You should claim that
this is the case and require the local authority to effect the necessary
repairs.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1990, after being in full-time employment outside the UK continuously
since 1973, I changed jobs. My new employment was also full-time outside the
UK. My employer is based in the US but because my salary was denominated in
sterling, I was paid in London by a UK subsidiary.
Some time after starting work, I discovered that UK tax at 40 per cent had
been deducted from my salary, together with national insurance
contributions. I was told this was a legal requirement and that gross
payments could not be made until a tax code had been issued.
After six months my employer started to make the salary payments from an
offshore subsidiary, without deductions. it took a further 11 months before
I received a full refund of the tax deducted.
1) Was my employer correct that it was legally obliged to make the
deductions?
2) Do I have any claim on the Revenue for interest on the sum refunded?
1) Yes, so far as we can tell from the bare facts.
2) No: successive Chancellors of the Exchequer since 1975 have refused to
authorise the Inland Revenue to pay interest (repayment supplement, as it is
called in the Taxes Acts) to nonresidents.
You may like to write to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Treasury
Chambers, Great George Street, London UK SW1P 3AG, setting out the bare
facts briefly (including the name of the tax office and their reference
number, and the name and address of the UK subsidiary), and ask how the
discriminatory restriction of section 824(1)(a) of the Taxes Act to
residents of the UK can be reconciled with the spirit of the Citizens
Charter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY MOTHER owns the freehold of her house in which she and her husband, my
stepfather, currently live. She has told me that in her will, the house will
be left to my stepfather, but on his death it will revert to me. Is it
possible to do this legally?
If the house becomes the property of my stepfather (who is some years
younger than my mother) what is to stop him from making a will leaving the
house to his children and not to me?
My mother assures me that the will is valid, and that her wishes for the
house to go to me on my stepfather's death will be carried out. However,
should my stepfather and I lose touch with each other following my mother's
death, how will I be informed of my inheritance? I know that the solicitor
my mother used to draw up her will does not know my present address, because
I moved after the will was made. I do not have a copy of the will.
My mother does not like to discuss this matter with me, as she is certain
that my stepfather would carry out her wishes as regards the house. If I
push the matter, it looks as though I am mercenary.
It is perfectly possible to do what your mother wants while still preventing
your stepfather from alienating the house during the period of his
survivorship. This is done by a gift to him for life (or during his life)
with remainder to you absolutely; the effect is to set up a trust in which
you would have a vested interest immediately on the death of your mother,
even though your enjoyment of the use of the house is postponed during your
step-father's lifetime.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Finding the correct chemistry -
David Sparks meets three scientists who have turned a problem into a
business opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHTENING standards for safety and pollution mean that chemical and drugs
companies must rethink how they make products. That presents opportunities
for a small Durham company, High Force Research, set up by Stuart Penny, Roy
Valentine and Bob Redfern: chemists and a chemist turned marketing man.
The company specialises in improving chemical processes. Last year it won a
second Smart award from the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a
technique for removing toxic phenols from the waste that goes into drains.
The three started in July 1988 with a large job. They took up a request,
turned down by the company they then worked for, to devise a safe way to
manufacture a new drug, buparvaquone, to cure a devastating cattle disease,
East Coast fever.
Coopers Animal Health (now part of Pitman-Moore) had found the drug after 30
years' work, but its laboratory process involved toxic mercury, the
potentially explosive use of hydrogen peroxide, and corrosive fluorine
compounds in a low-flashpoint solvent unsuited to factory use.
'We asked the local universities if they had a spare lab we could rent,'
recalled Redfern. ''You mean the Mountjoy Research Centre,' said the
chemistry department in Durham.'
Mountjoy, a centre for small research companies, perched on the hill above
the university science laboratories, was ideal - 'though the rent is now
higher than in London Docklands,' said Redfern. 'Being near Durham city
centre is attractive, and this has allowed English Estates to raise rents to
ridiculous levels.' He added: 'You need a good library close by if you are
doing our sort of chemistry. The university has glass-blowers, chemical
stores, instruments, scientific expertise. One academic is a consultant for
us.'
Regional selective assistance from the DTI covered part of the cost of
setting up High Force which also received support from local councils.
Coopers and the contract helped find the rest of the money.
Valentine, who left school at 16 but then gained a doctorate at the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, felt chemists
made too little use of computers. He devised a computer-controlled reaction
vessel to test and perfect the buparvaquone process.
High Force Research now makes the Automated Laboratory Reactor and has sold
it to multinational companies doing manufacturing research. The main
competitor is a much costlier Swiss machine.
Redfern said: 'We are getting a lot of work as a result of the Control of
Substances Hazardous to Health standards. Where workers are in contact with
such substances - dry-cleaning fluids, for instance - employers must assess
the risks, take precautions and monitor the outcome. It is making them look
more closely at what they do.'
Environmental standards are also bringing change, restricting what you can
discharge from a chimney or allow to go down the drain.
High Force devises processes to make products not now made in Britain. A UK
company was importing a raw material from Japan and wanted a local source.
'We developed a process and approached a production company to adopt it.
Together we aim to be the main supplier.
'Our turnover was several hundred thousand pounds in 1990-91, showing a
modest profit. And we are holding our own despite the recession. One problem
is that the past six or 12 months have been a time of merger, divestment and
reorganisation among our customers which paraslyses decision-taking. We
believe, now the election is out of the way, that people are starting to
think about the longer-term.
'From our profits we have invested over Pounds 100,000 in laboratories and
equipment. It is nice to be master of your own destiny. If you're a little
cog in a big organisation, you have no control over what happens to you. One
of the nicest things is to be free of committees and rigid structures. We
can organise in an informal way.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: When cleanliness is next to
godliness - Nick Garnett meets the Reverend David Jones, a man stuck on the
bathroom business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A typical day last month, the Reverend David Jones celebrated communion
at St Mary's Church, in the north London district of Primrose Hill. He then
climbed out of his eucharistic vestments and climbed into his Vauxhall
Senator (up to six months ago it was a BMW coupe). Destination? One of the
three shops Jones owns in and around the capital that offer basins and
lavatories as well as complete bathrooms designs with hand-painted wood.
'I trained in a monastery for five years and was ordained in 1970 as an
Anglican priest,' Jones says. 'I subsequently resigned from that but was
relicensed as an Anglican priest in the middle of last year.'
In between, Jones worked in the bathroom supply business, eventually setting
up his own company in 1983, selling it to Smallbone, an upmarket supplier,
and buying into and then getting out of bathroomware makers Sanitan. He set
up Colourwash with two partners in 1990 and the company now has bathroom
shops: in Fulham, north London and Sunningdale. 'What a disastrous time to
do anything like this,' Jones says.
Colourwash shows you can start up a retail business without much capital and
extract a salary even in difficult times. The three partners - Jones, Jane
Gilchriest, a former commercial cook, and Teeny Hickman, a sculptor - last
year earned a total of Pounds 80,000 from the business.
You also need nerve. Until August last year, Colourwash made losses; it has
racked up a net deficit of Pounds 35,000 since starting up. The company is
now in profit, but at only a margin of 5 per cent on turnover - Pounds
700,000 last year.
The business was set up with one shop, the partners each contributing Pounds
20,000, the two women raising that against their houses. The Trustee Savings
Bank came up with a secured loan of Pounds 40,000. Jones injected another
Pounds 40,000 on his own to open the Sunningdale shop, and the north London
shop and warehouse absorbed another Pounds 15,000, with Pounds 25,000 needed
for working capital. All the premises are rented.
Colourwash is the kind of company which offers only white bathroomware
(there is no avocado in sight) and would not touch a bath made of plastic if
it was the last material on earth. 'En suite' would be regarded as a dirty
phrase. A lot of folk in Sunningdale like a limed oak finish on the bathroom
wood in their South Fork spreads, but Jones blanches at this. The company
sells itself partly on its ability to colour-match complete bathrooms. It
supplies wallpaper, tiles and the wooden furniture. A lot of the wood
finishes are of the fashionable, washed-out, 'kicked around and rolled
downstairs' look, as Jones likes to call it. Colourwash mainly uses a
traditional furniture maker in Somerset.
A lot of the sanitaryware Colourwash sells comes from continental Europe:
Pozziginori and Sbordoni of Italy, or Duravit and Villeroy &amp; Boch, rather
than the UK's Armitage Shanks, Twyford or Shires.
'At the beginning of the 1980s, when traditional designs started coming in,
all UK makers pooh-poohed it. Now they are all on the bandwagon, but years
after the event,' says 47-year-old Jones. 'They have vacated the high value
ground to foreign imports. This has allowed the Germans to come in with
their taps, shower doors and valves with good engineered quality and
reliability. You've got companies like Roca of Spain just waiting to come
in, and Jacob Delafon making a surge into the market.'
Colourwash has high regard for, and sells bathroomware from, some UK makers
such as Ideal Standard, Sanitan and Tutbury, the latter recently bought by
Spring Ram, the equipment maker, as a separate upmarket arm. Jones says the
pricing policies of most British makers work against small retailers.
'People like myself running specialist bathroom shops have been badly served
by UK manufacturers. We have to find products with margins not eroded by
large building merchants which sell a lot of British-made items. We have to
look abroad. You can't live with margins of less than 30 per cent.'
The point was underlined, Jones argues, when Spring Ram cut retailers'
margins on Tutbury bathroomware once it had bought that business, but he has
a lot of confidence in Spring Ram. Colourwash, which sells baths for as low
as Pounds 100 but will do complete bathrooms (one house is installing Pounds
28,000 of equipment supplied by the company) can enjoy positive cash flow
even in a desperate market. 'We can get positive cash flow if we can turn
over equipment within eight weeks.'
Jones argues that the company has negotiated its way through the back end of
a recession by being 'mean'. There are no company cars, and management
accounts are done month on month every 10 days - these accounts include 33
entries split shop by shop. 'On every sale we make we analyse margins.' Some
of this approach has rubbed off from the practices of the mini-conglomerate,
Williams, which bought Smallbone and, indirectly, employed Jones. 'The ethos
is: 'on time, on budget, and no surprises.''
Recession has squeezed margins on many bathroom products by 10 to 15
percentage points. To help offset this, Jones tries to take advantage of
de-stocking offers by equipment suppliers and is importing some bathroomware
direct. In this way he can absorb the distributors' margins - usually 25 per
cent - as well as the retailer's. 'The problem is scale. We don't have much
clout in the market.'
Colourwash did Pounds 250,000 of business in the first three months of this
year. 'I think the prognosis is extremely good. We are more than holding our
own now. Companies selling ordinary stuff with no exclusivity must still be
bleeding to death.'
Small businesses like Colourwash need to raise sales to about Pounds 2m,
Jones believes. 'At that level, with one to three shops tightly managed and
a reasonable market, you are going to be very profitable.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Pensions hit by back-door raids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REMOVAL of pension fund assets, as it was done by Robert Maxwell is,
fortunately, rare. But depredations caused when companies use pension
schemes to subsidise redundancy programmes have become commonplace.
According to actuary Bryn Davies, of the specialised consultancy Union
Pension Services: 'It does weaken the funding for the people who remain with
the company scheme and treats them less than fairly, yet trustees tend to go
along with it.'
A few companies have special redundancy terms written into the pension
scheme rules, giving those made redundant better treatment than employees
leaving early of their own accord. Someone made redundant after the age of
50 might be allowed to retire at that time with a full pension instead of an
actuarially-reduced amount. But companies without special redundancy rules
assemble their own packages with an eye on cash flow as well as tax
efficiency.
Because of the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on the amount that can be paid as
tax-free redundancy compensation, a favourite tactic is to offer departing
employees the option of taking a lower lump sum, plus an improved deferred
pension.
Most schemes allow companies to increase some members' benefits if the
trustees and actuary approve. Theoretically, this means that the company has
to make an extra payment into the pension scheme to buy the additional
benefits. But if the pension fund is in surplus, the company often can be
excused actuarially from handing over any cash.
Employees remaining with the company might see this as a form of pension
fund raid, but have no effective comeback.
Bryan Freake, of the white-collar Manufacturing Science and Finance union,
says companies will continue dipping into pension fund surpluses with ease
until the law is clarified. 'Under present law, scheme members have no right
to the surplus, so there is no point saying people made redundant should not
have anything extra if you can't deliver it to the others, anyway.'
Freake says employers could also take advantage of the fact that employees
generally are unaware of the heavy pension loss that could be involved in a
seemingly generous redundancy package. Their deferred pension would be
subject to annual increases only up to a 5 per cent annual limit - likely to
be well below the wage increase they could have expected had they stayed in
employment.
However, a more significant influence on such deals could be be a protocol
agreed at the Maastricht EC summit last December. It proposed an amendment
to the Treaty of Rome aimed at wiping out the possible retrospective effect
of the landmark Barber judgment - a European court decision that men and
women in occupational pension schemes should be treated equally - handed
down on May 17 1990.
Redundancy terms were considered an essential part of equal treatment.
Barber's original case was brought after he was made redundant and received
lower total benefits than a woman of the same age would have been given.
Thanks to uncertainties about the exact interpretation of the judgment,
unequal treatment has continued and hundreds of claims have backed up in the
legal system.
If the Barber judgment is not taken as applying retrospectively, only
pension rights earned after May 17 1990 would have to provide equal
benefits. But matters may not be resolved quickly even if the Maastricht
protocol is ratified, as the agreement could be challenged in the European
Court.

Warning Talbot calculated head depth wrong IN PREVIOUS weeks, we have
highlighted director activity at Clinton Cards. Yet again, directors have
been buying, this time at 106p. Don Lewin, the chairman and Clinton Lewin,
the managing director, bought 154,000 and 5,000 shares respectively. Barry
Hartog, the finance director, and George Pomphrett both bought 3,000 shares.
The share price has continued to rise and now stands at around 125p.
Directors at Wilshaw, the building materials company, have been buying.
Francis Askham, the chairman, purchased 200,000 and Hugh Reynolds, the chief
executive, acquired 1m, both at 11.5p. On the same date, the director of a
subsidiary company also bought 1m. The shares were sold by one of the major
shareholders, based in South Africa.
At Close Brothers, the merchant bank, finance director Peter Winkworth sold
35,000 shares at 254.5p. This follows selling by Roderick Kent, the managing
director, and Peter Stone at the end of March.
Buying of Thames TV shares by directors has been steady since the beginning
of the year. Most recently, David Elstein bought 31,200 shares at 163p. He
is the fourth director to buy stock this year following Lord Brabourne, the
chairman, Richard Dunn, the chief executive, and Sir Paul Fox.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Broker caps home loans until 1995 -
News in Brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BROKER John Charcol is offering a 'cap and droplock' mortgage at a rate of
10.25 per cent (11.6 per cent APR) capped until August 1995, one of the
longest capped rates available at present. Each July, borrowers will be
given an option to switch to a competitive fixed rate.
Loans must be not more than 85 per cent of the property's value, and
repayment mortgages are not available.
If borrowers do not want to take out building and contents insurance linked
to the policy, there is a higher capped rate of 10.5 per cent. There is also
an arrangement fee of Pounds 295, but only Pounds 95 is payable in advance
and the balance can be added to the mortgage.
Early-redemption penalties are three months during the capped period and one
month thereafter.
                        *      *      *
Capital Home Loans is offering a three-year fixed rate mortgage of 10.20 per
cent (APR 11.4 per cent). It is available for repayment and endowment
mortgages.
Customers who also take out CHL's building insurance get a one-year discount
of 0.21 percentage points, giving them a first-year rate of 9.99 per cent.
There is a penalty of three months' interest for redemption during the first
three years.
CHL is also offering five-year fixed-rate mortgages at 10.35 per cent (11.4
per cent APR). Building insurance is compulsory. Early-redemption penalties
are the equivalent of five months' interest during the first three years. In
both cases there are arrangement fees of Pounds 295, which can be added to
the loan.
                        *      *      *
Latin American Securities, a subsidiary of Foreign &amp; Colonial, has launched
a Luxembourg-based Sicav (an open-ended fund similar to a unit trust)
specialising in Latin American equities. The launch follows on from the
success of the Latin American Investment Trust, the best-performing such
trust of 1991, and of country-specific Sicavs managed by LAS.
The Argentinian Sicav has risen 237 per cent since its launch in February
1991, and the Mexican Sicav is up 241 per cent since it was established in
November 1989.
The argument in favour of Latin America is that the region has had
widespread economic and political reform and appears committed to
free-market capitalism.
Economic growth rates are higher than in the developed world, which should
lead to faster corporate earnings growth. But pessimists would argue that,
after the recent sharp rises in share prices, the markets could be due for a
correction.
The Latin American Sicav has a single pricing structure and the minimum
investment is Dollars 5,000, on which there is a commission payment of 5 per
cent (the equivalent of the bid-offer spread on unit trusts).
There is also a redemption fee of 1 per cent for those who sell within a
year, and 0.5 per cent after that. The annual management fee is 2.25 per
cent.
                        *      *      *
Midland Bank is reducing interest rates on its accounts. The net rate on the
Orchard current account is being cut to 1.88 per cent from 2.27. On the
Meridian current account, the net rate on balances under Pounds 1,999 goes
down to 2.62 per cent from 3.04.
On the Meridian savings account, the net rate is now 5.02 per cent (down
from 5.58 per cent) on balances between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 4,999. On
Orchard savings accounts, the rate on the same balance is now 4.66 per cent
(down from 5.21). The Tessa rate has been cut to 9.5 per cent from 10.00.
Lloyds Bank is also cutting rates. The net rate on its Classic account is
now 0.75 per cent on balances between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1,000, and 1.5 per
cent on balances between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000.
On its gold account, balances between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,500 will pay
a net rate of 2.63 per cent; the rate on balances between Pounds 2,500 and
Pounds 5,000 is a net 4.35 per cent. The Lloyds Tessa rate is now 9.5 per
cent.
                        *      *      *
Those searching for fee-based advice in the north-east of England have a new
service on offer: Fimbra member James A. Clancy of Ovington, Northumberland
(0661-835-130). Clancy is linked with Adams &amp; Nevile Asset Management, an
IMRO member, for investment management purposes.
                        *      *      *
National Counties Building Society, which has long offered one of the best
rates on its Tessa, has cut the rate to 12 per cent. This, though, is still
2 percentage points above base rate.
Meanwhile, the Woolwich Building Society has cut its savings rates. The net
rate for its Prime Gold account on balances between Pounds 500 and Pounds
9,999 is now 6 per cent (5.79 on monthly accounts).
The society's Tessa rate is 9.75 per cent on balances between Pounds 25 and
Pounds 2,999; 10.75 on Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,799; and 10.85 on amounts
above Pounds 4,800.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Base rate cut unsettles fixed income
planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's base rate cut was not good news for everyone. Those keen on the
certainty of investing for a fixed income - mostly pensioners - found some
promising avenues closed off immediately as National Savings withdrew all
its products without notice. And interest rates for savers were reduced
quickly by building societies.
Further base rate cuts are now expected when, only a month ago, a jump of
two points was canvassed widely in the event of a Conservative election
defeat. Some pundits forecast that rates could even undercut those of
Germany - a psychologically important barrier to breach.
The election result reinforced the beliefs of a growing number of analysts
who expect a low-inflation, low-interest rate environment for the rest of
the decade. Double-figure base rates are still not all that low in
historical terms, they argue, so more cuts could be in store. This could be
the time to lock in returns.
But income investors must swallow some unpalatable facts. First, you will
normally have to sacrifice some capital growth. The more growth you are
prepared to lose, then, in general, the higher income you can afford; and,
indeed, a very high income often will be earned at the expense of a capital
loss.
Second, you must decide if the income is needed monthly or annually. You
should get better value if you only need payments once a year.
The most obvious product is a gilt (or UK government bond) which can be
bought for only a small fee at a post office. The present high level of
government debt ensures there will be plenty of gilts around for the
foreseeable future.
Gilt investors can make capital gains; but when investing for income, it is
simplest to buy a bond and then hold on to it.
If you buy a particularly short-term bond, you might find you are just
deferring a problem, according to David Kauders, a fee-based adviser who
specialises in financial planning using gilts.
Yields - the technical term for the proportion of the price you pay which
you will receive in income - are lower than they were immediately before the
election, but Kauders says that 9 per cent is achievable.
However, appropriately long stocks - which are not redeemed until at least
the year 2000 - are thin on the ground and it can be difficult to juggle
them so that you receive a regular monthly income.
It is also important to remember, when buying stock priced above 100, that
your capital value will be eroded if you hold it until maturity.
Annuities are the most effective income providers, but only because they
repay your capital as well as income. They are, therefore, most useful if
you are sure you will not need the capital again, and best avoided if you
want to keep future options open.
They are offered by life companies, and those not bought with the proceeds
of a pension plan come in two basic varieties. Immediate annuities continue
to pay out a fixed income until you die, whenever that happens, while
temporary annuities pay out over a fixed period.
In either case, however, the company will pocket your capital once you die,
so this is not a good investment if you are keen to leave a handsome
inheritance behind you or if you have reason to fear that you will not live
long.
The rate you receive depends on two main factors: your life expectancy and
the state of the gilts market. You will be paid more if your life expectancy
is shorter, or if gilt yields are high. This means you get better value the
longer you wait - unless you think gilt yields will fall.
As a rule, they are worthwhile for men aged 70 or over and women aged 75.
According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best rates now available
for temporary annuities lasting for nine years, and taken out by a male aged
70 paying Pounds 10,000, are Pounds 2,023 annually from Pearl Assurance and
Pounds 1,983.27 annually from Canada Life.
For an immediate annuity, on the same assumptions, the best rates are Pounds
1,463.40 from Sun Life of Canada and Pounds 1,460.52 from Equitable Life.
Guaranteed income bonds, as their name suggests, provide a guaranteed rate
of income over a fixed term. They tend to be offered by smaller life
offices. Both monthly and annual income payments are available, although
rates for the latter will be higher.
As with all these investments, they are underpinned by gilts - which meant
that virtually all the GIBs on the market were withdrawn abruptly on the day
after the election. The rates now on offer are less generous.
GIBs have the significant disadvantage for non-taxpayers that basic-rate
income tax is deducted at source and cannot be reclaimed. Baronworth's best
buys for monthly income (assuming you have Pounds 10,000 to invest) are 7.91
per cent from American Life over one year, 7.63 from American Life over two
years, 7.6 from Premium Life over three years, 7.61 from General Portfolio
over four years, and 7.8 from Hill Samuel over five years.
For annual income, Baronworth's best buys are 8.44 from Prosperity over one
year, 8.3 from CCL Assurance over two years, 8.5 from Liberty Life over
three years, 8.15 from Consolidated Life over four years, and 8.52 from
Prosperity over five.
National Savings provides taxable monthly income bonds which pay 9.25 per
cent. The maximum holding has now been increased to Pounds 50,000. These
bonds are most appropriate for non-taxpayers, while they are just about
competitive for basic-rate taxpayers.
Banks and building societies often offer fixed-income products, but many
have been dropped unceremoniously in the light of base rate speculation, so
choice is not wide and few offers are exciting.
According to Money Facts, the best onshore rates for accounts providing
fixed monthly income are provided by Exeter Bank and Halifax Building
Society.
Over one year, Exeter offers a fixed 9.5 per cent on a minimum of Pounds
5,000. On an investment of Pounds 10,000, Halifax offers 9.43 per cent over
one year, 9.02 over two years, and 8.83 over three, four and five years.
Midland Bank Trust and TSB Channel Islands offer the best offshore rates.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Court blow on NI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLATANT discrimination in the field of National Insurance Contributions
(NICs) will continue following an unexpected opinion from the European Court
of Justice this week.
Women can claim the basic state pension, now Pounds 54.15 a week, after
paying the full rate of NICs for 39 years. But men need to pay for 44 years,
and a shorter contribution record means a lower pension. The differential of
five years reflects the difference in the state pension age, which is 60 for
women and 65 for men.
The NI fund pays for several social security benefits including the basic
state pension and those for sickness and unemployment. National Insurance is
levied at 9 per cent on an employee's 'band earnings' - those between Pounds
2,808 and Pounds 21,060 per annum for the 1992/93 tax year.
People who earn above the lower limit also pay 2 per cent on the first
Pounds 2,808. An employee whose earnings exceed the upper limit would pay
Pounds 1,700 in NICs for 1992/93.
The inequality in the NI system is compounded by the fact that women who
continue to work after age 60 do not pay the tax, even if they have already
contributed for a full 44 years.
The Equal Opportunities Commission challenged this system at the European
Court - the supreme court of the European Community. Now, the court has
given an 'opinon' that unequal state pension ages - and, hence, unequal
qualifying NIC periods - were still legal under EC law.
This opinion is expected to be confirmed within three months by an official
ruling. The court's decisions are binding on member states and override
national legislation.
Last June, the government announced plans to equalise state pensions and it
is expected to make a statement next month when the consultation period
ends. The UK is one of four EC countries which still retains unequal pension
ages; the others are Belgium, Greece and Portugal.
EC law on state pension ages is unlikely to change until the draft second
Social Security Directive (1987) is implemented, although progress towards
equalising occupational pensions could accelerate this process.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Taking the rough with the smooth -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu reminds investors that Pep charges can outweigh the
tax benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS INTEREST rates drop, savers may be considering an investment in shares
through the putative attractions of a personal equity plan. 'Putative'
because the charges involved can be steep and a Pep might not be the most
cost-efficient way into equities for everyone.
Individuals can shelter Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and, in addition,
Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep in any one tax year. Returns are exempt
from income and capital gains tax.
If you are thinking of having a Pep, there are two broad issues to consider.
The first is your own tax position and the second is the type of Pep.
Many investors see the label 'tax-free' on Peps and assume automatically
that this means large profits. But this is far from the case. You must be
sure that you are buying a Pep because you want to invest in the stock
market. Remember that equity investment always involves risk and the rewards
may take several years to come through.
To minimise the risks, you have to ride out the bad times - which means
being prepared to let your money sit in the market until it recovers. Those
who bought in the summer of 1987, and sold in panic after Black Monday, had
the worst of both worlds. But for long-term investors, the 1987 crash was
just a blip in their fortunes.
If you have a large portfolio of equities already, then it could make sense
to place the maximum amount in a Pep this year. Over the years, you will
quickly build up quite a large tax-free portfolio, and this could result in
considerable capital gains tax savings.
If you are a small investor (under, say, Pounds 10,000), then CGT is not
likely to be much of a problem (the annual allowance is Pounds 5,800 and you
also benefit from indexation for inflationary gains).
So, the key benefit to you is the income tax saving. This will be quite
small in the early years, particularly if you are a basic-rate taxpayer, and
the charges can easily eat up these savings.
Basically, there are three different types of Pep: unit or investment
trusts, managed Peps, and self-select Peps.
Managed Peps
These are Peps run by a financial company which chooses the stocks on the
investor's behalf. They can be a mix of shares with unit and/or investment
trusts or shares alone.
Assume that a higher-rate taxpayer puts Pounds 6,000 into a managed Pep
investing solely in shares. The dividend yield on the FT-All Share index is
now around 4.5 per cent (which also happens to be the average for the past
10 years).
However, since the Pep is geared towards income, we can assume a yield of 6
per cent in the first year, with the income increasing by 5 per cent a year.
The annual income on the Pep would thus be Pounds 360, and the tax saving
for a higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 144 - or 2.4 per cent of the value of the
Pep. However, charges on managed Peps are much higher than this in the first
year.
The initial charge is likely to be in the region of 5-6 per cent with an
annual management charge of 1-1.5 per cent. VAT is payable on top of this.
There will also be dealing charges. Plan managers with a low initial charge
(around 1 to 3 per cent) tend to have higher dealing charges of 1.65 to 2
per cent every time shares are bought or sold. Otherwise, dealing charges
can be as low as 0.2 per cent.
In addition, there can be a penalty charge for partial withdrawal and
transfer charges should you want to move to another Pep.
Whichever method is used, it will take a number of years for the higher-rate
taxpayer to see the benefits of his tax-free Pep. If we assume an initial
charge of 5 per cent plus VAT, an annual fee of 1 per cent plus VAT, and 0.2
per cent for the initial purchase of the shares, the cost in the first year
would be Pounds 435. This is compared with the tax saving of Pounds 144.
Obviously, costs would be much lower in the second year, comprising the
annual fee of Pounds 70.50. It would not be until the sixth year of the Pep
that the tax break would show. But if the initial charge was lower, it would
take less time for the tax saving to come through.
Unit and investment trust Peps
For those making their initial foray into the stock market, the Pounds 6,000
Pep limit in any one tax year would not buy a very wide range of individual
stocks. The direct investor would thus be at risk if there was a sudden
plunge in one of his chosen shares.
One of the best ways of diversifying your risk is through a unit or
investment trust which invests in scores of companies. 'The vast majority of
managed Peps are either unit or investment trust Peps,' says Roz Barder of
Chase de Vere, the financial adviser which produces a PepGuide. She adds:
'More and more companies offering unit or investment trusts do not charge
any extra for putting the investment in a Pep.'
If you were thinking of investing in the stock market through one of these
vehicles, you might as well do so with a Pep. There might be a small
additional charge for going into the Pep - about 0.5 per cent a year because
of the increased administration of reclaiming tax on dividends.
Unit trusts commonly have an initial charge of 5-6 per cent and an annual
management charge of 1 or 1.5 per cent. Buying into an investment trust will
involve stockbroker's commission and stamp duty; annual management fees are
normally under 1 per cent.
Barder expects the abolition of the Pounds 3,000 limit on unit trust and
investment trust Peps to lead to lower charges by the plan managers. This is
because it will no longer be necessary to 'top-up' these Peps with blue-chip
shares to make up the full Pounds 6,000.
Investment trusts highlighted by Chase de Vere as good performers are Touche
Remnant's City of London and Fleming Claverhouse.
Touch Remnant has a 5 per cent initial charge and dealing charges are 0.3
per cent. If the Pep is invested solely in investment trust companies, the
annual management charge is 1 per cent; on equity investment, it is 1.5 per
cent.
Charges at Fleming comprise a 1.5 per cent initial fee, while the annual
charge is Pounds 25 and transaction charges are 1.75 per cent.
On the unit trust side, Barder recommends James Capel and Eagle Star.
Capel's unit trust-only Pep charges 5.25 per cent initial (an all-in fee)
while Eagle Star charges 6 per cent initial with a 1 per cent annual
management fee.
Unfortunately, the government's geographical restrictions on Peps mean that
the broadly-based international trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial, still do
not qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 allowance.
Self-select Peps
These are much cheaper than the managed Peps because you are not paying for
advice. But you have to be confident about your own ability to select
shares. If you are, then price is the main reason for choosing this method.
There are a number of Pep plan managers who make no initial or annual charge
for dealing in shares. These include Killik (071-224-2050), Pilling
(061-832-6581), Reyker Securities (071-499-9097) and Sharelink
(021-200-4545). The commission on dealings at Killik is 1.65 per cent,
subject to a Pounds 40 minimum, but there is a separate charge of Pounds
7.50 for dividend collection.
Sharelink also has no initial fee. It has an annual administration fee
(which will cover dividend collection) of 0.75 per cent, subject to a
minimum of Pounds 20. Dealing charges are 1.5 per cent, with a minimum of
Pounds 17.50 and a maximum of Pounds 37.50.
When selecting the shares for your Pep, you need to ensure that the choices
reflect your tax situation. Those who are buying a Pep for the income tax
saving obviously need to choose those with a decent yield; there is, for
example, no point in placing zero coupon preference shares in a Pep unless
you are a regular CGT payer.

<TEXT>
Whitbread will open a round of brewers' results on Monday by reporting its
first fall in earnings for 16 years. The impact of the recession,
culminating in a Pounds 37m provision for bad and doubtful debts, is
expected to reduce full-year pre-tax profits by more than 20 per cent to
between Pounds 225m and Pounds 230m.
Market forecasts for Allied-Lyons on Tuesday suggest pre-tax profits in the
new management's inaugural year of about Pounds 635m - marginally ahead,
excluding last year's Pounds 147m on foreign currency dealings. The results
are likely to have less influence on sentiment than statements about the
group's plans for the future and the benefits expected from restructuring.
Interim results from Bass on Wednesday should show a 20 per cent rise to
Pounds 263m on last year's weak first half. The country's leading brewer is
continuing to benefit from cost savings from brewery closures, but pub sales
to comply with the government beer orders will hit retailing profits.
At least Pounds 290m pre-tax for the year to March is expected from British
Airways, which reports its finals on Tuesday, against a Gulf crisis-affected
Pounds 130m. Strong second and third quarters lie behind the recovery.
BOC, the chemicals group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 166m on Tuesday. This compares with Pounds 144.7m last year,
when the figure was depressed by some above-the-line charges.
Courtaulds, also in the chemicals sector, reports full-year results on
Wednesday. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 200m are expected, compared with
Pounds 186.3m. Attention will focus on performance materials and the quality
of business in fibres and films.
Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK's composite insurers, could
show a slight fall in pre-tax losses to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 25m
when it reports its first-quarter results on Wednesday. CU will benefit from
premium rate increases in the UK.
With continuing overcapacity in milling and baking, the interim pre-tax
outcome at Ranks Hovis McDougall looks set to fall sharply. Estimates for a
tough first half, to be reported on Wednesday, range from Pounds 50m to
Pounds 52m, down from Pounds 76.5m.
BT, the telecommunications group, is expected on Thursday to report pre-tax
profits for the year to the end of March marginally up on the previous
year's Pounds 3.07bn. Profit growth has been held back by the recession,
competition from Mercury Communications and a tighter price cap.
Storehouse, the retailing conglomerate which owns BhS, Habitat, Mothercare,
Richard Shops and Blazer, will announce a mixed bag of trading fortunes when
it reveals its annual results on Thursday. Although group profits are likely
to be down from Pounds 21m to Pounds 13.5m, there should be progress on
several fronts, particularly at BhS.
Also on Thursday, Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway chain of
supermarkets, will demonstrate the continued resilience of food retailing as
it looks likely to lift yearly pre-tax profits by about a quarter to Pounds
360m.

IF YOU are an employee, you will know that one of the main effects of the
recession is to depress salaries. Unfortunately, most employers look at
cutting costs in this area. However, there is a way that an astute employer
can introduce a pay rise without incurring much additional cost on his part.
By introducing profit-related pay (PRP) as part of remuneration your
employer may encourage you to take an interest in the business in which you
work, together with other employees. In exchange for the risk, as employees
you will receive an exemption from tax (but not national insurance) on the
profit-related element of your salary. As an employee, you will benefit from
the tax relief which may amount to Pounds 1,600 annually for a higher rate
taxpayer and up to Pounds 1,000 for a basic rate taxpayer.
What perhaps has not so far been considered in detail by advocates of PRP is
that the profit-related element may be introduced as a substitute for part
of an employee's wages. The employee should not lose out because the
employer can make PRP-related monthly payments in advance on the profits
actually being announced.
The employer will of course be taking a risk. In PRP schemes, if more PRP is
paid out than is strictly due (because of, for example, an unexpected fall
in profits) the Inland Revenue could cancel the registration of the scheme
retrospectively and all tax relief may be recovered from the scheme
employer.
Your employer has to do his sums correctly and take the right professional
help. But how can he predict profits in these uncertain times? It depends on
several factors. Obviously, the employer has not got a crystal ball but he
can minimise his risks under the scheme as it stands. There are two methods
of calculating the amounts of distributable profits under the scheme rules:
A and B.
Although Method A is much easier to use and generally recommended, the
profits are distributed according to a formula based on the profits in the
current period. This is not possible to predict accurately so it is not
recommended in this particular case.
The use of Method B reduces the employer's risk as the employer works out
his distributable profits based on the concept of a notional amount (say,
Pounds 10,000) which he fixes for the first year in which he runs the
scheme. If he keeps the length of the scheme as one year only, the rules
offer him the scope to set up a new scheme the following year.
The rules allow the effect of profit swings to be dampened. In addition, a
lower percentage limit can be introduced below which profits will not be
distributed. Your employer can therefore make PRP payments in advance with
far greater certainty. However, if there is a loss the Inland Revenue may
recover the excess tax relief from him so he must be relatively confident
that some profits will be produced.
What your employer cannot do is guarantee a percentage of profits in
advance. It appears that the Inland Revenue is automatically rejecting such
schemes. If, for example, your employer tried to convince his employees to
take a fixed guaranteed payment from the PRP scheme in exchange for a salary
cut - the scheme would be unlikely to be registered by the Inland Revenue.
It does appear that the Inland Revenue requires some element of risk from
the employees as being in keeping with the spirit of the scheme.
If your employer is a limited company, introducing PRP involves little
additional cost other than agreeing the scheme with the Revenue and the
administrative expenses. If he is a sole trader or partnership he will have
to make his results public for the first time, and undergo an audit for the
purposes of the scheme. In exchange he may obtain a more committed
workforce.
If introduced at the right time PRP may well contribute to the business as
well as giving the employees a sense that they are participating in the
profits of the company. As there is a move out of recession, employers may
be able to make use of the above method of introducing PRP to the advantage
of both the business and their employees.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: New packages of Peps launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW range of packaged personal equity plans has been launched by River &amp;
Mercantile, the fund management group, in the wake of the new Pounds 6,000
limit for investment trust plans.
There are three packages: high income, capital growth, and income and
growth. Each uses shares in River &amp; Mercantile's various split capital
investment trusts.
The high-income plan uses a combination of ordinary income, income and
stepped preference shares to create a desired income yield of 10.5 per cent
per annum (before charges). There is a risk of capital loss, however, with
this plan; the assets and dividends of the trust need to grow at 2.5 per
cent per annum for investors to receive their money back.
The capital growth plan uses a combination of stepped preference and capital
shares. Use of the stepped preference shares ensures a nominal (2.1 per
cent) yield to cover the charges. But the plan is designed for those who
want to back a rising stock market, and who regularly pay capital gains tax.
If the assets and dividends of the trusts grow by 5 per cent a year, the
gross redemption yield (before charges) will be 12.2 per cent per annum; if
they grow at 7.5 per cent per year, the yield will be 15.4 per cent. The
downside is that if assets and dividends do not grow at all, the yield will
be just 5.9 per cent.
The income and growth plan will invest in stepped preference, income and
ordinary split capital shares and will aim for an income yield (before
charges) of 8.9 per cent. If the assets and dividends of the trusts grow at
5 per cent a year, then the gross redemption yield will be 12.2 per cent per
annum.
There is a 4 per cent initial charge and a 1.5 per cent annual charge on all
of the plans. That means for those investing the full Pounds 6,000, the
first year's charge is Pounds 330. The income tax saving on the highest
yielding plan will be Pounds 157.50 for a basic rate taxpayer and Pounds 252
for a top rate taxpayer, so it will take a couple of years or so to recoup
the charges in tax savings.
One further caveat is that the trusts in which the plans invest are set to
be wound up in 1999 and 2000. Anyone wanting to invest beyond that date must
depend on River &amp; Mercantile's success, either in extending the trusts'
lives, or in launching new ones.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: O&amp;Y and the small investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE builders of as confident a landmark as the Canary Wharf tower ask
for protection from their creditors, it can only be expected to dent
investors' confidence.
Yesterday, markets showed an understandable reaction to the news of O&amp;Y's
difficulties. The share prices of banks exposed to O&amp;Y, and other property
companies, dipped sharply.
But it remains unclear that what could be the biggest liquidation in
corporate history will have any severe impact on private investors.
For a start, O&amp;Y is a privately owned company, so no pooled funds will have
direct exposure to it - although losses may be borne via holdings in banks
which stand to lose out.
What of the impact on the property market? It is difficult to claim that
this is good news for property, but private investors' exposure to it via
collective funds has declined drastically in recent years. According to
Combined Actuarial Performance Services, mixed collective funds had an
average holding of only 4 per cent in property at the end of 1991. For
pension funds this figure is only 2 per cent, down from 10 per cent ten
years earlier.
However, bigger pension funds, defined by CAPS as having a market value of
more than Pounds 500m, have a larger proportion in property - around 8 per
cent. It seems unlikely that there is much misery in store for investors on
this front.
There are a number of ways in which O&amp;Y's difficulties could be felt in
investors' pockets. The most direct would be tax shelter investments which
take advantage of 100 per cent tax reliefs available on enterprise zone
property. Docklands is no longer an enterprise zone, but it will be possible
to benefit from the tax reliefs for another two years. This is usually done
using enterprise zone 'trusts' or syndicated deals where the ownership of a
large block is shared between a large number of investors.
O&amp;Y itself tried to launch the biggest EZT ever in February, to fund a
building in Cabot Square, Canary Wharf.
It was withdrawn in March, and demand for it had already been seriously
dented by O&amp;Y's financial difficulties.
With hindsight, the demise of the deal, on which the only guarantee for rent
came from O&amp;Y itself, will not be deeply lamented - even though US bank
Morgan Guaranty guaranteed that there would be no loss in capital value over
ten years.
Other EZT deals in Docklands are also looking rather sticky. CET7, the last
EZT deal of 1991-92, failed to reach its full subscription target, and the
final structure of the deal for investors is still not clear.
Against this background, O&amp;Y's call for help might almost be an advantage,
as it removes uncertainty, and might even mean that eventually some Canary
Wharf buildings will be available for EZT deals.
Analysts also seem to feel that so much bad news about O&amp;Y was already in
Docklands rent prices that an orderly process of disentangling the company's
debts is now actually one of the best possible outcomes. Rents have fallen
so low that it is now difficult to claim that there is a 'false market' in
Docklands property.
It cannot be good news that the world's largest property developer is in
this kind of trouble, but at the moment it seems unlikely that small
investors will feel many of the shockwaves.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Watchdogs focus on pensions sales -
Disquiet deepens over the transfers business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT watchdogs closed in on irresponsible pension salespeople this
week in the wake of deepening disquiet over the selling of personal pensions
to members of company schemes.
On Thursday, the monitoring committee of Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) met to consider disciplinary action
relating to pension transfer business against a large direct selling
insurance company.
Mike Abrahams, Lautro's chief enforcement officer, said six other companies
were under investigation, all in connection with transfers from the same
company scheme.
He explained that the investigations arose from complaints by company
pension schemes which had lost a large number of members to apparently less
generous personal pensions. Some questioned whether the sales people
concerned were genuinely meeting the standards of best advice set by the
regulator.
Lautro has prepared draft guidelines for companies on pension transfers
which set out, in specific terms, the factors salespeople should assess in
deciding whether a customer should leave a company scheme to buy a personal
pension. The guidelines could be bought into force within three to five
weeks.
Lautro already requires sales representatives to take the investor through
the detailed pros and cons. But a survey of more than 200 transfers made
from the J Bibby &amp; Son pension scheme over the past two years suggests that
observation of this rule is sketchy.
Administering transfers on behalf of Bibby, consulting actuaries IS
Cartwright of Godalming found that 15 per cent of sales people immediately
told clients they needed a transfer before knowing how much money would be
involved. This applied to independent intermediaries as well as
representatives selling exclusively for one company.
'Some just write in and say send a cheque,' said the firm's Ian Cartwright,
'For all they know, they could be taking a transfer of Pounds 1, as opposed
to a deferred pension of Pounds 30,000 a year. It amazes me when they are
supposed to give best advice'.
Only 30 per cent of sales people asked for information about increases to
pensions once they are being paid in retirement - Bibby gives a guaranteed 5
per cent. Nobody asked about the company's record of giving discretionary
increases above this.
None of the sales people asked about equalising pension ages for men and
women, which meant that men who transferred before Bibby introduced a common
pension age of 63 lost out, since the change was backdated to May 1990.
Cartwright also noticed that not a single sales person asked on what basis
the scheme calculated its transfer values or requested recalculation to take
account of any fall in interest rates following an initial quotation.
The effect of ignoring this is to understate the value of the company
pension or to lose a customer as much as 30 per cent of what might be a
substantial amount. Transfers from Bibby in the past two years have ranged
from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 200,000 with a norm of between Pounds 5,000 and
Pounds 10,000.
Despite Bibby's offer to pay for independent advice for employees, only 10
per cent of transfers came through independents. The remainder appeared to
be handled mainly by representatives of Refuge, Pearl, Britannic and, to a
lesser extent, Allied Dunbar.
Most of these companies say they require representatives to conduct full
fact-finds on the customer and to provide a comparison of the relative
benefits of the company scheme and a personal pension.
Refuge issued seven pages of pension transfer guidelines to sales staff in
January 1992, including questions that must be asked of company schemes.
Steve Conley, pensions product manager at Refuge, said sales people might
not need to ask questions about schemes they already knew well, adding that
many companies now handed out all the detailed information required as a
matter of course.
Refuge's guidelines say: 'The customer must on no occasion be advised to
transfer. Sales personnel provide information and in the light of this
information the customer must be the one to make the decision.'
'We are not trying to avoid liability,' said Conley, 'If people are not
given proper information or are misled in any way the company is liable for
any consequences.'
Reacting to the most frequent cause of complaint prior to January, Refuge
also warns staff that transfers 'may be inadvisable' for customers within 15
years or so of retirement, because of the impact of initial costs, but tells
them to consider each case on its individual merits.
At Allied Dunbar, Tony Reardon, a divisional director, said that the company
had cracked down on cases submitted without fact-finds and that
execution-only pensions business accounted for less than one per cent of the
total. He estimated complaints at one or two a month or about half a per
cent of transfers.
Reardon said that notes on transfers values accompanied every personal
pension application. Customers had to sign a statement confirming their
understanding of the information given and wish to proceed.
The National Association of Pension Funds has expressed concern to Lautro
about the sales methods of some personal pension providers, but a recent
survey of NAPF schemes showed only 70 per cent willing to allow re-admission
to people who had transferred out.
'Some members do take a hard line,' said Mike Brown of the NAPF, 'But if an
individual really had been given bad advice, they might be more
sympathetic.'

FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Prospects look good for the private
investor - Fund managers give their views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market has enjoyed a month of euphoria after the
re-election of the Conservatives. Even after the share price falls of
yesterday and Thursday, the FT-SE 100 Index is still trading over 10 per
cent above its level on April 8.
The prospect of five years of Conservative government, and of a rebound from
the recession, has encouraged traders to buy shares in anticipation of a
corporate profits recovery.
The FT 500 Index was trading on a historic price-earnings ratio of 16.5 at
the close of Thursday's trading, compared with an average of 11.6 since Mrs
Thatcher was first elected in May 1979.
The yield on the All-Share Index is now around 4.5 per cent, below the
1979-92 average of 4.9 per cent and well below the 5.7 per cent recorded at
the start of 1991.
So have private investors missed the boat? If they buy shares now, will they
be making the mistake that so many have done in the past - that is, plunging
into shares at the top of the market? Or do shares still represent good
value on a medium or long term view?
We asked a number of experienced fund managers to give their views on the
likely future direction of UK share prices.
Michael Hart, joint manager of the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, is
hopeful about the view to the end of the year. 'We might get interest rates
coming down a bit and see some evidence of profits recovery', he says.
However, Hart adds that there is the prospect of a setback in the short
term, with rights issues and the occasional bad result, restraining the
market. At the start of 1992, he was talking about 2,800 on the Footsie, but
now he thinks 2,900 may be possible by the end of the year.
Leonard Klahr of Capel-Cure Asset Management says that 'on a valuation
basis, the market certainly doesn't look cheap, apart from the yield ratio
(the relationship of gilt to equity yields)'.
'There are some good signs, however,' he adds. 'The outlook for inflation is
still good, and Wall Street has been performing well.' Like Hart, Klahr
feels that the market may be ahead of itself in the short term but he does
not see any setback being significant.
Julian St Lawrence, who manages the Capital unit trust for Framlington says
that 'Footsie is clearly breaking out into a new range, but in the short
term will need to consolidate at this sort of level'. There is scope,
according to St Lawrence, for the small company shares to catch up with the
large company shares.
St Lawrence also feels that this recovery may be different from previous
cycles. 'In past recoveries,' he says, 'producers of commodity type products
saw the benefit of increased margins.
'This time companies may need to see sales grow in order to increase
profits.' The task therefore is to look for companies in growth markets or
those that can take market share from competitors.
Like Hart and Klahr, St Lawrence sees scope for a short-term downturn in
share prices. 'If everyone's optimistic then it's not long before people
start having their doubts,' he says.
Kenneth Inglis, investment director at Allied Dunbar, is optimistic about
the long term outlook for the market but does not foresee a swift rise. 'The
market is barely 10 per cent higher than it reached in 1987, so we haven't
got that far in five years,' he says. So the market is 'hardly ludicrously
expensive compared with other markets or even with itself'.
However, he thinks those wanting to make big commitments should stagger
their investment as a precautionary measure. 'The recovery is likely to be
patchy so there may be unpleasant surprises'.
But for the most part, Inglis feels that the market should increase steadily
in a tempered way with no great upsurge. It is unlikely to take off until
small companies come back into the market - for that to happen, the banks
have to restore their health and Inglis sees this taking at least another
two years.
'The downphase in the US for small companies lasted six to seven years but
it is now starting up again. We peaked in the late '80s, so that suggests it
won't be until the middle of the decade that small companies come back into
the market,' he says.
Investors can forget about quick gains. 'They should think of holding their
stock in terms of five years rather than three. In fact, the longer the
better' concludes Inglis.
Paul Laband, deputy managing director at Abbey Life Investment Services,
disagrees. 'Normally we would advise investors to keep their investment for
at least five years, but my tactical view is that there is money to be made
in the next two years in the UK market.'
This, he says, is because he anticipates UK gilt yields falling closer to
those of Germany (currently around 7.8 to 8 per cent) in over a year's time.
If this happens the Footsie could rise to 3,100.
'As we move to lower inflation, risk premiums on equities diminish which has
the effect of pulling equities up relative to gilts,' he says. 'Once you are
in a low inflation environment the situation changes. Provided there is some
growth, you would still anticipate equities giving a higher return than
gilts but the differential should narrow.'
Richard Hughes, manager of the Recovery fund at M&amp;G Securities, thinks that
the rise in the market since the general election will not appear dramatic
in the fullness of time. 'In the past year, the market has been up by 10 per
cent while the yield on gilts has come down by 10 per cent.' Like Laband and
Inglis, he thinks it is a good time for investors to go in.
'Before the election obviously would have been better but equity investment
is a long-term strategy. The UK market at the moment is well underpinned by
the yield on the All-Share and with inflation falling, it will continue to
look attractive. Fundamentally, it's a cheap market,' he says.
However, any pauses in the economic recovery could mean setbacks for the
market but investors who go in with a view to holding on for the long term
will be rewarded. Even in the short-term, 'the return on shares should be
comfortably ahead of the building societies over the next 12 months.'

It was another good week for small company shares, which seem to be enjoying

Friends Provident, which announced a cut in its terminal bonus rates on with

Some policy holders, such as Mr Lemer, whose case we highlighted last week,
received a letter detailing a maturity value; this was subsequently

'It upset a number of people,' said Graham Aslet, general manager. 'We have

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has long specialised in issuing
fixed-rate mortgages which undercut the rest of the market.
Its latest fixed-rate offering, launched on Friday, is probably the most
attractively priced fixed rate mortgage product to appear on the market
since 1988.
Interest charged is 9.4 per cent (10.8 per cent APR) and the loans are
available for interest-only or repayment or endowment mortgages. Loans on
remortgages must be 90 per cent of valuation or below.
An fee of Pounds 250 is payble on application and there is a six months
gross interest penalty for early redemption within the five year period.
There are no other strings attached. See also Page V.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: Trafalgar's promises spoilt by today's reality -
The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House is no longer a conglomerate. On Tuesday, Sir Eric Parker,
chairman, gave a presentation, along with his line managers and senior
executives, to unveil the face of the new Trafalgar: a construction and
engineering company.
However, the transformation from shipping to construction combine to
specialist high-tech engineering company was too breathless for most
analysts and fund managers to accept.
Those contacted by the FT said that they understood where Sir Eric wanted to
take Trafalgar - they just differed over his analysis of what had already
taken place.
Mike Smith, conglomerates analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said: 'There
was nothing in the seminar that made me want to say 'here is a changed
company which is likely to make good profits in the long-term'.'
The problem for Trafalgar is that today's reality is significantly different
from tomorrow's promise. Too much capital is tied up in unprofitable areas
away from the the construction and engineering core. Consider the following:
The hotels are presently unsaleable. There was a time when the group turned
up its nose at offers of about Pounds 150m for the Ritz which it bought for
just Pounds 3m in 1976. Those were the days.
Unfortunately for Sir Eric those days have long past. There have been no
sales in the five-star category for two years which is why Sir Eric was able
to scotch rumours that imminent disposals were likely.
The Cunard fleet of five-star ships poses similar problems. There have been
trade buyers but the only real rival in the five-star market is Vard,
Norwegian owner of Kloster Cruise, which also owns the Royal Viking Line at
the luxury end of the market.
If Sir Eric could sell the fleet he would probably do so. Since this is not
a practical solution he would like to upgrade the two four-star ships but
admits that this is not likely in the short-term.
Gearing by the September year-end is likely to be between 60 and 70 per cent
and heading higher - in part because of working capital demands for
construction and engineering.
That is a surprise, given the cash generative nature of the core businesses.
Advance corporation tax remains a problem, although the halved dividend has
cut the first half tax rate from 47 to 35 per cent. However, if UK earnings
remain poor, the tax rate is likely to prove higher than for most comparable
companies.
Sir Eric admitted that Trafalgar had a lot of assets in properties and
leisure. 'There is no quick fix but I think the analysts and fund managers
thought we gave a good presentation and know where we are heading,' he said.
Trafalgar's credentials as an engineering and construction operator do look
impressive. Its order book is a shade under Pounds 4bn and construction and
engineering now accounts for the bulk of its pre-tax profits and turnover.
So why not compare it to Bechtel or Fluor in the US, asks Sir Eric. David
Ireland, conglomerates analyst at Hoare Govett, says that while they are
similar in scale - Bechtel had revenues of Dollars 7.5bn last year while
Fluor is projected to have engineering and construction turnover of Dollars
6bn - big differences which makes comparisons difficult.
Bechtel is private, while Fluor derives 90 per cent of its profits from the
US (Trafalgar has a significant Asian and UK presence in engineering and
construction).
Nor is there any word from Sir Eric on how Trafalgar's margins relate to
those of its competitors.
There is also a nagging feeling among some of its shareholders that the
'free wheeling-dealings' days of the conglomerate of old are not over.
One institutional shareholder said: 'Trafalgar's presentation on its
corporate strategy made me wonder whether it had learnt that too many of its
deals of past ended up with it setting aside provisions. That has to stop.'
If Trafalgar wants to be accepted as a successful construction and
engineering company with good prospects of long-term growth it will need to
disclose more than just its good intentions.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: Daylight at last for capital shares - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REMEMBER those weather houses where one figure emerges if it is raining and
the other if it is fine? The shares of split capital investment trusts are
rather like that. Until recently, the dull conditions of the UK stock market
have kept capital shares inside the house in the dark. They will be repaid
only after all the other assets of a split capital trust have claimed their
due. Thus, they depend on a healthy rate of asset growth to bring their
investors a decent return (in some cases, any return at all). Without rising
share prices, the average share capital fell 5.6 per cent in the three years
to April 30, according to Micropal.
Since the re-election of the Conservatives the sun has, metaphorically, been
shining and the London stock market has surged ahead. And, sure enough,
capital shares have emerged into the daylight. The best-performing
investment trust shares in April were the capital shares of Scottish
National, which rose by 88.2 per cent] A number of other capital shares,
including those of M&amp;G Income, rose by more than 20 per cent.
Until now, capital shares have tended to be neglected by the private
investor because they offer neither income nor security. The class of shares
that has really been tucked away is the zero coupon. These can also offer
tax-free double-digit returns, at least to those who do not expect to use up
their capital gains tax allowances (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93). And they can
do so without much risk of capital loss, unlike some income shares.
The double-digit yields available on income shares, particularly when placed
in a personal equity plan, have obvious attractions. Until the election,
though, income shares had appeared to be joining capital shares in the dingy
confines of the weather house. The main worry was that, to produce the
dividend stream, splits have to invest in high-yielding listed stocks. Not
only have such companies been hit badly by the recession but it is probable
that dividend growth will be much slower in the 1990s than the 1980s. All
this meant that the income share sector fell 7.3 per cent over the six
months to end-April (and that includes a post-election rally).
David Thomas, the investment trust expert at stockbroker Greig Middleton,
argues that income shares are now cheap and favours M&amp;G Dual and SPLIT, in
particular. He says the market has now set prices which assume only very
minimal future dividend growth. Lewis Aaron, analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. agrees. He points out that some income shares have little risk; their
repayment values are covered by assets. He cites the income shares of River
&amp; Mercantile which, he says, will yield 10.88 per cent to maturity without
any dividend growth.
Investors should, however, always be aware of what they are buying in the
income share field. In some cases, the shares have no repayment value at
all; in others, the repayment value may be geared to the asset performance
of the trust. In other words, the income could come at the expense of a
capital loss. This is a field where you should be guided by your
stockbroker.
Indeed, there is a more fundamental question to deal with here. As recounted
before, there are some who argue that the whole split capital sector could
be riding for a fall. The investors who were sucked in during the new issue
boom may not have realised what they were buying.
Peter Walls of Laing &amp; Cruickshank argued recently that many split trusts
are trading at a premium to their net assets. Eventually, that premium must
be eliminated, which means that the shares of the trust must underperform
the assets. Why buy such shares, therefore, when you can buy shares in a
general trust which are trading at a discount?
Thomas, in contrast, is a devoted enthusiast for the split sector. His
argument is based on the fact that split trusts are 'dated'; in other words,
there is a given day on which they will be repaid. The share price is a
reflection of the 'present value' of that future repayment level.
This present value is highly sensitive to interest rates. Asked if you would
rather have Pounds 10 now, or Pounds 10 in 10 year's time, the logical
person would opt for the money up front. If the money on offer increased to
Pounds 20 after 10 years, the calculation might be more difficult. The
rational way of making the decision would be to ask how much Pounds 10 would
be worth if invested for the next 10 years - and that depends on interest
rates.
If interest rates are 10 per cent, then Pounds 10 now will be worth Pounds
11 in one year's time. If rates are 5 per cent, then it will be worth just
Pounds 10.50. Turn the equation round and it is clear that a fall in
interest rates will increase the present value of any given future sum.
The general expectation is that interest rates are set to fall in the medium
term. So, to return to Thomas's argument: 'The repayment figure (of splits)
is going to rise. The level of dividends will rise as well'. Add-in falling
interest rates and Thomas says the prices of dated shares will rise very
sharply.
Whether or not you accept his arguments, it seems clear that the split
capital sector is going to offer some interesting opportunities for private
investors over the next few years. But selecting the right opportunities -
the 'sunny day' shares - will continue to be a difficult game, requiring
good advice.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: The little guys get their selling in first - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IGNORING the good economic news (low inflation, rising retail sales and
industrial output) and the bad corporate news (Olympia &amp; York's bankruptcy),
the stock market pursued its own, primarily technical, agenda this week.
Typical of the mood on Wall Street was its reaction to Monday's
record-setting gains, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an
all-time high of 3,397.58. As soon as the new peak was reached, analysts and
traders warned not to expect much more from a market that had stumbled, not
bounded, the last few steps to the top.
Trading volume on the Monday was light at 155m shares, an indication that
enthusiasm for stocks may be waning. The fact that once again the broader
market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks, failed to match the Dow's achievements was another
bad omen.
The Dow has outperformed because investors have been increasingly choosy
about where they put their money, and with many still uncertain about the
short-term outlook for interest rates and the economy, the buyers have
tended to seek out quality stocks such as General Electric, Wal-Mart, GTE
and IBM.
Analysts say a typical sign of the end of a short-term upward trend is when
familiar names post gains but no-one else does, a result of investors
topping up their portfolios with blue-chips and staying away from much of
the rest.
The sight of the Dow near 3,400 has made the market take stock of itself. It
begs an obvious question: should the market be up at these heights? The
answer, judging by this week's trading, is probably not. Sure, the recovery
is under way, but everyone now knows that because of structural problems in
the economy, mostly to do with debt, the rebound will be slower than it
would normally be coming out of a recession.
Also, the market may not get any more help from the Federal Reserve. Hopes
of another interest rate cut had risen steadily coming into this week,
primarily in expectation that if money supply growth continued to falter the
Fed would be forced to step in with some extra monetary stimulus.
Thursday's money numbers, however, dented those hopes. The money measure the
Fed tracks most closely, M2 (currency and most interest-bearing accounts),
showed an increase of Dollars 9.8bn during the first week of May, a sharp
reversal of previous declines. Crucially, the latest rise took M2 growth
back above the low end of the Fed's target range of 2.5 per cent to 6.5 per
cent.
Nice round numbers like 3,400 on the Dow also make investors nervous because
they invoke fears that the big funds may have programmed their computers to
sell when the index breaks through what is inevitably termed a new
'psychologically important level'. When smaller investors worry about the
big boys selling, they often try get their retaliation in first.
This was certainly the pattern after Monday. Every time the Dow inched near
3,400, selling kicked in as profit-takers rushed to book some of their
recent profits. Once the feeling that some sort of short-term 'correction'
has taken hold, as appears to have happened this week, it can be difficult
to dislodge.
Even favourable economic figures failed to shift the sellers. The week's
inflation numbers were reassuring, with both consumer and producer prices
rising just 0.2 per cent in April. If the Fed really does want to ease
monetary policy again, the inflation figures have provided plenty of room
for manoeuvre.
Signs of life in personal spending were also evident in a 0.9 per cent
increase in last month's retail sales, while April industrial production
rose a solid 0.5 per cent, the third consecutive monthly improvement in
output.
On the corporate front, the news that Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest
property developer, had filed for protection from its creditors under
Canadian and US insolvency laws ensured the market ended the week on a sour
note.
Although O &amp; Y's descent into bankruptcy was not unexpected, it underscored
the problems facing north America's commercial property market and those US
and Canadian banks which lent vast sums to fund property expansion in the
1980s.
Monday     3397.58 + 28.17
Tuesday    3385.12 - 12.46
Wednesday  3391.98 +  6.86
Thursday   3368.88 - 23.10

FT  16 MAY 92 / London Markets: Olympia &amp; York casts a long shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRIGHT flashing light in the eastern evening sky has been puzzling
Londoners for some time. Was it a rising star? Did it signify a birth? Now
we know. It was a warning beacon.
By day the source of the glow can be seen through the city haze. It is the
tower at Canary Wharf, the Pounds 3bn docklands development, part of the
Olympia &amp; York Developments empire, whose main holding companies in Canada
and the US have filed for protection from creditors.
Although Canary Wharf is still, in theory, solvent, the filing cast a longer
shadow over the City than that thrown by the giant office block on the Isle
of Dogs.
O &amp; Y's problems were so well known that the immediate effect of the news on
the market was not as severe as might be supposed from the the world's
biggest ever bankruptcy. Bank and property shares fell, but not a lot.
Shares in Barclays, the UK bank with the greatest exposure to O &amp; Y, fell 6p
to 280p yesterday. But the effect on sentiment in the next few weeks may be
deeper if Canary Wharf goes into administration.
After the previous week's enthusiasm which took the FT-SE 100 index to a
record high, the market has been tested by a series of poor corporate and
economic figures. The FT-SE 100's peak for the week was on Monday morning
when it touched 2744.5. But by Thursday it slipped below the 2700 level
again, and it closed yesterday at 2682.6, down 43.1 over the week.
This week the market suffered its first significant setback since the
election, a correction dismissed by the bulls as 'blowing the froth off the
market'. Given that the post-election rise topped 300 points, a 40-odd point
retreat is not much of a fall.
On the positive side, turnover in the market, which had been high as the
market rose, was minimal yesterday. This suggests that there is not much
real selling.
One of the main foundations of the market's recent rise has been the idea
that the UK has entered an era of low inflation, indeed that the miracle of
simultaneous low inflation and economic growth was about to be performed.
That view was somewhat dented this week by the latest economic statistics.
The market is fairly callous about unemployment, which in any case is a
lagging measure. But a sharper than expected rise of 42,600 in April
reported this week at the same time as an increase in average earnings of
7.5 per cent in the year to March, suggests that there are still
inflationary pressures in the system in spite of the weak economy.
Friday's retail price index - showing a year on year rise of 4.3 per cent in
April, up from 4 per cent in March - was not as high as some commentators
had feared. But as the chart shows, the Tory government has not been
conspicuously successful in getting unemployment to come down without
inflation rising. Or vice versa. The question is whether sterling's entry to
the ERM will have changed expectations sufficiently and it is one which will
be asked repeatedly in the months ahead.
However, on Monday BTR the conglomerate, took the same view as Hanson did at
the end of last week, that it was time to sell. BTR sold its 4.1 per cent
stake in Pilkington, the glass group, to Smith New Court, the broker. But,
as with Hanson's ICI stake last week, the subsequent placing did not meet
with overwhelming demand.
This may put off some companies which were expected to be flooding the
market with rights issues. But the example of BICC, the cables group, this
week is more encouraging. Its Pounds 154m issue - not yet a big mouthful for
the market but the largest since the election - was well received and BICC's
shares rose, partly as it promised to hold the dividend, although it was not
covered last year.
Corporate financiers are expecting further rights issues to be of a
'restructuring' nature as companies look to replace bank debt with equity.
The O &amp; Y experience will no doubt concentrate minds, while WPP, the
advertising group, this week announced the terms of the refinancing package
it is putting to banks.
The relative lack of rights issues has been matched by a similar scarcity of
big bids. There had been hopes that the positive election result would lead
to a stream of takeovers, but so far few have materialised. One such is the
Lloyds bid for Midland, which was still carefully referred to as the
'possible offer' in a detailed letter sent by the aggressor to Midland
shareholders yesterday pressing its case.
Among those bids that have appeared, TI, the engineering group, this week
declared its Pounds 500m-plus offer for Dowty final, signalling its
expectation to win hands down without having to increase it. Robert Bosch,
the German conglomerate, tied up its agreed bid for Worcester Group, the
central heating boiler maker. Yesterday Greene King started the long-awaited
shake up of the regional brewing industry with a Pounds 100m-plus bid for
Morland.
On balance, the guide to the progress of recession coming from companies was
still gloomy this week. Chairmen have been telling annual meetings that
there are few signs of an upturn in the early months of the current year.
Even the giants of the retail world, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury,
which each reported annual results this week, cannot see newly-confident
consumers rushing to their shops. Though both increased profits, and
Sainsbury overtook M and S as the most profitable UK retailer, the company
put that down to its own efforts rather than to an improvement in trade.
Further away from the supposed consumer-led recovery, Hanson, the
Anglo-American conglomerate, suffered a Pounds 100m fall in first half
profits to Pounds 488m and looks set to lose its record of unbroken earnings
per share growth.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Long View: What's good for the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DE-LEVERAGING of Corporate America has been continuing apace. But have
small investors in the US been too enthusiastic in playing their part in
Wall Street's push to new bull market highs? Don't they remember 1987?
With the collapse of Tokyo, Wall Street has again become the world's
dominant stock market. Recently it has accounted for about 41 per cent of
global market capitalisation. Yet just as international investors were
feeling uncomfortable about the Japanese equity market as it approached its
peaks in 1989 (actually getting to about 45 per cent of the world market) so
the global investors are now being sniffy about the US.
Look at British pension funds. They have 25 per cent of their portfolios in
overseas equities, and given that the US represents 47 per cent of the World
ex-UK market capitalisation, they might be expected to have 12 per cent in
the US. In fact, they only have 6 per cent on average. In the curious way
that fund managers think, that represents a very big bet against Wall
Street.
You can argue that the American company sector thinks in much the same way
about the values currently obtaining in the US stock market. Remember that
in 1988 and 1989, in the wake of the crash, US corporations were eagerly
buying in their equity from the public at levels of 2,000 to 2,500 on the
Dow Jones average. In many cases this turned out to be a bad mistake as
overborrowed companies collapsed in the recession. However, the American
corporate sector is now pouring out new equity to the tune of some Dollars
80bn a year. This is happening with the Dow well over 3,000. This looks like
a profitable in-and-out move which is good for America, but is it good for
American investors?
The buyers of all this new paper are not primarily the long-term
institutions: indeed, many of the US pension funds are busy with plans to
raise the overseas content of their equity portfolios from 5 to between 10
and 15 per cent. Instead there is a big rise in public participation. This
is seen not only in the booming profits of the big retail stockbrokers like
Merrill Lynch, but most clearly in the sales of equity mutual funds, which
have been recently been growing, net of redemptions, at about Dollars 7bn a
month.
It amounts to a flight from deposit instruments which now yield only about 3
1/2 per cent. Investors feel themselves forced to switch into higher risk
investments in order to obtain a satisfactory return. Equity mutual fund
returns have not in fact been at all remarkable recently - about 12 1/2 per
cent on average, including income, over the past year. However, that can
seem a better deal.
This rush into equities has had strange monetary consequences. The rundown
of certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds has corresponded to
weakness of M2, the measure of broad money which is targeted by the Federal
Reserve. Thus the Fed has been cutting short-term interest rates in an
effort to stimulate M2, with a minor uptick at last visible in Thursday's
monthly figures, upsetting hopes of a further imminent rate cut.
But for many months bank loan demand has been sluggish and has not
responded. Further interest rate cuts could encourage yet more investor
switching into stocks and de-leveraging by the corporate sector. Meantime
M1, the narrow money measure, is surging, so the monetarists hardly know
whether to worry about deflation or inflation.
In the circumstances the valuation basis of the US equity market has been
driven to an extreme. The dividend yield on the broadly-based Standard &amp;
Poors index of 500 stocks is only 2.6 per cent and the p/e ratio is an
alarmingly high 26. That ratio is not quite as bad as it looks because many
big US corporations made exceptional write-offs last year.
The consensus appears to be for over 50 per cent growth this year and maybe
another 15 per cent in 1993. However, this may be a case of desperate
investment analysts trying to justify current share prices. Even so, a
prospective p/e ratio of 15 looking two years ahead does not make the US
stock market look good value.
Nor do American equities offer good value against bonds. Although the long
Treasury bond yield has fallen back from the 8 per cent in the last few days
it looks as though the bond market may have peaked in the first quarter. The
ratio between the bond and equity yields is about 3, a figure previously
seen only in the last few months of the 1987 pre-crash surge.
Bulls have to fall back on the argument that the ratio between short-term
rates and dividend yields is still historically acceptable. But this means
that the valuation basis of Wall Street depends on the continuation of very
low short-term interest rates on the one hand and the assumption of strong
earnings and dividend growth on the other. It is hard to think of
circumstances in which these conditions could apply at the same time.
Professional experts have been questioning the level of the US stock markets
for many months and it continues to stay up there - and even break new high
ground. The strategists wonder whether permanently low inflation might allow
earnings to go on to a permanently higher rating.
As for those amateur punters, do they know something the pros do not? Will
there be a long shallow recession in which interest rates stay low but
companies will be able to rebuild their profits because of the remarkable
softness of American wages? Only about 15 per cent of US labour is now
unionised. Perhaps this is a new era for American capitalism. The odds are,
however, that the refugees from the deposit accounts are no wiser than they
were in 1987, but are just chasing a higher return than a low inflation
environment can deliver.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds/Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds' new deal for small business smacks dreadfully of public relations.
The innovations it proposes are conditional on it taking over Midland. If
they are worth introducing on their merits, the bank would surely be going
ahead anyway. The implication is that Lloyds perceives the scheme as a price
necessary to silence opposition to its bid on competition policy grounds. In
that case the authorities should beware. Lloyds will certainly be giving
away less than meets the eye. A Pounds 100m venture capital fund and Pounds
250m in long-term loans are not exactly going to set the economy alight,
despite their superficial political appeal.
The provision of venture capital in dollops as small as Pounds 5,000 will
certainly be expensive. Lloyds' argument is that it could only afford to
offer such a service as a result of the cost savings generated by the
merger. Thus it claims to have found an example of how the deal would
actually increase competition in the market place even as the number of
players is reduced. One has to assume that the gain for customers would be
short-lived. Since the scheme is essentially a loss leader, either it would
be wound down quickly or the bank would seek to subsidise it by increasing
charges on other services. After all, customers of clearing banks have paid
dearly for interest on current accounts.
Granted, the scheme does contain the germ of something important. In a
low-inflation environment, banks may find themselves increasingly driven to
develop longer-term fixed-rate products for both depositors and borrowers.
This is already normal in countries like Switzerland. Though small
businesses will doubtless benefit, there is no reason why they should be the
sole or even the main target. That leaves cost savings still the principal -
and eminently sensible - rationale for a Lloyds/Midland merger. The rest is
gloss.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Whitbread empire has finally admitted defeat in its efforts to come up
with an ingenious solution to the dilemma posed by the government's Beer
Orders. Hence the Whitbread Investment Company's decision to try stimulating
an auction for Morland by selling part of its 43 per cent stake to Greene
King. Presumably the other stakes held under the Whitbread umbrella will
soon be sold off, except where they are small enough to be easily reduced
below the 15 per cent threshold permitted by the government. Marston
Thompson and Brakspear are thus also available to the highest bidder.
As for the bid by Greene King, the commercial logic is so plain that an
auction is unlikely to develop. Greene King will shut the Morland brewery
and use the site as a distribution centre for its own Abbot and IPA brands.
Morland can scarcely be blamed for opposing the likely demise of its own
beer, nor for objecting that it is a well-managed company. But it is hard to
see how it can defeat the bid. If nothing else, that would mean flying in
the face of an uncomfortable truth: at every turn, the government's efforts
to promote competition in the UK brewing industry are having just the
opposite effect.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the composition of Unilever's first quarter results rather than the
headline figure which unsettled the market yesterday and sent the shares 17p
lower to 932p. Some slowdown in Europe had certainly been expected, but a
hefty 15 per cent drop in the region's contribution to operating profits
underlined just how far the Anglo-Saxon recession has spread elsewhere.
Lower volume was particularly marked in Germany, though higher advertising
and marketing expenditure on new products was also to blame.
The good news was the performance of the rest of the world - notably south
east Asia and Brazil - and the growing strength of the balance sheet.
Average borrowings were Pounds 500m lower than in the equivalent period a
year ago, thanks to a combination of disposals and tighter working capital
controls. Lower interest rates are also working in Unilever's favour and
will underpin 1992 profits advance regardless of whether faint flickerings
of hope in the group's main markets translate into a genuine recovery. But
having shown their defensive strength last year, the shares are likely to
stay out of the spotlight as more cyclical stocks swing back into fashion.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: A dash of cold water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For those of a bearish disposition, the fact that the London equity market
fell this week is evidence that the election rally has finally run out of
steam. More sanguine observers might conclude that in a week which saw the
collapse of Olympia &amp; York, a string of gloomy company results and
unsettling news on wage inflation, a 43-point fall was not bad going. In
truth, UK investors had been rather spoilt of late: not only by the election
result itself, but by a surprisingly early cut in base rates and a degree of
premature confidence about economic recovery. If the latest dose of realism
makes for a spell of reflection, it may be no bad thing.
This is not to say that the travails of O&amp;Y can quite be dismissed. At the
domestic level, UK bank and property shares scarcely suffered yesterday,
since the event was largely discounted. At the global level, the sum of
Pounds 7bn is not big enough seriously to damage the structure of world
banking. But O&amp;Y could still serve in a small way to hamper economic
recovery, particularly in Europe. The traditional way to ease the effects of
such a collapse on borrowers and lenders is through asset inflation, lower
interest rates or both. The former is not on offer anywhere in the developed
world. The latter is not available in the D-Mark zone, including the UK. At
the margin, the result must be lower property prices and less willingness by
bankers to help recovery by lending.
At the same time, this week's 7.5 per cent rise in UK wages is in gruesome
contrast to the levels being fought over in Germany. If nothing else, this
suggests caution about the recently popular thesis that UK interest rates
can be cut below Germany's. There is no reason yet to suppose that the gains
made by the equity market since the election are under threat. It may be a
dull start to the summer just the same.

FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Dreams of China keep Hong Kong in
favour / Review of the market's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given its reputation for volatility, the 51 per cent rise over the last 12
months in the Hong Kong stock market should set off investors' alarm bells.
Three years ago, Hong Kong equities traded at a discount because of the
political uncertainty in China, but positive comments on economic reform
from Beijing in recent months have virtually removed this risk factor, and
the market is enjoying an upward re-rating.
In 1991, Hong Kong was the best performing major stock market in the world,
with the Hang Seng index climbing 42 per cent. This year, the index has
risen 33 per cent to close at 5,704.50 yesterday. The stockbroking community
is unanimous in its desire for a brief consolidation, but the weight of
foreign money has kept the stock market firm.
There are many reasons for the recent record-breaking rally. Corporate
earnings for the Hang Seng index constituents are expected to grow by 20 per
cent this year and next. The upswing in the economy is continuing, with 6
per cent GDP growth expected in 1992, against 4 per cent in 1991.
The decision to go ahead with the Dollars HK112bn (Dollars 14.5bn) airport
programme lifted overseas confidence last year, and the resolution of trade
disputes between the US and China in January received whole-hearted
institutional support.
Despite its recent bull run, Hong Kong does not appear expensive. According
to Baring Securities, the Hang Seng index is trading on a 1992
price/earnings (p/e) multiple of 11.9 and a 1993 p/e of 10.1. This makes
Hong Kong cheaper than other investment destinations in south east Asia,
such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia.
The p/e situation has been recognised by regional fund managers. The US fund
managers, in particular, have been hypnotised by tales of China's economic
potential.
There has also been a substantial increase in retail investment. In 1989,
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dispelled the myth that everyone from road
sweepers to taxi drivers played the stock market, when it found that only 10
per cent of the adult population invested in equities. But in 1992 they have
come back with a vengeance.
The negative differential between the cost of borrowing and inflation in
Hong Kong provides a strong incentive for local investors to remain in
equities. The next interest rate down, as the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the
US dollar demands a tracking of US interest rates.
However, two factors could burst the bubble in Hong Kong: a drastic change
of direction in China, and a weakening of the Hong Kong property market. The
latter has been a concern as a result of government measures to quell
property speculation, which has resulted in a sharp decline in turnover, but
not in prices.
Negative interest rates are a compelling reason why the property market
should sustain the 10 per cent gain recorded in the first quarter, since
property has always been the traditional hedge against inflation in Hong
Kong.
But at the same time, interest rate cuts put upward pressure on inflation.
Analysts say that the territory's economic performance can be maintained in
spite of double-digit inflation, so long as China remains a major
attraction.
China is a greater concern. Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in May,
1989, Sino-American relations have come into the foreground during this
month, as the annual renewal of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status is
debated.
Renewal for 1992/1993 is almost certain. However, the debate on renewal for
next year could become a major issue in the US presidential election in
November. This would hurt Hong Kong, where the failure to renew MFN would
knock close to 2 per cent off its GDP.
The engine for growth in Hong Kong has been in the neighbouring Guangdong
province. Its economy is now overheating, with inflation on the rise; the
last time this happened, in 1988/1989, a severe austerity programme ensued.
China's paramount and aged leader, Deng Xiaoping, is in the middle of a
power struggle between reformists and conservatives. Deng has considerable
support for his economic reforms, but some observers say a setback is
possible. It has been some time, for example, since the stock market has
fallen on rumours of his death.
HSBC's bid for Midland Bank could cause some uncertainty in the stock
market, especially as the offer deadline on June 9 draws near. Since the
Hong Kong market has always tended to over-react, some caution is advisable.
Investors are sitting on substantial profits and it is only natural that
they will want to cash in part of their winnings.
But overall, analysts do not foresee a significant downside in the market,
as current attitudes suggest that any setback will be seen as a long-term
buying opportunity.
'We feel the Hang Seng index justifies a p/e of 13 .. and this would mean
the index should be trading at 7,500 by the end of 1993,' says Mr Clive
Weedon, research director of ChinTung Securities. This sort of optimism
gives little incentive to sell.

FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4 per cent
on O &amp; Y news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average plunged 4 per cent yesterday as news that Olympia and
York Developments, the Canadian property developer, had filed for protection
under the insolvency laws prompted investors to take their profits, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 730.33 to 18,074.27, down 1.6 per cent on the
week. Arbitrage-related selling and position-squaring ahead of the weekend
also depressed the index. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,762.75
and fell to the day's low of 18,034.02 just before the close.
Volume fell to 350m shares from 438m. Losers overwhelmed gainers by 1,003 to
75, with 72 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
fell 47.91 to 1,348.82 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.23 to
1,073.47.
Equities were weak during the morning session, moving in a tight range on
light profit-taking and buying by foreigners. However, afternoon reports of
O &amp; Y's move sparked heavy selling. The Nikkei futures index closed down by
its daily limit of 610 points to 18,360, prompting arbitrage-unwinding and
index-linked selling.
Traders said that while there was no panic, investors had become cautious in
view of the Nikkei's rapid rise over the past week. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities said that while Japanese investors tended to over-react to
overseas news, they were worried about the effect of the news on financial
markets in London and New York.
Investors sold banks and real estate issues on concerns about bad loans. The
outstanding balance of 14 Japanese banks' lending to O &amp; Y is estimated at
Y2bn. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which is believed to have the largest direct
exposure to O &amp; Y, fell Y170 to Y1,250, while Sumitomo Bank lost Y120 to
Y1,400. Mitsui Fudosan fell Y70 to Y1,060 and Mitsubishi Estate lost Y71 to
Y920.
Speculative issues, which had been pushed up by dealers earlier in the week,
lost ground as positions were closed ahead of the weekend. Japan Metals &amp;
Chemicals fell Y24 to Y725 and Okamoto Industries lost Y60 to Y1,440.
High-technology blue chips were also fell on profit-taking, with Hitachi
down Y26 to Y805 and Sony losing Y80 to Y4,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average plunged 633.32 to 20,795.31 in volume of 18.6m
shares. Profit-taking depressed share prices across the board. Nintendo, the
video game maker, however, rose Y100 to Y10,600 on good results.
Roundup
AUSTRALIA apart, markets in the region were not inclined to match, or even
approach the overnight declines seen in the US and Japan. Bombay was closed
after police froze the bank accounts and shareholdings of Mr Harshad Mehta.
AUSTRALIA, like Japan, blamed a 1.1 per cent fall on the day on the Olympia
&amp; York news from Canada. The All Ordinaries index fell 19.0 to 1,660.7,
fractionally down on the week.
Foster's Brewing ended 7 cents higher at ADollars 1.90 after ADollars 1.93,
and SA Brewing 12 cents lower at ADollars 3.07 on reports of a merger which
was made official after the close.
BANGKOK's SET index ended 4.93 higher at 732.89, unchanged on the week, in
low turnover of Bt2.44bn. Selling slowed, while some investors entered the
market to buy in the belief that this weekend's anti-government rallies
would be free of violence.
MANILA was flat on the day, the composite index adding just 1.02 at
1,338.37, but 8.4 per cent up on a week encouraged by the relatively quiet
conclusion to the presidential elections.
NEW ZEALAND, similarly, saw the NZSE-40 index up 0.70 on the day but 4.1 per
cent better on the week, the latter on falling domestic interest rates and
optimism about a batch of company profit reports due over the next few
weeks.

FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent sees weakness in
property, banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL reaction to the O &amp; Y crisis was more specific than general,
with weakness in property and financial shares, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS fell 1.1 per cent at the start, following losses in Tokyo and
overnight on Wall Street, but ended higher thanks to a rebound in stocks
which had fallen on Thursday. The CAC-40 fell as low as 1,995.22 in the
morning before ending 6.95 higher at 2,023.95, down 1.9 per cent on the
week. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.5bn.
News that O &amp; Y was seeking court protection from its creditors put pressure
on Credit Lyonnais, which has the biggest exposure of the French banks. The
stock dropped FFr23 to FFr602.
Elf, which had dropped on its poor first results on Thursday, steadied
yesterday, losing 90 centimes to FFr378.3, while LVMH, which had lost 5.5
per cent on news of a sell note from a US broker on Thursday, rebounded
FFr69 to FFr4,099.
Total dropped FFr6 to FFr260. After the close, the government said it was
offering four Total oil certificates for three shares, reducing its stake in
the oil refiner to 15 per cent from 34 per cent.
FRANKFURT was helped down by overnight weakness in the US and Japan, but a
worsening trend over the course of the morning was reflected in a 3.88 fall
to 700.17 for the FAZ index at midsession extending to one of 18.19 to
1,724.07 for the FAZ at the close. Similarly, falls on the week were 0.9 and
1.4 per cent respectively.
Cars and engineers were hit by worries over the possible metalworkers'
strike and the banking sector by concern over loans to O &amp; Y.
Lufthansa extended Thursday's DM3.20 fall on a passed 1991 dividend - and
the prospect of similar treatment for shareholders in 1992 - with a drop of
DM9.50 to DM138.
Asko, the retailer, rose DM6 to DM826 after the news that Dr Helmut Wagner,
designer of its somewhat erratic corporate strategy, had resigned as
chairman of the supervisory board.
MILAN continued to fall on the final day of the May trading account. The
Comit index fell 4.78 to 472.72, a new low for the year and down 4.2 per
cent on the week, in turnover estimated at L115bn after Thursday's L102bn.
Fiat lost more than 2 per cent in anticipation of a sharp drop in 1991 group
net profit and a cut in the dividend, due later in the day.
The stock fell L131 to L4,810 but recovered to L4,845 after hours. In the
afternoon, it was quoted around L4,900-L4,980 on London's Seaq after
publication of the results, which were in line with expectations.
Olivetti added L2 to L2,900 on renewed speculation in an Italian daily that
it was in alliance talks with Digital of the US. Mediobanca rose L70 to
L12,460 on short-covering.
ZURICH saw profit-taking in some industrials and O &amp; Y-linked selling of
banks as the SMI fell 23.7 to 1,921, 1 per cent lower on the week. Volume
was estimated at a moderate SFr800m.
CS Holding bearers, SFr50 lower at SFr1,980 and SBC bearers by SFr6 to
SFr276. Both banks are mortgage lenders to O &amp; Y. Chemicals were under
pressure from profit-taking, with Roche certificates down SFr20 to SFr3,320
and Ciba-Geigy registered SFr50 lower at SFr3,590.
AMSTERDAM eased, the CBS Tendency index closing 0.7 lower at 128.1 and 1.5
per cent down on the week. Rodamco, the property investment company, fell Fl
1.40 to Fl 47.
Unilever fell Fl 4.70, or 2.4 per cent to FL 187.30. Brokers said that a 5.3
per cent gain in first quarter profits was below expectations.
STOCKHOLM fell broadly in moderate trade, on profit-taking after the
market's recent gains and reflecting weaker markets overseas. The
Affarsvarlden General index fell 15.90 to 985.50, down 2.4 per cent on the
week, as turnover dropped to SKr393m from SKr616m. But the building sector
index fell by 3.8 per cent and the banking sector by 3.6 per cent.
Volvo and Procordia were among the day's biggest losers. Volvo B dropped
SKr14 to SKr429 while Procordia B fell SKr6 to SKr185.
BRUSSELS was pushed down by declines on other European markets and a weak
opening on Wall Street. The Bel-20 index ended down 9.04 at 1,206.08, a fall
of 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr1.1bn. Petrofina fell BFr225
or 2 per cent to BFr11,225. Banque Bruxelles Lambert eased BFr15 to BFr3,435
as bid speculation evaporated.
HELSINKI, as usual a law unto itself, saw the Hex index up 7.8 to 857.5 on a
1.6 per cent rise in March industrial production figures.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Week In The Markets - Tin
prices climb to 18 1/2-month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE MOST base metals moved cautiously higher on nervousness about the
possibility of a strike by German metal workers, tin values responded
positively this week to signs of an improvement in the fundamental market
situation.
Monday saw the three months delivery tin price at the London Metal Exchange
break through the resistance at Dollars 6,000 a tonne that had halted last
week's rise, and no time was wasted before an assault was mounted on the
next resistance area, at Dollars 6,100 a tonne. That barrier held out for a
couple of days and dealers were suggesting that a technical correction to
Dollars 6,000 might be needed before further ground could be made. But the
decisive breach came on Thursday, unleashing a fresh wave of buying, and the
three months price peaked at Dollars 6,240 a tonne, an 18 1/2 -month high,
before running into profit-taking. Yesterday the price was trimmed by
Dollars 5 to Dollars 6,192.50 a tonne, up Dollars 210 on the week.
The latest improvement in tin market sentiment, instigated by last week's
announcement of Brazilian plans to cut output, was given further
encouragement this week when the Association of Tin Producing Countries
forecast a sharp fall in world stocks. Another factor that traders said had
been encouraging the rise in prices was a moderate downtrend in LME
warehouse stocks, but that was reversed by a 215-tonne rise, to 12,045
tonnes, announced yesterday.
In a statement issued yesterday the tin producers' association said that the
expected stocks fall by the end of this year should help to firm prices and
might lead to an early end to the voluntary export quota system operated by
members of the ATPC, which does not include Brazil or China. 'We are pretty
close to normal stock level (of 20,000 tonnes),' said Mr Redzwan Sumun, the
association's executive secretary.
'We may keep the quotas for only six months in 1993.' He suggested that
further stock depletion resulting from production cuts could push prices to
MDollars 16 a kilogram - equivalent to Dollars 6,325 a tonne  - in the
coming months.
'Producers do not want to see steep rises or falls in prices as it will be
difficult for them to respond to demand,' Mr Redzwan said after a four-day
meeting of the ATPC executive committee.
The association put end-1992 world stocks at 25,000 tonnes, compared with
39,100 tonnes at the end of 1991 and 73,200 in early 1987, just over a year
after the collapse of the price-supporting International Tin Agreement. It
forecast that western world supply would fall from 1991's 166,000 tonnes to
157,000 in 1992, while consumption would remain at about 176,000 tonnes. But
the association expected that the implied stock drawdown of 19,000 tonnes
would be partly made up by an 1,800-tonne increase in Chinese exports, to
17,500 tonnes.
Mr Redzwan said the supply balance would hinge on sales of stockpiled tin by
the US Defence Logistics Agency, which would be asked to limit sales to
5,000 tonnes a year instead of the present 7,000 tonnes a year.
The biggest loser on the German strike fears was copper, of which Germany is
one of the biggest importers. The cash price at the LME slid to Pounds 1,215
a tonne before steadying yesterday to Pounds 1,223.50 a tonne, down Pounds
16.75 on the week.
Last week's downturn in the LME's cash zinc price was reversed as fears of
supply tightness in the June-July delivery period flared up again. The fall
continued on Monday, taking the price down to Dollars 1,332 a tonne and
narrowing the premium over three months metal to Dollars 70. But by
yesterday's close cash zinc was quoted at Dollars 1,372.5 a tonne, up
Dollars 23 on balance, and the premium stood at Dollars 101 a tonne.
Aluminium prices yesterday surrendered the modest gains achieved earlier in
the week, despite news of a 300-tonne fall in LME stocks, only the second
since August.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices bounced strongly
from last week's 22-year lows in response to signs of a more positive
approach from producers to market stabilisation efforts. Brazilian officials
held talks with coffee industry representatives and a high level meeting
with the Colombians is scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile Costa Rica, which
accounts for about 3 per cent of world supply, announced that it was halting
exports in protest at low prices.
The July robusta coffee price recouped last week's fall with interest to end
Dollars 58 higher at Dollars 734 a tonne.

FT  16 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: O&amp;Y hits property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERNIGHT news that Olympia &amp; York had filed for protection in New York and
Toronto sent leading property shares plunging when the London market opened
yesterday.
Hardest hit were those groups with a large commercial office portfolio which
would be likely to suffer the most if the Canadian group's Canary Wharf
development went into receivership.
Hammerson suffered the most, tumbling 8 per cent at the opening on
additional worries over the group's exposure to the New York and Canadian
property sectors. However, most stocks had recovered some ground by the end
of trading although one trader described the sector as 'fragile'. Hammerson
'A' lost 13 to 383p, the 'Ordinary' 13 to 405p, MEPC 10 to 332p, and Land
Securities 12 to 434p.
According to one leading property analyst, the demise of Canary Wharf would
be bad news all round. 'Banks would be even less likely to lend money to
property companies, foreign investment would be stalled and the market
recovery would be further delayed,' he said. Other analysts predicted that
the depression in London office rents is likely to be prolonged by the O&amp;Y
situation.
Banks steady
Clearing banks performed well in the light of the news on O&amp;Y. Barclays,
which is reckoned to have lent more money to O&amp;Y than any of the other UK
clearers, closed 6 off at 380p, after being 11 down at one stage. Some
analysts have said the exposure is as high as Pounds 400m and even the more
conservative put it above Pounds 100m.
However, the exposure to O&amp;Y in particular and the UK property market in
general was already in the share price and the stock was helped by a
positive note from Kleinwort Benson yesterday.
The house believes Barclays is the strongest buy in the sector and argues
that despite a healthy balance sheet the shares have underperformed the
market by more than 30 per cent since July last year. Kleinwort reduced its
estimate of O&amp;Y exposure from Pounds 250m to Pounds 200m yesterday.
Kleinwort also likes Royal Bank of Scotland which, it says, has one of the
lowest property exposures. The shares fell early on as it was suggested in
the press that the O&amp;Y loan was around Pounds 565m. A statement by RBOS that
it had no business relationship with the Canadian company and therefore no
exposure to it helped the shares to recover and close a penny firmer at
193p. NatWest, which Kleinwort also rates a buy, was a penny better at 351p.
Results from Unilever were in-line with market expectations, with
first-quarter profits ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 377m. However, there was
some disquiet over the fall in European sales leading to a decline in
operating profits which in turn pressured the share price.
Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'Although German sales in particular were
disappointing, overall organic sales growth of 5 per cent at a time when
other companies are showing a decline was encouraging.' He is shading his
forecast to Pounds 1.98bn full-year, with Pounds 2.20bn in 1993. BZW,
Unilever's broker, has also shaved its forecasts, predicting Pounds 1.97bn
and Pounds 2.17bn respectively. The shares fell 17 to 932p.
Talk that a Sunday newspaper would carry a very critical story on BP, plus a
block of 9m shares sold at 248p, prompted the stock to lose 2 1/2 to 250 1/2
p.
Once again, Shell Transport was a very strong performer following
surprisingly good first-quarter figures on Thursday coupled with
enthusiastic comment. The shares rose 10 to 506p and dealers said the gain
would have been twice as big if some investors had not been switching into
Royal Dutch. Turnover was high with 7.3m shares traded.
A sharp mark down in Pearson came after shareholders were told that
newspaper advertising remained weak, although there were prospects of an
upturn for its oil services unit in the second half. The shares fell 36 to
865p following the annual meeting.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton held up well despite an agency cross of 20m shares at
below the market price. The stake sale, carried out at 254p a share, came in
the wake of the surprise resignation of the chief executive on Thursday. The
shares eased 1 1/2 to 261 1/2 p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved 10 ahead to 470p, on thin volume in
London, after buyers were seen in Paris.
The shares picked up after the company said in a letter to share holders
that it would not need extra funds to help it complete the tunnel before its
autumn 1993 openning. Eurotunnel also said the Inter-governmental commission
would allow the Channel Tunnel operator to carry heavy goods vehicles in
semi-open shuttle wagons as long as stringent safety criteria were met. The
company said the decision could mean fewer delays and could save up to
Pounds 100m in additional costs.
Speciality chemicals group Laporte's days in the Footsie appear to be
numbered. The company is in the throes of cancelling 28m shares in the final
stage of its unravelling of Interox, its 50 per cent-owned joint venture
with Solvay of Belgium. After the close of trading on Monday there will be
only 154m Laporte shares and yesterday's closing price of 643p, down 4 on
the day, gives a market capitalisation of Pounds 977m. Analysts said the
group's share price would need to reach 740p before the end of June if it is
to remain in the Footsie. However, many still like the stock believing it to
be cheap at the present price.
Ironically, one of the companies that looks set to take Laporte's place is
Burmah which prompted the Interox venture when it launched a hostile
takeover bid in 1971. Burmah has risen, almost in a straight line, from 514p
at the time of the general election. Yesterday, although the shares lost 7
to 657p its market capitalisation was almost Pounds 1.2bn, comfortably
within the traditional Footsie cut-off point of around Pounds 1bn
Hotel group Forte slipped 4 to 247p in a weak market. BZW recently
reiterated its sell advice. However, Forte next week embarks on a series of
meeting with institutions where an upbeat message may help sentiment.
Theme park owner Euro Disney's bad week ended as it began, the shares
declining 13 to 1253p. The group has been hit by reports of disappointing
attendance figures. Ladbroke receded 6 to 244p on continuing property
worries.
Positive consideration of BICC, which has just announced a Pounds 154m cash
call to fund acquisitions, pushed the shares up 11 to 370p.
Body Shop was seen to recover from an allegedly badly-handled selling order
shares from the US on Thursday. The shares rose 6 to 319p.
