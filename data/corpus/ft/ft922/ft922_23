FT  16 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market closes on cautious note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that Olympia &amp; York (O &amp;Y), one of the world's biggest property
developers, had filed for protective bankruptcy in Canada added to the mood
of uncertainty that has emerged in the equity market this week and caused a
further bout of selling pressure, notably in the property and banking
arenas.
The O &amp; Y news upset most of the world's big stock markets. Cautious
statements from Unilever and Pearson also kept share prices under pressure
for most of the day and extended the equity market's fall on the week.
However, the bearish mood was tempered by better than expected news on the
inflation front.
The FT-SE 100 share index ended a difficult session a net 12.1 lower at
2,682.6. Over the week the Footsie fell 43.1.
Worries that the O &amp; Y situation could prompt a wave of selling in the banks
and property sector prompted dealers to mark share prices sharply lower
across the board at the outset of trading. The Footsie opened more than 20
points lower at 2,674.1 and looked to be in danger of falling further
shortly after the opening.
No really heavy selling emerged, however, and the market quickly stabilised
and managed to regain some of the ground lost as the day wore on.
There had been real concern among senior marketmakers at the beginning of
the day, that O &amp; Y would induce a sharp sell off on Wall Street when that
market began trading. In the event, the US market opened lower but showed
few signs of a wholesale retreat.
Official statistics on inflation, showing the April year on year increase at
4.3 per cent helped to stabilise the market and triggered a steady
performance by sterling. Gilts, encouraged by the economic news, gained
ground, with longer dated issues up around  3/8 at the close while rises in
the index-linked stocks were on a slightly smaller scale.
Property stocks were given a severe mauling during early trading but closed
well above the day's lowest levels. Bank shares, similarly, suffered early
on, but rallied quickly.
Despite the question mark over the property scene, dealers in London were
not unhappy to see the market dip. 'The worries are not so much property,
but the downside on Wall Street and the chances of big rights issues here,'
said one trader.
Turnover yesterday - 509.5m shares - was one of the lowest since the general
election and suggested that institutional selling had been small.
Overseas buying interest, plus more big share placings and programme trade
activity, kept customer, or retail business, at high levels this week.

<TEXT>
TRADERS OF stock index futures reported a volatile session with Footsie
futures once again failing to touch fair value, though a bounce late in the
day helped the contract to close firmly, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session below the psychologically
important 2,700 level at 2,695 and was traded down to 2,689 by mid-morning,
which proved to be the day's low point.
June was then traded down to fair value twice during the session, but was
boosted in the afternoon by the firm performance in the gilts and bond
markets leading traders to predict a strong performance next week.
June closed at 2,699, down 11 on the previous session and around 10 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover reached
a reasonable 7,626.
In traded options, turnover at 31,994 was down on Thursday's level. The
FT-SE traded 9,038 lots. Among the stock options, Asda, was the busiest,
trading 2,557 lots with the July 30 calls the most active. This was followed
by GEC, in which a sizeable amount of stock was said to have been on offer
in the equities. Some 1,928 contracts were traded in the options. Hanson was
busy again, with 1,701 lots dealt.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong US indicator ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD figures for US industrial production failed to boost the dollar on
foreign currency markets yesterday as investors continued to take the view
that low interest rates make the US unit too expensive to hold. writes James
Blitz.
The markets disregarded encouraging news that industrial production had
risen by 0.5 per cent, up from a revised 0.4 per cent gain in March, and
pushed the dollar down from DM1.6125 to DM1.6090 in early European trading
yesterday. The US unit eventually closed up on the day at DM1.6145. In late
US trading, the dollar was at DM1.620.
However, it lost ground to the yen, closing at Y130.20 from a previous close
of Y130.30.
Analysts believe that the latest economic indicators make it unlikely that
the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its Federal Open Markets
Committee on Tuesday. But one analyst said that the market was so dollar
bearish at the moment that it was not prepared to consider realities. 'They
will look for any excuse to go on selling them,' he said.
Traders worldwide were transfixed yesterday by the problems facing the
Canadian dollar after Olympia and York, the Canadian property developer,
filed for protection from its creditors under Canadian and US insolvency
laws.
A number of central banks, including the Bank of England, were reported to
have intervened in the market to support the Canadian currency after it had
fallen to a 2-year low against the US unit. In Friday's late Asian trading,
the US dollar rose to CDollars 1.2125 from an opening of Dollars 1.2018.
This was followed by reports fo intervention by the Bank of Canada, Reserve
Bank of Australia and Britain's central bank. By the end of European
trading, the Canadian unit had recovered to CDollars 1.2040.
Analysts still believe that the downside risk for the Canadian currency is
far stronger, not least because of the Ottawa government's declared policy
of keeping interest rates low. One London economist believes that the US
dollar could easily test CDollars 1.22 in the coming week. In futures
markets, there was higher Canadian/US dollar volatility with the currencies
being quoted at 5.3/5.6 per cent for one-month options and 5.2/5.5 for
three-month, up from about five per cent on Thursday.
Sterling suffered no setback after it was revealed that the UK's annual rate
of headline inflation had jumped to 4.3 per cent in April. Britain's
Treasury insisted that the rise was due to 'special factors' rather than
underlying inflationary pressures. The pound closed the day unchanged at
DM2.9375, although it had risen as high as DM2.9411 shortly before the
figures were released in the late morning.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Money Markets: No change in rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling cash markets were shaved yesterday morning after the
Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m which was quickly taken
up by the discount houses.
But the currency's weaker performance on foreign exchange markets in the
afternoon forced traders to take a gloomier view of the outlook on base
rates in the afternoon.
As a result, rates ended the day at roughly the same levels as the night
before.
Three month money, a key indicator of how the market thinks base rates are
likely to move, dropped to 10 per cent in the morning after closing the
previous day at 10 1/16 , as the shortage was easily taken up. But the rates
ended the day at the former figure of 10 1/16 per cent as sterling weakened
in the foreign exchange markets in the afternoon.
Further out, the rates for everything from 4-month money to 1-year ended the
day slightly lower at 10 per cent, suggesting that the market does not
expect a cut in base rates before September.
The futures markets were mostly indifferent to the news that headline
inflation in April had jumped by less than expected. The June short sterling
contract ended the day four ticks higher at 89.95, suggesting that base
rates in one month's time will be at 10.05 per cent. Once again, volumes of
trade in the September contract were a good deal higher than in the front
month, reaching 14,283 lots on the day. But the contract ended up only one
tick on its previous close, at 90.25.
Once again, the Bank of England's operations in the discount market were
straightforward.
At the start of the day, the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m. In
early operations, it purchased Pounds 900m of bills for resale to the market
on 3 and 4 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
The forecast was revised to a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn, and later Pounds
1.15bn, before taking account of the early operations. In the afternoon the
Bank purchased Pounds 250m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
Dealers said that, once again, the shortage on a Friday had been mopped up
quickly to push the overnight rate down as far as possible before the
weekend. At one stage, the overnight was down to 6 per cent but ended the
day at 9 3/4 - 1/2 per cent.

FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's wooed in ADollars 5.7bn
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SA BREWING, the Australian drinks and manufacturing group, yesterday
proposed an ADollars 5.7bn (USDollars 4.3bn) merger with Foster's Brewing,
the brewing, pastoral and finance group formerly controlled by Mr John
Elliott.
The merger would create Australia's fifth biggest company, and largely
resolve the financial problems of Mr Elliott's International Brewing
Holdings (IBH), a private company which owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he had 'initiated and
developed' the proposal, which is conditional on the appointment of SA
Brewing nominees as chairman and chief executive of the merged group.
However, the merger also forms the central element of a debt rescheduling
plan presented yesterday by IBH to its banks. IBH has debts of about
ADollars 2.5bn, acquired to finance the purchase of Foster's shares now
worth ADollars 1.6bn.
The board of Foster's said it would consider the offer, but is almost
certain to reject it. The board is understood to have turned down a similar
approach from SA Brewing in March.
The offer will also face scrutiny by the Trade Practices Commission, which
indicated that it was concerned about the possibility of a further reduction
of competition in the highly concentrated beer market.
The plan provides for a new holding company to issue one share for each SA
Brewing share, and one for each 1.5 shares in Foster's. There would be no
cash alternative.
The offer values Foster's shares at a premium of three cents to last night's
closing price of ADollars 1.90. SA Brewing shares would be worth ADollars
2.90, compared to the market price of ADollars 3.07.
However, SA Brewing believes the deal would unlock substantial extra value
for shareholders by removing the uncertainty about IBH's financial position,
which has depressed Foster's share price for the last two years.
This would be achieved through the reduction of the IBH stake in the merged
company from an initial 28 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
IBH would exchange its rights to about 14.5 per cent of the merged group for
perpetual convertible notes, exchangeable for shares after two years. The
merged group would then underwrite the sale by IBH of about 6 per of its
remaining holding.
If its bankers approve, the deal would provide IBH with about ADollars 345m
in cash for immediate payment of overdue interest, and allow it to secure
the bulk of its debt against the convertible notes and remaining shares. IBH
would also gain a reliable stream of dividend and interest payments.
SA Brewing said the 'significant financial strength' of the merged group
would provide 'substantial benefits' to shareholders of both companies. Mr
Wilson said the deal was expected to take at least five months to conclude.
The merger is dependent on the approval of the directors and shareholders of
both companies, and the creditors of IBH, led by Hongkong Bank Australia,
Citibank, and BHP, Australia's biggest company.
SA Brewing is a diversified Adelaide-based company, which dominates the
south Australian beer market, and has substantial interests in home
appliances and packaging.
Foster's, Australia's biggest brewer, owns Courage in the UK and half of
Molson Breweries in Canada.
The group has been in turmoil since losing a record ADollars 1.3bn in
1989/90, largely as a result of write-offs connected with non-brewing
activities acquired during Mr Elliott's reign as chairman and chief
executive.
The group has since sought to refocus itself as a pure brewing operation,
but has been unable to dispose of non-core assets worth about ADollars
2.8bn. The board warned last week it may be forced to write-down the value
of non-core assets again this year, which could affect its ability to pay a
dividend.

SOURCE PERRIER, the celebrated French mineral water group recently taken
over by Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, yesterday reported a 9.2 per
cent decline in net profits for last year.
France's leading mineral water group attributed the earnings decline, to
FFr325m from FFr358m in 1990, to the economic impact of the Gulf war.
A slowdown in tourism hit sales to hotels and restaurants, but the weather
also played a part. Consumers drank less in what was an unusually cool
summer in France and the US last year.
Turnover climbed only slightly, by 3.3 per cent from FFr13.19bn to
FFr13.63bn.
There was a fall in extraordinary gains from asset sales, to FFr78m last
year from FFr403m in the previous year. Operating profits were also down, by
3.2 per cent to FFr1.07bn over the same period.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO biggest electricity utilities in Germany and Spain, RWE and Endesa,
are understood to be close to agreement on a major exchange of shares.
RWE officials in Essen confirmed yesterday that the two companies were in
negotiations but said no agreement had yet been reached. In Madrid, however,
it has been reliably learned that RWE and Endesa have agreed in principle to
exchange up to 10 per cent of their stock with each other.
Until now, the Spanish Government has refused to allow foreign utilities to
take stakes in Spanish generators and distributors. But earlier this week
the large Spanish private sector utility, Iberdrola, said Tractabel of
Belgium had agreed to buy 3 per cent of its stock.
RWE is a much larger company than Endesa and it seems likely that any
two-way investment would be made for equal amounts of money, giving the
German utility a bigger share of Endesa than the Spanish would be able to
take in RWE. But analysts said it was unlikely RWE would immediately take up
a full 10 per cent of Endesa, which at current share prices would cost
Dollars 930m.
RWE tried in 1980 to take a stake in a smaller private Spanish utility,
Union Fenosa, but was blocked by the Spanish government which was then
trying to encourage a series of mergers among local electricity companies.
RWE is also understood to be talking to Union Fenosa about collaborating in
Czechoslovakia. RWE and other German utilities are seeking to expand into
eastern Germany and Eastern Europe.
In eastern Germany, though, the big German utilities have run into
opposition from local municipalities unhappy with the prospect of handing
over complete control of power generation and distribution to the powerful
western companies.
Endesa, meanwhile, would be a vehicle through which RWE could pursue other
opportunities in Latin America, where some markets are being opened to
private suppliers. The two companies are also heavy users of coal-fired
generating plant.

<TEXT>
MGM-Pathe Communications, the financially troubled Hollywood studio
controlled by Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank, yesterday reported a
first-quarter net loss of Dollars 54.7m against a deficit of Dollars 100.6m
a year earlier.
The company reduced operating losses to Dollars 14.4m from Dollars 24.6m.
Revenues were little changed at Dollars 298.9m compared with Dollars 292.5m.
It attributed the narrower deficit to lower writedowns on films and
television programming, a tighter control of general corporate expenses and
the absence of significant reserves in the 1991 period. Those reserves,
adding up to Dollars 44.8m, were taken to cover the possibility that
investments and affiliate loans made by prior management, led by the
unpredictable Italian financier Mr Giancarlo Parretti, might not be
recoverable or collectible.
During the latest quarter, MGM-Pathe's interest expense rose to Dollars
36.5m from Dollars 29.2m.

ANOTHER sizeable US retailer bit the dust yesterday. as New York-based
Alexander's closed the doors of its 11 department stores - all in the
metropolitan New York region - and announced that they would not reopen.
The company itself filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the US bankruptcy code, and will now attempt to reorganise as a property
company. In the mid-1980s, annual turnover at Alexander's topped Dollars
500m, and until recently the stores group employed over 7,000 people.
Alexander's move comes amid some signs of improved consumer spending levels
in the US. However, the company has been making losses for years; in the
last 24 months alome, the deficit from retail operations reached Dollars
40m, and management said yesterday that the losses were projected to
continue.
The chain was once viewed as a 'middle market' operator competing with the
likes of Macy's and Gimbels. Some of its store sites are still fairly
attractive, including one on Lexington Avenue, a stone's throw from
Bloomingdale's.
At one stage, Donald Trump acquired a 27.2 per cent stake in the company,
but this was subsequently repossessed by his bank lenders, led by Citicorp.

end year in red

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Japanese securities houses yesterday revealed worse than expected
results, with 12 of the largest 14 houses reporting after-tax losses for the
year ended March 1992, and all cautious in their predictions for the current
year.
Of the Big Four houses, only Nomura Securities reported an after-tax profit,
while two others, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, reported sharply
lower pre-tax profits and after-tax losses. Yamaichi Securities made a
pre-tax loss of Y36.5bn (Dollars 28m), a turnround from profits of Y67.6bn
in 1990-91.
The houses, most of which are cutting their dividends, blamed the poor
results on falling stock prices, low stock-market turnover, and the costs
and consequences of the financial scandals of the past year.
The 10 second-tier companies fared even worse. Nine announced pre-tax losses
with Kankaku Securities hit hardest with a loss of Y49.5bn. The results have
raised doubts about the ability of some second-tier brokers to survive
without a lowering of ambitions and a restructuring of their operations.
from stock brokerage commissions was down 44 per cent and the value of its
share underwriting fell 28 per cent, while bond underwriting fell 15 per
cent, interest and dividend income was down 44 per cent, and there was a 67
per cent fall in trading gains.
The difficult conditions forced Nomura to draw heavily on its cash holdings,
which fell from Y821.4bn to Y429.6bn.
The same pattern was evident among other leading brokers, as Nikko's cash
holdings were more than halved to Y352bn, and those of Daiwa were down 33
per cent to Y856bn.
Damage is even greater at the second-tier brokers, with Yamatane Securities
formally announcing a financial action plan in the wake of a Y25.4bn
after-tax loss. The company, along with Cosmo Securities, was forced to pay
compensation to settle disputes with clients over tobashi  - the shuffling
of stocks from account to account to avoid the booking of losses.
Yamatane is seeking interest rate cuts from its leading banks, while other
second-tier companies are closing unprofitable domestic and foreign offices,
and cutting their staff intake.
Sanyo Securities, which reported a pre-tax loss of Y29.6bn, said yesterday
that officies in Madrid, Milan and Toronto will be closed next month.
The collapse of the market was reflected in large losses seen on the
brokers' own securities dealings, with Yamaichi announcing a Y36.9bn loss in
stock dealings, Daiwa a Y19.4bn loss, and Kankaku an Y11.8bn loss.
Of the Big Four brokers, only Nomura will keep its dividend unchanged at Y15
a share, while Daiwa will cut its payout from Y14 to Y9, Nikko from Y13.5 to
Y8.5, and Yamaichi from Y13.5 to Y7.5.

FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Size of Fiat dividend cut
surprises

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, the Italian cars and industrial group, surprised analysts yesterday
with a deeper than expected cut in its dividend for 1991.
The company cut its ordinary share dividend by almost 38 per cent to L230
from L370 in 1990. The payment on savings shares was cut by L140 to L260.
Net profits after minority interests fell to L1,114bn (Dollars 894.8m) from
L1,613bn. The result caused some confusion, largely because of the
unexplained drop in minority interests to L162bn from L523bn.
At the pre-tax level, around half of the L1,690bn profit made last year was
accounted for by extraordinary items, notably the sale of the Telettra
subsidiary.
Turnover rose by 1.4 per cent to L58,029bn. This figure includes Ford New
Holland, acquired last year and consolidated from May. Stripped of this
purchase, Fiat turnover fell by 1.3 per cent to L56,488bn.
Fiat, chaired by Mr Giovanni (Gianni) Agnelli, said the lower earnings
stemmed from slower economic growth and cut-throat competition at a time of
heavy investment.
Profits at the cars unit fell to L386bn from L751bn on turnover of L27,506bn
against L27,675bn. Unit sales slipped by 3 per cent to 2.06m.
Results in industrial vehicles, divided between Iveco (trucks) and NH
Geotech (farm and construction equipment), spotlighted the crisis in both
sectors.
Fiat's losses have been exacerbated by acquisitions in both areas. Swollen
by the purchase of Enasa in Spain, Iveco swung to a loss of L82bn, from
profits of L65bn. A L155bn loss at Ford New Holland hit Geotech, which
reported a a divisional loss of L452bn, up from L238bn. Losses at the
Magneti Marelli car components unit rose to L144bn from L35bn.

FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Paris plans Dollars 1.7bn sale
of Total shares

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government plans to sell FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.7bn) worth of shares
in Total, reducing its direct stake in the state controlled oil group to 5
per cent.
This is by far the largest in the recent programme of partial
privatisations, following the FFr2bn sale of a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf
Aquitaine, Total's larger state-controlled rival, two months ago.
It also marks the renunciation of the French state's 70-year-old policy of
treating the country's oil companies as a strategic arm of France's energy
policy.
The government will sell through the Paris bourse 19 per cent of Total's
shares, reducing the stake held by the state and the public sector from 34
per cent to 15 per cent. It will also surrender double voting rights held
since the 1920s to reduce its votes to 5 per cent.
By contrast, the state owns 51.5 per cent of Elf.
France is selling parts of public industry mostly to help finance the
growing budget deficit, set to rise from FFr135bn this year to FFr150bn
next. It has also sold shares recently in Credit Local de France, a public
authority bank.
The Total sell-off took the market by complete surprise. The shares closed
yesterday, before the announcement, at FFr260, capitalising Total at FFr50bn
or ten times this year's estimated earnings.
The government has chosen a good moment in Total's fortunes to announce its
privatisation. Last month the group announced a 41.5 per cent rise in 1991
profits to FFr5.8bn after tax. However, uncertainty hangs over the future of
its chairman, Mr Serge Tchuruk, whose three-year mandate expires next
February.
In theory, it is up to the government to decide his replacement, though it
was not clear yesterday whether the state will keep this right after the
share sale.
As part of the sell-off, the government is also offering to exchange
non-voting shares, or certificats petroliers, for ordinary shares at a rate
of four for three.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Canadian bond holders angered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG those most surprised and angered by Olympia &amp; York's move to protect
itself from creditors are holders of bonds secured by First Canadian Place,
Toronto's tallest office building.
The bondholders, who include numerous European institutions, were hoping
that O&amp;Y would pay them CDollars 17m in half-yearly interest yesterday.
Convinced that they were protected by the single-purpose, non-recourse
company used to finance the 72-storey building, the bondholders had
threatened to seize rents and perhaps even the building itself if the
payment was not met.
Just a few days ago they were told by O&amp;Y officials that, in the words of
one Toronto bond trader, 'something would be worked out'.
Now the bondholders appear to be at the mercy not only of O&amp;Y, but also of
its other creditors. The Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act, under which
O&amp;Y filed for protection, probably prevents them from laying hands on their
interest or on tenants' rent payments. The only bids for First Canadian
Place bonds yesterday were at CDollars 45-CDollars 50 per CDollars 100 of
face value.
Holders of publicly-traded securities in O&amp;Y's US buildings, all of which
fall outside the scope of the Chapter 11 filing, reacted with more
equanimity.
Mr Michael Barr, an analyst at H. Rivkin &amp; Co, a New York firm which
specialises in distressed bonds, said yesterday that 'if anything, we're
seeing more buying than selling interest'.
Prices on O&amp;Y's US bonds were virtually unchanged, and the securities were
still being traded with accrued interest - a sign that buyers expect that
interest will continue to be paid. Most of the US buildings generate enough
rent income to support debt-servicing payments.
O&amp;Y paid monthly interest to a group of US floating-rate note holders last
week. It did however, fail to make a USDollars 62m payment on a building at
the World Financial Centre in early April, but claims this was because it
was funnelling every scrap of cash it could to the hard-pressed Canadian
parent.

FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Fresh blow to Docklands
railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT plans for Docklands received a further blow yesterday when it
emerged that the opening of the Beckton extension of the Docklands Light
Railway had been indefinitely postponed.
The setback comes on top of concern that the planned Pounds 1.7bn extension
of London Underground's Jubilee Line to Docklands could be jeopardised if
Olympia &amp; York defaults on its Pounds 400m contribution.
The Pounds 256m Beckton extension of the DLR leaves the existing network at
Poplar and serves 11 stations on its route through Docklands on the north
side of the Thames. It had been due to open by the end of this year, but
that date could now slip to summer next year.
The postponement follows the transfer of responsibility for the railway from
London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation last month.
The new management has decided that it will not open the Beckton extension
to the public until it is satisfied that the computerised systems which run
the automatic train control systems are entirely trouble-free.
Services on the existing railway have been severely disrupted by teething
troubles with the newly-installed control system. 'We are not going to use
our passengers as guinea pigs,' the DLR said.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 1m reorganisation costs force Holmes
&amp; Marchant into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ITS clients' marketing budgets being cut across the board, Holmes &amp;
Marchant, the marketing services group, tumbled into the red in the six
months to March 31.
Pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 748,000 (profits Pounds 1.7m) and were
struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 122,000) and interest
payable reduced to Pounds 501,000 (Pounds 839,000) by the 1-for-3 cash call
last May.
But Mr Emyr Jones, finance director, said with reorganisation costs paid in
the period and with turnover and profits at similar levels, he expected
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 800,000 in the second half, giving a
break-even position for the year.
The rights issue cut debt from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 8.1m at the September
year-end, but reorganisation costs have since bumped it up to Pounds 8.7m.
Mr Jones said the group had banking facilities for Pounds 10.8m, giving it
'enough headroom'. As late as February 25, the payment of the proposed 3.3p
final dividend for 1990-91 was cancelled, saving Pounds 800,000. The current
interim is passed (3.3p).
The exceptional charges related to redundancies and the costs of empty
properties. Mr Jones said the current reorganisation, which was expected to
save Pounds 1m in the full year and in which 31 jobs were lost, was largely
complete. Deferred considerations on acquisitions made in the 1980s - the
bane of sector - were also largely over, he added, with less than Pounds
300,000 due in the second half and less than Pounds 250,000 due next year.
The company has Pounds 5m-worth of freehold property.
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 25.2m), though Mr Jones ascribed the
decline largely to Broadbent Advertising, the regional retail advertising
agency, which lost a number of clients when contracts were renegotiated. All
the other companies were net gainers of clients, he said.
Losses per share were 2p (earnings 6.6p).

<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, met market expectations
with a 5 per cent increase in first quarter profits, from Pounds 358m to
Pounds 377m. However, signs that the economic slowdown was hitting European
sales volumes affected sentiment and the group's shares fell 17p to close at
932p.
Overall operating profit declined 2 per cent to Pounds 404m (Pounds 412m) on
turnover 3 per cent higher at Pounds 5.49bn (Pounds 5.35m).
In Europe, operating profits dipped from Pounds 306m to Pounds 260m, as
sales volume fell compared with a strong first quarter in 1991, particularly
in Germany. The results were also affected by the disposal of the 4P
packaging businesses.
Margins in Europe came under pressure, dropping from 9.4 per cent to 8 per
cent.
Profits from North American operations rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 17m,
and in the rest of the world from Pounds 96m to Pounds 127m. 'An improved
performance in North America was largely due to foods and personal
products,' said Mr Michael Perry, chairman.
'Rest of the world increases in volume and profit were widespread, with a
particularly good contribution from Latin America.'
The results were helped by reduced interest charges. Payments in the quarter
fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 43m. Net profit increased by 5 per cent to
Pounds 242m; earnings per share showed a rise to 13.09p (12.44p).

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Black ready to bid Dollars 75m for NY Daily
News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CONRAD Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph group will make a formal
bid for the New York Daily News, the loss-making daily, in the middle of
next week.
Mr Black is expected to bid around Dollars 75m (Pounds 42m) for the famous
daily bought last year by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The purchase price is calculated to meet trade creditors and severance terms
for those who will lose their jobs.
The bid will come with undertakings to protect the newspaper's future and
commitments to modernisation including the installation of new presses.
However, in return the unions would have to accept a 35 per cent reduction
in full time jobs and recognise, as happened at the Daily Telegraph more
than five years ago, that management has a right to manage.
Mr Black is not convinced that his bid will be accepted - at least first
time round - but believes these are the sort of terms needed to guarantee
the newspaper's future.
On April 28, the Telegraph chairman was given four weeks to work out a deal
with the paper's management, unions and creditors.
Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, publisher of the US News and World Report, is also
seen as a possible buyer.
Mr Black has also decided, after initial doubts, that he is seriously
interested in bidding for Mirror Group Newspapers when it comes on the
market, although he is unlikely to get involved in an auction.
The private Maxwell business which controls a majority of MGN is in
administration and effectively owned by a range of banks.
The Telegraph chairman who owns about 200 newspapers worldwide - most of
them small North American dailies and weeklies - has worked out a recipe for
expanding his media empire.
Increasingly he plans to buy publishing companies either in receivership or
close to it. The aim then is to improve the management, modernise the
product and, where possible, relaunch on a rising economic tide.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The need to show a clearer vision /
Pondering the uncertainty over Arjo's future direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL general meetings are seldom the setting for hard questioning of
company directors, but Arjo Wiggins Appleton's meeting on Tuesday could
prove the exception. Shareholders will want some answers from the chairman,
Mr Cob Stenham, and his team about the Anglo-French paper group's future.
The direction of the company was thrown into doubt on Thursday when Mr
Stephen Walls, chief executive, announced he was resigning after a
disagreement with other directors over the group's future development.
The board rejected Mr Walls' plan to grow the company through acquisition,
choosing organic growth and selective small purchases instead.
Mr Walls' vision made considerable sense, according to some analysts. A
Price Waterhouse study showed it had the best return on capital of any paper
company in the world. With its high margins - its average selling price is
Pounds 1,200 per tonne compared with an industry average of Pounds 600 - the
company had weathered the recession well.
The problem facing AWA is that most of its markets are mature or maturing.
In particular, the carbonless paper market, currently growing at about 3 per
cent a year, is likely to slow down as businesses start installing
high-speed laser printers. Similarly, the facsimile paper market is likely
to start shrinking as the price of plain paper fax machines continues to
fall.
Although the company has proved resilient, it is not as highly geared to
recovery as other paper manufacturers.
Mr Walls realised that earnings momentum could slow, but also recognised
present opportunities. With its low gearing, AWA was in a good position to
start picking up acquisitions from paper groups suffering from overcapacity
in the pulp area.
Analysts believe Mr Walls identified KNP, a Dutch-based manufacturer of
coated paper which also has merchanting operations in Germany, Belgium and
the Netherlands. They think the deal could have MacMillan Bloedel, the
Vancouver-based forest products company, holds a 30 per cent stake in KNP.
AWA is European market leader in all of its product areas apart from
wood-free coated paper where it is in third or fourth place. Before he
announced his resignation Mr Walls said that although there was presently
over-capacity in the market, it would grow rapidly with the greater
penetration of colour photocopiers.
Now Mr Walls' vision has been rejected, the board will need to convince
shareholders that it has a coherent strategy. Earnings growth seems assured
in the short-term as the European and US economies picks up.
In the medium-term, however, doubts remain about the rate of dividend and
earnings growth.
Shareholders will also be interested to know the identity of the new chief
executive as soon as possible. One analyst, who refused to be named, said
the replacement needed to have a powerful track-record to have much
credibility.
Otherwise he will be seen to be in the pocket of the French minority
shareholders. Worms et Cie, the French financial group, indirectly owns
about 39 per cent of AWA. It holds a 38 per cent stake in St Louis which in
turn owns 39 per cent of AWA. Analysts believe the KNP deal would have
required a dilution of that stake.
Those French shareholders were last night denying the boardroom split, which
also ended in the resignation of Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline
Beecham, had been along Franco-British lines. However, analysts remain
concerned whether the interests of Worms et Cie will be the same as UK
shareholders.
Yesterday some shareholders demonstrated their displeasure at Mr Walls'
departure. A line of 20m shares, equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the
company, was sold at below the market price. Mr Walls, who has refused to
discuss his departure, also demonstrated his feelings: he sold 5,515 of his
shares too.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Horizon Investment Trust has become a battleground after Jupiter
Horizon, the trust's fund manager, yesterday blocked an agreed takeover and
promised to produce rival reconstruction proposals.
Martin Currie Pacific had made a recommended offer for the trust, which was
born out of the Australian Investment Trust in 1989.
But Jupiter Tyndall assembled a 25.1 per cent stake in the trust's warrants.
That enabled the fund manager to block a resolution at an extraordinary
meeting of warrant holders yesterday; the resolution required a 75 per cent
majority, but only got 74.7 per cent.
If approved, the resolution would have prompted Martin Currie to make an
improved offer (at 93 per cent of the formula asset value) to ordinary
shareholders. Following the resolution's failure, the offer will be just 92
per cent of FAV. Both offers exclude the 11 per cent of the portfolio
invested in illiquid funds; that portion will be sold and the proceeds
distributed to shareholders.
Discretionary clients and managed funds of Jupiter Tyndall also have a stake
of 15.4 per cent in the ordinary shares. Jupiter says it will not accept the
offer and therefore Martin Currie will not be able to achieve the 90 per
cent stake it needs to acquire compulsorily the outstanding shares.
In these circumstances, Jupiter Tyndall says that the rights of the warrant
holders will have to be substantially enhanced but this is disputed by the
Pacific Horizon camp.
Jupiter Tyndall said yesterday it intended to produce further proposals
which would 'enhance shareholder value' and enable share and warrant holders
to receive cash for all or part of their investment.

lorry wagons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANGLO-French safety commission for the Channel tunnel has agreed that
Eurotunnel need not make expensive design changes to rail wagons planned to
transport lorries. Eurotunnel said that the commission's decision could
reduce the cost of the project by about Pounds 100m.
It said the safety commission, which was established by the British and
French governments, had agreed that heavy goods vehicles could be
transported in semi-open-sided wagons, provided Eurotunnel met other
stringent safety criteria.
The commission, concerned about the possibility of a fire spreading in the
tunnel, had previously indicated that it would prefer the wagons to be fully
enclosed.
Eurotunnel warned last year that changing the design of the shuttle wagons
at this late stage would increase costs and could cause delays in providing
a full service.
The group, in a letter to shareholders, re-asserted that it would have no
need to raise further funds before the tunnel opened next September or
within the fourth quarter of next year.
Sir Alastair Morton and Mr Andre Benard, joint chairmen of Eurotunnel, said
that they were convinced that a satisfactory settlement could be reached
with the companies building the tunnel. Contractors are claiming more than
Pounds 1bn in additional payments at 1987 prices to cover cost increases.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Call for EC clearance of UK review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Conservative minister yesterday called on the government to seek
clearance from Brussels to conduct a UK review of Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation's proposed takeover of Midland.
In an amendment to an early day motion, Mr Peter Viggers, a former junior
Northern Ireland minister, said that the Hongkong offer and the proposed bid
from Lloyds Bank 'should both be examined under the same jurisdiction.'
He urged Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, to 'request
the European Commission for the examination of the HSBC bid under the
British mergers regulations.'
Mr Heseltine could theoretically ask for a separate UK review on the grounds
either that the takeover was a threat to Midland's depositors or that it
raised general issues of national concern.
The original early day motion in support of Hongkong's bid has so far
attracted the support of 17 MPs from both major parties. These include Mr
Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South, Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for
Hayes and Harlington, and two Labour MPs representing Sheffield seats.
Midland is the largest private-sector employer in the Sheffield area with
some 2,500 employees.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - Searching for
simple solutions to systems tangle may stall savings / A look at the
problems of integrating the banks' computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE to unite the computing systems of Midland Bank with those of
the winner of the takeover battle will be expensive, prolonged and not
without substantial risk.
That is the view of data processing experts who have been involved in
previous large merger attempts.
They point to the experience of Woolwich and Nationwide Anglia building
societies, the merger plans of which foundered on the economic
impracticality of uniting incompatible systems.
Or there is the example of Girobank and the Alliance and Leicester Building
Society, where the merger went ahead but it took 18 months before Girobank
customers were able to use their bank cards in Alliance and Leicester cash
mach-ines.
Estimates of the complexity of the task in the Midland battle are
complicated by the secrecy in which the banks shroud their computer
operations, for both security and competitive reasons.
Midland and Lloyds this week refused to give details of their data
processing systems.
It is tempting to think of a bank's computer system as an integrated whole,
like an electronic filing cabinet. Where two systems are incompatible, it is
because the cabinet is the wrong shape or the holes in the filing cards the
wrong distance apart.
The reality is not so simple. Computer arrangements in many big banks are a
sprawling mess of incompatible systems, each built for a separate purpose,
often with little in common.
They will include retail systems, branch automation systems, wholesale
banking operations, cash management systems, automated teller machine
networks and securities trading and accounting systems.
Many are so old and complicated that nobody in the data processing
department can remember how they work. Documentation is not one of the
computing industry's greatest strengths.
Maintenance, the word the data processing industry uses for extending and
modifying existing systems, is an expensive nightmare.
It is impossible, however, simply to throw away the mess of wiring and
computer code and start again. The systems, inefficient as they are, support
the banks' commercial operations.
If the economies of scale expected of a merger are to be achieved a serious
effort to integrate information technology across the enlarged group will
have to be put in place. The Hong Kong and Shanghai offer document talks of:
'Economies in production processing through combining data centres and
communications networks and enhanced purchasing power.'
There are four issues at stake. They are the processing software, the
hardware or the physical computers, the network and staffing. One consultant
believes the principal cost savings will come through rationalising data
processing staff, which can number thousands for a large bank.
Mr Steven Landles, a divisional director with BIS Group, a leading banking
software company, says merging systems should proceed in three phases.
In the first, the two sets of systems are allowed to run in parallel for up
to two years. No savings can be expected in this period.
In the second phase, the best systems have to be selected. If Lloyds were to
win the merger battle, for example, its branch automation system would be
likely to be selected over that of Midland.
The third phase would involve developing a single, integrated system to
cover all the banks activities. The cost of developing a new branch
automation system alone has been set at Pounds 50m.
Anomalies exist at every stage. Midland and Lloyds use similar processing
software for their automatic teller machines but Midland's reciprocity
partner in automatic teller operations is National Westminster, while
Lloyds' is Barclays.
Lloyds uses IBM central processing hardware exclusively while Midland is in
the process of moving from Unisys to IBM.
Other consultants believe technology will be the least of the enlarged
group's problems, arguing that differences in business processes will prove
the biggest hurdle to a smooth merger.
But whoever wins the merger battle, rationalisation of information
technology will not provide jam today. And it will be a hard slog to ensure
jam tomorrow.

FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Betterware reorganises and recruits
executive from Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTERWARE Consumer Products, which sells household goods door-to-door, is
reorganising its divisions and taking on an executive from Avon Products,
the world's largest direct selling company, as part of its push into
continental Europe, writes Jane Fuller.
With direct selling established as its core business, the other activities,
including garden products, textiles and coffee shops, are being placed in
one new consumer products division.
The company is simplifying its name to Betterware.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the non-direct selling subsidiaries
accounted for only 10 per cent of group profits and might eventually be
sold.
The expansion of Betterware on the continent would be overseen by Mr Philip
Tulimeri, an American recruited from Avon, which sells cosmetics and other
goods in about 80 countries.
After a successful launch in France last September, the next country on
Betterware's agenda would be Spain, Italy or Germany.
The company is holding an EGM on Tuesday to approve the reorganisation.
Forecasts for the year ended February centre on about Pounds 6.5m pre-tax
profit, more than 50 per cent up on last year.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: Markets do make mistakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOE CRYANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stuffing Canary Wharf full of Michael Heseltine's civil servants is a
cosmetic exercise, borne out of desperation, and at taxpayers' expense.
Throughout the 1980s, the cranky ideas of the New Right were given full rein
in Britain and the US with disastrous social and economic consequences. For
examples of this you need look no further than the riots of Los Angeles, or
the sheer depth of the British recession.
The New Right has enjoyed unrestrained political power in the US and Britain
for 12-13 years. There is no-one its adherents can blame this time.
Ironically, the real 'culprit' is their blind faith in the 'free market'
which has been elevated to almost mystical status.
Simply put, markets, like people, can and do make mistakes. This could not
be otherwise given that markets are nothing more or less than the collective
results of the myriad decisions and actions by, yes, people. Thus markets
are far from being infallible.
Hence the zealots of the right haven't discovered the philosopher's stone
but merely a rich seam of political prejudice.
There are three lessons to be learned from the 1980s: markets don't always
get it right; government does have a role to play; creating a huge
underclass harms society at all levels.
Canary Wharf, the biggest office development in the world, is merely one of
the more visible mistakes of the markets in the 1980s. It should be re-named
Turkey Tower.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Hard sell on high street: Retailers are discovering that the
shoppers of the 1990s are a different and more discerning breed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers have been scratching their heads this week, puzzling over the
strange phenomenon that is the British consumer.
In spite of their expectations of a post-election revival in high street
fortunes, few retailers have reported any substantial increases in consumer
sales. Although some individual markets, such as cars, carpets and
electrical goods, have shown sparks of activity, there has not been a marked
pick-up in consumer demand.
On Tuesday, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, was gloomy
about the pace of recovery. In the year to March 31, the clothing and food
business did better than most but saw UK sales fall by 0.6 per cent to
Pounds 4.92bn. And M and S had still not seen the 'whites of the consumers'
eyes' since the year end, Sir Richard said.
That feeling has been shared by a host of others in recent weeks, as
Littlewoods, Sears, Burton, Argos, Kwik Save and J Sainsbury have all
reported little evidence of a general pick-up in sales.
What makes the situation particularly perplexing is that most consumers
clearly have the money - as the current high levels of savings ratios show.
According to the Central Statistical Office, consumers saved 10 per cent of
their disposable income in the last quarter of 1991 compared with just 4.1
per cent at the beginning of 1988.
What is lacking is the inclination to spend.
The lingering recession is the primary culprit. Consumer confidence has been
shattered and will be slow to recover, according to retailers and most city
economists. Many retailers suppose consumers are still unsettled by falls in
house prices and the uncertainty caused by the high level of unemployment
which continues to grow and now stands at over 2.7m.
But many observers of consumer trends are beginning to wonder whether deeper
psychological and social factors are also at play. They suggest that the
shoppers of the 1990s are a different breed from those of the previous
decade and that all consumer industries will have to become far more
sophisticated at enticing the public into parting with its money.
Much of the evidence for such arguments is more anecdotal than empirical.
Some of the strongest trends are best illustrated in the US where the
consumer society is more developed than in Europe.
Mr Will Ander, a partner of McMillan Doolittle, the Chicago-based retail
consultancy, recently told a conference in London that several US research
studies had demonstrated that people now valued time as much as money.
He suggested part of the reason for this change was the growing proportion
of women in employment - three-quarters now work either full or part time.
As time had seemingly 'shrunk' for such women, the number of shopping trips
had dwindled. The average number of visits to shopping malls each month fell
from 3.1 in 1980 to two a decade later; the number of hours spent shopping
declined from 12 to four.
This meant retailers would increasingly have to give shoppers explicit
reasons to come to their stores. Mr Ander predicted this would lead to the
predominance of four types of so-called '-est' retailers, which clearly
offered either the cheap-est products, the bigg-est selection, the hott-est
fashion items, or the easi-est service. The Wal-Mart discount chain, Toys
'R' Us, The Gap fashion chain and Nordstrom department stores, were cited as
examples in the respective categories.
Mr Ander suggested that such changes in consumer priorities were already
discernible in the UK, as evidenced by a recent Harris Poll which found that
54 per cent of consumers said they had less free time than five years ago.
His argument is supported by Mr Gary Davies, professor of retailing at
Manchester Business School. 'Retailers are asking us to part with our time
and that is going to become more and more important to us over the next
decade. The working woman has got more things to do and unless you can
guarantee her something worth devoting an hour to she will spend it doing
something else,' he says.
He points to the beginnings of 'a very long-term drift in terms of
discretionary spending on shopping' towards other leisure activities, and
believes it significant that for the first time since the 1920s, Marks and
Spencer's share of consumer spending has fallen in two consecutive years.
According to Mr Ander, the recession may also have served to disguise a
shift in social values which will have an enormous impact on retailing.
Ageing thirtysomething baby-boomers with young families are likely to have a
different set of values from those their yuppie predecessors espoused a
decade ago.
Mr Fabrizio Valente, an Italian sociologist confirms a noticeable shift in
behaviour. He says the 1980s saw as explosion of a cultural trends
emphasising the 'here and now'. Consumers lived for the present. They were
motivated by experimentation and impulse buying. The age was associated with
advertising, video-clips and highly ephemeral fashions associated with the
latest designer labels. During the 1980s, for example, there were 14,000
products which all bore the Gucci name.
In the 1990s, he says consumers are more experienced, shrewd and aware of
their individuality and will be more concerned about the environment in
which their children live.
Much of this may sound like sociological jargon. But retailers are beginning
to pick up on these trends, even if they do not articulate them in quite the
same language.
One chief executive of a big British retailer, for example, tells a tale
that illustrates the move towards an era of more self-conscious consumption.
He says one of his company's female non-executive directors had recently
been amazed to discover that she owned 41 handbags. The interesting point,
he suggested, was not that she had bought so many bags but that she had
counted them for the first time.
On a day-to-day level, retailers are also becoming painfully aware of the
pressures that environmentally and socially responsible shoppers can exert
on their businesses. The Green Consumer Guide, which advises consumers how
to minimise the environmental consequences of their consumption, has sold
more than 1m copies and undoubtedly influenced shopping patterns.
Retailers have found themselves in the front line of environmental campaigns
to reduce packaging, preserve the rainforests by banning endangered
hardwoods, or stop driftnet fishing of tuna - which kills dolphins in the
nets.
Mr Patrick Carson, a director of the Loblaws supermarket chain in Canada and
writer on environmental affairs, describes this new breed of environmental
shoppers as Higher Inner-Consciousness Consumers, or Hiccs.
'These people make decisions based on ethical, moral and environmental
concerns and these consumers are going to use their shopping carts to push
for a better world,' he says.
Instead of just responding to such emerging concerns, however, Mr Davies
suggests that retailers must take a more active role in shaping the market
and that there is far more that they can do to stimulate greater consumer
spending.
He says the excitement has gone out of shopping and that for many people it
has become a necessary drudgery crammed into a Saturday morning.
He argues that if retailers provided sufficient stimulus to attract shoppers
and reward them for spending time in their stores, they would respond by
spending more money.
He cites the example of Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, which has
opened its giant stores in more than 20 countries around the world. He says
the store has great customer appeal as shoppers enjoy touching and playing
with the exhibits, and taking advantage of subsidised meals and children's
play areas. Shoppers typically spend between 1 1/2 and two hours in a store
which is far longer than in rival furniture outlets. Their sales are
correspondingly higher, he suggests.
'In the middle ages the Bartholomew's Fair market was shut down for
debauchery. I wouldn't suggest retailers go so far today but at least they
realised then that the only way to get people to travel long distances and
sleep in ditches on the way was to offer them entertainment. We have lost
sight of what retailing is all about,' he says.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Tower of trouble on the waterfront: Olympia &amp; York's crisis
spells decision time at Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The men responsible for Canary Wharf sat on its 30th floor yesterday,
deflecting criticism of the scheme that has brought the world's largest
property developer to its knees.
'Wasn't the project a great disappointment?' insisted a questioner. Steve
Miller, Olympia &amp; York Development's chief bank negotiator, came back: 'You
are sitting in the most important commercial development in the country. I
don't see how you can even ask the question.'
That question, however, is being repeatly asked by government ministers,
tenants and, most of all, the bankers who are deliberating whether to put
the project into administration. Whatever its fate, the project has played a
disastrous role in draining O&amp;Y's cash to a point where it has sought
protection from its creditors under US and Canadian insolvency laws. The
4.5m sq ft office complex is only 60 per cent let.
But in one respect, Mr Miller had a point. As a construction project, Canary
Wharf is an astounding achievement. In just five years it has transformed a
derelict area of disused docks into the highest-quality offices in the
country. The scale and panache of the Canary Wharf buildings present an
astonishing contrast to its surroundings.
Too astonishing, perhaps. The opulence of the development sits oddly with
the neighbouring buildings on the Isle of Dogs and the shabby housing of the
East End. Its critics in the neighbouring local authorities believe that a
massive office complex is an inappropriate way of revitalising the area and
its community. Its critics in the property market wonder whether the image
of Docklands will ever be able to overcome the down-at-heel neighbourhood.
It is too early to assess whether the scheme will succeed or fail. In the
long run, Canary Wharf could become a prestigious cornerstone of a
revitalised East End. But in the near future it is hard to see the project
living up to its developers' vision.
Its goal of creating a third business centre to rival the City and West End
was always ambitious. Certainly, Canary Wharf had little in common with the
government's original intention for the area which, at the start of the
1980s, was a wasteland. The vision was a modest one. When Mrs Thatcher's
first government set up an enterprise zone in the Docklands, it only
expected to attract industrial companies to the area.
The stakes were quickly raised. Private developers, supposedly the best
forecasters of demand, were willing to invest ever-larger sums in the
Docklands. The London Docklands Development Corporation, set up in 1981 to
oversee the regeneration of the area, also worked tirelessly in attracting
new tenants. Even before O&amp;Y arrived on the scene, the area enjoyed a
feverish period of commercial and residential expansion.
For a time, the Docklands was a magnet for investment - attracting five
times as much private money as public funds. But many who entered the market
have regretted it bitterly. Well over half its building never found tenants,
making the Docklands a developer's graveyard. The latest casualty is South
Quay, the developer of a 300,000 sq ft building just across the water from
Canary Wharf, which yesterday went into administrative receivership.
The question now facing the Docklands is whether it can fulfil the lofty
aspirations symbolised by the Canary Wharf project. Or will it take on a
more modest role, poor relation to the business headquarters of Central
London.
Part of the answer depends on whether it has already achieved sufficient
momentum to build itself up as a centre for international companies in
London. Canary Wharf already has an impressive roster of US-owned tenants,
ranging from American Express, to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, which
could attract others to the area.
But to a greater extent, the future of the Docklands rests with the
government, which can influence events in two crucial ways. First, it is
considering moving at least 2,000 and possibly up to 5,000 civil servants to
the area. Second and equally important is its willingness to finance the
extension of the Jubilee Underground Line, due to be completed in 1996 at a
cost of Pounds 1.7bn.
The government is divided on what to do. It is unwilling to send civil
servants to the Docklands unless the future of the Jubilee Line extension is
assured. But it is unclear whether Canary Wharf's banks will honour O&amp;Y's
commitment to fund the extension. The company is due to pay Pounds 100m over
the next year and a further Pounds 300m when the line is completed.
If the banks refuse to provide the funds, some ministers would like the
government to make up the difference. The cost, they argue, is a relatively
small price to pay for salvaging the world's biggest urban redevelopment
project.
The Treasury sees the matter in a different light. At a time of a ballooning
budget deficit, it needs to cut expenditure. It thinks that Canary Wharf's
owners will, eventually, be willing to help finance the Underground
extension that will greatly add to the buildings' value.
An extra twist is provided by the negotiations with the Department of the
Environment, which is moving from its current offices in Marsham Street and
is considering several Docklands locations. Although the department was
close to clinching a deal with Canary Wharf earlier this week, it has yet to
be sure that it is obtaining the best possible value for money.
The government's need to find a satisfactory route out of this maze is
complicated by the symbolic role that Canary Wharf has played as a flagship
of the enterprise culture of the 1980s. The government cannot totally
divorce itself from the fate of the project, which it promoted as a
prominent example of a partnership between the public and private sectors.
The prime incentive for the government to rescue the project and the Jubilee
Line extension lies in its commitment to develop the east of London. This is
reflected in the concentration of infrastructure spending in the area, the
routing of the high-speed rail link from the Channel through Stratford and
the grandiose, although sketchily defined, plans for development along the
East London Corridor, a tract of land stretching through Essex that is
earmarked for urban renewal.
The three borough councils abutting the Docklands Development Corporation -
Southwark, Newham and Tower Hamlets, gateway to the 'East London Corridor' -
are watching developments with anxiety.
For all three, Canary Wharf is a symbol of hope - or more particularly,
jobs. The Jubilee Line is seen as vital to reviving the whole area.
Unemployment levels are high: about 19 per cent in the Peckham and Southwark
and Bermondsey constituencies, and higher still in Bow and Poplar (21 per
cent) - which includes the South Poplar district, for which the council is
currently seeking urban regeneration funding under the government's City
Challenge scheme.
East London regeneration projects are only weakly tied to Canary Wharf for
the most part, but Tower Hamlets has recruitment, amenities and education
agreements with Olympia &amp; York, which may be nullified in the event of a
collapse.
'Development in the southern side of the borough was driven by Docklands,'
says Ms Janet Ludlow, the Tower Hamlets representative on the Docklands
Development Corporation. 'It's slumped since the recession, but could take
ages to revive if Olympia &amp; York go under.'
There is a certain irony in the possibility that the government will come to
the rescue of the project. A key reason for Canary Wharf's problems has been
the slow progress made by the Department of Transport in improving the
Dockland's transport links.
O&amp;Y's executives were incensed at the inefficiency and poor management of
the Docklands Light Railway, which sullied the reputation of the entire
area. When O&amp;Y appeared before the House of Commons transport committee in
1990, it said the average delays experienced by DLR passengers were between
10 and 100 times greater than those found on any comparable system in the
world.
Transport has not been the only problem facing O&amp;Y and other Docklands
developers. Canary Wharf might have pulled its ambitious plans off had it
not been for the deepest slump in London commerical property prices in
living memory.
The recession bit at the same time as a record number of new buildings came
on stream, the legacy of the property boom of the late 1980s. There is now
no shortage of large, modern air-conditioned buildings in the City where one
in five buildings is empty.
Together with other Docklands projects Canary Wharf inspires mixed reactions
from its tenants, with some bemoaning a shortage of shops, difficult
transport and a sense of isolation. However, the developments also have
ardent admirers, whose enthusiasm is undimmed by O&amp;Y's problems.
'Whatever happens to the owners, it is still an extraordinary facility,'
said Mr Jerry Roberts, general manager of Ogilvy and Mather Europe, the
advertising agency. 'There is still a tremendous shortage of this kind of
quality of place with as much flexibility as one has in Canary Wharf.'
But O&amp;Y has had difficulty is persuading UK companies of the merits of the
high-quality, large buildings at Canary Wharf, leaving the overwhelming
majority of buildings to North American tenants. The developers found many
UK companies resisted moving. 'We have to identify people who have the
courage and personal leadership skills to risk the disdain of their
colleagues,' said a senior O&amp;Y executive last year.
Is there, the developers mused, something intrinsically conservative about
the British that deterred them from pioneering a new district? Were they so
prejudiced against the East End that they could not see its potential? Were
they so tightly bound to familiar streets and watering holes that they were
unwilling to explore new locations?
The fate of London's Docklands hangs in the balance. If the Jubilee Line
extension is completed and the government takes a lead in mopping up the
surplus space, it will have gone some way to overcoming the pyschological
barriers of potential tenants as well as its physical isolation. The
development of the area moved faster and further than anyone thought
possible during the 1980s. Decisions made in the next few weeks will
determine whether that impetus has been lost for good.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN FOR those who believe that a recovery is imminent, the economic news in
Britain this week must have seemed unremittingly awful. The bits that
mattered could best be summarised in telegrammatic form: inflation up,
unemployment up, Olympia &amp; York down. The only consolation for the
government was that the recent election result has temporarily punctured the
old joke about the economist's lag being the politician's nightmare. But
that does not make it any less of a nightmare for everyone else. It also
begs the question of what is happening to the economy now.
It is, of course, possible to put a gloss on the bad news. The jump in the
year-on-year headline inflation rate from 4 per cent in March to 4.3 per
cent in April was less than expected and reflected a number of price
increases specific to April. These included the budget increases in excise
duties and the annual rises in the poll tax, rents and water charges.
More worrying was the 12-month increase in average earnings, which was back
up to 7.5 per cent in March after the February figure had been revised
upwards from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent. Here the mitigating factors were
the urge by employers in March last year to postpone settlements as
inflation came down, while this year they were paying bonuses early to
pre-empt Labour's tax plans. Moreover, pay settlements, which are not fully
reflected in average earnings until a year has elapsed, have been falling
much faster than earnings.
Even so, the failure of average earnings to fall below 7 per cent after
three years of hard disinflationary grind is a sorry outcome for the
government's efforts. With the jobless total at 2.7m and rising, inflation
in UK manufacturing earnings is still among the highest in the OECD area,
outstripped only by Italy, Greece and Portugal. This curious dichotomy
between North European hair shirt and Mediterranean indulgence raises
awkward questions about the thrust of policy. A rate of interest that might
be appropriate for the purpose of squeezing inflation out of the labour
market has the unwelcome by-product of throttling over-indebted property
companies and home owners. That is why the path towards economic recovery is
proving so long and difficult.
The path for the bank creditors of Olympia &amp; York Developments - a name that
aptly captures the element of hubris in this Canadian-based group's global
expansion - will be longer than most. Olympia &amp; York is about to submit to a
bankers' work-out. And with much of its Pounds 6.7bn debt committed to
Canary Wharf in London's Docklands it will do so partly under British
monetary discipline.
That is important; because whereas North America has been seeking to escape
from its debt overhang by reducing nominal interest rates and pumping
reserves into the system, the British authorities remain, as we have seen,
more preoccupied with inflation than debt. So any work-out for sterling debt
will be very different from the last one in property during the mid-1970s.
Then, inflation was running at over 20 per cent. Real interest rates were
negative and the real burden of debt was eroding rapidly. In the meantime,
the impact of the property crash on the banks was partly blunted by historic
cost accounting and valuers' sleight of hand. This time inflation is lower
and it offers less help to asset values. Positive real interest rates mean
that the gap between income and debt service is widening painfully and
inexorably. As a property entrepreneur aptly quipped, in thanking the
outgoing chairman of Barclays this week for a speech, 'we owe you more than
we can ever repay'.
In the absence of a dramatic shift in monetary policy, which seems unlikely
with Britain in the ERM, this means that the problems of over-indebted
property companies will continue to worsen. The question about the ability
of the British banking system to finance an economic recovery becomes more
acute by the day.

<TEXT>
IT IS EASY to be scornful of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's diatribe against the
European Community. The immoderation of her language has confirmed the
wisdom of the Conservative party in retiring her. Equating the 'half-Europe
imposed by Soviet tyranny' with the objectives of the EC Commission is a
ponderous calumny worthy of those who recently ruled east of the Elbe. The
Brussels windmills at which she tilts are grinding British liberties much
less fiercely than she imagines.
The ex-prime minister does, however, perform a service in exposing
contradictions in the Maastricht process. As she predicted in the past, many
countries in practice are much less willing to transfer national powers to
Community institutions than their Euro-rhetoric suggested. That is why the
Germans are jibbing at abandoning the D-Mark. But that is also why Europe is
not charging down the road towards a 'super-state' in the manner Mrs
Thatcher supposes.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Man In The News: Iron hand in a regulator's glove - Sir
James McKinnon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, will be smouldering over his
gas-fired barbecue in Eastbourne this weekend at the ignominy of being
forced to cut domestic gas prices. Sir James McKinnon, who as head of the
Office of Gas Supply, the industry regulator, is Mr Evans' adversary in the
gas price wars, can relish another victory for the consumer.
For Sir James, forcing British Gas to cut its prices marks the latest
triumph in a struggle to shake the company out of the complacency stemming
from its long-held position as monopoly supplier to the UK's 17.8m household
customers. Sir James's soft Glaswegian burr and his polite manner conceal a
gladiatorial spirit which British Gas has repeatedly misjudged in the stormy
six-year relationship following the company's privatisation in 1986.
But the latest row, which erupted two weeks ago when Sir James called for a
price cut on an early-morning radio programme, has pushed relations between
regulator and supplier to a nadir. Many industry observers question whether
the company and Ofgas will be able to hold a constructive dialogue again.
The fact that Sir James has emerged as the victor from his disputes with the
company and that Mr Evans has complained many times to the government about
his interference, have cast Sir James in the role of the consumer's
champion. It is a role he relishes. There is little doubt of his delight in
being in the public eye or of his skill in conducting his debates with
British Gas through the columns of the newspapers.
But as Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, puts it: 'Each
side is developing something approaching contempt for the other, and if
relationships cannot be re-established, that is not in the long-term
interests of consumers.' Mr Powe points to the need for co-operation between
the watchdog and the utility as part of initiatives such as the energy trust
launched last week whereby British Gas is offering money to help low-income
households.
The 'creative tension', which is the way Sir James has often described his
relationship with British Gas, has fast degenerated into warfare and an
atmosphere of extreme distrust between the two. Sir James complains that
British Gas will not debate change in its marketplace or pricing with him
but is put on the defensive when he goes ahead and imposes measures such as
the new pricing formula for household supplies. He accuses the company of
not being pro-active enough.
British Gas, steeped in a culture of government bureaucracy - a legacy from
its life as a nationalised monopoly - where decisions are arrived at behind
closed doors, has failed to adjust to the new regulatory environment. The
company often criticises Sir James for being reluctant to sit round a table
with its top executives. One of its chief complaints about Sir James's
recent demand for a price cut was that he would not hold a meeting to talk
about it.
The company's antipathy towards Sir James is not diminished by his
willingness to exploit to the full the powers conferred on him by the Gas
Act, which privatised British Gas in 1986. He has managed to get many
regulatory steps such as the introduction of the new pricing formula and the
overhaul of the industrial gas market accepted by British Gas only under
threat of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could
prove more punitive.
The relationship was not initially envisaged as being quite so combative.
When Sir Peter Walker found the then Mr McKinnon for the regulator's job, he
was hoping to appease Sir Denis Rooke, chairman of British Gas at
privatisation and outspoken advocate of a monopoly gas supplier. Sir James
was cast as a retired accountant who would be glad of a cosy sinecure.
Sir James, a lorry driver's son, had been with the Imperial Group for nearly
20 years - eight of those as finance director. He left the company when
Hanson took it over in 1986, having staunchly resisted the hostile bid.
Close associates of Sir James say he believed he did not get the recognition
due to him at the Imperial Group and, far from being a spent force, he was
looking for a new challenge.
The seeds of his relationship with British Gas were sown in his early days
in office. On taking up the post he said: 'It would be a mistake to think
that we will be confronting the British Gas Corporation in any sense. Our
job is to ensure that it carries out what it is supposed to do.'
But very quickly he ran into the formidable personality of Sir Denis, who
refused to refer to Sir James by name, calling him, even to his own staff,
the director-general. Sir James's initial attempts to elicit information
from British Gas relevant to his regulatory role were met with blank
refusals and later reluctance and obscurantism. He soon realised he would
have to be tougher or fail to make a mark altogether.
Sir James's job was not made any easier by the manner in which British Gas
was privatised - in retrospect, many in the industry believe the company
should have been broken into competing regional companies as in the
electricity industry. Sir James deserves credit for working towards
competition while saddled with what remains essentially a monopoly
structure.
A staunch believer in competition and free markets, he must receive the
plaudits for pushing for a better deal for consumers in spite of his
publicity-conscious methods. Mr Peter Nicol, industry analyst at SG Warburg,
the securities house, says: 'He has probably taken British Gas to an
entirely different place in 1992 than was envisaged in 1986.'
But Mr Powe at the Gas Consumers Council believes that it is now time to
start offering some olive branches and toning down the public acrimony
between Sir James and British Gas before the disputes destroy British Gas's
credibility altogether. But both sides have dug in their heels and without a
change at the top of either body, the relationship is likely to remain sour.

FT  16 MAY 92 / BP sheds 330 jobs in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is to shed 330 jobs in its chemicals operation at
Grangemouth, on the Firth of Forth in Scotland.
The losses are the result of a company-wide review of operations. The
company said reorganisation and revised work practices at Grangemouth were
essential if the plant was to remain competitive.
About 225 of the redundancies are among BP staff, the rest among contract
and agency staff. They will be phased over 18 months, and the company said
it hoped most could be achieved voluntarily. Grangemouth's oil and chemicals
complex employs 2,050 people at present.
The cost-cutting programme has already brought redundancies at two of the
company's four other UK sites. Four hundred job losses were announced at the
company's plant in Hull, Humberside, and 120 at Baglan Bay in south Wales.
The BP group last week announced an 80 per cent decline in first-quarter
profit, which was insufficient to cover its dividend payment. The chemicals
division, suffering in the recession, lost Pounds 25m, compared with a
Pounds 54m profit in the same period last year.
Three hundred jobs will be lost following a decision by Asda, the
supermarket group, to close 17 stores belonging to its Allied Maples carpet
and furniture subsidiary. The closures follow a strategic review of the
business. Allied Maples blamed the recession for difficult trading
conditions.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Jersey row sparks call for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between Britain and Jersey caused by the home secretary's dismissal
of one of the island's judges may lead to its assembly seeking some
constitutional changes.
Jersey's distinctive financial regime, however, and its status as an
autonomous territory under the British Crown are not at stake in the
dispute.
Earlier this week Mr Kenneth Clarke dismissed Mr Vernon Tomes, Jersey's
deputy bailiff, a post combining judicial functions with the deputy
speakership of the states, Jersey's autonomous assembly. The reason for
dismissal was inefficiency in delivering legal judgments.
The decision angered many islanders, and Mr Tomes has announced his
intention to stand for election to the states when elections are due in St
Helier.
Moves are also afoot to split the judicial from the political functions of
the deputy bailiff's post, to restrict the scope for future interference
from London in the island's political affairs.
'Feeling here is strong,' said Mr Pierre Horsfall, president of the states'
finance and economics committee. 'But there is no question of instability -
or of any threat to the island's political and economic systems from
mainland Britain.'
The Queen, on the advice of ministers, appoints judges and a lieutenant
governor for the island. Beyond that, Jersey enjoys almost complete fiscal
and legislative autonomy from the British mainland.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Bruges II lives up to its billing: Thatcher's speech on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Conservatives these days are inclined to respond to Mrs Margaret
Thatcher's public pronouncements on the future of Europe with a carefully
patronising smile.
Their expressions carry a simple message: 'Of course we listen but, well,
the former prime minister is finding it so difficult to adapt to retirement;
we should not be surprised if she sometimes sounds a little eccentric.'
It is an image for which Mrs Thatcher must accept some of the blame. Even as
prime minister she tended to shoot from the hip. Freed from the steadying
hand of her Downing Street office, she has too frequently allowed
intemperate language and unguarded outbursts against her successor to blur
her message.
She did not make that mistake yesterday. Her speech on Europe's political
architecture during the 1990s ceded no ground to those who believe in a
federal future for the continent, but it carefully avoided gratuitous
criticism of Mr John Major for his willingness to remain, albeit grudgingly,
on the route mapped out by Britain's European partners.
The speech was billed 'Bruges II', the follow-up to her devastating attack
four years ago on the ambitions of Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the
European Commission. It lived up to the billing.
The central theme was that everything that has happened since Bruges has
strengthened rather than weakened her argument for a loose confederation of
sovereign states rather than a federalist superstate.
Since the row in her party that triggered her political downfall, Mrs
Thatcher has become more convinced that Europe's leaders are grappling with
a vision of the past rather than of the future. She believes it should be
looking forward to a community of 30 states rather than to a bureaucratic
structure designed to impose uniformity on the present membership of 12.
The community's duty to embrace the emerging democracies of eastern Europe
argued for a 'multi-track' Europe based on a single, free market but in
which ad hoc groups of countries could forge varying degrees of co-operation
on different issues.
She is as concerned as ever about the dominant role Germany might take in a
tightly knit community; as certain as ever that the way to constrain German
ambitions is to widen rather than deepen the community.
Mr Major, no great admirer of the commission, is sympathetic to some of the
detail of her analysis. In spite of Downing Street's deliberately low-key
response, it is one that is impossible to reconcile with the prime
minister's commitment at the heart of Europe.

THE venture capital group 3i has nearly doubled its level of new investment
in the UK in the past six months, helped by increasing confidence in the
economy.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said the level of investment had been

made new investments of more than Pounds 275m in the six months from October
last year to March, an increase of 90 per cent on the same period in the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S Kurds vote tomorrow in an election conducted in a carnival atmosphere
but condemned by the regime of President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad and by
Turkey and Iran, the two neighbouring states with large Kurdish populations.
The election is another attempt by the Kurds to assert the right to a free
and independent state and comes in the wake of the severe setback they
suffered when Baghdad partially crushed their spontaneous uprising in the
wake of the Gulf war.
The poll has been organised by the Kurdistan Front, a coalition of seven
parties which has administered the region following the creation by allied
forces of 'safe havens'.
Although party allegiance is based partly on loyalties forged during decades
of hardship, disruption and war, an important new issue has emerged: whether
Iraqi Kurdistan should break entirely from Iraq.
Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is
seeking a mandate for autonomy within Iraq.
But Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK),
supports 'self-determination' for the region.

FT  16 MAY 92 / South Africa's bitter foes snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for political power in the new South Africa yesterday began in
earnest.
For many frantic hours, the two largest political groups, the mainly white
National Party and the mainly black African National Congress (ANC), clashed
and retreated, fought and finally abandoned hope of deciding whether South
Africa should be governed by majority rule, or by power-sharing.
It was a momentous failure of will by those charged with determining the
political future of South Africa. Only two months after the stunning
referendum victory in which white South Africa finally voted out apartheid,
hopes of multi-racial power-sharing were frustrated yet again and violence
looked set to intensify.
An agreement already reached to establish a multi-racial interim government
cannot now be implemented. Multi-party control of the security forces,
crucial to contain the violence which has left 11,000 people dead since
1984, cannot be established.
Remaining economic sanctions, which would largely have been lifted on
installation of an interim government, will remain in place. Normalised
relations with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) remain a
distant prospect. Popular protest will intensify, under the direction of the
ANC which is likely to stage a general strike. South Africa risks a period
of even worse political violence. Mr Chris Hani, Communist Party leader,
threatened last night that Codesa would 'hear the voice of our mobilised
masses.'
Angry ANC officials yesterday accused the government of sabotaging
democracy, and insulting them to boot. Government negotiators reverted to
the Cold War rhetoric of the apartheid past, accusing the ANC of wishing to
impose a 'Communist-Marxist' constitution on South Africa.
Voices shook with anger, or failed altogether under the strain of days of
crisis talks. A furious Mr Joe Slovo, senior leader of the ANC, accused the
government of insisting on a minority veto: 'We can only conclude . . . that
what they fear, like nothing else, is democracy.' But Mr Pik Botha, the
foreign minister, called democracy to his defence as well, claiming that the
government supports democratic federalism; he damned the ANC for wanting a
centralist, unitary and majoritarian state.
The fragile trust built over the past four months in the conference rooms of
the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - where hundreds of
officials spent thousands of hours in the unfamiliar practice of talking to
one another - did not survive the day. The 19 parties to the talks,
representing liberation leaders, discredited homeland governments, ethnic
leaders and the government, acknowledged deadlock. Mr Zach de Beer, leader
of the liberal Democratic Party, bemoaned the fact that 'defeat has been
snatched from the jaws of victory.'
South Africans watching yesterday's slanging match on national television
must have found it difficult to understand the root of the dispute. But
behind the complex proposals tabled by both sides lay a basic disagreement
over how decisions should be taken in the elected body which will eventually
write a post-apartheid constitution.
The National Party tabled proposal after proposal designed to allow it, in
alliance with other ethnic minority parties, to veto decisions of the
constitution-making body. This would be achieved either by imposing a
requirement that decisions be taken by 75 per cent majority; or a specially
elected senate, with disproportionately large representation for regional
and minority groups, would veto decisions of the main body. The ANC proposed
a two-thirds majority (which it assumes would exclude a National Party
veto). It offered to accept a 70 per cent majority (with 75 per cent to
approve the bill of rights), but then insisted that a popular referendum be
called if that majority could not be achieved.
But when the last acrimonious word had been said to the television cameras,
the 200-odd delegates filed sombrely into the conference hall to debate
again. Delegates agreed that Codesa had reached deadlock, but not disaster.
It is not clear whether the constitutional talks at Codesa will continue ,
or whether the warring factions will observe a temporary or extended truce.
But from the two opposing camps - the ANC-led group, which included
liberation movements and some homeland governments, as well as the
government-led group, which included the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party and
other ethnic parties - the message was the same. They have no alternative
but to return to Codesa .. whether in a week, a month, or a year.
When they do, they will come with eyes open and illusions dashed, and each
will know his enemy much more clearly than before. Minds will have been
concentrated on the real battle ahead.
As one veteran negotiator commented, a propos the talks which brought
Namibian independence: 'There are two elements to any successful
negotiation: fear and pain.' Early or late, those two forces will propel
South Africans back to the negotiating table.

FT  16 MAY 92 / US output rise boosts hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a sustained US economic recovery were bolstered yesterday when the
Federal Reserve reported a 0.5 per cent increase in industrial production in
April, the third consecutive monthly increase.
The figures were better than financial markets expected and partly reflected
a sharp rebound in car production. However, most sectors of industry have
shown a steady improvement since January.
Production has now almost retraced the falls of last autumn, when the
economy seemed to be heading for a 'double-dip' recession. Industrial output
stands 2.5 per cent above the level in April last year.
Manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent last month and 2.9 per cent in the
year to April.
The improved production figures follow reports of gains in both employment
and retail sales in April. On Thursday the Fed also reported a sharp rise in
the money supply, bringing it just above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per
cent target range.
Many analysts believe a quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates is
still likely in the next few weeks despite the improved economic figures. A
reduction would trigger a cut in banks' prime lending rates, now 6.5 per
cent, and add vigour to the recovery.
A decision on rates could be taken as early as next Tuesday, when Fed
governors and regional presidents meet in Washington to review monetary
policy.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Madrid to press ahead with anti-strike laws
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government is to press ahead with tough new anti-strike
legislation after failing to reach agreement with trades unions in
negotiations last week.
Just two weeks before a general strike planned for May 28, the government
has decided to abandon negotiations on the law with the unions.
Union leaders attacked the government's decision to take its proposals to
parliament as 'provocative.'
The law, certain to be passed in the next few months, seeks to regulate the
way strikes are run. It would allow the state to impose minimum services
during strikes, fine or sack strike leaders, withdraw state subsidies to
unions, and give judges the power to decide whether a strike was political
and therefore illegal.
Growing union dissatisfaction over the strike law has added to ill-feeling
between the government and the unions and the proposed legislation - along
with Madrid's decision to save Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) this year by
cutting unemployment benefits - helped trigger the half-day strike planned
for the morning of May 28.
The government ordered the jobless benefit cuts in April as part of its
proposals to cut public deficits and take Spain into European Economic and
Monetary Union by 1997. It believes it may have driven the unions into a
corner by forcing them to strike.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French prices rose by between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent in April, the
11th consecutive month that France's rate of inflation has been lower than
Germany's, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
This brings to 1 per cent the rise in French inflation since the turn of the
year, or 3.1 per cent over the past 12 months, according to provisional
figures. That represents a slight decline in the annual rate, from 3.2 per
cent in March.
However, economists believe the trend is stable, since prices fell
automatically in April thanks to the government's decision to reduce the top
rate of VAT from 22 per cent to 18.6 per cent. This month's inflation will
be affected by the 10.5 per cent rise in tobacco prices from April 27, part
of the government's anti-smoking campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A former top prosecuter claimed in congressional testimony yesterday that he
had been impeded last year by the Department of Justice in his efforts to
obtain documents and bring indictments against the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI).
Mr Dexter Lehtinen, US Attorney in Miami until four months ago, complained
that despite numerous written requests to Washington, the department
declined to give him permission to enforce subpoenas demanding crucial BCCI
documents about the bank's Luxembourg and other non-US operations.
Mr Lehtinen testified that in a separate instance, a Justice Department
official told him last August not to bring a tax charge against BCCI. The
former prosecuter said the order not to bring the indictment has been given
by Mr William Barr, the US Attorney-General, and relayed to him by a deputy
of Mr Barr.
The department has consistently denied that it impeded any US investigations
of BCCI.
Mr Lehtinen, before a senate foreign relations sub-committee, said he had
written to the department in May 1991, requesting assistance on BCCI,
because he believed his investigation would 'crack open a case of the
greatest national urgency.'
He said he was told repeatedly by Justice Department officials in Washington
that an out-of-court BCCI settlement of a money laundering case in Tampa in
January 1990 precluded his bringing any further indictments in Miami.

Operating expenses rose by NKr2m to NKr156m.

SPAREBANKEN Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank known internationally as

the first quarter, helped by a reduction in operating costs and stable
income.
Operating profit was NKr4m (Dollars 629,400) compared with a NKr168m
operating loss in the same period last year. Operating profit, before credit
losses, rose by NKr137m to NKr317m. Credit losses were reduced by NKr35m to
NKr313m.
Sparebanken Nor said that net interest income improved slightly to NKr657m
from NKr644m. Operating costs were reduced by NKr81m to NKr584m. The bank
boosted specified loan loss reserves to NKr2.6bn from NKr1.7bn in last
year's first quarter reporting period. Unspecified loan loss reserves were
increased by NKr367m to NKr1.17bn.
'The most important reason for the bank's improvement is a 14 per cent
reduction in operating costs by the parent bank,' Sparebanken Nor said.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari has given Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex),
Mexico's state oil company, 30 days to present plans for a fundamental
restructuring of its operations.
The order comes less than a month after the explosion at Guadalajara that
killed 200 people. The company has been widely blamed for the disaster and,
during the past couple of weeks, has been subject to sustained and bitter
criticism.
Few details of the plans are known, but they are likely to lead to a greater
decentralisation of Pemex's operations, and further demarcation between its
lines of businesses. Local managers may assume greater responsibility for
operations. It is expected more services will be contracted out to private
companies.
Pemex, and Mexico's oil reserves, will remain under full state ownership,
and foreign oil companies will still not be allowed to explore for oil in
Mexico, nor build and operate refineries.
Under advice from McKinsey, the US consultancy, Pemex has already been
divided into five profit and cost centres - exploration and production,
petrochemicals, refining, sales, and construction. It is intended that the
accounting price of trade between the centres be based on a formula linked
to international prices.
However, this new structure is meeting resistance within Pemex, and is not
thought to be as running as smoothly as the government would like.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Genoa hails Columbus

<TEXT>
The bets are off whether Italy will have a president in time to cut the
ribbon, but whoever performs the ceremony, the city of Genoa will today
celebrate the opening of its bid to cash in on the Christopher Columbus
industry, Haig Simonian writes from Genoa.
Genoa's most famous son left his native city for Spain after failing to find
sufficient financial backing at home for his expedition to the New World.
Latter-day Italian bureaucracy has meant Genoa's current attempt to mark its
most celebrated mariner has also taken second place to Spain, with the
international exhibition in Seville to mark the quincentenary of Columbus's
discovery opening well ahead of its Genovese rival. But the Genovese, who
have had around L700bn (Pounds 317m) of Italian government money to shower
on their event, claim it is not competing with either Seville or Eurodisney,
the main European crowd-pullers.
The result has been a worthy, if slightly dull, exhibition concentrating on
the wider themes of 'Christopher Columbus, ships and the sea' which is
somewhat short on fun but long enough on architectural heritage and urban
renovation.
The project, over four years in the making, was designed by Mr Renzo Piano,
the Genovese architect best known for his part in designing Paris's Pompidou
Centre.

<TEXT>
BUSINESS must take the lead in persuading the British government to
sacrifice its opt-out clause on European monetary union, Mr Brian Garraway,
deputy chairman of BAT Industries, said yesterday.
He told a joint FT-Lovell White Durrant conference on the impact of EC law
and policy that, following the Conservative election victory, the government
had the opportunity to assert leadership on European monetary union.
Business would benefit from monetary union through the disappearance of
exchange rate variations between member states, and through the cost savings
and efficiency benefits of not having to deal in separate currencies once a
single currency was adopted, he said.
However, achieving the prize of monetary union was not just a matter of
setting up a central banking system and meeting criteria for economic
convergence. The transition would involve direct and indirect costs and
upheaval.
'Governments face a massive job in getting the essential support among the
public and business for a reform which is vital to the well-being and
development of European industry,' Mr Garraway said.

Reuter reports from Vilnius.
Mr Mitterrand, the most senior western leader to visit the Baltic states
since they regained independence from Moscow last August, told the
Lithuanian parliament: 'Fix a timetable, organise discussion, gain the
support of the other democratic states of Europe and the solidarity of
international conferences of free countries so that your freedom of decision

He said Lithuania's desire to join the European Community eventually was
legitimate but added: 'Let us not speed things up faster than is
appropriate. Let us plan the (intervening) time.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Latvia issues parallel rouble / A look at the 'suicide'
steps being taken to cope with currency shortages in the Baltic states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPE LEGRAIN, ANTHONY ROBINSON and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A move which the International Monetary Fund calls 'economic suicide',
Latvia has issued its own parallel currency and other Baltic states are
taking similar measures to ease the rouble shortage afflicting the former
Soviet republics.
Raging inflation has led to an acute cash shortfall which the Russian
financial authorities - who consider the independent Baltic states as debtor
nations - have refused to meet. As a result the payment of wages and
pensions is often delayed for months, strengthening the pressure on Baltic
governments to replace the hated 'occupation rouble'.
Latvia responded on May 7 by issuing a transitional currency, the 'Latvian
rouble', which is legal tender on its territory together with the Russian
rouble. Lithuania has made a similar limited step, decreeing that its
'Vagnorky coupons' are to serve as rouble substitutes. Estonia has printed
its own money, the kroon, but has decided not to issue it for the time
being.
The convertibility of the new currencies is strictly limited. They will be
used for public-sector wages and payments, but it will be hard to force the
private sector to accept them. 'What happens when I pay a 25 rouble
restaurant bill with a 200 Vagnorky note?' asked a Lithuanian official. 'I
doubt I will get 175 roubles change.' Latvian citizens have already dubbed
their new currency 'white' money.
The IMF, which is supporting Russian moves to make the rouble convertible
and the linchpin of the entire 'rouble zone', has warned that the new
currencies will be even more vulnerable to inflation than the Russian
rouble. It warned that for the smaller, energy-dependent republics like the
Baltics to create their own currencies now would be 'economic suicide', says
Bank of Latvia president Einars Repse.
In its recent reports on the Baltic republics, the IMF said the short-term
economic outlook was 'bleak' in Latvia and Lithuania and 'precarious' in
Estonia, whose GDP could shrink by over 20 per cent this year.
The Fund has warned that the introduction of new and largely inconvertible
currencies would only deepen the slump as trade with the rest of the former
Soviet Union, which accounts for over 90 per cent of the total trade of the
Baltic states, is further disrupted.
The Baltic moves towards currency reform are motivated by political as much
as economic factors. The governments of all three Baltic states are in
crisis, facing economic depression, potential ethnic conflicts between their
native populations and over 2m ethnic Russians, and continuing occupation by
former Soviet troops.
In Latvia, parliament is increasingly critical of the government headed by
Mr Ivars Godmanis, made up largely of former communists. The government
could fall if the Latvian rouble is driven out of circulation by the Russian
rouble.
The Lithuanian government staggers on, although half its ministers resigned
at the end of April, while a whiff of scandal surrounds the Bank of
Lithuania's preparations for the new currency, the litas. President Vytautas
Landsbergis is expected to call new elections if he wins a popular mandate
from a referendum on an executive presidency on May 23.
In Estonia, the ex-communist government, elected under Soviet law, is under
fire from the rival Congress of Estonia, which represents the pre-war
republic's citizens and their descendants. Daily pickets outside the
parliament building have demanded the death of prominent ex-communists and
called for immediate, independently-run general elections. But the top
priority of all three governments is to ensure the speedy departure of the
estimated 100,000 former Soviet troops on their territory. Russia says it
lacks the funds or housing to relocate the troops and the latest round of
talks ended in deadlock. The Baltics are counting on western pressure to put
urgency into the troop withdrawals but thus far only the Scandinavian
countries have come out openly in favour of the Baltic stance.
'These troops must go,' Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president, said
during his recent visit to Lithuania,in a statement which marked a shift
from traditional Finnish reticence in dealing with the former Soviet Union.
Instead, Russia recently sent new troops into its Lithuanian bases, which
led President Landsbergis to accuse Russia of 'blatantly disregarding
Lithuanian sovereignty'. Repeated protests to General Valery Mironov, the
local commander of CIS troops, have gone unanswered.
Latvia's mission to the UN meanwhile has accused Russia of repairing a
Libyan submarine at Bolderaja dock near Riga in breach of international
sanctions. The Russian Foreign Ministry claims the submarine will take three
years to repair and pledged that it would not be returned to Libya while
sanctions were in force, according to Mr Mihails Stepicevs of the Latvian
parliament's commission on defence and internal affairs.
The combination of political, military and economic uncertainty is taking
its toll of the reform process throughout the region. Only Lithuania has
begun privatising state-owned enterprises, while prices have not yet been
completely liberalised and a carousel of subsidies still protects the less
well-off.
The old state monopolies try to squeeze the last drops out of the faltering
Soviet supply system to keep shops full, although prices are very expensive
for local wages and salaries. 'The reform process is very slow and the
instinctive reaction is still a communist one,' said a western diplomat
summing up the obstacles to faster change.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday that the
government still intended to make the rouble convertible at a rate of 60 to
80 to the dollar - in spite of doubts voiced by officials at the Russian
Central Bank, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Nechayev told the news agency Interfax that the rate was 'fairly
realistic', given the availability of a Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund
provided by the IMF and the Group of Seven countries - though he admitted it
would bring difficulties for importers and investors.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the Central Bank and Mr Dmitri Tulin,
the deputy chairman, have in the past few days poured cold water on the
intention of the government to move to a fixed and internally convertible
rouble by the autumn.
Timing the move towards fixing the rouble remains uncertain, given the
doubts of the Central Bank - without whose co-operation it could not happen.
The Central Bank will itself be in the dock next week, following a decision
of the Russian parliament to examine its performance. Many deputies consider
it has ceased to be responsive to the will of parliament, under whose
jurisdiction it falls.

FT  15 MAY 92 / 'Violent assault on carbon tax' angers di Meana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The EC has faced a 'violent assault from industrial lobbies and the Gulf
countries, which even threatened to break off diplomatic relations'
following the announcement of its energy tax, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC
environment commissioner, said yesterday, agencies report.
Mr di Meana said the Commission would push ahead with a modified energy tax
even if the US and Japan did not impose a similar levy to reduce global
warming.
He spoke a day after proposing a tax on non-renewable energy sources, such
as coal and oil, of dollars 3 on the equivalent of a barrel of oil in 1993,
rising to dollars 10 by 2000.
This tax, he said on Wednesday, would be imposed only after the US and Japan
agreed to introduce similar measures. However, a lower tax would be levied
by the EC if other industrial countries failed to act.
Mr di Meana attributed intense US lobbying against the tax to efforts to
make next month's UN environment conference a meaningless event.
'It is vital that Rio is not simply a media event (but yields) concrete
decisions with binding obligations to achieve precise targets.'
Mr di Meana complained about US lobbying. 'Sometimes Big Brother's
suggestions go too far,' he said, hinting that US diplomats had tried to put
undue pressure on him to kill the energy tax.
So far the only public reaction from oil-producing countries in the Middle
East has come from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).
Mr Subroto, the organisation's secretary-general, said yesterday he believed
the tax would not be implemented because of opposition from the US.
On Wednesday, Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister criticised Mr
Ripa di Meana for waiting for US and Japanese agreement before imposing the
energy tax. He said he wanted Europe to 'go it alone in introducing EC-wide
carbon dioxide taxes.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Industry doubtful but resigned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL reaction to the carbon tax proposal yesterday was mixed. Heavy
consumers of energy winced at the added costs, but the majority adopted a
resigned approach, expressing doubt that the impact would be as great as
feared.
Many companies argued that the tax was misdirected. Greater energy savings
could be achieved by, for example, investing in measures to clean up eastern
Europe.
National Power, the UK electricity generator which is one of Europe's
largest coal consumers, said it did not believe the proposal was either
practical or appropriate. 'There are other ways of achieving emission
reduction targets,' it said.
The airline industry emphasised that it had no alternative to jet fuel and
that a carbon tax would inevitably be reflected in increased fares.
Airlines also stressed that civil aviation only accounts for about 2-3 per
cent of total CO emissions and that significant advances have been made in
fuel efficiency.
British Airways, for which fuel accounts for 12.5 per cent of costs, argued
that revenues from such a tax should be used to help improve the
infrastructure of civil aviation, especially air traffic control. The tax
could encourage airlines to 'tank' fuel outside the EC with the risk of
increasing further CO emissions.
Ford yesterday took a lead in proclaiming itself in favour of the EC
proposals. 'We have long supported the concept of a carbon tax as one of the
most immediate and effective actions that can be taken in terms of
environmental protection,' it said.
However the tax has to be bad news for the vehicle industry. Lower mileages
as a result of costlier fuel could be expected to slow the rate of vehicle
replacement. A trend to smaller, lighter vehicles would be accelerated, to
the detriment of large, luxury cars which provide manufacturers with more
profit per unit.
However, Ford and other car makers say they regard both trends as long-term
inevitabilities even without the CO issue, as oil becomes an increasingly
scarce commodity.
The freight transport industry believes a carbon tax at the level suggested
will have little effect on fuel consumption. 'Fuel costs are so high that
economy is already a top priority,' said the UK Freight Transport
Association.
In the oil industry, some company executives said the tax would be
impractical and unlikely to reduce emissions. Shell, which has taken a high
profile on the environment said it was too early to comment on the tax.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Tax may run into political sands: Opposition from the US,
Japan and the Gulf is intense

<TEXT>
THE EC's proposal on the introduction of an energy and carbon tax could run
into the sands over whether it remains conditional on the US and Japan
adopting similar measures.
The Bush Administration is considered most unlikely to adopt a carbon tax.
Aside from the fact that Mr Bush is fighting an election this year, his
administration has staunchly resisted pressures for a fiscal solution to
energy and environmental problems.
The US aversion to deadlines on emissions controls was highlighted by Mr
Bush's earlier wavering on whether to attend the Rio Earth Summit. He made
his attendance conditional on a redraft of the treaty on climate change to
exclude specific deadlines for emission controls. The US is the only major
industrial nation which has not adopted the year 2000 deadline to reduce
emissions to 1990 levels.
Instead of taxes, the US strategy is based on a range of specific measures,
such as tightening efficiency standards for equipment, and promoting energy
efficiency audits.
The question, however, is whether the US can make progress on these fronts
without an energy tax. Last week the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics concluded taxation should form a key part of any
strategy to combat global warming.
The Japanese government, keen to take a high political profile on
environmental issues, was caught out of step by the Commission's approval of
such a tax on Wednesday.
Debate is continuing within Japanese ministries over an energy tax, but two
of the more powerful, the ministry of international trade and industry
(Miti) and the ministry of transport, have generally opposed a tax that
would increase fuel costs for industry.
Their concerns were reflected in Japanese delegates' insistence that the
Tokyo Declaration, issued last month at a UN-sponsored eminent persons'
meeting on the environment, contain only an ambiguous reference to energy
taxes and emphasise the importance of economic growth.
It will take the direct intervention of Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former
prime minister and faction boss chief, who has made the environment his
territory, to settle an inter-ministerial debate on energy taxes that has so
far lasted more than three years.
A month ago, Miti insisted that government discussion of an energy tax was
'only informal', but last night the ministry said such a tax was 'under
consideration'. Some Japanese officials argue that the country has already
made a contribution by agreeing to 'freeze' carbon dioxide emissions at the
1990 level by the year 2000.
However that ambiguous policy includes a per capita 'freeze', which has
allowed Miti to set a separate target for an 8 per cent increase in
emissions until the end of the decade. The target is based on projected
annual GNP growth of about 3.6 per cent.
The Environment Agency is in favour of an energy tax, and has suggested a
sliding scale of charges that would reflect the amount of carbon dioxide
emitted. The finance ministry is apparently not opposed to doubling the
present petrol tax from Y2.4 to Y4.8 per litre, raising about Y400bn that
could be spent on environment protection.
Elsewhere in Europe there are fears the EC tax is already in serious
trouble. In the Netherlands, which strongly favours using taxation for
ecological ends, Mr Hans Alders, the environment minister said: 'The more
countries that participate, the better it is ..but to make it dependent (on
US and Japanese participation) means nothing will get done,' he said.
Mr Ken Collins, chairman of the European Parliament's environment committee,
said after the decision that he had decided to cancel his attendance at next
month's Earth Summit in Rio. He described the event as 'a sham'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson depresses market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER than expected figures from international conglomerate Hanson cast a
dark shadow over the London market, helping to send equities in general into
retreat.
The group's half-year profits, which came in at Pounds 488m, down from the
corresponding period's Pounds 588m, were Pounds 2m below the lowest City
forecast. Several analysts also took the accompanying trading statement to
be downbeat, and brokers moved immediately to cut full-year forecasts by
about Pounds 100m to around the Pounds 1.1bn mark. BZW, however, said it was
leaving its current forecast at Pounds 1.14bn, although this figure now
includes Pounds 27m from the recent sale of the ICI stake.
Hanson shares closed 9 down at 232 1/2 p after heavy turnover of 15m and
further heavy business in the London Traded Options Market, where the
equivalent of more than 6m shares were dealt.
GrandMet pleases
Encouraging half-year results from Grand Metropolitan lifted the stock 7 to
509p in its biggest turnover for 18 months, 9.3m shares. Its core drinks
business was the power behind a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
402m.
Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest said: 'Stripping out the forex and other
variables, the organic growth in the drinks division was 7.1 per cent, which
is an outstanding performance.' The food and the retail sectors proved
slightly diappointing, and analysts were also surprised by the losses at the
Pearle optical business in the US.
County is looking for full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.015bn, down
Pounds 35m, and Pounds 1.184bn for 1993. Mr Martin Hawkins at Carr Kitcat &amp;
Aitken has cut his forecasts to Pounds 1.025bn and Pounds 1.17bn
respectively.
Shell Transport was one of a handful of stocks that bucked the trend as the
market was cheered by the group's first-quarter results, which beat the most
optimistic expectations.
Analysts, however, pointed out that the figures were greatly enhanced by
non-recurring exceptional items. The shares ran forward on the release of
the figures and at the day's high point were ahead 21 at 505p. Profit-taking
at the high levels, coupled with closer examination of the figures, saw the
stock relinquish some of the earlier gain to end a more modest 12 up at 496p
after heavy turnover of 11m.
A sizeable amount of the day's business was reported to have come from the
traded options market.
Commenting on the figures, Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said: 'The
actual underlying trading performance was modest after allowing for a large
number of special items. But the shares look attractive compared to those of
BP.'
Regulation worries, as British Gas reported figures in line with
expectations, hurt the shares, which ended 5 lower at 251p on volume of 12m.
The regulation worries in Gas spilled over into the Electricity Package,
down Pounds 117 at Pounds 3138. Profit-taking was also said to have been a
factor in the day's fall. The package is due to be unbundled in September.
Anglo-French paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins tumbled after it
announced the chief executive's resignation following differences over
future development. The shares fell 18 to 263p.
Kleinwort Benson favours the stock and yesterday issued a buy
recommendation, saying: 'The shares have significant upside and they are a
good long term buy.'
Among metals and engineers, British Steel shed 2 to 81 1/2 as increasing
fears emerged about the size of the dividend cut expected with the company's
full-year results next month. A select group of analysts is currently on a
company outing to Seville, in Spain.
A positive annual meeting at GKN lifted the shares and they closed 6 up at
372p.
The recent clutch of broker recommendations continued to benefit British
Aerospace and the shares gained 6 to 372p.
Good interim results from Burton Group pushed the shares 7 1/2 higher to 49
1/2 p, the Pounds 21.8m pre-tax profits being around Pounds 3m ahead of most
analysts' forecasts. The retail group also reported a slight pick-up in
sales in the past 10 weeks, leading to hopes that the long-awaited consumer
recovery was starting to show.
However, some analysts pointed out that sales were bound to see some
increase this year after being hit last year by the onset of recession and
by the rise in VAT. The level of costs also drew some criticism. New profit
forecasts fell in the range of Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m for 1992 and Pounds
18m to Pounds 23m for 1993. Burton was the most heavily traded stock
yesterday, with 26.6m shares changing hands.
Reflection on results from Marks and Spencer, and talk that its mail order
business was holding up, helped Great Universal Stores, the 'A' shares
rising 30 to 1588p.
A weak Wall Street hit drugs stocks, Glaxo tumbling 18 to 739p and
SmithKline Beecham relinquishing 12 to 871p.
Catering concern Compass Group jumped 21 to 539p as the market centred on
the sale talk surrounding its chief rival Gardner Merchant, a subsidiary of
Forte. A management buyout had been rumoured, with a possible listing to
follow. Yesterday there was also talk that Compass, in alliance with a US
company, may be interested in Gardner, but monopoly implications would seem
to rule this out.
BZW reiterated its buy stance on Rank Organisation, off 2 at 758p, and
Queens Moat Houses, a penny firmer at 88p. In a lengthy view on the sector,
the securities house also remained a seller of Forte, 2 down at 251p, and
Ladbroke, where rumours of imminent downgrades refuse to die and which lost
4 to 250p.
A weak property sector was enlivened by news of the proposed merger between
Capital &amp; Counties and its majority shareholder, TransAtlantic, a
Luxembourg-listed group owned by Liberty Life. The offer values Capital
shares, which started the day at 200p, at 233p. After leaping to 228p, they
later fell back to close at 205p on consideration of the dilution to
shareholders of the all-paper offer.

FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Enthusiasm for stocks begins to wane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS that the London market has peaked for the moment increased yesterday
as stock started to wash around without readily finding a home, and a number
of traders were beginning, with a certain amount of relief, to see the end
of the bull run.
Although the FT-SE 100 Index had found some support during the morning, a
combination of disappointing government figures, a large sell programme,
poor corporate results and a weakening Wall Street prompted a slide which
ended with the Footsie down 25.8 at 2,694.7, just off the day's low.
News that underlying average earnings for March were up 7.5 per cent led to
worries that the government's restraining influence on inflation is not so
firm as hoped. This gave traders their first chance of the day to do
something they had been looking to do all week - namely, take profits. On
the other hand, the rise in unemployment figures had been largely
discounted.
The profit-taking was part of a European trend that was particularly evident
in France, and to a lesser extent in Germany, yesterday.
There were signs of nervousness in the gilts market and in the performance
of short sterling. This was followed shortly after midday by the sale of
between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m worth of Footsie stocks in a programme
trade which took the wind out of the market.
After that, there was surprise at the poor first-half performance of Hanson.
The results wiped out the effect of good figures from Grand Metropolitan and
Shell Transport.
Futures traders reacted quickly and led the market, which had been showing a
comfortable gain of around 10 points, down towards 2,700. The FT-SE contract
for June delivery fell to its estimated fair value premium to cash for the
first time since the general election.
The fact that turnover remained very high suggested that the market was no
longer able to absorb the stock being placed at current high levels. There
were 706.9m shares traded yesterday, well above Wednesday's figure of 604.6m
when customer retail business reached Pounds 1.154bn.
Analysts were starting to look at the lower than usual dividend yield on the
FT-A All-Share Index, down to 4.5 per cent with the market at 2,737. They
were also examining the level of its price/earnings ratio which, said one
observer, was the highest for 10 years.
One of the more relieved market commentators was Mr Nick Knight of Nomura
Research, who sees the market going back to 2,500 by the end of the year,
and who published research yesterday arguing that the good news following
the general election was already in the market.
'The degree of bullish consensus is frightening,' he said. 'Not only is the
economic recovery already in the price, but the figures from Hanson show
that there is no economic recovery.'
With 10 companies reporting figures yesterday, individual stock movements
were dominated by results. Guinness was one to suffer, affected by a poor
performance from its luxury goods subsidiary, but Burton was actively higher
on better than expected numbers.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow suffers a setback as
investors cash in

Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING in the wake of recent gains sent US share prices tumbling
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 23.10 down at 3,368.88. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 receded 3.31 to 413.14, while the Nasdaq composite index
slipped 5.92 to 576.46. Turnover on the New York SE totalled 200m shares,
and declines outpaced rises by a ratio of more than two-to-one.
There has been growing concern this week that recent gains may have been
overdone, and analysts have cautioned that the failure of broader indices to
match the Dow's advance is a warning that a correction might be imminent.
The day's only economic news - a 10,000 increase in weekly jobless claims -
also unsettled investors, who have been waiting a long time for the labour
market to show signs of a sustainable recovery.
Advanced Micro Devices fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 5/8 in volume of 4m
shares after Intel, its main rival in the microprocessor business, said it
would cut prices on an advanced chip in the third quarter. Intel, quoted on
the Nasdaq, lost Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 49.
Clothing retailer Gap dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 36 5/8 in turnover of
3.99m shares after reporting first-quarter net income of 32 cents a share,
up from 29 cents a year ago. The market reacted negatively to the news
because the figures were slightly below the median of analysts' forecasts.
McDonnell Douglas plunged Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 in the wake of a
recommendation from a Congressional committee that funding for the troubled
C-17 cargo jet, made by McDonnell, be cut by 30 per cent.
Cray Research tumbled Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 32 3/4 after the company
warned late on Wednesday that it expected 1992 earnings to come in somewhere
between 10 and 20 per cent below those achieved in 1991. Trading in the
stock had been halted pending the news, and yesterday morning was the first
opportunity for investors to respond to the news.
On the over-the-counter market, Adolph Coors rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
19 7/8 after the group announced a planned demerger of its non-brewing
businesses, which include ceramics, aluminium and packaging units.
New York Bancorp advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 in the wake of a big
rise in fiscal second-quarter earnings to Dollars 1.46 a share. Also firmer
in the banking sector was Northern Trust, Dollars  3/8 up at Dollars 58 1/2
, with both buoyed by a ratings upgrade from Alex Brown, the Baltimore-based
securities house.
Canada
STRONG gains in gold shares, with the sector's index climbing 3.66 per cent,
lifted Toronto from a midday low, although losses in most other sectors kept
the market in negative territory. The financial services and communications
groups both closed down more than 1.5 per cent.
Olympia &amp; York lost an appeal in a London court which could force the
troubled property giant to pay Morgan Stanley USDollars 240m as soon as next
Wednesday.
The composite index closed 15.9 off at 3,388.3, after 3,381.4. Falls led
rises by 306 to 245 after volume of 28m shares.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar unsteady after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR recorded its fourth easier close in a row on European markets
yesterday after tumbling to a three-month low against the D-Mark in the US
overnight, writes James Blitz.
After falling to DM1.6090 in Wednesday's North American trading, the US unit
ended at DM1.6125 last night in London, nearly a pfennig down from its
previous close. Once again, dealers said the market's obsession with another
possible cut in the US Fed Funds rate had been the main factor undermining
the dollar. North American traders were anxiously awaiting US money supply
data due to be released yesterday, with fears that another sharp drop in M-2
money supply could force the Federal Reserve to ease credit.
According to Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp, the
dollar's performance will be by far the most important factor in foreign
exchange markets in forthcoming days. He believes the next important event
will be the Fed's open market committee meeting on Tuesday. 'If there is no
easing of rates by next Wednesday, we should see new support for the
dollar,' he says. He believes that if the Fed does reduce its rates again,
the dollar will go below DM1.60 and test support at DM1.58.
Analysts said the US currency had also been weighed down by extremely heavy
selling of D-Marks against Swiss francs. The Swiss currency has
traditionally been highly illiquid and dollar bull markets have often been
short of Swiss francs. Yesterday, however, the 'Swissy' was highly popular
as traders enthused about the fact that the authorities in Zurich have
allowed market interest rates to rise.
Suggestions that Switzerland may move closer to the European Monetary System
also boosted the currency. The dollar fell nearly two centimes to SFr1.4775
and the D-Mark eased to DM108.90 per SFr100 from DM108.40. In New York the
dollar finished near to London's close at DM1.6130, SFr1.4740 and Y130.23.
Yen trading was quiet yesterday after the dollar's dramatic fall against the
Japanese currency on Tuesday to Y130. A trader said the US unit, which
closed last night in London at Y130.25, was now supported by rumours of very
good dollar support at Y129.50. A number of large Japanese financial
institutions were said to be ready to buy dollars if the rate fell to around
that level.
Sterling's movements have appeared to shadow the dollar in the last
day-and-a-half. The UK currency weakened sharply against the D-Mark
overnight, dipping to a low of DM2.9260. Similar to the dollar, it recovered
yesterday to close at DM2.9375, a loss of  1/2 pfennig from its previous
London close.
A surprisingly strong rise in UK average earnings dashed hopes harboured in
some quarters of another cut in interest rates, propping up the pound.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyana hands over reins of
export industries - How the republic is preparing for bauxite and sugar
privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an attempt to cut losses and lift productivity and production, Guyana is
restructuring the administration of the two commodity sectors that form the
foundation of its economy.
The bauxite and sugar industries, owned by the government of the
English-speaking republic on the north eastern shoulder of South America,
are to be sold off in the next two years. To prepare for this, the
management of both industries has been taken over by foreign companies.
An Australian company took over the administration of the bauxite (aluminium
ore) industry this month, coinciding with a move by the government to assume
some of the industry's heavy debts. Government officials appear optimistic
that the fortunes of the industry, which is one of the world's main
producers of calcined bauxite, will be similar to those of the sugar sector.
The divestment of the management of sugar has been followed by increased
production.
The management of the bauxite industry is now in the hands of Minproc
Engineering of Sydney, Australia, while the government tries to clear the
industry's debts of USDollars 85m, making it a viable proposition for
privatisation.
In addition to managing the industry for at least 18 months, the Australians
will be marketing the country's metallic and calcined grades of bauxite.
The call on foreign management and the planned divestment has come two
decades after the government nationalised the local operations of Reynolds
of the US and Alcan of Canada.
But the industry's fortunes have waned with a deterioration in the country's
economy. A shortage of hard currency prevented expansion and maintenance of
equipment. Once accounting for 70 per cent of the world's calcined bauxite
output, Guyana's share has fallen to 40 per cent.
The involvement of the Australians in Guyana's bauxite industry follows
earlier attempts by the government to find managers and buyers. Alcan of
Canada and Billiton, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell company, had
indicated some interest but did not pursue negotiations.
The restructuring of the industry is being funded by loans that the
government has negotiated from the World Bank, the European Investment Bank
and the European Community. The Guyana government has written off the
Dollars 10m that it was owed by the bauxite industry. The government is also
to assume the debt of more than Dollars 22m that the industry owes to
commercial banks.
The change in the industry's management, and the plan for privatisation,
follow renewed interest by foreign investors in the country's bauxite
industry. The government's recent liberalisation of the conditions for
foreign investment has resulted in new projects that promise a significant
increase in output.
CA Dayco de Construcciones of Venezuela is involved in a venture to mine
1.4m tonnes over three years for the Guyana Mining Enterprise, to be sold to
Interalumina of Venezuela, and a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals of the US is
in a joint venture that is expected to yield about 2.5m tonnes of ore per
year.
Guyanese government officials appear optimistic about the prospects of the
bauxite industry, and the prospects for economic viability. They are hoping
that Minproc Engineers will be able to emulate the changes have taken place
in the sugar industry, the sale of which the government is hoping to
conclude later this year.
According to Mr Desmond Hoyte, Guyana's president: 'The process of divesting
the sugar industry is under way and will not stop and cannot be stopped.'
Booker Tate of the UK, whose parent company's Guyanese sugar holdings were
nationalised by the government two decades ago, took over the management of
the industry in 1990 from a state-owned company. The industry was in trouble
and unable to meet its supply quotas to the European Community and the US
while supplying the domestic market.
In each of the previous three years Guyana had to plead force majeure on its
export commitment to the European Community. According to government
officials, the decision to put the industry in the hands of Booker Tate is
already paying dividends. Shipments are being made to the US and the EC, and
production is rising. Guyana has found the 182,000 tonnes to meet its EC and
US quotas.
Under Booker Tate's management sugar production rose from 130,000 tonnes in
1990 to 160,000 tonnes last year. Nearly 90,000 tonnes have already been
milled for the first crop this year, doubling the 44,000 produced over the
corresponding period last year.
'Unless we had done this, the industry would not have turned around,' said
Mr Hoyte. 'In every industry we have divested the workers have benefited
enormously from improved conditions of pay and service. In every industry we
have divested, that industry has so far done better than when it was under
state control. . . and those are facts that cannot be gainsaid.'
Government officials have not named the parties interested in buying the
sugar industry, although there are reports that Booker Tate, already with a
foot in the door, is likely to be at the top of the list.
The world supply/demand balance for sugar is likely to be tighter next year,
following a projected stocks rise of 1.24m tonnes in 1991-92, according to
the latest Sugar Review published by London trader C. Czarnikow.
'More than 1m tonnes of production may be lost next season by countries in
Southern Africa (because of the present drought),' while 'overall offtake is
likely to rise, if only modestly,' Czarnikow says.
Jamaica's bauxite ore production in the first quarter of this year was 2.82m
tonnes, 5.2 per cent more than the corresponding period of 1991, writes
Canute James in Kingston. The Jamaica Bauxite Institute reported that
production of alumina (aluminium oxide) in the quarter fell 3 per cent to
735,000 tonnes.
Exports of crude ore of 949,000 tonnes were 5.1 per cent less than the first
quarter of last year, but government officials say the industry is still
projecting overall ore production for this year at 12m tonnes, compared with
actual output of 11.5m tonnes last year.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry seeks 'understanding'
on farm policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the EC could conclude the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks if they tried harder to understand each other's contributions in farm
subsidy cuts, according to Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner.
That is the issue blocking agreement in the five-and-a-half-year-old Round,
but Mr MacSharry believes an agreement 'could be close' - only if the US
understood and accepted what the EC was prepared to do in reforming its farm
sector.
The commissioner's purpose was to lay out the critical issues and identify
where there were areas of flexibility, to 'get us over the bar on Gatt', the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is conducting the Round.
Mr MacSharry said that willingness of the US and Gatt to exclude the EC's
planned compensation payments to farmers for price cuts from the Round's
subsidy cuts schedule 'holds the key to an agreement'. The 'final act' of
the Round, drawn up last December by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt general
director, excluded these payments from its 'green box' for subsidies that
did not encourage production and therefore distort trade.
The compensation payments, which the EC may approve next week as a central
component of the MacSharry plan to reform the common agricultural policy,
are conditional on all but small farmers taking land out of production. 'We
have given absolute guarantees that they will reduce production,' Mr
MacSharry said, adding that they were 'more specific than Dunkel's green
box.' 'This is the real contribution the community is making,' the
commissioner argued.
He said it was politically impossible for the EC to accept the US suggestion
that these payments be allowed for six years but then become regressive.
Most member states agree with Mr MacSharry, but the UK and Netherlands
attach more importance to preventing a Gatt agreement from restricting
exports.
The Dunkel text requires a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised
exports over six years, as well as a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies. Mr
MacSharry said this was 'a fact of life and there will have to be (volume
restraint) commitments.' But he said that 'at the end of the day, if people
don't want to come off that 24 per cent, there are other avenues which will
enable the EC to make its contribution on (restraining) exports.'
The other method is so-called 'aggregation', whereby volume cuts would be
delivered by sectors rather than products, enabling the EC to cut more, say,
on skimmed milk powder and barley, and less on higher-added-value products
such as cheese and bread-making wheat. But the US has shown no inclination
to allow this edge to the EC's most competitive products.
Mr MacSharry accepted that there was no indication that the US was moving
towards the EC, but underlined that there were still 'talks on an almost
daily basis' between the two sides at all levels.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Earth Summit casts shadow over
timber talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM RAPHAEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION to ask producer nations to assess the resources needed to attain
sustainable management of their tropical forests drew fire from
environmentalists at the two-week meeting in Yaounde, Cameroon, of the
International Tropical Timber Organisation, which ended yesterday.
'It's like offering them a combination of a ransom note and a blank cheque,'
said Francis Sullivan of Worldwide Fund for Nature. 'The decision says
nothing about the opportunity to recover money to support sustainable
management from fees, taxes and other revenues, outlined in their own
consultants' report, which suggests that more than enough money is available
already.'
Brazil, the only country to have submitted such an assessment so far has
asked for Dollars 6bn to fight poverty, which it says is the root cause of
the non-sustainable use of forests. A British delegate scorned the Brazilian
demand as 'pie in the sky'.
This 12th session of ITTO also dealt with a budget crisis. The organisation
is heavily overspent, and has drawn on reserves of working capital to
finance its 1992 budget shortfall and to make possible the next meeting in
Yokohama in November, at which the renegotiation of a second tropical timber
agreement is to begin.
ITTO's critics say this has been a disappointing fortnight in which too
little has been achieved. This is not surprising as the meeting has ended
only two weeks away from the Earth Summit in Rio, where a Statement of
Forest Principles is to be agreed, hope of a Forest Convention now having
been abandoned.
The pall of Rio hung over this conference. Delegates admitted privately that
there were two reasons so little was accomplished. First, that consumer
nations were unwilling to risk upsetting producers so close to the Earth
Summit, where their co-operation would be essential to avoid disaster;
secondly, that Rio offered the possibility of an instrument that could lend
ITTO muscle (if not teeth) for the future, and that it would be wise to
wait.
But environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) at the meeting said
Rio was a smoke-screen to cloak the organisation's indecision and inaction.
They spoke of the lack of 'real action in tackling the tropical timber
trade's role in perpetuating deforestation, both by consumers and
producers'. A statement by the NGOs referred to huge disparities between the
objectives and priorities of the organisation and the actual progress being
made in achieving them.
The ITTO meets twice yearly in what has become a kind of square dance,
producers to the left, consumers to the right, and 'promenade', with the
NGOs on the sidelines calling the figures. But, like a dance, it goes round
and round and gets nowhere.
One delegate complained that the ITTO was too much occupied with projects
and not enough with policy. Since 1985, more than 100 research and
development projects have been approved, and more than Dollars 100m
allocated.
The NGOs charge that many of these projects are meretricious and that anyway
they bring ITTO members no closer to the original aims of the agreement, to
expand trade and foster conservation. What is more, they say, the project
cycle needs to be reformed. It is an exhaustive procedure, in which project
suggestions are prepared long before ITTO meetings, where they are
considered and then passed back to committees. The projects then become the
responsibility of the small and overstretched staff, who have to supervise
their implementation. The NGOs say this has led to corruption and
misappropriation of funds.
ITTO's defenders cite the adoption of guidelines for conservation and Target
2000 (in which members have agreed that all exports of tropical timber
should be from sustainable forests by the next century) as evidence of
progress. Mr Arthur Morell of the UK Timber Trade Federation, an adviser to
the UK delegation, says ITTO is the best safeguard of future supplies. He
attacks the critics: 'if a fire is not burning as brightly as you would
like, you build it up, not throw water on it'.
But Mr Julio Cesar Centeno, a Venezualan forestry expert, insists that the
organisation, after nine years, has achieved no change. 'Not one cubic metre
of tropical logs has been processed in any producing country due to ITTO,'
he declares, 'nor have any industries been modernised or new industries set
up.' He says the objective of fostering development has been ignored by
ITTO.
The International Tropical Timber Agreement also makes reference to fair
prices for timber products. 'Discussion on prices has been consistently
avoided in the deliberations of the organisation,' says Mr Centeno.
The NGOs' expressed scepticism about ITTO members' reliance on Rio to set
the organisation on its feet. 'If 47 countries cannot make progress in nine
years,' said one observer, 'what can 147 nations do in two weeks?'.

GOVERNMENT officials and private-sector representatives met in Brasilia
yesterday to try to hammer out a detailed Brazilian position for the next
round of talks on the International Coffee Agreement, set to begin on May
27.
'The idea is to go to the meeting with a clear position,' said Mr Joaquim
Libanio Ferreira Leite, director of exports for the Guaxupe Coffee Producers
Co-operative. 'Up to now we have waited for the others' positions.'
Brazil is expected to maintain its 10-point overall proposal announced prior
to the April round of talks. Present discussions are aimed at defining
specifics within those guiding principles, said Mr Celsius Lodder, director
of the Department of Supply and Prices of the Economy Ministry, who is
co-ordinating the government's participation.
'What we don't want to discuss right now is a quota for Brazil,' said Mr
Lodder. 'We think there are other points that are more important.'
The Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters says the country's coffee
exports in the first four months of 1992 increased by 12 per cent over the
same period last year, to 5.73m bags (60 kg each). But because of low prices
on the world market receipts were down by 9.6 per cent at Dollars 425.6m.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Bundesbank chief warns of E
Europe funding shortage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE developing countries of eastern Europe face a growing shortage of
funding unless action is taken to redress a global imbalance between the
supply of and demand for capital, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the
Bundesbank, warned yesterday.
Speaking at the annual conference of the International Securities Market
Association in Munich, Mr Tietmeyer forecast that long-term interest rates
in the world economy (and hence bond yields) would remain high because of an
imbalance between the supply and demand for capital.
While the developed industrial nations would face no major problems in
satisfying their capital needs, the developing countries - in particular
those of central and eastern Europe - would be hampered in efforts to
finance economic restructuring, he said.
Mr Tietmeyer argued the major exporters of capital - Germany, Japan, and the
OPEC oil-producing nations - would be less able to finance the world economy
in coming years because of problems close to home. Germany needs to make
substantial fiscal transfers to the eastern part of the country, Japan faces
a massive decline in asset prices and the OPEC countries faced low oil
revenues and the need to rebuild after the Gulf war.
However, demand for capital remained very high, he said. Mr Tietmeyer said
the low savings ratio in the US, combined with the growth of federal budget
deficit, meant 'that country will continue to suck in a major proportion of
world savings'.
In a wide-ranging defence of the Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates,
Mr Tietmeyer said high short-term rates were a major element in promoting
additional saving and reducing excess demand for capital in the private
sector.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts slip on unease over retail price
index data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONGER-dated gilts eased yesterday as the market absorbed
worse-than-expected average UK earnings figures for March and prepared for
today's inflation figures for April.
Earnings rose at a year-on-year rate of 7.5 per cent, up from 7 per cent the
previous month and ahead of expectations (although the figures for the
previous month were restated to 7.5 per cent on a new calculation basis).
The news was not devastating, but combined with unease about the retail
price index figure and some reported profit taking, helped to take the shine
off the gilt market.
The RPI is widely expected to show a year-on-year rise of around 4.4 per
cent, compared with 4 per cent the previous month - though some estimates
predict a rise as high as 5 per cent. Should the figure come close to the
lower expectations, the Bank of England is expected to sell more gilts,
another factor which helped to hold back gilt prices.
Shorter-dated gilts remained steady as sterling remained firm and the
three-month interbank rate remained at 10 1/16 per cent. The benchmark 9 per
cent bonds maturing in 2011, however, lost around  1/8 of a point on the day
to close at a yield of 9 per cent.
On Liffe, in moderate trading, the long gilt future - having broken above 99
at the start of the day - closed at 98 3/4 .
GERMAN government bonds lost ground in late trading as the market continued
to absorb bad news on the wage front and further warnings that interest
rates are likely to remain high for some time.
News that the largest of the four public sector unions, OeTV, had rejected
the pay offer negotiated by their leaders (only 44.1 per cent voted in
favour of acceptance, well short of the 50 per cent needed), did little to
dent the bund market immediately.
The news had been widely expected. But by late in the day, sentiment turned
for the worse.
The bund futures contract on Liffe, having opened at 87.26 and hit a high of
87.44, retreated to 87.15 in late trading. In the cash market, yields on
10-year bunds rose slightly, hovering just below 8 per cent.
Warnings that real interest rates were likely to remain high for some time
came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president of the Bundesbank. He warned
against the 'quick fix' of lowering rates and added demand for capital
around the world would keep real interest rates high for some years.
PROFIT-taking by investors in French government bonds caused 10-year OATs to
lose some ground yesterday - though with bund prices also easing, the yield
spread between the two markets remained at just over 60 basis points.
The French franc fell from its recent high point, touched on Wednesday, but
continued to hover around its central rate against the D-Mark of 3.3539. The
yield on the benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 slipped slightly to around
8.58 per cent in late trade.
PREDICTIONS from the Federal Reserve that money supply growth was exhibiting
a recovery took the edge off Treasury prices yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 102
9/16 , yielding 7.858 per cent, while at the short end of the market the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/2 , to carry a yield of 5.085 per cent.
The comments on money growth came from Fed governor Mr Lawrence Lindsey, who
said he expected the latest money supply data, due out late yesterday, to
show the beginning of a bounce back. This disappointed those sections of the
market which had pinned its hopes on further weakness in money figures
spurring the Fed into another easing of monetary policy.
Mr Lindsey's comments overshadowed the weekly jobless claims data, which
showed a rise of 10,000 in the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance. The rise was bigger than expected, but the news failed to
stimulate any buying interest.
AFTER their strong rise in the middle of the week, Japanese government bonds
continued to move ahead yesterday, further buoyed by the strength of the
yen. The yield on the benchmark bond No 129 eased further, from 5.5 per cent
to 5.487 per cent on the day. The yield was last below 5.5 per cent in
mid-April.
However, concerns about the amount of new bond issuance due from Japanese
corporate borrowers continue to overhang the market, and could restrict
further gains.

CHINA Investment Company, a closed-end fund which plans to invest in joint
ventures in China, looks set to raise over Dollars 15m from investors in the
US, Europe and the Far East, according to Crosby Securities, the Hong
Kong-based securities firm which is sponsoring the new investment company,
writes Sara Webb.
The fund is due to be listed on the London Stock Exchange this month and
will be managed by Crosby Asset Management (CAM).
CAM plans to invest most of the money raised on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock markets, buying 'B' category shares which are the type available to
foreign investors. Longer-term, the fund manager hopes to invest in equity
joint ventures, mainly in Zheijiang, Jiangsu and Shandong.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Bonds: OKB extends offering to Ecu300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWERS in the international bond markets are continuing to issue in the
Ecu sector, encouraged by attractive swap opportunities and hopes that
investors are feeling more confident about buying Ecu paper.
Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OKB), the Austrian state-backed financial
institution, reopened its existing Ecu bond with a further Ecu100m tranche,
bringing the total size of the issue to Ecu300m.
The bond, which is due February 1994 and carries a coupon of 9 per cent, is
being reoffered at 99.84 to yield 9.05 per cent. Lehman Brothers, the lead
managers, said the existing paper was trading at 100.00-100.20, yielding
8.97 per cent. Other market participants commented that the pricing seemed
fair. The deal is targeted at retail and small institutional investors.
However, despite claims that investors are willing to buy Ecu-denominated
notes as confidence increases in the ratification of the Maastricht treaty
on European monetary union, the lead manager admitted none of the
short-dated Ecu deals launched this week have 'been a blow-out', but will
take some time to sell.
Kommuninvest, guaranteed by the County Council of Orebro, also announced an
Ecu100m deal, with an initial tranche of Ecu50m priced at par and yielding 9
per cent. Daiwa Europe, the lead manager, said the deal was aimed at
Japanese and European institutional investors.
In the US dollar sector of the market, Eagle 1 Ltd, a special purpose
vehicle, launched a Dollars 120m floating-rate note bond with a coupon of
110 basis points above six-month London inter-bank offered rate, and priced
at par.
Isetan, the Japanese department store group, launched a seven-year Y10bn
issue with a coupon of 6.2 per cent and a reoffer price of 99.975.
Nikko Europe, the lead managers, said the deal has already been placed with
Japanese investors.

<TEXT>
SHARES in McDonnell Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace group,
plunged Dollars 5 5/8 to close at Dollars 47 1/8 yesterday - a fall of more
than 10 per cent - as Wall Street worries mounted over the fate of its
problem-plagued C-17 military aircraft.
The C-17 development programme is running more than a year behind schedule
and substantially over budget on the company's Dollars 6.6bn fixed price
contract.
The share price drop came in response to news of fresh production problems
on the aircraft and a call this week by the House of Representatives' Armed
Services committee for a 30 per cent cut in next year's funding for the
programme and a block on the C-17 going into full production.
Congressional ire was also increased by allegations from the Pentagon's
inspector general that the Air Force had connived in 1990 to provide secret
financial assistance to McDonnell Douglas by improperly rushing through
acceptance of the first completed C-17 when it was only 80 per cent
finished.
McDonnell Douglas has repeatedly denied asking for or receiving any bail-out
money.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments' entry into the market for personal computer
microprocessors, announced yesterday, is expected to accelerate the rapid
decline in personal computer prices by further eroding Intel's monopoly of
the multi-billion dollar market.
TI said that in the third quarter it would begin sales of a '486'
microprocessor chip that is compatible with the original Intel device of the
same name.
On Wednesday, Intel slashed the price of its 486SX microprocessors by more
than 50 per cent, in an apparent move to counter competition from Texas
Instruments as well as from Advanced Micro Devices, which offers its own
version of Intel's 386. Advanced Micro is expected to introduce a 486 chip
later this year.
The Intel price cut would reduce the average selling price of a 486-based
personal computer down substantially from its current level of more than
Dollars 2,000, said Paul Otellini, vice-president of Intel's microprocessor
products group.
Texas Instruments obtained rights to the 486SLC through a cross-licensing
agreement with Cyrix, the Texas-based semiconductor company which designed
the chip. TI is already manufacturing the chip for sale by Cyrix and will
begin its own sales efforts in the third quarter.
As one of the largest US chipmakers, TI is a serious challenger to Intel,
which has dominated the personal computer microprocessor market for the past
decade. However, Intel is expected to meet TI's challenge with aggressive
marketing and legal tactics.
Intel has already filed a suit against Cyrix, charging that the 486SLC
infringes Intel patents. Cyrix denies any infringement.
Texas Instruments also claimed that it was not infringing any Intel patents,
pointing out that they have a patent cross-licensing agreement.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's to look at structure of
CUB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the Australian beer, pastoral and finance group,
yesterday announced a review of the structure of its Carlton and United
Breweries (CUB) subsidiary, Australia's biggest brewer.
The review was announced by Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, as part of a
drive to recover market share lost to National Brewing, the former brewing
arm of Bond Corporation Holdings, now owned by Lion Nathan of New Zealand.
Mr Kunkel said the review was 'a normal part of a management's task in any
efficient organisation, and will ensure that the company is properly
focussed to meet the opportunities of the 1990s'.
However, the review is also in line with views expressed by Mr John Elliott,
deputy chairman of Foster's. Mr Elliott believes the group has failed to
extract full value from CUB's near-monopoly in Victoria, Australia's second
most populous state.
International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company controlled by Mr
Elliott, owns 38 per cent of Foster's, but will be in breach of loan
covenants on debts of about ADollars 2.5bn unless its bankers approve a
financial restructuring plan due to be delivered today.
The restructuring plan is believed to focus on a proposed merger of Foster's
with SA Brewing, the South Australian drinks and industrial group run by Mr
Ross Wilson.
The plan suggests the merger could be accomplished through a share swap
allowing IBH to repay much of its debt, and secure a return of about
ADollars 2.60 for Foster's shareholders, compared with last night's closing
price of ADollars 1.86.
The deal has not been approved by the boards of SA Brewing or Foster's, and
is understood to be opposed by Foster's directors, including Mr Nobby Clark,
chairman. The deal would also face significant regulatory problems,
including the need to gain approval from the Trade Practices Commission for
a further reduction in competition in Australia's highly concentrated
brewing market.
Analysts said the review of CUB was likely to help IBH persuade the banks to
roll over its debts, especially if it helps convince them that restructuring
the Australian brewing operations will lift Foster's earnings and dividends.
IBH depends on dividends from Foster's to pay interest on its debts, which
was acquired to fund the purchase of the Foster's shareholding - the
company's only asset. The shares are worth about ADollars 1.6bn.
The company's bank lenders include Hongkong Bank Australia and Citibank.
Analysts say the banks are unlikely to try to wind up the company in the
short term. The most likely outcome is a deal which would remove some of
IBH's debt and reduce the uncertainty surrounding the group.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson dividend cut hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KING &amp; Shaxson Holdings, the discount house, has proposed cutting its
dividend for the first time in its history following a halving in profit
from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 920,000 after providing for rebate, tax and
transfer from contingencies in the year to April 30.
The final would be 2.5p for a total of 5p, against 10.25p. The shares lost
17p to close at 91p.
Mr David Pearce, who became chairman following the death of Mr Billy
D'Abbans in February, said it had been a troublesome period for the core
discount house business. He added that during the year the pivotal role of
the discount market as a provider of liquidity to the banking system had
been eroded.
'We are normally in an uncomfortable vice between eligible bill yields that
are forced too low and money costs that are pushed too high. It is for this
reason that our holdings of money market instruments are approximately half
that of a year ago.'
The situation was unsatisfactory, he said, and the company was looking at
further ways of reducing its dependence on the discount house.
The results include those of Smith St Aubyn (Holdings), the discount house.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Burton halved as multiples suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURTON GROUP, which owns Debenhams and a string of fashion chains, saw
interim pre-tax profits halved as it sought to defend market share by
sacrificing margin and cutting prices.
In the 26 weeks to February 29, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 44.1m to
Pounds 21.8m on sales 2 per cent higher at Pounds 934.6m.
But although gross margins slipped by 0.8 per cent, Mr John Hoerner, chief
executive of three months' standing, said the group had succeeded in
restoring its market share to 12 per cent after shedding 1 percentage point
in the previous half.
He added that sales from continuing businesses in the first 10 weeks of the
second half were ahead 7 per cent but attributed the increase to restocking
and operational improvements rather than a general recovery in the clothing
sector.
'I think there has been a pick-up in conversation about consumer demand and
a definite improvement in mood but it would be seriously misleading if I
said I had any indication that it had yet happened,' he said.
There was a marked difference in trading fortunes between the two arms of
the group.
Debenhams, where Mr Hoerner was previously chief executive, lifted trading
profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 29.5m on sales 11 per cent higher at Pounds
426.8m.
But the fashion multiples saw a drastic fall in profits from Pounds 32.2m to
Pounds 3.1m on sales just 1 per cent lower at Pounds 507.8m.
Top Shop, Dorothy Perkins, and Evans were said to have recorded 'better
performances' while Top Man and Principles for Men were disappointing.
The group received Pounds 124m from asset sales, including Harvey Nichols
and the Dartford shopping centre. Net debt stood at Pounds 237m compared
with Pounds 476m a year ago, representing a fall in gearing from 63 per cent
to 33 per cent.
Earnings per share slid from 4.8p to 2p. An interim dividend of 1p (1.7p) is
declared.
The group announced a streamlining of management functions which will result
in the departures of Mr Richard Pym as chief executive of the services
division and Mr Brian Moody as managing director of Burton menswear.
Mr Pym's pay-off was not disclosed but was described as 'less than
extraordinary', unlike those given to other departing board directors in
recent months.
COMMENT
Burton should represent an object lesson in the perils of investing in
personalities. Ironically, however, that may now represent just about the
best reason for returning to the UK's second biggest clothing retailer. In
the short term he has been in charge, Mr Hoerner has impressed the City with
his candour and common sense and although there are as yet few substantial
signs of trading improvement there is a tangible swing in sentiment as
evidenced by the 7 1/2 p rise in the share price to 49 1/2 p yesterday.
Burton is now a finely-balanced risk-reward scenario but the market may be
over-eager about the pace and strength of recovery. Although the group is at
last moving in the right direction, it would be unwise to presume that it
will easily be able to rebuild margins, given the restocking and restaffing
that is still needed and the escalation of pressure that the likes of Marks
and Spencer can still bring to bear. And although the group may just be in
the black at the year end the dividend is still likely to be cut.

Peabody for Dollars 6.6m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG GROUP, the coal mining company, has sold an option to buy its stake in
Carbonar, the Venezuelan coal company, to Peabody, the US coal company owned
by Hanson, for Dollars 6.6m (Pounds 3.72m).
The option is exercisable any time during the next year, giving Peabody time
to investigate Carbonar's operations. During that time, Peabody will lease
mining equipment to Young - allowing the company to accelerate its coal
production.
Peabody, one of the largest US coal companies, producing about 90m tonnes of
coal a year, will also advance Young Dollars 500,000, which will be used to
buy out minority shareholders in Carbonar, lifting its 51 per cent stake to
100 per cent, and settle liabilities relating to the company.
Mr Brian Calver, Young's chief operating officer, said he expected Peabody
would exercise the option.
The deal will help Young to increase production and profit from the company,
which will mine at least 200,000 tonnes of coal in 1992. Last year, the
company had unexpectedly low output from Venezuela after equipment failed.
Mr Calver denied that the deal was a preliminary to making a bid for part of
British Coal, which is due to be privatised shortly. It was simply 'cleaning
up'. He pointed out that any packages of British Coal for sale would be more
likely to cost tens of millions of pounds.
Young Group underwent a financial restructuring earlier this year after an
unexpected fall in profits and cash flow problems led to its shares, quoted
on the USM, being suspended.
Mr Calver said he was still planning to sell one or two small opencast
mining sites in the UK, but otherwise had no further important plans for
restructuring.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: On the runway to wider horizons - Roland
Rudd meets the chief of the Irish aircraft leasing group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE a very big British company,' says Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of the
Shannon-based aircraft leasing company which is going public next month.
Puffing on a large cigar in the Trafalgar Suite of the Ritz Hotel, Mr Ryan,
the quintessential Irishman, is undeterred by a look of astonishment.
GPA is the third biggest buyer of Rolls-Royce engines and British Aerospace
has a 20 per cent stake in its airbus programme, he says.
Mr Ryan wants GPA to be listed among the top 100 Footsie stocks in London.
At an expected post flotation valuation of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) the
company easily qualifies on size.
The fact that GPA is based in Shannon and does not pay tax in the UK has
disqualified it from what its chairman calls the 'London Club.'
Whatever happens over the listing - and Mr Ryan says he will not allow the
issue to go away - the group is unlikely to be referred to as the Irish
aircraft leasing company after the flotation. It may move its headquarters
to London or at the least upgrade its UK office.
Mr Ryan, who is not given to looking pleased with himself, cannot hide his
relief that with the pathfinder prospectus out the controversial issues of
pricing and persuading shareholders to sign binding agreements not to sell
their shares immediately after the sale are mostly behind him.
There are still problems ahead, but they are likely to be industry related -
which Mr Ryan prefers to talk about.
GPA is not like Atlantic Computers, the leasing arm of the now defunct
British &amp; Commonwealth, because it specialised in computers which went out
of fashion. 'What is today's technology is tomorrow's junk.' But everyone is
still going to need aeroplanes.
Mr Peter Villa, managing director of the International Bureau of Aviation,
which publishes the Residual Value Journal, agrees that the company has been
skilled at selling the income stream and aircraft to groups of investors.
'The value of all aircraft has dropped. Values will improve over the next
five years. The question is are they strong enough to survive until values
improve?'
Mr Ryan says he knew what he was doing when GPA began marketing aircraft
sales. He is confident that with most analysts forecasting 5 per cent annual
growth in air traffic, values of aircraft will improve.
He also feels confident enough to dismiss the possible downgrading of GPA's
short and long-term debt by Moody, the credit rating agency, which has put
the company, along with many others in the airline industry, on credit
watch.
'If the sale goes well we are unlikely to be downgraded.'
Over the next month Mr Ryan, who prefers the anonymity of his Tipperary
home, will be on the road selling the company. 'I feel a bit like Jesus
Christ trying to convert people to this business.'

stock with Electra Kingsway, an investment group. The stock is convertible
to ordinary shares after three years within a price range of 50-55p. Full
conversion at 50p would result in the issue of 20m shares, representing
23.6% of the enlarged capital.
The proceeds will be used to strengthen the capital base.
The book of lease payments, advances and hire purchase receivables grew by
32 per cent to IPounds 74.7m (IPounds 56.4m) which has been financed largely
through a 42 per cent increase in bank loans and overdrafts to IPounds 68m.
The Irish division saw growth and the UK operations performed
satisfactorily. The collapse of the Europa group during the period gave rise
to the company's largest single bad debt and problems were encountered in
business through its Preston office. Full provisions were taken.
The profit for the year included a IPounds 1.16m contribution from the
Xtra-vision associate.
Earnings per share were 6.31p (6.25p). A final dividend of 0.55p is
recommended for a 1p (0.9p) total.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Royal first-quarter losses reduced sharply
to Pounds 48m - Further evidence of recovery in insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL INSURANCE, the composite insurance company, yesterday announced a
reduced pre-tax loss for the three months to March 31, providing further
evidence that the industry may be returning to profitability after recent
heavy losses.
Earlier this week General Accident also reported reduced losses for the
first quarter, while Guardian Royal Exchange - which does not report on a
quarterly basis - has also indicated that trading conditions are improving.
Royal's pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 63m to Pounds 48m, largely
because of an improvement in underwriting results in the UK and the US,
where the benefit of premium increases, introduced over the last two years,
and stricter controls over underwriting is now being felt.
Worldwide underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 57m compared with Pounds
84m. Life profits were down to Pounds 14m (Pounds 16m). Investment income
fell to Pounds 6m (Pounds 15m) while other income amounted to Pounds 6m
(Pounds 6m) and share of associated income Pounds 5m (Pounds 10m). Loan
interest for group financing amounted to Pounds 10m (Pounds 14m).
UK underwriting losses fell by Pounds 15m to Pounds 91m with the combined
ratio in the UK (claims plus expenses against premiums) improving by nearly
6 points to 125 per cent.
The reduction of underwriting losses to Pounds 6m (Pounds 18m) on the motor
account, where insurers were affected adversely last year by increased
theft, climbing claims costs and a rising frequency of claims, is seen as
particularly encouraging.
Underwriting losses for domestic mortgage indemnity business amounted to
Pounds 50m, some Pounds 33m less than in the fourth quarter of 1991,
although elsewhere on the household account, Royal recorded an underwriting
profit.
The solvency margin, which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life
premium income, remains the main blackspot. Following a fall in US bond
prices the margin fell to 29 per cent at the end of the third quarter,
nearly twice the legal minimum but one point below the level generally
regarded as adequate in the industry.
Over the last months the solvency margin has risen to 32 per cent, with the
post-election recovery in the UK equity markets helping to bolster capital.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Insolvency maze with
three corners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FILING by Olympia &amp; York under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement in
Canada may trigger a highly complex relationship with insolvency procedures
in both the US and the UK.
Under Canadian law, a CCAA allows the management of the company to remain in
charge with protection from creditors. It could decide to allow O&amp;Y
subsidiaries in the US and the UK to continue to trade if they were solvent.
But if management decides to file for Chapter 11 protection in the US, and
administration in the UK - the most likely insolvency options in either case
 -there are few precedents to guide co-ordination between the different
national courts.
There are no international treaties to foster or require co-operation
between the different national jurisdictions under which the O&amp;Y empire
could fall, according to Mr Bill Drake, second vice-president of the
Canadian Insolvency Practitioners Association and a partner with Ernst &amp;
Young, the accounting firm.
He said there had been at least one recent case of a US parent company in
Chapter 11, with a Canadian subsidiary under CCAA and one of its divisions
under administration in the UK. 'A lot is being done by innovative, bright
practitioners working with sympathetic courts prepared to take a pragmatic
approach.'
CCAA - which has its origins in a short piece of legislation called the 1933
Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act - has a number of similarities with
Chapter 11 in the US.
The management of the company - as debtors - initiates proceedings by filing
a petition with the senior court of the province under which jurisdiction it
comes. The petition is almost automatically granted, protecting the company
from any existing or future proceedings by creditors to recover their loans.
The management then has a period of at least six months in which to file a
'plan of arrangement' with the court. In practice, this deadline is often
extended with a new court order. In the meantime, the management can
continue to trade and operate its business. A series of committees will be
formed for secured and unsecured creditors, which must approve the plan of
arrangement before it is brought to the court.
Teams of insolvency practitioners - generally led by lawyers but also
including accountants and merchant bankers and other professional advisers -
will be brought in to help develop the plan.
The court may also appoint an individual as a 'monitor' during the CCAA
process, who is responsible for reviewing the work of the management,
gathering the financial information during the process for the court, and
reporting on the fairness of the procedures if disputes arise.
If the creditors endorse the plan of arrangement when it is finally
presented, the court is likely to endorse it. However, it may need to make a
ruling if disagreements arise.
It is rare for the disagreements to go this far, however, because if the
court has to make a ruling when the plan is not endorsed, the result is
almost inevitably bankruptcy.
'It's a fairly onerous end of the road when the creditors realise that if
they don't agree then the company is gone,' said Mr Drake.
'By the time the plan gets to the courts, there have been extensive and at
times exhaustive negotiations. It is very much a reiterative process to
develop a plan acceptable to all stakeholders.'
Meanwhile, it is possible that O&amp;Y subsidiaries in the US and the UK could
also be subject to equivalent insolvency proceedings. In the US, Chapter 11
would allow the management to remain in charge of the company as 'debtor in
possession'. They are granted a stay from their creditors, and given 120
days - which is extendable - to file a 'plan of reorganisation'. This must
be ratified by creditors' committees and the courts.
But Mr Sam Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute
in Washington, DC, notes that a recent estimate showed only 17 per cent of
Chapter 11 reorganisation plans were accepted and implemented. The vast
majority of companies ended up passing into Chapter 7 - bankruptcy.
If O&amp;Y's UK subsidiaries pass into UK administration, the procedures are
somewhat different. If a company's directors petition for insolvency, then a
judge must decide whether to grant their request. If so, the judge appoints
insolvency practitioners as 'administrators'.
The administrators run the company in place of the directors, and have three
months - which can be extended - to draft a 'scheme of arrangement'. This
must be approved by creditors and the court.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Wizards no more in a
fading docklands Oz - Praise, profit and potholes along the road to Canary
Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MESSAGE 'We built Canary Wharf' was stretched across the ballooning body
of a workman basking in the heatwave.
The T-shirt had long since ceased to fit and the words were fading yesterday
as fast as the Reichmann brothers' vision of a docklands Utopia.
The workman was approaching the Canary Wharf pier yesterday morning as the
Riverbus discharged about a dozen passengers. Most were tourists.
Behind him in the spring sunshine the buildings of Canary Wharf rose
majestically like the beaming city of Oz, shorn of its yellow brick road.
The City was just a traffic jam away.
Mr Allan Paull, a retired professor from Toronto was visiting the centre
with friends while on holiday in London. 'This place is a big talking point
in Canada. I really can't see it fail but I wouldn't say that about the
Reichmanns.'
While the Reichmanns may be facing a financial showdown, the people they
have installed at Canary Wharf seem surprisingly upbeat about its future.
The greatest sadness among the office workers and the shopowners yesterday
was that they might lose O&amp;Y as their landlords.
Mr Peter Wagg, who runs the newsagent in the small shopping mall at Cabot
Place, said: 'Yesterday we had 3,146 customers and that's a lot of income.
When I came in October I was expecting to have to subsidise the business for
two years. Instead I had to subsidise it two weeks.'
Like all the shops at Canary Wharf, his rent is based upon a percentage of
turnover. 'I'm now paying more per square foot than I would be in Oxford
Street but I'm quite happy to do so on the level of business I'm getting.'
Whether O&amp;Y survives or not, he said, he was planning a second unit in the
development. His greatest fear is whether the quality of service would be
maintained if the running of Canary Wharf were taken out of O&amp;Y's hands.
He said: 'I don't understand why this place has received such a bad press.
It seems to be a British trait that anyone who gets to the top, whether a
pop star, sports star, or O&amp;Y, we have to knock them down.'
Mr Stephen Yeates, the owner of the Lady Gwynfred, a Thames Barge converted
into a floating restaurant moored in the Wharf, said: 'You only have to look
at Tobacco Dock and the mistakes they made with shops which were available
on every high street, to realise that O&amp;Y has got it right here. They have
gone for quality. The infrastructure has been planned and is on its way. The
debatable question is whether it should have been installed beforehand.'
The only place where the transport links have been completed is in the
models of the development displayed in O&amp;Y's marketing suite on the 30th
floor of the tower. The private view is not for everyone. Not even the
viewing platform of Europe's second tallest building is open to the public.
With the press of a button, a pulse of light brings to life the unfinished
Limehouse link road and the proposed extension of London Underground's
Jubilee Line.
A mile away where the Isle of Dogs meets the river, Mr Ted Adams a former
chairman of the Association of Island Communities, looked ruefully across
the water. 'The infrastructure is coming far too late. It should have been
installed now and should have been given more thought.'
His arm followed the flow of the river. 'Look at this,' he said. It goes
right into the heart of London. It's maintenance-free and it's swept by God
twice a day. This river should be part of a proper integrated transport
system.'
Mr Adams was one of the East End residents who raised barricades on the Isle
of Dogs in 1970. 'We declared UDI. We'd had enough,' he said.
'There is a feeling here that to some extent the War never ended. After the
bombs had fallen we had the slum clearance and the re-building then the
reclamation of the docks. They have been building and knocking down
buildings for 50 years. When is it going to come to an end?'
Mr Adams recalled the plaque that remembers Sir Christopher Wren, the
architect in St Paul's Cathedral, his finest creation. It says: 'Si monument
requiris, circumspice - If you are seeking a monument look around you.' He
said: 'They would never leave a plaque like that in Canary Wharf. I don't
think these buildings were made to last.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Problems on all fronts
for Canary Wharf - Hopes for keeping project out of administration / Failure
would hit confidence in property market and push down prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF, the project at the heart of Olympia &amp; York's predicament,
could still avoid being put into administration under UK insolvency laws.
However, its bankers may well judge that this would be the best way of
dealing with the project, given the O&amp;Y decision to seek protection from its
creditors.
If so, the Reichmann brothers' hopes of building a prestige office centre to
rival London's West End and the City would probably be dashed for good.
Canary Wharf's administration would make it far less likely that the
project, now less than half complete, would ever be finished.
Administration would not solve any of Canary Wharf's problems. Banks are
usually loathe to take property companies out of the hands of their
managers. Administrators generally have less expertise than developers and
their appointment is seen by potential pur-chasers as a reason to drive
prices down.
The administrators' task in finding tenants to fill the unlet 40 per cent of
the 4.5m sq ft project would be complicated by uncertainty over the
ownership of the project and doubts over the extension to the Underground's
Jubilee Line.
Attracting tenants will be a long, difficult process, whoever is in charge
of the development. According to APR a research group, in the Docklands, 58
per cent of space is empty.
The quality of the Canary Wharf buildings is superb, but rents have so far
been greater than anywhere else on the Isle of Dogs. Tenants are paying
around Pounds 30 per sq ft - although incentive packages, including
fitting-out costs, rent-free periods and rights to buy the freehold cheaply
have sometimes halved the headline rent.
The banks are believed to be prepared to lower rents to Pounds 18 a sq ft,
although the inducements offered by O&amp;Y would no longer be available. That
may not be cheap enough. The government, which is seeking 500,000 sq ft for
the Department of Environment and parts of the departments of transport and
trade and industry, is believed to be offering just Pounds 10 per sq ft.
The administrators' task in selling the Canary Wharf buildings would also be
tough. There is a huge surplus of buildings on the market in London,
although the strong covenants of the Canary Wharf tenants would be an
advantage.
In the case of many failed property companies, banks and administrators have
been anxious not to sell buildings cheaply, but rather to wait for an upturn
in the market. If the banks decide to fund O&amp;Y's share of the Jubilee Line
extention, there would be an added incentive to have a long timetable for
disposals.
The sale of the buildings would be unlikely to repay anything like the
Pounds 1.3bn that has been spent on the project. Canary Wharf's complex
construction and expensive finishes have made it a costly development, in
spite of its low land costs. The prospects of rental growth, which were a
key part of the original premises, have evaporated. Unlet space is virtually
worthless at the moment.
Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyor which is advising banks on the
project's value, may arrive at values that are significantly lower than
previous valuations which used special assumptions. At the start of the
year, it valued 10 Cabot Square, a 600,000 sq ft building, at Pounds 215m by
assuming that the buyer could take advantage of the tax breaks and ignoring
the risk of tenant default. Its US associate Landauer valued the Canary
Wharf tower at Pounds 680m, which also is thought unlikely to be realised.
The consequences of Canary Wharf failing for existing tenants would also be
severe. Not only would the Jubilee Line extension be in doubt and the
prestige of their headquarters dented, but many would face the prospect of
double overheads.
In many cases, O&amp;Y agreed to take responsibility for their tenants' existing
offices in central London. Legally, the costs of renting the old space would
revert to the original tenant.
There is speculation that the risk of being burdened with double overheads
in this situation spurred some of the most recent arrivals at Canary Wharf
to include let-out clauses in their contracts.
The sums are significant. Property agents estimate that O&amp;Y has taken back
at least 500,000 sq ft of space, including, for example Shearson Lehman's
240,000 sq ft of offices in the Broadgate complex. The severely depressed
state of London's letting market suggests that they will have difficulty in
attracting new tenants. That could leave Canary Wharf tenants paying an
extra Pounds 20m in rents and rates on their old property.
For the banks, the downside of putting Canary Wharf into administration
would extend beyond the project to the rest of the property market, which
underpins a large proportion of banks' total lending. If a large quantity of
new space was dumped on the market, it could drive prices down across the
board.
A further risk for the London market stems from the damage that Canary
Wharf's failure would inflict on confidence. Canary Wharf's central role in
bringing down the largest and most admired property developer in the world
will cast a shadow over London's attractions for international investors,
particularly the less sophisticated.
The impact on London's letting market might not be so dramatic, although the
City and West End will not welcome increased price competition from Canary
Wharf. But even now, the remoteness of Docklands limits its impact on the
centre. Moreover, the mothballing of future buildings in Canary Wharf would
reassure a market that is grappling with record quantities of unlet space.
Perhaps the longest shadow cast by the failure of Canary Wharf would be over
Docklands and the government's decision to allow the private sector to lead
its development. Its evolution might have been very different had the
government taken the lead and put in infrastructure at the outset.
Late in the day, the government has thrown itself behind the project's
infrastructure, channeling Pounds 5bn of investment into east London between
1985 and 1995. This spending may yet save the area, particularly if the
Jubilee Line extension goes ahead. It may be, however, that its image has
been irretrievably dented, limiting its potential to that of other parts of
London such as Hammersmith or Croydon.

GOOD TRANSPORT links have always been seen as crucial to the future of
Canary Wharf and London's Docklands. But with the final shape of Canary
Wharf now in doubt, one question to be answered is whether those transport
plans will be scaled back.
Projected government spending on Docklands transport is colossal. Over the
next five years, the bill for upgrading the Docklands Light Railway,
extending London Underground's Jubilee Line and completing the road links is
expected to reach Pounds 3.5bn - many times more than is being spent on
transport in the rest of the badly congested capital.
The government's commitment to the regeneration of Docklands means most of
that spending will still go ahead. Road construction and the upgrading of
the Docklands Light Railway are in any case too far advanced to be halted.
Where doubts do arise, however, is over the two transport links in which
Olympia &amp; York is financially involved - the RiverBus and the Jubilee Line
extension.
The RiverBus, a high-speed ferry service running every 20 minutes along the
Thames from Chelsea Harbour to Canary Wharf and Greenwich, is in danger of
becoming an early casualty if O&amp;Y collapses. Heavily loss-making, it has
only survived this long because O&amp;Y was prepared to finance it as a stop-gap
service pending the completion of other transport links.
It only seems likely to continue if any successors to O&amp;Y decide the losses
are outweighed by the value of the direct links provided by the ferry
between Canary Wharf and British Rail's London Bridge, Charing Cross and
Waterloo stations.
The Jubilee Line extension from central London to Canary Wharf and
Stratford, in east London - the most important link of all - also faces
uncertainty. At Pounds 1.7bn it accounts for nearly half the projected
Docklands transport spending.
In recognition of the fact that the value of the Canary Wharf development
would be greatly enhanced by the Jubilee Line extension, O&amp;Y had agreed to
put Pounds 400m towards the construction cost. But only Pounds 100m was to
be paid during the construction period: the remaining Pounds 300m was due in
staged payments long into the future, so its effective present value was
small.
O&amp;Y and the Department of Transport had yet to sign a legal agreement
covering the details of the deal. But the department has a letter from O&amp;Y
committing the company to the financial contribution, and ministers regard
this as binding on the company and its successors.
What remains to be seen, however, is whether O&amp;Y's banks see it this way, or
whether they would try calling the government's bluff and default, in the
expectation that the government would pick up the tab.
The government's view is that whoever takes control of Canary Wharf would
accept that Pounds 100m is a small price to pay to secure the Underground
line, given the fact that the investment will be recouped many times over
through the enhancement of Canary Wharf's value. Conversely, without the
line, Canary Wharf could become next to worthless.
But O&amp;Y's banks are also aware that the extension of the Jubilee Line is
crucial not just to Canary Wharf, but to Docklands in general; they may
gamble that the political price of not proceeding with the project would be
far greater than the missing Pounds 100m.
Whichever way, it seems likely that the line will be built. But the bigger
question is over the timing. London Transport warned yesterday that it could
not hold its project team together indefinitely. If the uncertainty lasts
much longer, and the project team is disbanded, the Jubilee Line could be
badly delayed - with all that implies for Canary Wharf and Docklands as a
whole.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Not enough fingers to
plug the dyke - Filing for protection prevents creditors' taking control of
assets / Judge orders Dollars 240m payment to Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON

<TEXT>
MR PAUL REICHMANN, the publicity-shy founder of Olympia &amp; York Developments,
has spent two months struggling to avoid asking the Canadian and US courts
for protection from his creditors under insolvency procedures.
But his bankers became convinced over the past few days that court
protection offers him the best chance of carrying out an orderly
reconstruction of his business, which has properties worth billions of
dollars in Toronto, New York and London.
Earlier this week, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Robin Leigh
Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, were alerted to the prospect of
O&amp;Y seeking the protection of the Canadian courts from the competing claims
of its many creditors. The Canadian government and Mr John Crow, governor of
the Bank of Canada, were also told.
But the news was restricted to this small circle. In the unlikely event that
O&amp;Y changed its mind and tried to do without court protection, it was
imperative that its preparations for bankruptcy filing should not leak. As
the world's biggest property developer, with Dollars 12bn of debt, any
premature public disclosure would have shaken the world's property and
banking markets.
By yesterday morning, however, it was becoming clear to O&amp;Y and its bankers
that they had little choice. A long line of disgruntled creditors was
queueing at Mr Reichmann's door in Toronto.
He had just been ordered by a High Court judge in London to make a payment
of Dollars 240m to Morgan Stanley in respect of a contract by which the US
investment bank had the right to sell to O&amp;Y the lease on an office in
Canary Wharf, the Pounds 3bn development in London's Docklands. Although the
payment is in respect of the Docklands property, the liability falls on
O&amp;Y's parent company in Canada.
Morgan's claim was only the latest of several confronting Mr Reichmann. A
syndicate of eight banks led by JP Morgan, the US commercial bank, was
foreclosing on a Dollars 160m loan. Meanwhile, bondholders owed CDollars
325m were furious that O&amp;Y was delaying payment of CDollars 17m in interest
and were threatening to seize rents payable to O&amp;Y by occupants of First
Canadian Place in Toronto.
O&amp;Y also faced a demand for immediate repayment from holders of several
hundred million dollars of commercial paper, short-term debt securities,
which are secured against another Toronto building, the Exchange Tower. As
one of O&amp;Y's bankers' said yesterday: 'There are too many holes in the dyke
and not enough fingers to fill them.'
Since mid-March, when holders of CDollars 800m of commercial paper demanded
immediate repayment, Mr Reichmann has been using up all his fingers - and
his toes - filling those gaps. He ran out of cash and has been having
problems selling assets to raise more.
He and his advisers are convinced that his assets still have a net positive
value - of about Dollars 5bn, according to Mr Reichmann. But these assets,
mostly huge office blocks in Toronto and New York, would not fetch anything
like as much as that if they were sold today.
O&amp;Y's banks, led by Citicorp, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, advised Mr Reichmann that he needed to create
more time for himself if he is to succeed in producing a workable plan to
realise assets over the long term and gradually reconstruct his business.
By filing for protection from creditors, O&amp;Y puts a block on their ability
to take control of assets. Mr Reichmann's hope is therefore that O&amp;Y will at
some point emerge from the court's protection as a going concern.
Any reconstruction plan will be based on the proposals which O&amp;Y put last
Thursday to its 15 biggest bank creditor, who were representing all 100 of
its banks. Mr Steve Miller, O&amp;Y's chief bank negotiator and a partner in the
US investment bank, James D Wolfensohn, asked the banks to suspend principal
payments on most of the company's Dollars 12bn of debt for five years. There
was also a request that they take new O&amp;Y shares instead of cash interest on
around Dollars 4bn of this debt. If the scheme were approved, the banks
would probably end up owning 20 per cent of O&amp;Y.
At the time of that bank meeting, O&amp;Y's Achilles heel appeared to be Canary
Wharf. It was the cost of building Canary Wharf which drained O&amp;Y of cash in
the first place.
O&amp;Y has told its bankers it needs Pounds 300m from a group of 11 Canary
Wharf lenders to meet costs of finishing the office development over the
next two years. But much of the Pounds 300m was required simply to pay
interest to banks on loans already made. Banks were unhappy about doing
this.
Their chief concern was whether the value of the Canary Wharf buildings  -
in which 40 per cent of space is unoccupied - would increase enough over the
coming few years to make it sensible to lend any new money at all.
Bankers are encouraged that the UK government has been indicating it is
likely to move thousands of civil servants down to Canary Wharf to occupy
about 500,000 square feet of space. But the government has been proposing to
pay only Pounds 10 per square foot, compared with the banks' estimate that a
rent of about Pounds 18 would be necessary to make the project viable.
In the event, the Canary Wharf banks have provided O&amp;Y with Pounds 21m,
enough to meet costs until the end of May. Advised by Ernst &amp; Young, the
accounting firm, and Hillier Parker, the surveyor, they plan to decide by
the middle of next week whether to put up any more money.
Canary Wharf may not go into administration under UK insolvency procedures,
following the Canadian bankruptcy filing, because at the moment no creditors
are threatening to seize the Canary Wharf assets.
If it were the one part of O&amp;Y which avoided bankruptcy filing, Mr Reichmann
would allow himself a wry smile, since Canary Wharf caused the bulk of his
problems. But one banker said of that prospect: 'Theoretically possible, but
. . . '

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Little risk for UK
builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WOULD be sadness among British contractors at the collapse of the
developers of Canary Wharf, but most have already been paid for the initial
phase of the project which has been largely completed.
Any problems that could arise would involve money which has been retained by
Olympia &amp; York against the possibility of defects emerging in completed
buildings.
Normally developers would retain 5 per cent of the total cost of a building
until it has been completed. After that developers can retain 2 1/2 per cent
of the cost as an insurance against defects developing within 12 months.
At least two large UK contractors are understood to be owed money by O&amp;Y on
this basis. It is not clear what claims companies might have on these
outstanding sums should the developers be placed in administrative
receivership.
If this happened, companies fitting out the large office blocks could also
be at risk. This work is done last before the tenants arrive. Unfortunately
for O&amp;Y not enough tenants are paying rent to make the scheme viable.
Whether companies now fitting out buildings got paid would depend upon
whether contracts are with the developers or the tenant. Most are likely to
have insisted upon regular progress payments given the state of O&amp;Y's
finances.
Any loss of revenue would be bad news for builders when the UK construction
market is in deep recession and new orders are in short supply. British
contractors would be particularly concerned that the government might decide
not to go ahead with the Pounds 1.7bn extension to the Jubilee Underground
line. O&amp;Y had been expected to provide up to Pounds 400m over 25 years
towards the cost of building the extension.
The project, which received Royal Assent in February, has attracted
widespread interest from British and overseas tunnellers, although London
Underground cannot place contracts until the secretary of state for
transport gives the go ahead.
It has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by Italstrade as
likely to win the contract for the 4.3km section between Canary Wharf and
Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames.
Bidders for other sections include Trafalgar House of the UK, Cogefar of
Italy, Spie Batignolles and Dumez of France and Hochtief of Germany.
At Canary Wharf only one building, known as B3, is left to be completed  -
and work on that is largely finished. There is also a small amount of civil
engineering, including improvements to a jetty used by river buses.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Olympia &amp; York Files for Protection: Family fortune slip
slides away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE conversation in the spacious, book-lined study of Paul Reichmann's home
in north Toronto turned one recent Saturday evening to the subject of Canary
Wharf. What went wrong, the Reichmanns' guests were wondering, with the
family's mammoth showpiece in London's Docklands? 'Canary Wharf,' one of the
Reichmanns replied defiantly, 'is too good for the British.'
Such bitterness was not surprising with the family company, Olympia &amp; York,
tottering on the brink of bankruptcy. Eulogised for more than a decade as
the world's wealthiest and most astute property developers, the Reichmanns
may now face the agony of watching the vast empire which they built crumble
around them.
Ever since they started putting up industrial buildings on the outskirts of
Toronto in the late 1950s, Paul Reichmann and his brothers Albert and Ralph
have prided themselves on the innovative touches which kept them one step
ahead of the competition.
Paul Reichmann has been heard ticking off one project after another where
O&amp;Y provided features and services which no other developer had thought of -
from Toronto's 26-storey Aetna Centre built in the late 1960s, to the
marble-decorated towers of Canary Wharf.
In spite of the Canary Wharf problems, Paul Reichmann's vaunted skills as a
property developer are likely to remain in demand even after O&amp;Y's filing
for protection from the courts. But the brothers, and especially Paul, will
almost certainly play a less dominant role.
O&amp;Y has always been run as a family firm, despite its size. Even in the
years of helter-skelter growth in the mid-1980s, almost every decision, big
and small, was made by Paul or his elder brother Albert. Their closest
confidants for the past quarter-century have been the handful of men they
recruited from O&amp;Y's auditors. The company's offices still close well before
sunset each Friday to allow the Reichmanns and other Jewish employees to get
home in time for the Sabbath.
Not even the heads of O&amp;Y's biggest subsidiaries have been invited to Paul
Reichmann's unremarkable home in the heart of Toronto's Orthodox Jewish
neighbourhood, whose most pretentious feature is a glass-ceilinged family
room.
But things were starting to change even before the liquidity crisis broke in
February and March.
Late last year the Reichmanns approached Mr Tom Johnson, former head of the
US bank Manufacturers Hanover, to join O&amp;Y. Mr Johnson spent less than three
weeks as O&amp;Y's president in March, but a precedent had been established for
outsiders to have a significant say in running the company. Mr Johnson has
been succeeded as president by Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-chairman
of Chrysler. Another ex-Chrysler man, Mr Steve Miller, has for the past six
weeks spearheaded O&amp;Y's negotiations with restive banks and bondholders.
The Reichmanns remain O&amp;Y's sole shareholders for the time being. But here
too, their control shows signs of slipping. A milestone was reached in
London last week when the family came to the reluctant conclusion that it
had no choice but to offer creditors an equity stake  - albeit a non-voting
one - in the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments.
O&amp;Y has already started shrinking as the Reichmanns have stepped up their
desperate search for cash. It has sold a controlling interest in
Interprovincial PipeLine, one of North America's biggest oil pipeline
operators.
O&amp;Y has also announced plans to spin off its 19 per cent stake in Santa Fe
Pacific, the biggest single shareholding in the Chicago-based railway,
mining and pipeline operator. Its stake in Home Oil, a Calgary-based energy
producer is also up for sale.
Even some of the precious real estate is on the block. O&amp;Y has been
desperately casting around for a partner to buy at least part of Canary
Wharf. It has unsuccessfully tried to seal a sale-and-leaseback deal on the
36-storey Exchange Tower building in Toronto.
Some of O&amp;Y's other North American properties are also for sale. But
prospective buyers have so far found that Paul Reichmann - whose mild manner
masks a tough, and even stubborn, will - has no intention of parting with
them at bargain-basement prices.
Whether O&amp;Y can hang on to the bulk of its property may depend mainly on the
length of time its creditors are willing to wait to get their money back.
The Reichmanns will be crossing fingers for a strong upturn soon in the
North American and UK office property markets. The glut of office space in
New York, London and Toronto does not augur well.
The damage which O&amp;Y's troubles has wreaked on the Reichmanns' personal
fortunes can only be guessed at. Forbes magazine last year ranked them as
the world's seventh-richest family, with a net worth of Dollars 7bn. O&amp;Y
recently estimated the market value of its net assets at about Dollars
5.5bn. But the volatility of the property market and the sheer size of many
of the company's buildings makes it hard to pinpoint a precise value until
firm buyers step forward.
The Reichmanns own a web of private companies outside O&amp;Y, including Olympia
Tile, one of North America's biggest floor-covering distributors. The
personal companies own some minor property assets - but, as far as outsiders
can tell, all the crown jewels remain under the O&amp;Y umbrella.
Before the crisis broke, it was widely expected that O&amp;Y's far-flung empire
would eventually be parcelled out among the three brothers' dozen or so
children.
Two of Paul Reichmann's five children are still at university in Israel, but
several other members of the younger generation (and their spouses) work for
the family company and sit on the boards of subsidiaries. One nephew is at
Abitibi-Price, the newsprint maker which is 82 per cent owned by O&amp;Y.
But none of the younger Reichmanns has impressed outsiders as an obvious
successor to their fathers. Indeed, some of their present jobs could be in
jeopardy if O&amp;Y is forced into massive asset sales.
The question of succession will become less pressing as the family is forced
to loosen its grip. Although the next generation will probably inherit a
tidy sum by most people's standards, they might have had a lot more to look
forward to if the British had been more appreciative of Canary Wharf.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Hanson profits fall 17% midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 17 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the half year, making it harder for the group to
continue its record of 28 years of earnings growth. Shares fell on the news
to close 9p down at 232 1/2 p.
For the six months to March 31, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 588m to
Pounds 488m, which the company blamed on a fall in net interest receivable
from Pounds 103m to Pounds 44m and the absence of a Pounds 68m profit on
disposal of natural resources assets.
Trading profits were up marginally at Pounds 464m compared with Pounds 459m.
Sales increased from Pounds 3.9bn to Pounds 4.4bn.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US, confirmed that the
group was looking to buy a core business.
'The outlook for acquisitions is favourable,' he said. 'Recently we have
begun to see some signs of recovery in North America and improvement in our
early cycle building products and consumer companies.'
The integration of Beazer, the aggregates and building business, was largely
responsible for an Pounds 880m increase in provisions for liabilities which
rose to Pounds 4.5bn.
Net borrowings were Pounds 1.59bn which have recently been reduced by the
Pounds 132m sale of Hanson's UK and Irish Ever Ready companies and the
Pounds 280m sale of its 2.8 per cent shareholding in Imperial Chemical
Industries.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said there were likely to be more
disposals to bring down net borrowings which he would like to eliminate.
The worst hit US business was SCM Chemicals which reported a 36 per cent
drop in profit as average selling prices for titanium dioxide fell 9 per
cent. Profits from chemicals were down from Pounds 72m to Pounds 46m.
A full six-month profit from Cavenham Forest Industries boosted the overall
profits of forest products from Pounds 13m to Pounds 34m.
In the UK, Imperial Tobacco continued to increase profits from Pounds 124m
to Pounds 131m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were down 12 per cent to 8.3p from 9.4p.
From July 1 dividends will be paid quarterly, the first payment amounting to
2.75p and subsequent dividends being not less than that amount.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Shell shares rise on strong first-quarter results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in the Royal Dutch/Shell group, the Anglo-Dutch oil company gained
Pounds 1 3/32 to close at Pounds 46 5/8 yesterday as the company announced
surprisingly strong first-quarter results.
Increased earnings from exploration and production helped the company to
increase net income on a historical cost basis to Pounds 858m, up just over
1 per cent from Pounds 847m in the same period last year.
With the price of Brent crude around Dollars 3 a barrel lower than in the
first quarter of 1991, analysts had forecast figures of between Pounds 450m
and Pounds 650m. Current cost net income, which includes stock gains or
losses, fell 22 per cent to Pounds 954m from Pounds 1.23bn.
The figures reflected a strong performance in upstream and downstream
businesses outside North America. Shell said margins in its Asian market
remained relatively firm because of lower levels of export from the Middle
East and growth in demand.
Mr Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said: 'These
are very intriguing figures and completely at variance with anything any
other company has managed to deliver. They reflect a great deal of success
in holding on to margins at the pumps and the refineries.'
Shell's oil production in the first quarter rose 6 per cent to 2.22m barrels
a day. Gas sales volumes also rose 9 per cent to 8.31bn cu ft a day.
Earnings in the exploration and production sector rose to Pounds 468m from
Pounds 443m last year, with higher production and special items including a
US contract settlement and tax adjustment more than offsetting the lower oil
price.
Downstream manufacturing and marketing earnings increased to Pounds 298m
from Pounds 254m, although they fell on a current cost basis to Pounds 390m
from Pounds 624m because of lower margins.
Gains from corporate items - including Pounds 85m from exchange rate
movements - also boosted the figures.
However, the chemicals sector saw income plummet to Pounds 21m from Pounds
89m in the same period in 1991. The 1991 figure was itself a drop of Pounds
70m from 1990. Most of the reduction was in the market outside the US, where
lower product margins reflected depressed markets, particularly for bulk
petrochemicals.

FT  15 MAY 92 / The NYSE begins to show its age: Stock market is being left
behind by its more modern rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few weeks ago a delegation from a newly independent Eastern Bloc state was
shown around the New York Stock Exchange.
The visitors wanted to see a modern stock exchange, and hopefully learn
something that would help them develop their own securities market. As the
delegation strolled through the trading room, a voice was heard above the
fray: 'For God's sake, don't build one like this.'
The anonymous advice goes straight to the heart of the problem facing the
NYSE, which this weekend celebrates its bicentenary. It may be 200 years
old, and it is still the world's largest stock exchange, but the Big Board's
power in its home market is waning and it risks being left behind as
financial markets head for the 21st century.
It has been remarked upon recently that no one, with all the computer
technology now available, would design a stock market today along the lines
of the NYSE, with its expensive trading floor, its hand-written paper
orders, and its specialists who man trading posts every day but who for 90
per cent of the time play no real role in the market.
Over the past decade not one emerging country which has developed its own
stock market has modelled its system on the NYSE, points out Mr Junius
Peake, a US financial consultant who has advised governments on securities
exchanges.
Why is this so? The NYSE is simply regarded as an expensive anachronism. The
priority for many investors today, particularly the big institutions who
trade big bundles of stock at one time, and for the brokers who handle large
amounts of customer orders, is to cut transaction costs. Increasingly, many
are finding alternatives to the NYSE.
In 1981, more than 75 per cent of the trading in all US stocks (measured by
dollar volume) was handled by the NYSE. Last year, that share had dropped to
not much more than half.
The NYSE has even struggled to hold on to trading of its own listed stocks.
In 1981 it accounted for 82 per cent of all trades in NYSE stocks. Ten years
later its share had fallen to 67 per cent.
The decline, however, is less precipitous when measured by the number of
shares, rather than the number of trades, with the NYSE's share of volume
over the same period falling from 87 per cent to 82 per cent.
The business the NYSE has lost has gone to a number of sources, including US
regional and overseas exchanges, electronic markets such as the
over-the-counter Nasdaq market, commercially run trading systems such as
Instinet, Posit, Madoff Securities and Spaworks, and in-house matching
services run by a few big US brokerage firms.
Foreign exchanges - generally London - are popular because they operate more
relaxed reporting rules than the NYSE. The remainder are used because they
save money for institutions and brokers.
Aware that the big issue today is cost, the NYSE has gone on the offensive,
arguing that costs cannot be measured purely in transaction fees. It claims
the exchange's customer-driven auction market, where there are no
intermediaries to take a cut from the spread between the buy and sell price,
gives investors the best possible price on trades.
This argument was supported by a recent Michigan University survey, which
concluded that trades made away from the NYSE were often completed at
unfavourable pricing terms, at a total cost to investors of as much as
Dollars 55m (Pounds 31m) a year.
Defenders of the NYSE point out that some of the business going elsewhere is
being bribed away. Increasing numbers of broking firms have been diverting
customer orders to rival markets in exchange for transaction fee discounts,
which are not passed on to the end investor.
The NYSE also likes to emphasise that its system guarantees liquidity.
During the 1987 Crash, the NYSE won much support when specialists on the
trading floor bought stock from frantic sellers while dealers on rival
electronic systems such as Nasdaq refused to answer their phones.
Since then, however, the National Association of Securities Dealers has
tightened its rules and says in future there will always be a marketmaker on
Nasdaq willing to deal.
While the NYSE's customer-driven auction system has merits, the continued
use of the exchange's trading floor is more difficult to defend.
NYSE officials, recognising that the floor seems out-of-date in the hi-tech
world, admit it would be possible to design an electronic market that keeps
the customer-driven auction system, and the specialists, but dispenses with
the floor.
The exchange has tried to keep up with changing times, partly by expanding
its business hours to encourage more trading. But the after-hours session
introduced 11 months ago has been only a modest success, while last year's
plan to open earlier each morning was scuttled by opposition from member
firms on the west coast.
Apart from bringing in new business and stemming the flow of orders to
rivals, the NYSE's other priority is to attract more foreign listings. The
exchange knows that US investment in overseas stocks is rising steadily, and
it is desperate to service that growing demand.
Standing in its way, however, is the SEC.
Determined to uphold its responsibility of protecting investors, the SEC has
refused NYSE requests to relax financial reporting requirements for foreign
companies so that their shares can be traded on the Big Board. The two sides
remain locked in disagreement, and for the moment the NYSE must put its
ambitions on hold.
Ultimately, the chances of the NYSE keeping up with the times will depend on
the members who run the exchange.
To date, they have shown little inclination to instigate change. While the
specialists hold sway at the NYSE, they are unlikely to do anything that
threatens their valuable franchise.
As one cynic noted: 'If bank tellers had run the banks, how many automated
cash machines do you think there would be?'

FT  15 MAY 92 / GrandMet 7% rise exceeds forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, topped market
forecasts with a 7 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds
402m.
The result was helped by a Pounds 12m bonus from favourable exchange rates -
but trading profits from continuing businesses in the six months to the end
of March grew 11 per cent in sterling terms and 6 per cent in local
currencies. Earnings per share rose 5.6 per cent to 13.3p. The interim
dividend is raised 9.5 per cent to 4.6p.
GrandMet's share price responded with a gain of 7p to close at 499p.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, who predicted three months
ago that first-half profits would be in line with last year's Pounds 377m,
said: 'Trading conditions in our major markets continue to be testing.'
Recovery had begun in the US and there were signs of improvement in the UK,
he said.
Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of about Pounds 1.04bn.
GrandMet's drinks division, IDV, contributed 54 per cent of the group's
Pounds 437m trading profits. IDV brands achieved an 18 per cent growth in
profits to Pounds 235m on turnover of Pounds 1.4bn, up from Pounds 1.17bn.
In spite of contraction in the North American market, IDV profits rose 14.3
per cent in dollar terms and 24.2 per cent in sterling to Pounds 77m.
Profits in Europe and the rest of the world were up 15.3 per cent at Pounds
158m.
The group's food businesses recorded a Pounds 4m increase in trading profits
to Pounds 141m on turnover of Dollars 1.56bn, up from Pounds 1.45bn. Profits
of Pounds 120m from the North American operations rose 2.4 per cent in
dollar terms; but European earnings dipped from Pounds 29m to Pounds 21m
after large expansion costs in building the Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and
Brossard brands. Trading profits at Burger King rose 13 per cent in local
currency terms to Pounds 48m on the back of increased sales and improved
margins. However, losses at the Pearle eye-care stores rose from Pounds 5m
to Pounds 13m. Profits from the group's managed pubs and property business
rose Pounds 4m to Pounds 26m but there was a loss of Pounds 7m on IEL, the
GrandMet/Courage pubs joint venture. There was an extraordinary profit of
Pounds 139m from the sale of the Express businesses in the UK and Ireland.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Over 35 is over the hill for Brussels jobseekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are in your mid-thirties and would like to work in Brussels for the
European Commission, don't bother to apply.
The trouble is, the Commission says, that people approaching 40 do not have
long enough careers ahead of them. This means that most of its jobs carry
age limits of 32 or 35.
The policy, however, came under sharp attack yesterday from Britain's new
employment minister, 37-year-old Mr Michael Forsyth. He said it was 'stupid'
because it prevented the recruitment of people offering many productive
years.
The minister accused the Commission of ageism, widely considered a
regressive employment practice. The UK has more often been on the receiving
end of such allegations.
Mr Forsyth's remarks underline indications by Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, that tackling age discrimination will be a priority
when the UK takes over the European Community presidency in July.
The UK employment department has, however, ruled out legislation against
ageism, the approach favoured in the US. 'Sometimes we are accused of being
reluctant Europeans because we do not believe that piling on regulation is
the way forward,' said Mr Forsyth.
Best practice as outlined by the Institute of Personnel Management is for
employers to specify no age limits in adverts or ask for ages on application
forms.
Mr Forsyth told a recruitment industry meeting in London: 'The Commission
has set an age limit of just 35 on most jobs whether you wish to join as a
lawyer or as a messenger.'
He accepted the need for age limits sometimes, ,but said blanket bans could
not be justified.
The Commission says its aim is to recruit individuals who 'can look forward
to a career progression of a sufficient period of time'. It may now review
the practice of specifying age limits in its recruitment literature.
Besides, it says a few senior staff as old as 55 are in any case recruited
and there is no age limit for roughly a third of staff who are on temporary
contracts.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Domestic gas price cut fails to quell row with regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between British Gas and Ofgas, the industry regulator, grew
increasingly bitter yesterday as the company insisted its decision to cut
gas prices by 3 per cent was not a climbdown after threats of legal action.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, said that when British Gas froze its
prices in March it indicated a future price cut was likely. It had waited
until the economic outlook could be more accurately predicted before taking
action.
Last week, Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, told British Gas
to cut prices to its 18m domestic customers or face 'enforcement action'.
Mr Evans attacked Ofgas's statement as a 'stunt for the press' and
complained that the demands of the regulator and the government in their
efforts to open the gas supply market to competition sometimes gave the
impression that British Gas was being 'set up to fail'.
The price cut of 1.7p a therm will mean an average reduction of Pounds 13
for domestic consumers on bills for the year from July. It brings the
company into line with a tough pricing formula imposed by Ofgas in April
which limits price rises to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation.
But it was clear yesterday that the move had done little to improve the
frosty relations between the utility and its regulator. Sir James said the
cut was only just sufficient for him to put the threat of legal action 'on
hold', and he would continue to monitor prices on a month-by-month basis. He
repeated that British Gas could have cut prices sooner.
'They knew on April 10 that we had a Conservative government and the likely
economic consequences. There is no reason why they could not have announced
a price cut then, to take effect from June, so that the consumer felt the
benefit much sooner.'
Mr Evans complained that Sir James had made his statement to the media last
week without consulting British Gas and without responding to its request
for a meeting to discuss the matter.
'It sends signals around the world, in places we look to for investment,
that there is interference in the business in a continuing and aggressive
way.'
Mr Evans said Sir James's comments also gave the impression to customers
that British Gas was failing to comply with price regulations, when in fact
the opposite was true.
The cut will cost the company about Pounds 225m, although British Gas said
that Pounds 56m of this was accounted for by an overcharge in the first
quarter which could now be refunded.
If the refund element is subtracted, the cut is equivalent to less than 1.3p
a therm.
British Gas yesterday disclosed an 11.5 per cent drop in first-quarter
profits, due largely to subdued demand during the mild winter.
Mr Evans warned that any drop in what was normally the most profitable
quarter was likely to be reflected in the full-year figures. He also warned
that British Gas's management faced a 'monumental challenge' in maintaining
profit levels while fulfilling requirements set by Ofgas and the Office of
Fair Trading aimed at increasing competition in the gas market. He admitted
he thought some of the demands were 'unfair'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Bonn rejects further pay talks: Public sector union's
leadership in disarray after members vote against deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday rejected any move to reopen pay talks after
public sector workers rejected a pay deal agreed by their leaders last week.
A ballot among the almost 450,000 union members of the oTV, the largest and
most militant public sector union, showed just 44.1 per cent in favour of
the 5.4 per cent pay deal.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and leader of the employers' side
in the talks, said the ballot result reflected the 'completely unrealistic
expectations' aroused by the union's 9.5 per cent pay claim. He said: 'No
one can expect the negotiations to be reopened.'
The result leaves the oTV leadership in disarray. Although it is unlikely to
lead to further strike action in the public sector, the vote could stoke
militancy among 4m engineering workers who are preparing for strike action.
Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the German employers' association, issued a
warning that engineering workers taking action would face 'lock-outs on an
unprecedented scale'.
The last formal negotiations in the engineers' dispute, between employers
and unions in North Rhine-Westphalia, were called off last night before they
began, after the unions declared there was no point in attending. Three key
regions have called strike ballots for next week and strike action is
expected to start on May 25.
Industrial relations turmoil, fuelled by resentment over rising taxation,
inflation running at 4.6 per cent, and the overall cost of German
unification, continued to spread yesterday.
Textile workers have called a meeting for Monday to decide on possible
strike action. Arbitration for print workers will begin on May 21, but token
strikes are already taking their toll of newspaper production.
The confusion over the public sector pay award is expected to stoke
militancy among members of IG Metall, the large engineering workers' union,
convincing the union leadership of the dangers of accepting too low a deal.
However, the union has lost the advantage of having a base figure from which
to launch its own demand.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, the high-profile oTV union leader who led the
11-day public sector strike, and then recommended last week's deal,
yesterday refused to resign after the setback.
'The result depresses us all, and it affects me in particular', she
admitted. 'We simply did not expect this mood.'
She said that any attempt to restart the strike was unlikely to produce a
better offer from the employers, representing the central government, the 16
federal states, and local authorities. Instead, she has ordered her
officials to 'consult the grass roots', and report back to a national
executive meeting on May 25.
All the other unions in the dispute have now accepted the 5.4 per cent pay
deal, including railway and postal workers, police, and clerical workers,
leaving the oTV isolated.

Focusing attention on the fact that three out of the five new members of the
prime minister's policy unit are women misses the point. The ideas of the
new team are far more important than its sex. Unlike its predecessor, the
new team does not have to concentrate on the short-term objective of winning
an election.
Two of the new faces - David Poole and Damian Green - are well known in the
City. Poole, son of a former Tory party chairman, used to be with Capel Cure
Myers and more recently ran James Capel's corporate finance side. If the
government is to take a look at the pensions business, Poole is the man to
watch. Green, presenter of Channel 4 Business and a 'Heathite' Tory, has
some interesting ideas on the future of the TV licence fee - which could
make the BBC twitchy.
Meanwhile, civil servant Jill Rutter's career does not seem to have been
blighted by her work on the poll tax and Lucy Neville-Rolfe comes from a
well-connected family. Of the existing team, Sarah Hogg's deputy remains
Nick True, the man largely credited with having turned the Citizen's Charter
from a bright idea in the prime minister's mind to the centrepiece of his
strategy for improving the public services. Alan Rosling, son of Hanson
vice-chairman Derek Rosling, also remains on board.

If Tokyo-touring Dan Quayle has time between visiting factories, negotiating
the new world order and such, he'd do well to watch a video called Imported
Rice is Dangerous, just produced by the well meaning if protectionist Japan
Offspring Fund.
The video traces the tragic lives of weevils in three containers of rice.
One houses the home-grown product, the next imported Australian rice, and
the third the good old American rice that the US vice-president no doubt
insists is served with his curries and chop suey.
A flourishing family of 50 weevils was added to the American rice and,
allegedly owing to the effects of insecticides, 10 were dead within four
days. The fate of the weevils in the Australian rice was still sadder: all
50 perished within a week. Of course, the weevils in the Japanese rice lived
happily ever after.

Is the Old Testament right that man dates from God's creation 5,752 years

Planned advertisements suggesting Darwin was correct, and that today's homo

The company and its local licensee, Israel's biggest drinks-maker Tempo, are

the religious community accounts for a good portion of the country's Pounds

Meanwhile the local producers of Coke looked on smugly. Their impeccably

Compact, rich and handsome Stephen Walls, just gone down the gangplank from
the good ship Arjo Wiggins Appleton, looks to be becoming a bit of a
corporate flibbertigibbet - which, as any international executive knows, can
damage even the best-managed reputations.
No one can quibble about his 13-year apprenticeship at Chesebrough-Ponds in
the US. He's also said to have done well while briefly running Plessey
before GEC interrupted. But having helped to demerge Wiggins Teape Appleton
from BAT and then meld it with Arjo-Prioux, 44-year-old Walls is again
collecting his P45 and presumably another golden handshake. His French
shareholders were not prepared to back a young man in a hurry.
Were it not for the earlier resignation from the AWA board of Henry Wendt,
SmithKline Beecham's respected chairman, Walls's reputation must surely have
suffered more than it has from the latest boardroom bust-up. And even as
things are, it's hard to judge his success as a near Pounds 400,000 a year
boss; he has never stayed in one job long enough to be tested.
Come to think of it, if only he were a bit younger, he'd probably make a
better merchant banker.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Determined driver of the 'last train to modernity': Brazil's
President Collor talks to FT writers about the Earth Summit and the
challenges of economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, CHRISTINA LAMB and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In three weeks Brazil's President Fernando Collor de Mello is due to host
the UN conference on Environment and Development, better known as the Earth
Summit - an occasion he describes, with perhaps pardonable hyperbole, as
'the conference of the century'.
With more than 100 heads of state expected in Rio de Janeiro, Collor's
Brazil will be on show at a critical time domestically. The coming months
will determine whether Latin America's largest economy can break free from a
decade of chronic inflation (still running at 20 per cent a month) and
return to its historic pattern of rapid growth, or, whether the government
will be forced to abandon its adjustment programme in the face of political
pressure and mounting social problems.
In an interview Mr Collor seemed determined not to yield to demands to relax
his deflationary policy which has prolonged a recession which began in 1989.
'We have caught the last train to modernity. If it's not going as fast as
we'd like it's because obstacles are being placed in front of us daily as if
to test us. But we are overcoming them.'
Lacking a sufficient political base to steer crucial economic reforms
through Congress, Mr Collor was forced last month to bring into his
government old-style politicians who are already asking for increased funds.
But at the same time the government's failure to meet first-quarter targets
of an economic stabilisation programme with the International Monetary Fund
will mean increased pressure to slash public spending even further to
prevent a collapse of the accord.
According to official figures, expenditure was already down about 60 per
cent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, achieved
by a virtual freeze on all new spending commitments. At one point even the
foreign ministry's telephones were cut off because the bill had not been
paid.
Mr Collor insists he will resist pressure for higher social spending from
politicians who face important local elections this October. 'These
pressures are legitimate in the sense of the need for state investment but
it is also legitimate for me to insist on sticking to my stabilisation
programme. The ministers must obey and are obeying.'
Mr Collor's new pragmatism contrasts sharply with the gimmickry of two years
ago, when he came into office pledging to 'slay the inflationary tiger with
a single bullet.' The 42-year-old president now admits that the people he
brought into his initial cabinet were inadequate to the task. 'It was a team
of young idealists without experience. I've learnt through time that I
needed people with more experience and thus I have now brought into my
cabinet older people with professional qualifications and sound ethics.'
Himself a political outsider from the backward north-eastern state of
Alagoas, Mr Collor assumed office in March 1990 with monthly inflation at 84
per cent and immediately stunned the nation by freezing four-fifths of
commercial bank accounts, in between riding jet-skis and flying fighter
aircraft. Now after two failed economic plans he has abandoned what is known
locally as his 'Indiana Jones' approach in favour of strict fiscal
discipline embodied in the staid persona of the economy minister, Mr
Marcilio Marques Moreira.
The change has taken a visible personal toll on Mr Collor. His hair is now
sprinkled with grey, and he admits to having lost 14 kilos (30lb) while in
office. There have been persistent rumours about his health, although in
this week's interview he appeared relaxed and fit.
The austerity programme is extracting a heavy social cost of which symptoms
are not hard to find. This week, Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, has been
paralysed by bus strikes. Over the past month 30 supermarkets have been
ransacked by mobs in Rio de Janeiro, and there is considerable unease in the
military over low pay. Brazil has the world's worst income distribution and
last month the minimum monthly salary fell to less than Dollars 40.
Mr Collor admits he is concerned but insists that 'improvement of standards
will come only with the return of economic growth to the state. At this
stage it is necessary to defeat the phantom of inflation, balance public
accounts and reduce the role of the state in areas in which it should not be
operating. It's a project of extraordinary ambition which will not produce
overnight results.'
Brazil has come under frequent attack for the widely publicised murders of
street children by death-squads, and Mr Collor insisted that the welfare of
children is his highest priority. A large part of the budget, he said, is
being devoted to 'integrated assistance centres for children', designed 'to
rescue children from the streets'.
He added that education is essential for Brazil's economic growth. 'We
cannot enter the first world with third world labour. Cheap manpower is no
longer an incentive to investment.' Pointing to the array of Brazilian-made
tank, fighter-jet and rocket models arranged on his shelves, he said: 'It's
no good building computers and planes if in the future we're submerged by a
wave of ignorance.'
Brazil is still lagging behind the rest of Latin America in the reform
process. It has the highest inflation in the region and is the most closed
market, imports only representing 5 per cent of GDP. But Mr Collor warns
against comparisons. 'Brazil is a continent-sized country which has both
first-world oases such as Sao Paulo and areas of intense underdevelopment.'
He added: 'Brazil has enormous potential and possibilities. With
stabilisation I have no doubt that Brazil will be the best alternative for
foreign investment.'
One of the problems which makes Brazil's difficulties so intractable is its
rapid population growth. Despite his somewhat sensitive position as
president of the world's largest Catholic country, Mr Collor plans to bring
population control into the discussions at the Earth Summit.
Mr Collor believes industrialised countries' concern about world population
is motivated mainly by fear of uncontrolled migration. But, he says,
'developed countries spend three or four times more to receive an immigrant
than the investment it would take to create the conditions to keep him in
his country of origin. People move because they are looking for
opportunities for survival.'
Taking as an example the garimpeiro (wildcat gold miner) in Amazonia, he
said 'the garimpeiro doesn't cut down trees because he wants to see logs on
the ground, or pollute rivers because he likes seeing fish dying. He has
travelled thousands of kilometres into the jungle in search of survival.
When we ran an operation to remove garimpeiros from the Amazon one sent me a
letter saying, 'Fine, Mr President, but how do you expect me to live now?'
Mr Collor said he was now far more confident of the Summit's success than he
had been a month ago, particularly since the confirmation this week that US
President George Bush would attend. 'It would have been a disaster if the US
had not been represented at the highest level,' he said.
He believes the importance of the conference cannot be overestimated. 'If we
continue as we are today, the planet will not survive the next 50 years.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: A banking bid based on a faulty premise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs JOE MCCUE and PETER MOLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is not clear how Prof Littler and Dr Ciancanelli of UMIST (Letters,
May 12) can legitimately discriminate with regard to the Midland takeover in
favour of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's 'international' bid. This is yet
another example of the discredited 1980s cross-border bank acquisition
mania. From the standpoint of Hongkong Bank shareholders, such an
acquisition is frankly a nonsense as the bank can perform its own
diversification without paying the penalty of a control premium.
Even without such costs, the 'international' bid lacks sense. The experience
of banks in international acquisitions has been devastatingly bad. Concepts
such as global networks and international connections are now thoroughly
discredited. To our knowledge, no research has demonstrated enhanced
economies of scale at the international level. In fact, quite the reverse:
real savings are best achieved in the 'in-market' situation. It is now
obvious that customers can easily 'unbundle' these so-called global services
to the detriment of international banking conglomerates. Because of poor
profitability, not least in their international networks, banks everywhere
are retreating to core or least-cost producer positions and ruthlessly
discarding poorly performing services. This is the change that is now
overdue in the UK banking sector and only now being undertaken, spurred on
by monumental loan losses in the current recession. The emphasis is on
cost-effective services as epitomised by the Lloyd's alternative. For
Hongkong Bank to take over Midland will do nothing for Midland's dismal
profit record. The rationalisation and job losses the international option
would seemingly avoid will happen none the less. Lloyd's bid has the virtue
that it can identify significant cost savings benefits from eliminating
Midland's overheads.
If Hongkong Bank wins due to the monopoly reason, it may yet dispose of the
retail operation after taking the cream investment banking business and once
it establishes its beachhead in Europe. Because its bid is based on a faulty
premise, it is merely postponing the inevitable restructuring of Midland
Bank. Fighting against valid market forces makes for strange bedfellows and
for long-term hangovers]

On Press night, even after several previews, Peter James's production of Joe
Orton's black comedy still looked like a beta-plus version of a
straight-alpha play. That isn't such very faint praise; if you had never
seen The Importance of Being Earnest, a goodish provincial staging might
still be a revelatory delight, and so may this Loot be.
Here, a scattering of small fluffs by the cast throughout the evening
suggested under-rehearsal, but also an early prospect of tightening-up. The
general Ortonesque tone was generally audible, which is to say that the
James cast knew well enough that Orton's diction is the heart of the matter.
Very few British plays this century have pulled themselves so completely
into the words, mocking and subversive in a self-contained, consistently
original vein. The casting is judicious, and the pacing deftly handled -
some momentary lapses, but a strong forward impulse with a fine accelerando
towards the end.
On the other hand, the producer has devised cute freeze-frames to begin and
end the acts, and saddled his murderous Nurse Fay (Dearbhla Molloy) with a
mechanical bottom-wiggle from the start: winsome vaudeville, nothing to do
with Orton. Ben Walden has been allowed and perhaps encouraged to play his
personable Hal 'sincere', down to a carefully demotic accent that takes the
edge off his best vicious lines. The preludial music - 'I Did It My Way' on
crematorium-organ - is nice, but the bundled cadaver of Hal's Mum is
ridiculously large and lightweight.
Miss Molloy allows herself too much Irish crooning, melodious lubrication of
lines that want scarifying down-to-earth candour. Colin Hurley captures
Hal's pal Dennis, the criminal undertaker's-assistant, with cooler
precision, though he is a bit over-age: it matters to the play that the
appalling Hal and Dennis are just streetwise adolescents. Nobody but Patrick
O'Connell's widowed McLeavy, baffled and beset, should speak with unguarded
feeling; O'Connell does that very well, but the improper competition - from
Hal and from Nurse Fay, and even from the egregious Truscott of the Yard -
denies him his proper effect. When his last unjust deserts should jolt us
beyond the provisional limits of the farce, they melt painlessly into the
general charade.
Inspector Truscott is the key role, and David Troughton plays him with
resourceful relish: not a line wasted nor an implication missed, the
transition from simple Agatha Christie bumbler to corrupt modern archetype
smoothly managed. Yet Troughton's basic comic persona gets in the way. He is
always vainly ingratiating, a hopeful wheedler, where the original West End
Truscott (Michael Bates, much missed) went through virtuoso switches from
flat Christie stereotype to sudden sadist - here, Troughton's duffing-up of
Hal carries nothing like the shock-value - to venal bribee. That made Loot
much nastier, and significantly funnier.

There are two schools of British Chekhov criticism. The former, and larger,
school says that there is too much Chekhov about in Britain, that the
British seldom get Chekhov 'right', and that the Russians are right to say
Chekhov is much funnier than the British know.
The other school says that the existence of a long British tradition of
Chekhov proves a real local sympathy for this author, that this tradition
has been responsible for numerous classic stagings of Chekhov's few plays
over the years, that the British may actually be no further from Chekhov
than the post-1917 Russians, and that Chekhov is tonic and stimulus to
British actors. I belong, you have rightly discerned, to the latter school.
Theatre Clwyd's production of The Seagull is the farewell staging there by
the theatre's artistic director Toby Robertson (who departs after seven
years' service). It has the interest of having Arkadina and her son
Konstantin played by Dorothy Tutin and her son Nick Waring; and Trigorin is
Ian Hogg.
The drama is alive, with a nice sense of Chekhov's serio-comic fluctuations.
Jeremy Brooks's English version, based on a translation by Susanna Hamnett,
is lively. Arkadina admits 'Well, of course, I do have some money. But I'm
an artiste. My make-up alone practically ruins me.'
Tutin, with her strange chestnuts-and-cream voice and delicate near-French
enunciation, hints lightly at the streaks in Arkadina that in other hands
have become egomania and rampant affectation. She is light even in absurd
extremes - even when she pushes Trigorin onto the floor and makes long,
verbal love to him: 'You have freshness] simplicity] healthy humour]'
Earlier, she tells him, metaphorically, 'You must sober up]' and then takes
a swig of alcohol herself. Hogg, however, makes Trigorin too blatantly a
charlatan. It becomes impossible to see what Nina idealises in him.
Waring, however, makes a good impression from the first as Konstantin and
gets better as the play proceeds, though I would like to see him the play
the role again in five years' time when he has more vocal presence. He
epitomises the major virtues of the production - and the slight weaknesses
that would drive the Brits-out Chekhovians crazy. On the one hand, he has
pacing, variety, feeling, sincerity; the way he keeps shifting the mood in
every speech and dialogue is admirable. On the other, we don't sense
Konsantin's underlying temperament forcefully enough.
As Sorin, Ronald Fraser looks like Verdi in extreme old age, drawls his
vowels and mushes his consonants; 'tragedy' is pronounced 'chrairshedeh.'
Both he and Lucinda Curtis as Polina are too predictable, too fond of
turning their roles into stock types.
Nina and Masha are much more interestingly conceived by Catherine Cusack and
Lucy Scott as contrasting examples of young womanhood, but neither
interpretation has quite settled into focus yet. The most perfectly judged
interpretation of all is Bernard Lloyd as Doctor Dorin, elegant and ironic.
He finds time, as no one else onstage does, just to take in atmosphere; and
we feel life itself passing by.
The staging works beautifully on its own delicate terms. Other stagings have
more drive, more neurosis and, above all, more sense of the accidental
details of life passing in the background. If there is a single fault I
would find, however, it is that too many speeches are made bang in the
centre of the stage. The fascination of Chekhov lies in asymmetry.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: A deliciously scandalous painter - Fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVER a painter had the luck of the gods, it was Henri Gervex. Son of a
Montmartre piano-maker, Gervex floated up through French society with the
effortlessness of Montgolfier's balloon. At his death in 1929 Gervex was
wealthy and fabulously well-connected. His daughter had married into the
aristocracy, and his paintings graced some of the grandest dining-rooms in
Europe.
Now, in a modest way, the Gervex balloon is once more on the way up, thanks
to an exhibition which has just opened in Bordeaux. (Next year, it travels
to Paris and Nice.) There has never been a retrospective of the great
arriviste, so tracking his canvasses to the homes of private collectors has
meant a good deal of sleuthing for the show's organisers. Not, however, that
Gervex is a totally unknown painter - above all, not in Bordeaux.
For half a century, 'Rolla', the large, frothy scene of the morning-after in
a cheap hotel, has been the most popular painting in the museum's collection
 -and star of the postcard sales, far surpassing Titian, Veronese and even
Delacroix's 'Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi'. There was a nasty moment
when it seemed that the newly created Musee d'Orsay might reclaim the
State's deposit, as it had every right to do. But Paris, mindful for once of
local sensibilities, stayed its hand.
Gervex was 26 in 1878 when he exhibited 'Rolla', unquestionably his
masterpiece, in the Salon. Already, he was well and truly launched after
winning a medal for the horribly squirming, but academically impeccable,
'Satyr playing with a Bacchante', which showed him to be every inch the
faithful pupil of the great Cabanel. But with 'Rolla', Gervex showed himself
to be now a true believer in Manet's gospel that artists must paint modern
life.
His nude, however, is no 'Olympia', the painting which over a decade before
had caused such a scandal. There was no risk of Gervex ever reneging on the
academic doctrine of ideal beauty of form in the matter of nudes. Throughout
his life, as we see in the upstairs rooms of the exhibition, paintings of
meltingly boneless nudes - usually redheads - were one of his stand-bys. In
old age, Gervex the dinosaur even reverted to Cabanalesque goddesses lolling
on the tops of waves.
It was with 'Rolla', however, that Gervex showed his uncanny gift for public
relations. It was banned as immoral, for reasons well explained by Hollis
Clayson in her interesting study of prostitution in French 19th-century
painting, 'Painted Vice' (Yale University Press). A prostitute in her
corset, like Manet's 'Nana', was tolerable; discarded corsets and
petticoats, with Monsieur Rolla's walking stick pointing at a provocative
angle, were quite another.
Undaunted, Gervex put it on exhibition in the Chaussee d'Antin; le tout
Paris was invited to see, and for weeks the street was filled with
carriages. Gervex was now a deliciously scandalous painter, in addition to
being a perfectly delightful human being. In the 1880s and '90s, Gervex was
irrepressible. The older generation of Impressionists loved him for his
raffishness.
Early success meant he could afford a famous mistress, Madame Valtesse de la
Bigne, whom we see in a large and glibly sub-Manet open-air portrait. He
thoughtfully introduced her to Zola, researching the background for his
immortal prostitute, Nana. Another little scandal, when he exhibited a
painting of a nude wearing a velvet mask, helped his reputation. Everyone
wanted to know whose wife she was, and a count sueing his sister for her
inheritance said she had been the sitter . . .
Gervex's industry was prodigious and he would never turn down a prestigious
commission, no matter how boring the subject. A brilliant stroke in 1889 was
to join up with the Belgian artist, Alfred Stevens, and paint a gigantic
'Panorama of the History of the Century', shown here in a modest copy from
Brussels.
Gervex had now shown himself as the republican patriot, honouring the
Revolution. People flocked to see it, and when a buyer did not come forward,
small pieces were given to each of the financial backers.
Clearly, here was the right artist to execute vast murals for public
commissions, such as still survive in the Hall of Weddings at the mairie of
the XIX arrondissement and the ceiling of the buffet of the Gare de Lyons.
Onwards and ever upwards, Gervex painted millionaire's salons and ceilings
for the Elysees Palace. In the Belle Epoque years, his undoubted talent for
painting electric light made him favoured choice for showing high society
dining in the Bois de Boulogne.
Portraits were bread and butter to Gervex, although he showed no very great
talent for them. Singer Sargent's bravura effects always eluded him. But
even as his commissions took him into the highest ranks of society - even
the Russian Royal Family, he still paid homage to early days. He was still,
a 'painter of modern life', follower - at however far a distance - of Degas
and Manet. Hence, we still find him painting scenes such as the wistful
cocotte, umbrella on the table, who anxiously awaits her companion for the
night in a smart restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne.
This is a hugely enjoyable exhibition, even though of a painter who rarely
rose above third-rate. Only now and then is he better than that, for
example, in oil sketches of his wife nursing their daughter or asleep on the
deck of the splendiferous yacht of the American tycoon, James Gordon Bennet.
The book accompanying the show will delight all who love the Belle Epoque,
and is rich above all in the contributions made by Gervex's great-grandson.
And do keep your eyes skinned; propped in a cellar, or hanging in some
drawingroom, you just might happen to see a nude in a black velvet mask or a
Nana look-alike dressing in a theatre loge . . . There are many Gervexes yet
to be unearthed; with a vengeance, the arriviste master is coming in from
the cold.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: 'Coriolanus' at Chichester - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chichester Festival has begun its 30th anniversary season with a
thoroughly enjoyable Renaissance Theatre production of Coriolanus in which
some of the minor parts outshine the stars.
Quite the most memorable aspect is the crowd scenes where the theatre has
had the bright idea of drawing on the local population. The result is a
goodly crew of about 70 extras, playing alternately the people of Rome and
the supporters of Tullus Aufidius. They do not look like a Roman mob or even
remotely urban. They tend to be armed with pitchforks and hoes and are
perhaps more convincing when playing the Volsces who come from the more
rural community.
Nevertheless, to have a cast of 70 enthusiastic volunteers at your disposal
is a considerable asset. They have been marshalled well in Tim Supple's
production. The effect, which is crucial to Coriolanus, is to show that the
power of the people matters, if only because there are so many of them. The
populace may make the wrong decisions and be demonstrably fickle in its
judgments, but without the people there would be no power struggle and no
play.
The other outstanding achievement is the role of the two tribunes, played by
Jimmy Yuill and Gerrard Horan. They are the men who manipulate the people of
Rome. Supple's production scores again in underlining their pivotal
position. They may be working-class politicians with an eye for the main
chance, but they are not wholly self-interested. The Roman patricians
respect their power, even if they dislike their origins and aspirations.
Coriolanus himself, remember, is neither patrician nor lower class. He looks
down on the plebs with a contempt that the patricians would never express in
public. This delicate balance of political forces is beautifully caught.
Coriolanus observes when he enters the land of the Volsces 'A goodly city is
this Antium', and so it turns out to be. Certainly it is far more relaxed,
and possibly more civilised, than Rome. The problem is that it is
overshadowed by Roman power, just as Tullus Aufidius is overshadowed as a
warrior by Coriolanus. Yet here again is an example of the smaller parts
rising to the occasion. Iain Glen's Tullus has just the right touch of an
inferiority complex and even the faint sound of a West country accent.
Coriolanus is played by Kenneth Branagh. He does nothing wrong, except
perhaps that he should look more attractive. The tight-fitting leather
trousers are a mistake. On the whole, one admires the way he lets the
production and the play speak for themselves without trying to steal the
show. Equally, Richard Briers does everything he should as Menenius without
being obtrusive.
There is a caveat about Judi Dench as Volumnia. She is in danger of becoming
a bit of a gorgon. In this production she is a frightful badgerer. Indeed
one is inclined to think that the last person Coriolanus would want to give
way to is a mother like this. Supple should tell her to calm down: a bit
more Roman dignity and less of the militant female.

Another milestone in the onward march of multimedia will be passed in
September with the worldwide launch of Kodak's much-trumpeted Photo CD
system - conversion of 35mm photographs to digital images for display on
televisions or personal computers.
By then, two years will have passed since Kodak announced the system, but
William Jack, vice-president for worldwide electronic imaging systems and
consumer imaging, stresses the US company has not been twiddling its thumbs.
What was a concept, based on an intensive 18-month effort pulling together
all the technologies within Kodak, has become a product, with the help of
know-how and hardware from outside the company.
In the intervening period Kodak has been talking to software suppliers,
hardware manufacturers and systems integrators to establish the Photo CD
standard.
'There are no obstacles to the broadest participation by photographic and
consumer electronics companies in this one standard,' says Jack.
The consumer wishing to playback photos, new or old, via Photo CD will be
able to choose between three Kodak Photo CD players manufactured by Philips
in Belgium. But the disks and players will be widely available through the
licensing of Kodak software and the Photo CD trademark.
'You'll be able to read Fuji Photo CD on a disk, and all our photographic
competitors will be aboard at the outset,' says Jack.
For the computer market, which Jack sees as equally important and in many
cases overlapping, the ease of access and use of Photo CD is particularly
important, and is being addressed through Kodak's Photo CD Access
development toolkit and software. Kodak's discussions have been helped by
the computer industry's need for something new to boost flagging revenues.
In the high street, photographers will be able to pay Pounds 4.99 for a
special Photo CD disk, and Pounds 7.95 for having 24 exposures written
digitally on to it. Further exposures can be added, up to a maximum of 100.
The Kodak Photo CD players will cost Pounds 299, Pounds 369, and Pounds 429
in the UK, and can also play audio CDs.
Ravi Khanna, the UK product manager for Photo CD, believes the mid-priced
model, which has extra functions such as zoom, crop and rotate, will prove
the most popular.
The Kodak system, along with other adventures into multimedia, has
inevitably raised questions about consumer reaction. The advantage of the
Kodak system is the simplicity of the system and the fact that the camera
itself - and the routine visits to high street kiosks to get the film
developed - is unaffected.
Whether consumers will pay to watch still pictures via Photo CD players when
they could watch moving pictures via camcorders remains to be seen. Jack is
increasingly confident that they will, but Kodak has also been careful to
'future-proof' its investment - the picture quality is four times the
standard that will be required for HDTV.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology: Square pegs in round holes - Judy Dempsey finds
the Russian tank industry facing difficulties adjusting to civilian life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, employees at the Lenin Engine Factory in Chelyabinsk, a
sprawling, industrial city in the Urals, made tanks and tractors.
The plant, part of a complex of enterprises set up by Stalin in the late
1920s, was in a privileged position. Money flowed in from the ministry of
defence of the former Soviet Union to support a sector which was designed to
turn the Soviet Union into a great superpower.
Today morale at Lenin is low. Some of the production lines of an enterprise
which employs 45,000 workers are making equipment for invalids.
As part of bilateral agreements in arms reductions between the US and the
former Soviet Union, and unilateral reductions on the part of the Russian
side, the factory can no longer afford to roll tanks off the production
lines.
Funds, and orders from the ministry of defence, have been sharply reduced.
Many at the factory are asking what impact these arms reductions will have
on their jobs. Indeed, many are asking if it is really possible to convert
tanks into wheelchairs.
Oleg Guz, the 36-year-old manager of the tractor floor, recalls how the
factory used to manufacture between 250-300 tanks a year. Now, he says, the
assembly lines have to concentrate on making tractors, and finding ways to
turn excess capacity into civilian projects.
'We have stopped making complete tanks here,' explained Guz. 'However, we
are continuing to make parts for tanks, such as engines. The tanks are
assembled at another plant. I cannot tell you how many engines the (Russian)
ministry of defence have asked us to make for 1992. This is still classified
information.'
The plant first started the process of converting military equipment to
civilian projects in 1989. But Guz said it could take three years to
complete the conversion. 'There is no method in the conversion. There is no
clear sense of direction from the central authorities. I suppose we will
have to rely on our own resources in the future, and keep whatever profits
we make in the factory itself,' he added.
Even if the plant continued to make tanks and weaponry, Guz now recognises
how the international market for such machinery has become competitive. The
performance of western tanks in the Gulf war was a salutary lesson for
Russia's military establishment.
'It was embarrassing for us. When we were producing the tanks, we were just
following orders. We had no information on the levels of western superiority
and quality. We now realise we have to produce goods which are marketable.
That's why we need some joint ventures with western firms. We need a sense
of direction,' said Guz.
Yuri Disilov, who has worked in the plant for 31 years, shares the same
sense of uncertainty. 'We never had to think about the future. Everything
was controlled by the centre,' he says.'
Because of this uncertainty, the Russian government has earmarked credit and
financial assistance for the sector. Andrei Nechaev, Russia's economy
minister, explained how soft credits would be lent to certain enterprises
specialising in the production of military equipment.
'To activate the process of conversion, we are going to lend Rb 42bn to some
enterprises. This money will be used for special projects related only to
conversion. All enterprises which do not have orders from the state will
have to convert, or else they will have to be closed,' explained Nechaev.
State expenditure for purchasing arms in 1992 have been reduced by 50 per
cent.
The minister added that the Russian government could not ignore the social
repercussions arising from conversion, or the sharp reductions in arms
production.
'Conversion brings lots of social problems. Sometimes, whole towns are based
solely on production of military equipment. If you stop production, you stop
the whole life of the town.
In order to guarantee some level of wages, and to cover social expenses,
such as hospitals, housing and kindergartens which in the past have been
partly financed by the profits of these enterprises, the government has
already allocated Rb 40bn from this year's budget.
But for the workers at the Lenin Engine Factory in Chelyabinsk, Moscow, the
seat of the Russian government, this is a long way off.
Sergei Mukharkin, co-chairman of the Union of Workers, an independent trade
union, explained that sections of the management are not prepared to respond
to the changes sweeping through Russian society.
'The situation here in the enterprises is confusing,' said Mukharkin. 'Our
union knows that some of the management - still the same old communists
because there has been no change in the personnel yet - are actually
increasing the workers wages. This is pushing up the rate of inflation. I
reckon this is an attempt to undermine the government's reforms,' said
Mukharkin.
He added that some workers have been forced to sign contracts agreeing to a
shorter working week - with a corresponding cut in wages. 'If they don't
sign the contracts, they will get the sack,' he said.
These claims confirm not only the sense of uncertainty and confusion hanging
over the military-industrial sector as it tries to come to terms with the
collapse of the Soviet Union, reductions in the defence budget and the need
to convert and find markets for their products. They indicate potential
areas of social unrest for a Russian government which is committed to a
reduction in military production and spending.

FT  15 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Paris: a tale of two halves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is trying to tilt the city's axis to the east in an effort to
spread wealth to a deprived part of the capital, which suffers from
industrial dereliction and the concentration of decision-makers in the west.
To help the process, it is prepared to move one of its key government
ministries to the east. But the project's momentum is threatened by the poor
state of the market after a fall-off of demand and a surge in building
following a relaxation of controls.
The description fits both London and Paris. This tale of two cities contains
many parallels, although the contrasts are perhaps even more striking.
Tax incentives and laissez-faire planning policies have been at the heart of
developing London's east end in recent years. The development of Paris,
however, is being forged by a policy of interventionism, extravagant
government gestures and partnerships between the public and private sectors.
As with London, the need to regenerate eastern Paris was recognised by the
authorities in the 1970s. But it was not until 1983 that the Council of
Paris drew up its planned programme for east Paris. The proposals have been
reinforced with the region's structure plan, the Livre Blanc, published in
1990, and blueprints drawn up by Mr Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris,
which featured 'Zacs' - partnerships between the public and private sectors.
Both London and Paris have been confronted with the challenge of changing
the image of their eastern districts. In spite of being close to the heart
of Paris, the eastern arrondissements of the city have more than their share
of urban blight, poor housing and high unemployment. Although the eastern
arrondissements are not as cut off from the centre as London's Docklands,
there is a need for improved transport. A new metro will be completed by
1996, cutting the journey from Bercy to Gare St Lazare from 20 to 6 1/2
minutes.
In Paris, some grand projects, most notably the new opera house built on the
site of the old Bastille railway station, created a wave of publicity.
Yet more publicity was generated with the launch of the Seine Rive Gauche
development, a new business district which will eventually stretch along
both banks of the Seine in the 12th and 13th arrondissements.
Developers are also trying to inject some life into the area. Bercy village,
which is due to be completed in the next two years, is a shopping district
located in renovated wine warehouses and their vaulted cellars, with more
than 100 restaurants and boutiques.
Perhaps the most significant development has been Euro-Disney, 32km to the
east. Many French people are sceptical about its influence, but its
supporters believe that the publicity before its opening earlier this year
and the sheer number of visitors will be a huge boost to the eastern side.
The government has moved its ministry of finance from the Louvre to a huge
edifice in Bercy. In spite of the architectural merits of the Bercy
premises, the move was not welcomed by officials. 'It is rather like taking
the UK home office to Croydon (in south London),' says Mr Robert Waterland,
president of surveyors Jones Lang Wootton, Paris.
Bercy has yet to win the hearts of Parisians. Changing the character of an
area and the preconceptions of its citizens takes time. The growth of the
east will also be affected by the fall in the Paris property market. 'The
east is in danger of losing its economic edge,' says Mr Waterland.
The Seine Rive Gauche scheme resulted in a bout of speculative fever in
1988-89. 'In anticipation of the success of the project, developers were
quick to buy sites in surrounding areas, trusting that the idea of a new
office pole would be enough to attract occupiers. In a less buoyant market,
however, take-up has been lower than expected,' says Jones Lang Wootton.
If the intention of moving the finance ministry to Bercy was to establish a
new financial district in the area, the task is likely to be a lengthy one.
Societe Generale, the French bank, had been interested in relocating to
another development area on the left bank of the Seine, but it could not
reach agreement on the price of land and so decided to move to La Defense.
But it would be a mistake to underestimate the government's powers of
persuasion. While the UK government has used rates holidays and tax breaks -
with mixed success - to develop London's Docklands, the French government
has rather more direct influence over company relocations. Tenants need to
win official approval before they take on large amounts of new space.
Moreover, developments on the western side of Paris are being discouraged.
In 1988 Mr Michel Rocard, then prime minister, announced measures to favour
the less sought-after eastern suburbs of Paris, away from the popular area
of La Defense.
'Ten years from now it will be comparable to La Defense,' says Mr
Jean-Pierre Hennequet, managing director of the New Bercy project, which
comprises Bercy village along with 50,000 square metres of offices, a food
and drink trade centre, a hotel, conference centre and cinema in the old
wine district.
The comparison is pertinent. Indeed when London and Paris compare notes, the
parallel is usually drawn is between La Defense and Docklands.
La Defense, like London's Docklands, is seen as a less expensive alternative
to the central business district and, like Docklands, it has not always had
an easy ride. However, there the similarities end. The French government has
had a hands-on involvement with the project, most notably with its generous
provision of transport links.
The origins of La Defense date back to President Georges Pompidou, who was
keen to develop a business capital, partly, it was said, in a bid to
accommodate the offices of the European Community.
The plan was slow to get off the ground. 'After the oil slump of the 1970s
it was a disaster,' says Mr Colin Bird of DTZ, the international agency of
surveyors Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. 'We were trying to let buildings at
rents that would cover the service charges.'
Since then La Defense has taken off: it is prestigious, well connected and
cheaper than the central business district, where the typical office
building is more than 100-years-old and lacks large floor spaces and
air-conditioning. 'It has a good image, better than the Golden Triangle (the
area at the heart of Paris) in some respects,' says Mr Jean-Pierre Pajon of
Gleeds, a long established UK firm of quantity surveyors in Paris.
When the US brokers Salomons visited La Defense it was impressed with its
list of prestigious tenants. 'If Brussels is the political capital of
Europe, then La Defense is the corporate capital of modern Europe,' it
concluded.
La Defense is not to everyone's taste. It is often described as a concrete
jungle; many Parisians shudder at the idea of living there, even though it
has some 200 shops, 20 restaurants and nine cinemas.
The most recent example of government intervention in Paris is the Grande
Arche de la Defense. This hollowed-out cube would easily accommodate Notre
Dame and its towers. Its alignment with I M Pei's glass pyramid in the
courtyard of the Louvre museum, the obelisk of the Place de la Concorde and
the Arc de Triomphe adds to its monumental qualities.
In spite of its emphasis on the development of the east, the French
government has not turned its back on La Defense. In August 1990 it unveiled
a Fr10bn urban development scheme that will double La Defense's area and
extend the thoroughfare starting at the Louvre a further two miles past La
Defense. The emphasis will be on housing.
Paris is currently an unlikely model of planning and development. The city
has been hit hard by the slump in the property market, following temporary
planning deregulation in the mid-1980s which led to an increase in supply.
None the less vacancy rates are among the lowest of any European capital at
less than 5 per cent. And by avoiding the laissez-faire policies of other
European markets, Paris has escaped the peaks and troughs of the US and UK.
On current evidence, the regeneration of the French capital's eastern
districts is likely to be more successful than the comparable efforts in
London.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A CALL for state funding of political parties and limits on parties'
national spending on the general election headed the agenda as Mrs Margaret
Beckett, shadow chief secretary, launched her election address for the
Labour party deputy leadership yesterday.
Campaigning, like others, on a platform of modernising the party, Mrs
Beckett promised that her first priority as deputy leader would be to set up
policy forums as a way of giving individual party members a greater say in
formulating policy.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, as part of his leadership
campaign, put forward a vigorous defence of the role of the public sector
delivering services. He also criticised the government's approach to
compulsory competitive tendering.
In a speech to the Fire Brigade Union's annual conference, Mr Gould said
that Labour should 'loudly proclaim that there are some services that can
only be done properly within the public sector,' while maintaining pressure
on the services to improve.
Nominations for the Labour party's shadow cabinet elections and a contest
for the posts of chief whip and parliamentary party chairman are to go ahead
before the leadership is settled.
With an early summer recess expected soon after the leadership contest
finishes on July 18, senior officers of the PLP have decided to bring both
processes forward to avoid delays.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Fox ousts Onslow on 1922 committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN assertion of independence by new Tory MPs largely explains the ousting
last night of Mr Cranley Onslow as chairman of the Conservatives'
influential 1922 backbench committee.
Sir Marcus Fox, the Conservative MP for Shipley, upset forecasts to become
chairman of the committee of 'men in grey suits' that keeps the prime
minister informed of backbench opinion.
He is understood to have won the overwhelming support of the Tories who won
seats on April 9.
They were unimpressed by discreet pressure from government whips to support
Mr Onslow or by his eight years' experience.
One new MP said: 'I think that we felt it was a rather stuffy organisation
which needed a breath of fresh air.'
Sir Marcus, 64, is an affable Tory who will not shy from media interviews.
He described his victory as 'another step in the process of change which has
taken place since the general election'.
He said that with the Tory majority cut to 21 it was crucial that
backbenchers' views were conveyed to the prime minister and chief whip.
'I will be knocking on the doors of 10 Downing Street from time to time.'
Mr Onslow, 65, the MP for Woking, had promised he would not stand for
re-election next year but said it would be wrong to rush to replace him.
But he faced criticism for being a low-profile, taciturn chairman and for
failing to stop a Labour MP becoming the Commons' Speaker after the general
election.
He was also attacked for not conveying backbench opinion to Mrs Margaret
Thatcher in the run up to her resignation as prime minister in 1990.
Sir Marcus is regarded as a populist rightwinger who campaigned discreetly
but actively, particularly among the new intake.
His victory coincided with a strong performance by the right wing
Conservative '92 group in elections for the 1922 executive committee.
Among the successful candidates was Mr John Townend, Tory MP for Bridlington
and Euro-sceptic.
Mr Onslow was a old-school Tory, happy with traditional procedures. The
votes in the 1922 elections are not published, for instance.
One minister agreed that he was, 'good at the frosty answers'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major issues stern warning on
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister yesterday warned the cabinet that this year's
public-spending round would be especially tight.
Details of Mr Major's caution to his colleagues were released as it emerged
that Mr Michael Portillo, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, will call
in 14 ministers for unprecedented talks on departmental budgets soon after
Whitsun.
Mr Major's warning, at the end of a 75-minute cabinet meeting, was clearly a
deliberate effort to dampen expectations of extra departmental funding as
the costs of high unemployment bite into exchequer revenues.
Downing Street took the unusual step of relaying his message yesterday,
adding that the prime minister had said it was 'right for the chief
secretary to examine all spending proposals very rigorously'.
While such admonitions are not unusual, Mr Major's efforts to lend his
weight to his chief secretary and Mr Portillo's move to call in ministers -
months before the final round of bilateral negotiations in September -
underline the high level of concern.
On Wednesday Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, insisted in a Commons debate
on the economy that he was sticking to his forecast of a Pounds 28bn
public-borrowing target this year.
Speculation has been mounting among City analysts, though, that that, along
with next year's Pounds 32bn figure, may have to be revised upwards.
Mr Major is determined that borrowing should be reduced sufficiently to
allow room for further income tax cuts towards the end of this parliament.
But with yesterday's unemployment level showing 2.7m jobless, there are
doubts whether a forecast average rate of 2.4m for the current financial
year can be achieved.
For every 100,000 jobless over that figure, the government must find Pounds
330m to cover unemployment and other benefits this year, rising to Pounds
360m in 1994-95.
Civil servants now privately concede that the strain on the social security
budget is substantially higher than first expected.
The official word remains that there is no spending crisis, but rather that
departments are being made aware of the insistence on good housekeeping.
Efforts are under way to speed up the implementation of policies to contract
out public-sector services and push through privatisation plans.
A leaked letter from Mr Portillo to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
earlier this month illustrated how ministers are also under pressure to
improve productivity in their departments.
Ministers are expected to have filed their bids for departmental budgets by
about the end of this month. After their meetings with the chief secretary
after Whitsun, the horse trading will begin in earnest after the summer
recess and be completed in September before the autumn statement in early
November.
If ministers fail to reach agreement with Mr Portillo, they will face the
humiliation of going to the so-called Star Chamber, where senior Cabinet
ministers adjudicate on disputed issues. The last meeting was in 1986.

FOREIGN Office papers, held for more than 30 years but so far unpublished,
could be released under a review announced by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary.
An internal committee will be set up to look at papers, including documents
on Nazi deputy leader Rudolf Hess, but there were no indications that any
particular papers would be released. The review is part of the government's
promise to increase openness.
Mr Hurd said: 'The culture of secrecy went too wide. The presumption should
be that information is released unless there are compelling and substantive
reasons of national interest to withhold it.'
The Foreign Office refused, though, to confirm whether the review had yet
been set up or who would chair it. An official would said only that it would
be carried out by the Foreign Office's library and record department, headed
by Mr Richard Bone.
Mr Hurd said the government had made progress in eliminating secrecy.
Criticisms of the 1989 Official Secrets Act had been misplaced.
'Fevered imaginations produced predictions of authors restrained, silence
imposed and editors jailed. Nothing of the sort has happened. On the
contrary, news has spread through Whitehall that secrecy for its own sake is
no longer a virtue,' he said.
But he dismissed calls for a Freedom of Information Act as 'a mechanistic
approach to reform which produces conflict rather than progress'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher to cite fears of
federalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, will today set out her
fears over the European Community's institutions and moves to federalism in
a speech her aides said should avoid an explicit intervention into
Conservative MPs' rows over the Maastricht treaty.
Underlining tensions over the Commons' debate on Maastricht next week, Mr
Roger Knapman, Tory MP for Stroud, last night lost his job as unpaid
parliamentary private secretary to defence minister Mr Archie Hamilton,
after telling government whips he could not support the treaty. Such strict
discipline before, rather than after, a vote is rare at Westminster.
Mrs Thatcher's high-profile address in The Hague will include some praise
for Mr John Major, and is expected to steer clear of direct references to
his handling of the Maastricht deal. But she will be sharply critical of the
federal ambitions of Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
Ministers, however, will be braced for coded messages in Mrs Thatcher's
words and for her stepping into the Conservative party's battles when she
answers questions afterwards.
Speaking in Munich yesterday, Mrs Thatcher said that the former Soviet Union
and eastern Europe were part of a trend away from centralised bureaucracy
and towards co-operation between national governments.
'It is for individual countries to decide what powers they cede to the
(European) Community,' she said at a meeting of the International Securities
Market Association.
Her aides said that today's speech to the European Research Centre was 'not
a parochial speech about Britain' but a 'thoughtful' consideration of Europe
in a world context. She is expected to put particular emphasis on promoting
economic prosperity through world trade.
Mrs Thatcher will not shrink from renewing her traditional attack on the
erosion of the sovereignty of national parliaments and on the aspirations of
Mr Delors.
Mr Major provided some encouragement to Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons
yesterday by saying that Britain would not accept EC proposals to remove
border controls under the single European market.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Councils face delay over budget targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL tax looks likely to run into trouble in its first year because
the announcement of next year's overall local-government spending will
probably be delayed.
Meanwhile, ministers faced criticism when Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, announced that the government intended to 'cap' 10 councils'
spending this year.
Each July the government usually announces the maximum amount it believes
local government should spend in the following financial year (total
standard spending) and the total amount of external support through
government grant and the business rate. This year, though, The Department of
the Environment believes the statement may be delayed until October.
The likelihood of a hold-up is being interpreted as a sign of how tight the
coming public spending round will be.
Environment ministers consider it vital to secure a reasonable revenue
support grant for next year so that the first year of the council tax does
not produce the sharp rises in bills that bedevilled the first year of the
poll tax.
One difficulty is that ministers still lack detailed information about the
tax base for the council tax, under which bills will be based largely on the
value of property in one of eight bands. The valuation exercise is not
expected to be completed until the end of next month at the earliest. Until
its results are available, ministers will have difficulty in knowing the
scale of the transitional relief scheme they will want to put in place.
A further complication is that the extra money to go to local authorities to
take account of their new duties in providing community care has yet to be
decided.
The government is still considering whether to prohibit councils from
spending the grant on other services.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government spokesman, said that the
Department of the Environment and the Treasury were 'locked in a battle
which will leave local government the loser'.
In the Commons, Tory and opposition MPs alike criticised the environment
secretary's decision to cap the 10 councils' spending.
Mr Howard said the move would mean reductions in the average poll tax in the
10 areas from Pounds 58 a payer in Basildon to Pounds 3 a payer in
Gloucester, benefiting 1.8m payers. The councils have 28 days to challenge
the decision.
Tory backbenchers were among those who warned that the limits on spending
would mean cuts in services.
The Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities condemned the
capping arrangements. When provisional capping criteria were set, the
association said, that led almost all the other authorities to cut their
budgets to avoid being capped.
Mr Alan Howarth and Mr James Pawsey, Tory MPs for Stratford-on-Avon and for
Rugby and Kenilworth respectively, joined Labour colleagues for Warwickshire
in urging Mr Howard to relax the cap on Warwickshire.
Mr Pawsey warned of the risk of 'a strongly adverse effect on the services
being offered'.
Mr Howard said he would look carefully at any representations made to him
about the impact of standard spending assessments on capping, and that they
were continually kept under review.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Astra skill centre cuts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUCPS Civil Service union reacted angrily yesterday to the news that
Astra Training Services, which took over the bulk of the 60 skill centres
privatised in 1990, had announced to staff a further three rounds of
closures and redundancies.
Rochdale, Somerset and Redmouth centres are to close, and other redundancies
totalling 70 were announced. That follows the announcement four weeks ago of
the closure of three centres and 162 redundancies.
'This tactic of announcing such closures is roundly condemned by the NUCPS,'
said Tony Gallagher, national officer of the union, which is in annual
conference at Blackpool. 'It's not the first time but the third consecutive
mid-conference announcement when the union officials are away from the
workplace.'
He further condemned the government underfunding of employment training,
which Astra considers the reason for such cuts.
'Privatisation has been disastrous for the providers and those in need of
training. It's a national disgrace that should be condemned by all.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Pricing gap emerges in bank fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME HIGH street banks' charges to small-business customers are
substantially higher than their rivals', according to a survey of banking
business charges published by the consultancy Rochester Research.
The pricing gap is particularly wide between Lloyds and Midland, the two
banks locked in a takeover battle. Lloyds emerges as the most expensive bank
for small businesses and Midland the cheapest.
The survey was carried out in bank branches in Kent but its findings are
valid for the UK as a whole.
Rochester says some Lloyds small-business customers would save at least 20
per cent if they banked with Midland. It has forwarded a copy of its report
to the Office of Fair Trading, which is considering whether to refer Lloyds'
bid for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Lloyds said yesterday it was unfair to compare its prices with Midland's
when predicting what customers of a merged bank might pay two years from
now.
'We have made it clear that the kind of cost savings which would then be
possible would clearly benefit the customer,' Lloyds said.
The bank declined to say why its charges were higher than those of the other
banks.
The survey says a small business with 80 transactions on its account each
month would find itself paying Pounds 39.50 a quarter more in charges if it
banked with Lloyds rather than Midland.
For a customer writing 60 cheques a month, paying six bills by standing
order and another six by direct debit, and receiving eight credits, Lloyds
would charge Pounds 187.50 compared with Midland's Pounds 147.90.
The charges of the other big clearers are closer to Midland than Lloyds. A
NatWest customer would pay Pounds 159.60 for identical services and a
Barclays customer Pounds 156.20.
Lloyds scores better than other banks with its Premier Interest Account, in
which businesses can hold funds.

<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL Market Foundation, a think tank founded by supporters of the now
defunct Social Democratic party, will be relaunched today with the backing
of Mr David Sainsbury, one of Britain's wealthiest businessmen and a leading
supporter of the SDP until its demise.
The foundation will promote discussion of social policy in the framework of
a capitalist market economy.
The social market ideas espoused by Christian Democrats in Europe have
attracted increasing interest among Conservative thinkers such as Mr Chris
Patten.
The foundation's new board includes two Conservative MPs who entered the
Commons at the last election after serving as advisers to the prime
minister: Mrs Judith Chaplin, who was Mr Major's private secretary, and Mr
David Willetts, who was director of studies at the Centre for Policy
Studies, the Conservative think tank founded by Lord Joseph and Mrs
Thatcher.
Mr Andrew Tyrie, a former Treasury adviser who worked for Mr Nigel Lawson
and Mr Major, also joins the board.
The board includes a wide range of other interests, including Mr Samuel
Brittan, an assistant editor of the Financial Times, Professor John Kay of
the London Business School and Ms Sue Slipman of the National Council for
One-Parent Families.
Reflecting the drift of many leading lights of the SDP towards Mr John
Major's Conservative party, the foundation will be chaired by Lord
Skidelsky, an SDP life peer who has recently taken the Conservative whip in
the Lords.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLECTION of local taxes and the payment of benefits is to be contracted
out to the private sector by East Cambridgeshire district council, in one of
the first successful competitive tender for a local-authority white-collar
function.
The council sought competitive tenders for the collection of poll tax and
business rates - and council tax when that is introduced next year  - and
the payment of housing benefit and poll tax benefit. The contract, worth
Pounds 3.5m over five years, has been awarded to Capita Group from this
month.
The council's 23 revenue collection and benefits staff have chosen to
transfer to Capita, and the service will continue to be provided from the
existing premises. If service targets are exceeded, Capita will be paid a
performance bonus. If standards are not met, their fee will be reduced.
Capita already works under contract for more than 20 local councils in
chasing up poll tax payments by phone, but this is the first contract
involving the entire revenue collection and benefits payment service.
Competitive tendering is due to be extended to a wide range of council
professional and technical services under legislation passed in the last
parliament. Details of the scope of such contracting out and the timetable
are due to be announced soon, after officials have considered more than 500
submissions on a consultative paper issued last autumn.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Approach to debts criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies, utilities and local authorities are exacerbating
consumer debt troubles by their heavy-handed and inflexible approach,
according to the National Consumer Council.
In its annual survey of advice centres, the government-funded council says
that difficulties over paying for essential services such as water, housing
and fuel form a high proportion of cases requiring help.
The troubles brought to advice agencies are often linked in cycles that are
difficult to break. For example, people who have difficulty in paying bills
may be asked for a deposit in advance, which they cannot afford.
The council points out that consumers on low incomes often have to pay more
for essential services such as gas and electricity.
Pre-payment meters, which are helpful to consumers on a limited income, are
more expensive than quarterly billing.
The National Consumer Council also blames suppliers and local authorities
for delays and errors that posed further obstacles to consumers. The
collection of the poll tax has been particularly difficult, with confusing
billing methods and unclear instructions.
The recession appears to be leading to a tightening-up on debt collection
procedures, according to the survey. The council gives a warning that lack
of understanding and inflexibility about renegotiating repayments often made
debt delays worse.
The council concludes that 'with a little patience, understanding and with
sensible budgeting, most consumer debts can be repaid'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Anger at BCCI allegation by MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Abu Dhabi majority shareholders of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International reacted angrily yesterday to allegations made in the
House of Commons naming a senior adviser in the sheikdom as having benefited
from fraudulent transactions.
The allegations made by Mr Keith Vaz, the Labour MP for Leicester East,
named Mr Ghanem Faris Al Mazrui, one of the most senior advisers to Sheikh
Zayed bin Sultan al-Nayhan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, as having gained from a
'no risk' share deal.
The claims had been made before in the Section 41 Report on the BCCI fraud
prepared by Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors. The report prompted the
Bank of England's closure action on July 5 last year.
But Mr Vaz's decision to reiterate the allegations in the Commons, drawing
the information from a new report prepared by Norton Rose, lawyers advising
British-based creditors of the bank, reopened the wound at a critical stage
for the Dollars 1.7bn provisional compensation agreement with Abu Dhabi
negotiated by Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator of BCCI.
The High Court has adjourned the hearing into the liquidation until June 8
for creditors to seek 'clarification' of the deal. The unofficial creditors
committee is seeking a better deal than the one on offer.
Abu Dhabi said yesterday Mr Mazrui had been given no guarantee, indemnity or
similar assurance that his transaction in shares in the BCCI group, which
occured in 1986, would be risk-free.
The details, said Abu Dhabi, had been voluntarily disclosed by Mr Mazrui to
Price Waterhouse and the investigation committee set up by the majority
shareholders. It said that at no time before April 1990 did Mr Mazrui know
of fraudulent activities by BCCI management.

FT  15 MAY 92 / South bears brunt of big increase in unemployment: More
defence industry jobs lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRUNT of April's sharp rise in unemployment was borne by the southern
regions of the UK, although the number of people out of work rose in all
parts of the country except Northern Ireland.
The rise was sharpest in the south-west, where a 0.3 per cent monthly
increase in the number of jobless brought the total to 201,800.
In the south-east, including London, unemployment rose by 0.1 per cent,
bringing the rate of unemployment to 10.2 per cent.
There were also sharp increases in the west Midlands and north-west, but
economists suggested yesterday that the southern half of the country would
continue to suffer the biggest monthly increases in unemployment as pressure
on the service sector persis-ted.
In Northern Ireland the level of unemployment remained unchanged in April
compared with the previous month. Nevertheless, the rate of unemployment -
at 14.3 per cent - remained the highest in the country.
The overall weakness of the labour market was further reflected in a rise in
the rate of male unemployment to 12.8 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year
ago. Female unemployment remained significantly lower, rising to 5.2 per
cent in April compared with 4.4 per cent a year ago.
The level of female unemployment, and consequently overall unemployment, may
be much higher, since many married women whose husbands work are not
eligible for benefits and hence do not show up in the figures.
Job vacancy statistics worsened with the number of unfilled vacancies, which
account for about a third of all vacancies in the economy, falling by 7,900
to 119,600 - 2,200 fewer vacancies than in April last year. The Department
of Employment said that over the past six months Jobcentre vacancies had
risen by 2,700 a month on average.
Employment in the manufacturing sector continued to decline. The number of
employees in manufacturing in the UK fell to 4.5m, a fall of 26,000 on the
month.
Employment in the sector has fallen by 297,000 in the year to March,
compared with a fall of 239,000 in the previous year.
Measured on a quarterly basis, an improving trend in manufacturing
employment was reversed in the three months to March.
In the third and fourth quarters of last year manufacturing employment fell
by 65,000 and 59,000 respectively compared with a fall of 101,000 in the
second quarter. In the latest three months, employment in manufacturing
industries fell by 72,000.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Earnings rise continues: Reasons for the upward surge in
wages - Average pay increases 7.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE upward 'blip' in UK average earnings, announced yesterday, can be
explained by various special factors but still puts into sobering
perspective the controversy over a 5.4 per cent pay offer to Germany's
public-sector workers.
Germany, of course, is paying for reunification. But the figures make clear
that Britain can afford no complacency over its pay-setting arrangements.
In spite of a sharp reduction in inflation and the new discipline that ERM
membership is supposed to impose on the manufacturing sector, UK
manufacturing earnings are rising faster than all but three OECD countries:
Portugal, Greece and Italy.
According to the government's own figures, UK manufacturing earnings in
March were rising at an underlying rate of 8.25 per cent. The latest
available figures for other large countries include 6.6 per cent in Germany,
4.3 per cent in France, 2.7 per cent in the US and 1.7 per cent in Japan.
The underlying rate of increase in average earnings for the economy as a
whole was 7.5 per cent in March, more than 3 percentage points above
inflation. That is the same rate as February after an upward revision of
that month from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
That figure disguises a jump of more than 10 per cent in earnings in many
sectors between February and March. There are two main reasons for that. One
is that many companies paid bonuses in March, earlier than usual, to save
their better-paid employees from the effects of a possible Labour
government's tax increases.
The other is that some workers will have received two pay rises in the 12
months to March. In March last year, when inflation was 8.24 per cent but
heading down quite rapidly, employers were trying to postpone pay
settlements. This year inflation is relatively stable, and is even expected
to rise slightly, so employers have been settling promptly.
Apart from those 'special factors', it should be remembered that average
earnings represent pay increases over a 12-month period, so the current
figure still includes pay rises from the middle of last year when inflation
was considerably higher.
Nevertheless, employers and the government have been expecting average
earnings to fall significantly, along with inflation, for nearly a year,
without any luck. Average earnings were rising at a rate of 7.75 per cent in
July last year, only 0.25 per cent above the March figure.
Even more worrying, there are signs that pay settlements - which have been
falling more rapidly - may be hitting a floor between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent. Settlements are usually a percentage point or 2 below earnings
increases because they exclude bonuses and overtime pay.
The Confederation of British Industry is still reporting pay freezes for
companies in special difficulty. The CBI, however, said settlements in
manufacturing in the first quarter of this year rose from 4.2 per cent to
4.3 per cent.
Some pay analysts are speculating that average earnings may not fall below 7
per cent at all, in the present cycle, if the recovery does pick up in the
next few weeks. That would mean an increase in overtime and other bonuses.
This view is probably too pessimistic and the recent low settlements from
the banking sector suggest there is still downward pressure on pay.
Even so, the latest 'blip' certainly serves to highlight the fact that
Britain still has a pay difficulty both in the public sector - where
settlements are running at about the German level of 5.4 per cent - and in
the private sector.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Yorks businesses see signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS in the Yorkshire area and Humberside is beginning to show signs of
recovery but prospects are still fragile, the region's Confederation of
British Industry council said yesterday. There have been signs of further
improvement since the regional trends survey was compiled.
Mr Peter Barker, chairman of the regional council, said the most recent
evidence was of domestic orders increasing for some companies and being at
least stable for the majority.
'If the indicators on output and orders strengthen over the coming months -
and if businesses maintain the pressure on costs which now appears to be
bearing fruit - we should be able to discern a turning point and the
beginning of the recovery,' Mr Barker added.
He said the process would be slow, with definite signs elusive for some
time. Confidence was crucial, but the general election had strengthened it.
CBI members do not, however, expect employment prospects to improve. The
region is likely to have Britain's smallest year-on-year decline by the end
of June, but that will still be 2.8 percentage points.

strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government may face legal action in the European Court of Human
Rights by unions over the behaviour of employers in the 1989 dockworkers'
strike.
An independent study published by the TGWU general union found that, of 63
port employers, just 15 fully respected the human rights of striking
dockworkers.
The study calls on the TGWU to ask the Trades Union Congress to take the
case against the government, concerning Associated British Ports (ABP), to
the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
It argues that ABP breached the rules on collective redundancies. Rulings by
the ECHR are binding on British courts.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Johnson Matthey wins tax plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals company, yesterday won its appeal
against the Inland Revenue to receive tax relief on Pounds 50m granted to it
for the rescue of Johnson Matthey Bankers, its former subsidiary, seven
years ago.
The Bank of England rescued the bank, which ran into difficulties on its
commercial loans business, by buying its shares for Pounds 1. The rescue was
conditional on a Pounds 50m cash injection from Johnson Matthey.
Five law lords unanimously upheld the company's argument that the Pounds 50m
was a 'revenue payment' and hence deductible for corporation tax purposes.
Lord Templeman said the payment was solely to enable Johnson Matthey to
continue trading, because its own platinum-trading business would have
collapsed if Johnson Matthey Bankers had closed.
The Pounds 50m was not paid to persuade the Bank of England to buy worthless
shares in the bank, but to persuade it to rescue it and allow Johnson
Matthey to survive. A payment to preserve an existing business was
attributable to revenue, the lords stated.
The Revenue had argued that the Pounds 50m was a 'capital payment' to enable
Johnson Matthey to get rid of a capital asset, and liable to tax.

NORTHERN companies in sectors under pressure from environmentalists are
concerned that their prospects are being threatened by the cost of
compliance with over-hasty legislation.
A survey published yesterday highlights strong discontent among
manufacturers with the Department of Trade and Industry. It was based on
interviews between December last year and February this year with chairmen,
chief executives and managing directors from 62 of the largest
private-sector employers in north-east England and Cumbria.
Many felt that DTI ministers lacked understanding of the support that
manufacturers needed. Business leaders in sectors such as energy and food
also felt the government had failed to define its policy or shape European
Community legislation to the advantage of UK companies.
Companies in sectors under environmental pressure, such as plastics and
chemicals, food and drink, pharmaceuticals and energy, also voiced great
frustration at the complexity of UK and EC environmental regulation.
The survey, A Business Agenda for the North, was prepared by Price
Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and the economic research office of the
Northern Development Company.
It says there is strong satisfaction with the region's further and higher
education institutions.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Tighter tax rules on equity note payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION is to be introduced by the government which, with effect from
midnight last night, will prevent multinational companies avoiding liability
for UK tax on payments made under equity notes - perpetual debt instruments
where the loan is not repaid.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in the Commons
that the Finance Bill to be published on May 20 would include provisions to
prevent the exploitation of a recent ruling by the special tax commissioners
arising from a double taxation agreement.
They decided certain payments under equity notes were interest for tax
purposes. Mr Dorrell said the Inland Revenue was considering an appeal
against the ruling.
He also announced that new clauses to be introduced in the committee stage
of the bill to confirm the existing basis for taxing life assurance
companies.
They had been made necessary by the claims made by some companies that the
existing basis could not apply when a trading loss was incurred.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Lloyd's inquiry to end in mid-June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Walker will complete his inquiries into alleged malpractices at
Lloyd's of London by mid-June and will hand his report to the insurance
market's authorities on July 1.
That timetable emerged after a meeting yesterday between the Securities and
Investments Board chairman and three Conservative MPs. When Sir David was
appointed in February it was stated that he would take at least two months
to complete his task.
It has also emerged that a report into the loss-making Feltrim syndicates -
the first of a number of loss reviews being conducted by Lloyd's - will not
be ready until August. It had been expected that the investigations, which
are being co-ordinated by Sir Patrick Neill QC, would be ready earlier this
year.
Yesterday's meeting came as the government was accused by the Labour party
of mounting a cover-up of malpractice at Lloyd's in an attempt to protect
its 21-strong Commons majority.
Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, called for a debate on the market's
troubles and said there was evidence that 'the Council of Lloyd's - in
discussion with the Department of Trade and Industry - was involved in an
attempt using institutional finance to bail out Lloyd's Names including
MPs'.
A DTI official said yesterday that he had 'absolutely no knowledge' of the
discussions referred to by Mr Hain.
Mr Paul Marland, Tory MP for Gloucestershire West and a Lloyd's Name, joined
Mr Hain in calling for a Commons debate on the ground that there was
increasing evidence that the market was breaching the Lloyd's Act.
Mr Marland expressed satisfaction with the meeting with Sir David, which he
had attended along with Sir Gerard Vaughan, Conservative MP for Reading
East, and Sir Michael Marshall, Tory MP for Arundel.
In a separate development, Lloyd's Names who benefited from the out-of-court
settlement in the Outhwaite case yesterday won another legal victory.
After a two-day hearing in the Commercial Court Mr Justice Saville ordered
Lloyd's to pay the Pounds 116m directly to the 987 Names party to the
settlement agreed in February.
Last month Lloyd's blocked direct payment of the settlement to Names by
insisting that money be paid to its premium trust funds - the funds into
which all underwriting money earned by Lloyd's underwriters is paid.
The complication arose because some Names who benefited from the Outhwaite
action are also members of loss-making syndicates - such as those managed by
the Feltrim and Gooda Walker agencies - and have outstanding liabilities
from those separate underwriting activities.
In the cases of those Names, Lloyd's intended to offset settlement monies
against these other liabilities.
Mr Anthony Boswood QC, representing the Names, said that the decision had
caused Names 'grievous financial hardship'. Lloyd's said it will not appeal.

<TEXT>
THE threat of govern-ment-imposed statutory controls on the press appeared
to recede yesterday as the Press Complaints Commission praised the press for
supporting the industry's code of practice.
The commission, which replaced the Press Council in 1990, said in its first
annual report that the press, especially the tabloids, had given it strong
support.
The Calcutt Committee on Privacy, supported by the government, made clear
that the commission would be the last chance for the newspaper industry to
avoid statutory intervention.
Lord McGregor of Durris, commission chairman, said the newspaper industry
had passed the 'stiff test' of showing that self-regulation can work. 'I am
sure that the ethical standards embodied in the code will now be observed
cumulatively, expansively and irreversibly,' he said.
The commission emphasised yesterday that:
Most complaints raising apparent breaches of the code of practice had been
resolved directly with editors without the need for adjudication.
No newspaper or periodical had repeated the same or a similar inaccuracy or
misleading report brought to the commission's attention.
The commission's formal adjudications had been observed.
Lord McGregor also emphasised in his report the 'astonishingly small number
of complaints made against news-papers in general and popular national daily
and Sunday newspapers in particular'. During its first year, the commission
had 1,396 communications from the public. There was judged to be no prima
facie breach of the code in more than 37 per cent of cases.
Of the complaints in which there was a formal adjudication, 43 were upheld
and 48 rejected.
Lord McGregor paid tribute yesterday to the work of the two tabloid editors
who are commission members - Miss Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the
World, and Mr Brian Hitchen, editor of the Daily Star. He said it was unjust
to suggest their presence was like 'putting criminals on a committee to
reform the criminal law'.
He added: 'We owe a great deal to Mr Hitchen and Miss Chapman, who have been
criticised most unjustly.'
Mr Hitchen said yesterday that a new code of practice for the paper's own
journalists, underlining points in the industry code, had been completed
this week.
It placed considerable stress on intrusion and Mr Hitchen said his staff had
been told: 'Don't do anything you would not like done to you.'
Lord McGregor warned the press against complacency. He said: 'I can't
believe the press will be so foolish as to relax on a feather bed and think
that what the government said two years ago will be forgotten, because it
won't'
Mr David Mellor, the National Heritage secretary, is expected to review the
first 18 months of the commission within the next few months.

FT  15 MAY 92 / ITV proposes to block re-runs by rival broadcasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW ITV network plans to buy rights to programmes for up to 15 years to
keep them out of the hands of rival broadcasters.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London
Weekend Television, said yesterday that ITV wanted to buy the right to show
a programme three times over 10 years. There would also be an option for a
further five years.
'What we are trying to do is defend ITV and not find its programmes used
against it,' Mr Dyke said. He was speaking as ITV published the details of
the new centralised ITV network and the proposed contracts that will govern
programme commissioning and purchase in the future.
The new policy on buying rights is expected to be investigated by the Office
of Fair Trading in addition to its general responsibility under broadcasting
legislation to ensure the network arrangements are open and fair.
Mr Dyke said the ITV companies did not want to fall into the trap of
networks in the US, where re-runs of their old programmes shown by
independent stations and on cable television had eaten into audience share.
The ITV move to control rights and often keep programmes on the shelf for
years will undermine hopes that a secondary market will develop in the UK
for the rights to programmes already shown once on national commercial
television.
The strategy will prove controversial with independent producers, who want
to keep as many of the secondary rights in programmes as possible to sell in
other markets.
Mr Dyke said yesterday ITV would if necessary be prepared to pay more to
guarantee full rights to programmes, and added that it was very much a
buyers' market for programmes. ITV might end up 'buying less or not buying
at all' from producers who did not want to sell 10-year rights.
If approved by the OFT, the new policy, which would take effect from
September next year, might have a significant effect on Channel 4, which has
scored significant ratings successes with repeats of popular ITV programmes
such as the detective series Inspector Morse.
In future, the ITV network will be put together by a centralised system run
by a chief executive and a network director, who will be spending an annual
programme budget of about Pounds 500m.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Phone codes may cost industry Pounds 3bn: Telecom managers
association urges Oftel to delay for at least two years proposals on extra
digit for numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES planned for telephone codes may cost industry more than Pounds 3bn,
according to an organisation representing large telephone users.
The Telecommunications Managers Association (TMA) has urged Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator, to shelve proposals to introduce new codes in
spring 1994 for at least two years.
Oftel announced last September that all codes would have the digit '1'
inserted after the initial '0' to cope with a shortage of telephone numbers,
caused by growing competition in telephone services and increased demand for
numbers.
For example, Birmingham's 021 code would become 0121 while London's 071 and
081 would become 0171 and 0181.
Its Pounds 3bn estimate of the cost takes into account modifying - or even
scrapping - equipment, reprinting stationery and advertising the change.
The TMA's objections have already stopped Oftel from giving final approval
for the code change - Oftel's internal estimates put the cost at only Pounds
200m. A national campaign to alert customers, due to have started at the
beginning of this month, was postponed at short notice.
The delay is worrying parts of the industry. BT, Britain's largest
telecommunications group, and the Telecommunications Users' Association,
another user group, believe any further delay will give customers even less
time to prepare for the change.
In addition to the high cost of the planned change, the TMA has told Oftel
that it would not even meet the difficulty of a shortage of numbers and
that, in a few years, there would be further number changes and yet more
disruption.
Instead of a wholesale change to codes, it has proposed a stopgap scheme to
buy time while Oftel examines whether there is a better long-term solution.
The TMA's idea would involve taking codes from rural communities, where
there are few users, and reallocating them to the areas with a shortage.
Its fears of further disruption are confirmed by the fact that BT has
recently put a proposal to Oftel that would involve more than a million
customers in five cities changing both their codes and numbers.
Numbers in Leeds, Nottingham, Bristol, Sheffield and Leicester would change
from six digits to seven, while their current codes would be replaced with
prefixes from the series '0111', '0112', '0113'.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Sony and Thames join bid for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television and Sony Pictures International have joined the Five TV
consortium to bid for the Channel 5 licence.
The agreement, about to be announced, means that there are now two powerful,
potentially well funded groups competing for the new national channel
capable of reaching about three quarters of the population.
Last month TV-am, Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group and Time Warner,
the world's largest media group, signed an agreement in principle to bid for
the new channel.
Last week another announced bidder, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group,
decided not to go ahead.
In addition to Thames and Sony Pictures, the parent group of the Columbia
and Tristar Hollywood studios, Canwest Global Communications, a
Canadian-based international broadcaster, has signed heads of agreement to
join Five TV. Canwest's interests include a stake in TV3, the new television
channel in New Zealand.
The Five TV consortium was founded by Mr Chris Rowley, a former IBA
executive, Primetime the independent production and distribution group, and
Mr Moses Znaimer, founder of City TV in Toronto, who will be chief
executive.
The decision by Thames Television to take a stake in a Channel 5 bidder is a
further sign of the company's desire to remain a broadcaster. The company,
which was outbid in last year's competitive tenders for new ITV franchises,
ceases to be an ITV broadcaster at the end of December.
It has already announced the setting up of a satellite channel in a joint
venture with the BBC. Thames is likely to take only a 15 per cent stake in
Five TV, the maximum allowed to retain its independent producer status.
Channel 5 will be an expensive project to get off the ground because the
winner of the licence will have to pay for its own transmitters and the cost
of retuning 3m video recorders, which will suffer interference from the
Channel 5 signal.

INTELSAT last night successfully propelled its Dollars 157m
telecommunications satellite into a temporary orbit, preparatory to moving
it into its operational orbit. The satellite is to be lowered into its final
orbit in time for it to start work this summer.
This followed its rescue by US astronauts during the first three-man space
walk. The mission to save the satellite has brought Nasa, the US space
agency, its most sensational success since its re-organisation that followed
the explosion of the shuttle Challenger in 1986.
It had taken three tries before the astronauts, travelling at 17,000 miles
an hour, were able to snatch the elusive satellite on Wednesday night. They
set aside the bulky 'capture bar' which had been unsuccessfully employed to
snare the the 4.5-tonne satellite, and caught it by hand.
Once it was brought into the shuttle bay, the astronauts attached a new
12-tonne rocket motor and prepared it.
The mission was performed at the behest of a consortium of 22 countries
which own and operate the global communications satellite system. Intelsat
paid Dollars 150m up front and unreturnable to Nasa because the satellite is
expected to reap more than Dollars 1bn in business.
So strong was its faith in Nasa - which has never failed on six previous
missions to repair or recapture errant satellites - that Intelsat failed to
insure the mission, which would have added about Dollars 43m to its costs.
The entire Shuttle flight is reckoned estimated to have cost about Dollars
1bn. Nasa officials have been extolling its worth.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Accord on BCCI attacked by senator in US

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed Dollars 1.7bn settlement for creditors of the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) came under fire in the US senate
yesterday as Senator John Kerry, who has been investigating BCCI, described
the proposal as 'unfair'.
He made his remarks to Mr Brian Smouha, the BCCI liquidator, who gave his
first Congressional testimony on the BCCI affair.
The senator, at a foreign affairs sub-committee hearing, called into
question the settlement - by which the government of Abu Dhabi would pay
BCCI creditors between 30 and 40 cents in the dollar - because creditors
would be forced to waive their rights to bring any legal action against Abu
Dhabi. The government there is the BCCI majority shareholder.
Mr Kerry also criticised Abu Dhabi for its failure thus far to supply US
authorities with key BCCI documents and with former executives of the bank
being held under house arrest.
The senator said the BCCI creditors 'deserve to know that, if there are deep
pockets that fleece them, they have the right to take action.' He added:
'You have to understand who is responsible for the BCCI affair before you
strike some deal that wipes this all away. I would call this an unfair trade
practice.'
Mr Ahmed al Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and a
member of the government's BCCI working group, said Abu Dhabi had no
involvement in the frauds perpetrated by BCCI. He added that Abu Dhabi is in
talks with the US Justice Department over the possibility of making
available BCCI documents and witnesses now in Abu Dhabi.
Mr al Sayegh also criticised former BCCI auditors Price Waterhouse as
'negligent', and said the accounting firm 'should accept responsibility for
their failure to uncover the true position year after year.'
Mr Smouha responded to Mr Kerry's criticism by saying that what he had
sought was to 'negotiate a commercial solution.'
The settlement, which will be reviewed at a UK high court hearing in June,
will need to be approved by BCCI creditors and courts in the UK, Luxembourg
and the Cayman Islands.
A former top prosecutor claimed in earlier testimony to the sub-committee he
had been impeded last year by the Justice Department in his efforts to
obtain documents and bring indictments against BCCI.
Mr Dexter Lehtinen, US attorney in Miami until four months ago, complained
that, despite numerous written requests to Washington, the department
declined to give him permission to enforce subpoenas demanding crucial BCCI
documents about the bank's Luxembourg and other non-US operations.

<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday gave a partial reprieve to the northern
spotted owl, but proposed sharp reductions in the conservation areas set
aside for the threatened species, writes George Graham in Washington.
It also agreed to allow logging in a portion of the ancient Oregon forest
that provides the bird's habitat. The Endangered Species Committee agreed to
let the federal Bureau of Land Management sell timber on 13 parcels of land,
although logging there might jeopardise the owl's existence.
Only once, in 1979, had the committee by-passed the Endangered Species Act
by granting such an exemption.
The Interior Secretary proposed a plan to cut the federal land set aside for
the birds from 5.4m to 2.8m acres.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TO MILLIONS in Bombay, the success of Mr Harshad Mehta in making the jump
from low-paid office clerk to financial magnate, and self-proclaimedly
largest taxpayer in the country, has provided proof that there is an escape
from urban squalor.
But Mr Mehta is now under investigation by police for alleged improper use
of money from the interbank market in government securities to fund his
equity dealings. His rise and fall mirrors the best and the worst of the
Bombay stock market.
As the market climbed this year from under 2,000 on the Bombay Stock
Exchange 30-share index to a peak in April of 4,467 largely under the
pressure of Mr Mehta's relentless buying (yesterday it closed 36.65 lower at
3,394.48) he became the symbol of the path to easy wealth.
In Bombay's rather stuffy financial community, he was an upstart. The son of
a cloth trader, he was proud of having done badly at school and college. He
mocked the Indian education system by describing himself as a 'B Com, 37 per
cent'.
He quit working for an insurance company in 1982 and set up a portfolio
investment company called by the characteristically aggressive name of
Growmore.
He liked the wealth that came from success - buying a large fleet of cars,
and installing himself in a bungalow overlooking the sea that has a small
golf course attached.
The establishment eventually accepted him. Shortly after being raided by
income tax officials, he was invited by state-owned television to offer his
budget night comments.
He was immensely well-connected among politicians, bankers and senior civil
servants - buying and selling shares for them in transactions that could now
come under close scrutiny. He became a legend for the way he could push up
share prices, focusing on what he considered undervalued shares and sticking
with them. Mr Mehta purchased 5 per cent of Associated Cement Corporation -
helping to push up its share price from Rs350 at the beginning of 1991 to an
April peak of Rs11,500.
He bought similar 5 per cent portfolio stakes in other groups such as
Appollo tyres or Piramal luggage - driving up their price as well.
Part of Mr Mehta's success was that he knew the inner mechanism of an
archaic market structure. The other reason was that he never seemed to lack
funds.
Last month part of the reason for this emerged when State Bank of India, the
largest commercial bank, discovered that it had paid out Rs6.2bn (Pounds
122m) for securities or bankers' receipts (promissory notes in the interbank
securities market) which it had never received. State Bank forced Mr Mehta
to settle his account - a move that showed up the strains in Mr Mehta's
finances.
He seems to have turned to help from National Housing Bank, headed by Mr M J
Pherwani, who has since resigned. A large cheque issued by National Housing
Bank to ANZ Grindlays, India's biggest foreign-owned bank, was endorsed on
the back to be credited to Mr Mehta's account.
Mr Mehta is a quiet 37-year-old, full of charm. He holds his own in
conversation, partly because of the power of his wealth. But as police
investigators hover around him, he will have great difficulty in preserving
all that he has gained.

THE BATTLE of nerves among leading candidates in last Monday's Philippine
general election heightened yesterday as counting of votes proceeded at a
snail's pace.
The camp of Mr Fidel Ramos, the administration-backed candidate for
president, yesterday claimed it would fortify its slim lead over Mrs Miriam
Defensor Santiago once the returns from nine of the country's 13 regions
were tallied.
Mr Ramos' Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats party said Mrs
Santiago's lead in metropolitan Manila and other urban centres could easily
be offset by Mr Ramos' winning margins in the nine regions.
Mrs Santiago, however, said votes from the countryside 'will further widen'
her lead in the Media-Citizens Quick Count, an independent tabulation
sanctioned by the watchdog Commission on Elections. (Comelec). Other
estimates put Mr Ramos slightly ahead.
The camp of Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, third in the count, yesterday also
expressed confidence of emerging as winner.
Vice President Salvador Laurel, trailing in the seven-member field, conceded
defeat. Mr Ramon Mitra, Speaker of Congress, also acknowledged he had no
real chance of success.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Pakistan raises tax base to cut budget deficit
</HEADLINE>

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pakistani government yesterday announced an annual budget containing new
taxes to narrow its deficit while claiming that it intends to carry on with
liberalisation of the economy.
The measures did not appear to hit ordinary poor Pakistanis directly, as
costs for domestic consumption of basic needs including food, electricity
and water were untouched.
Among measures announced to raise additional revenues of PR6.8bn (Pounds
152m) under the central excise budget, telephone call rates were raised by
some 30 per cent.
A 5 per cent duty was also introduced on unprocessed fabrics exported from
Pakistan. An additional tax was announced for owners of cars of over 1,000
cc to encourage use of smaller vehicles.
Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, said in his budget speech that the
government intends to widen the sales tax net to include items such as
air-conditioners, ammunition and photographic equipment.
Computerisation is to be used to improve efficiency of the tax system to
broaden the tax base. Successive Pakistani governments have been unable to
prevent large-scale tax evasion due to widespread corruption in assessment
and collection systems. The government hopes for an additional PR3.62bn
annually from improvements in collection of income, wealth and property
taxes.
Some incentives were also announced for the private sector, in an effort to
continue with liberalisation of the economy. The budget provided details of
a five-year plan under which a tax rate of 66 per cent for banking companies
would be reduced to 55 per cent, and for publicly held companies from 44 per
cent to 30 per cent.
Tariffs ranging up to 90 per cent were reduced by 10 per cent on import of
refrigerators, televisions and washing machines.
Yesterday's budget appeared to be an attempt by the two-year-old government
of Mr Nawaz Sharif to avoid measures which would be unpopular among the
majority of the population. Most Pakistanis are not likely to be hit by such
measures as increased telephone costs or car tax.
But the government appeared to have made no headway on difficult decisions
such as cutting the large defence budget.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Tortuous undoing of apartheid: South Africa's complex
constitutional 'summit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Fine to warm, with storms brewing'
THAT was how Mr Thabo Mbeki, one of the chief constitutional negotiators of
the African National Congress, characterised the prospects for success at
talks today on the political future of South Africa.
When white, black, coloured and Indian South Africans meet today at the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party forum
shaping the country's constitutional future, they will be tackling the
central questions of post-apartheid politics: how will power be distributed
in the new South Africa? Will there be majority rule or power-sharing?
By Saturday night, the 19 parties to Codesa may have agreed to form a
multi-racial interim executive which would bring blacks to power for the
first time in 350 years. Such a government would include the ANC (the
largest black group), the ruling National party (which represents most
whites and probably a majority of coloureds and Indians), and the powerful
Zulu party Inkatha, as well as parties from the nominally independent black
'homelands', the liberal Democratic party and smaller ethnically-based
parties. It would remain in office until elections were held for an interim
national assembly, probably early next year.
But before they can strike a deal on the interim executive, the 200-odd
delegates to today's plenary session of Codesa must either resolve the issue
of how a new constitution is to be drawn up - or agree to differ on it for
the moment. The bottom-line positions of the two main parties - the National
party, which continues to demand what would in effect be a white veto in the
constitution-making body, and the ANC which wants decisions taken by a
two-thirds majority - reveals a big gap which they were yesterday
frantically attempting to close.
Since last December, five Codesa working groups have met for at least two
days weekly to seek agreement on removing obstacles to free political
activity, on interim government, on the shape of a constitution-making body,
on the future of the homelands, and on implementation.
They have spawned sub-committees, technical committees, steering committees
and management committees, which have struggled for thousands of hours to
reach consensus. Their deliberations, reported in confusing detail in the
local press, have alternately baffled and bored ordinary South Africans. And
though they can claim to have made progress, only the upcoming plenary will
determine whether there is breakdown or breakthrough.
On some important issues, consensus has already been achieved. At the first
plenary session of Codesa last December, the two sides agreed on a
'declaration of intent' which committed them to a multi- party political
system with 'freedom, equality and security for all', an independent
judiciary, a bill of rights, separation of powers among the executive, the
legislature and the judiciary with appropriate checks and balances,
proportional representation, and an end to racial discrimination. The
Inkatha Freedom party, which refused to subscribe to the declaration last
December, has now said it will sign, after an amendment which raises the
possibility of federalism.
Since then, the working groups have agreed to restore South African
citizenship to the residents of the homelands of Transkei, Ciskei, Venda and
Bophuthatswana, and agreed 'in principle' that they should be
re-incorporated into the republic (though the wording is vague and the deal
fragile).
They have agreed on the structure of the interim executive, to be called the
Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which would include a representative
from each of the 19 Codesa parties and take decisions by an 80 per cent
majority.
The council would be a sort of 'super cabinet' with powers to compel the
existing cabinet (which would remain in office) to comply with its
decisions. But its scope would be limited: the council would not run the
government, but deal only with levelling the political playing field in the
run-up to multi-racial elections, ensuring joint control over the security
forces, the state media, the electoral process and some aspects of foreign
affairs.
The council, which would be appointed by Codesa, could take office within
two or three months. But the ANC has said it will block it until agreement
is reached on the constitution-making body which would both draw up a new
constitution and make ordinary laws during the transition to democracy. That
may be within reach today and tomorrow, but only by postponing the most
contentious issues - powers of regional government, the supreme authority of
central government, joint control of security services - until later.
Yesterday the two sides were still fighting over the size of the majority
needed in the constitution-making body. The ANC wanted that body to take
decisions by a two-thirds majority, while the National party is demanding a
75 per cent majority, which would in effect give it and its allies (whites
and other conservatives), a veto over the constitution.
Though the percentages appear close, the dispute is substantive: the final
figure will determine whether blacks have the power to write what is
essentially a majority-rule constitution, or whether whites and other
minorities can entrench minority protections.
If talks break down, the ANC will probably mount a campaign of mass protest,
including a national general strike, which will lead to more civil
disruption.
The National party, for its part, may not easily buckle under the pressure.
But in the end, both parties concede they will return to the negotiating
table with the same political problems to solve, the same backlogs of
economic development, the same burden of joblessness - and even less time in
which to solve them.

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of two senior members of Australia's federal Labor government was
in doubt yesterday after Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, demanded a
written account of their relationship with a businessman facing criminal
charges in the Marshall Islands.
Separately, Mr Keating was accused by a Western Australian royal commission
of hampering investigations into alleged corruption between Labor
politicians and local businessmen by blocking access to tax records.
The allegations mark the end of a five-month honeymoon period during which
Mr Keating has increased Labor's opinion poll rating to within three
percentage points of the opposition conservatives. The government trailed by
18 points when he replaced Mr Bob Hawke in December.
The most serious allegations revolve around Senator Graham Richardson, the
transport and communications minister, whose brother-in-law, Mr Greg Symons,
is on trial for forgery in the Marshall Islands, a US protectorate in the
Pacific.
Mr Richardson admits meeting Mr Symons in his office, writing a letter of
introduction for him, and telephoning Mr Amata Kabua, Marshall Islands
president, after Mr Symons was arrested.
It later emerged that Senator Kerry Sibraa, Senate president, wrote to the
Australian embassy in Washington in November, urging the diplomatic service
to help arrange meetings for Mr Symons with US officials.
Both senators deny wrongdoing, but the affair has left Mr Keating open to
allegations of protecting political allies.
In Perth, Mr Tony Templeton, counsel assisting the royal commission, said
investigations into the collapse of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells merchant
bank had been limited by Mr Keating's refusal to allow access to tax
records.
Mr Keating said he refused access on the advice of Mr Trevor Boucher, the
tax commissioner.

THE South Korean government yesterday threatened new credit sanctions
against Hyundai a day before Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the
conglomerate, formally launches his independent presidential campaign.
The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) said it would bar Hyundai from making
new investments or acquiring real estate unless it collects Won202.7bn
(Pounds 145m) Hyundai lent to the Chung family earlier this year.
The Chung family is believed to have used the funds to help finance creation
of the Unification National party, which is expected to nominate Mr Chung
today as its candidate in the December presidential election.
Hyundai recently promised it would recover the loans by the end of the year,
but the OBS said the money should be repaid by this summer.
Hyundai has suffered credit restrictions as a result of the dispute. It
believes that it recently lost a contract to build the Tsing Ma bridge for
the Hong Kong airport project because the squeeze on its credit undermined
confidence in its financial position.

Residents of Phola Park squatters' camp near Johannesburg try to escape
yesterday from a tear-gas attack during a police and military raid on the
camp, an area of continuing factional violence.
The latest turmoil came as Amnesty International, the international human
rights organisation, warned that talks on South Africa's future were taking
place 'against a background of increasing political violence and terror in
the black townships, squatter camps and on commuter trains.'
Amnesty also says the South African government has not taken firm enough
action to end involvement by the security forces in torture and political
killings.
Unless they are brought to justice, 'the current climate of fear and high
loss of life will continue, threatening prospects for a democratic
transition in South Africa.'
Amnesty notes that 'not a single prosecution has yet resulted' from any
official inquiries into police and military complicity in assassinations of
black activists.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIA Airlines yesterday placed firm orders worth Dollars 600m (Pounds
339m) with Boeing of the US for 17 737-400 twin engine aircraft.
The deal comes at a time when general demand for narrow-body jets remains
sluggish. Boeing plans to reduce monthly production of 737s from 21 to 14
aircraft from October, to adjust to the weaker market.
The deal with Malaysia Airlines involves 12 new orders for 737s and the
conversion of five earlier options.
It brings to 45 the number of 146-seater 737-400 jets the Kuala Lumpur
carrier has ordered, making it Boeing's biggest airline customer for this
aircraft.
The airline plans to use the new aircraft to expand its domestic and
regional services.
The new aircraft will be powered by CFM56-3 engines made by the CFM
International joint venture between General Electric of the US and Snecma of
France.
Boeing has also delivered the last of its 707 Awacs (Airborne Warning and
Control System) aircraft to the Royal Air Force. Production of the 707 Awacs
ended last year and Boeing is now offering a militarised version of its
twin-engine 767 airliner as the future Awacs airframe.
Rolls-Royce jet engine sales to China have been boosted by an order for
three Fokker 100 aircraft from China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).
The UK group will supply Tay 650 engines to power CAAC's twin-engine Fokker
100 airliners.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Nynex plans Japan-UK fibre optic cable
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of international investors, led by Nynex, the north-east US
regional telephone group, is considering installing the world's longest
undersea fibre optic telecommunications cable, costing Dollars 1bn (Pounds
565m) and stretching from Britain to Japan.
The group will outline plans next week to officials from many leading
telephone companies. It aims to hold a further meeting in the autumn, to try
to persuade the companies to buy capacity on the cable.
Nynex stressed that the project was still in the early planning stages, with
details of the cable's route, landing points and financing still to be
worked out.
Other members of the consortium are Marubeni, the Japanese trading company,
Dallah-Al Baraka, a Saudi Arabian bank, and Gulf Associates, a New
York-based firm specialising in Middle Eastern business.
Some 95 per cent of the telecommunications traffic between the UK and Japan
currently goes by satellite. The only cable linking the two regions via the
Middle East is one between Singapore and France. This is a co-axial cable,
which is less efficient than fibre optic cable. However, a second fibre
optic cable is being built.
The proposed Nynex cable would have much greater capacity than the Singapore
ones. Its 120,000 circuits would be capable of carrying 600,000 simultaneous
conversations. Fibre optic signals are much clearer than satellite ones, and
do not suffer from time delays.
The Nynex venture, known as Fibreoptic Link Around the Globe (Flag), would
aim to complete the cable in 1996. It would have 14 landing points along the
route.
Nynex, one of the 'Baby Bell' telecommunications companies formed from the
1984 anti-trust break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph, has been
conducting feasibility studies for two years.
The move follows its failure to get US approval for a transatlantic cable
between the UK and New York, because of the strict anti-trust court rules
governing the 'Baby Bells'. These rules would not apply to a cable which did
not land in the US.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Export credit rates review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE premiums Australia's exporters pay to insure against default by foreign
buyers are under review, with higher rates possible on trade with riskier
countries, according to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.
According to Mr Graham Nottle, manager of the Treasury and Loans division of
EFIC, the review is due to be complete by the end of June: 'The objective
would be to move to a more market rate of premium,' Mr Nottle noted: 'We are
adjusting premiums with policy holders. They may not pay more, but may take
on more risk themselves.'
The Australian review follows recent decisions by Hermes, the leading German
export credit agency, and the US Eximbank, to adjust their premium
structures.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Globe-trotting Czechs seek new markets -
The search to replace Soviet sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEARCH by Czechoslovakia for new markets last month took President
Vaclav Havel to Japan and South Korea while his prime minister, Mr Marian
Calfa, set off for South Africa at the head of a 50-strong delegation of
Czech and Slovak businessmen.
Such top-level globe-trotting reflects the urgency of finding new export
outlets to replace the former high dependence on Soviet trade. But it also
marks a desire to re-establish a presence in global markets beyond the
European Community and attract new investment to update Czechoslovakia's
product range and increase the attractiveness of its exports.
Until this happens the country remains locked into its existing pattern of
exporting a wide range of relatively low- or medium-technology engineering
and consumer goods while importing energy and raw materials from the former
Soviet Union and more sophisticated investment and consumer goods from the
west.
Despite these product limitations, willingness to trim margins and easier
access to the EC and markets of the European Free Trade Association (Efta)
have already made western Europe the main market for Czechoslovak exports.
This has helped offset the loss of the former Soviet bloc trading system
Comecon, which accounted for 61 per cent of overall trade in 1989 but less
than 30 per cent last year.
Growth in trade with the west however has not yet been strong enough to
compensate for the collapse of Comecon.
Total exports of 321bn koruna (Dollars 11bn) in 1991 were 94 per cent of
their 1990 level and nearly 30 per cent down on the Dollars 14.3bn of 1989.
Imports have shrunk even more sharply to Dollars 10.1bn from Dollars 13.2bn
in 1990.
Lower imports reflect both a recession which cut gross domestic product by
nearly 15 per cent last year and the shift away from energy-intensive,
polluting heavy industry. Imports of crude oil from Russia, for example,
dropped from 16m tons in 1989 to 11m tons last year. With imports dropping
faster than exports, Czechoslovakia's balance of trade recorded a 25bn
koruna surplus in 1991.
The collapse of exports to the former Soviet Union in particular has
deepened the domestic recession, especially in Slovakia with its heavy
concentration of arms factories and other plants geared specifically to the
old Soviet market.
Within the lower overall volume, however, trade with EC markets grew
strongly, to account for 40.7 per cent of Czechoslovakia's total exports
last year compared with 24 per cent in 1988. A third of imports came from
the EC, against only a quarter from the former Soviet Union, although
imports from the former Comecon countries as a whole were virtually
identical to the EC share at 32.2 per cent of the total.
The trend towards closer integration in the EC is expected to continue as
Czechoslovakia, along with Hungary and Poland, reaps the benefits of a
recent association agreement with the EC.
Germany, which accounts for two-thirds of the estimated Dollars 800m foreign
capital invested in Czechoslovakia last year, took 19.4 per cent of
Czechoslovak exports and supplied 20.1 per cent of all imports in 1991. It
is expected soon to replace the former Soviet Union as the largest single
export market.
But the influence of the German-speaking world does not stop with Germany.
Austria and Switzerland are also becoming important trading partners. In
1991, Efta, of which they are members, accounted for 10 per cent of
Czechoslovakia's total trade. Business with Efta countries is expected to be
boosted by a recent trade agreement which takes effect on July 1.
But, as indicated by the official visits to Asia and Africa, and the opening
soon of a trade office in San Francisco to supplement existing offices in
New York and Washington, Czechoslovakia is also looking further afield.
Until now trade with the Pacific rim countries has been minimal.
Czechoslovak exports to Japan for example were a mere Dollars 71m last year,
mainly traditional consumer goods such as Bohemian glass and porcelain and
hops for brewing Japanese beer. Exports to South Korea were only Dollars 8m.
Japan traditionally likes to boost trade links before following up with
investment, and in the long run the main purpose of the high-profile state
visit to both Japan and South Korea was to raise Czechoslovakia's profile as
a profitable venue for investment.
Africa was also neglected under the old regime, with trade limited mainly to
shipments of military materiel in obligatory support of Moscow's support for
revolutionary regimes. The visit to Pretoria last month was recognition that
if political developments allow South Africa to become the dynamo for the
economic regeneration of southern Africa, a new market would be created in
which Czechoslovakia would also intend to participate.

POLAND and other eastern European countries seeking European Community
membership are erecting trade barriers to non-EC goods, according to US
government and industry officials.
US computer makers and government officials are accusing the EC of
encouraging the erection of trade barriers in eastern Europe to benefit
their own industries at the expense of US and other competitors.
'What has occurred in Poland, and appears likely to happen in Czechoslovakia
and Hungary as well, is that at the EC's urging, Poland has adopted measures
that create a major tariff wall clearly designed to block out US and other
non-EC goods in favour of EC products,' says the Computer and Business
Equipment Manufacturers Association.
Poland eliminated or reduced import tariffs on EC goods in March under the
interim trade provisions of its association agreement with the EC. In
August, Poland imposed import tariffs averaging 20 per cent on a range of
products that previously were duty-free, including computers,
telecommunications equipment, pharmaceuticals, farm products and chemicals.
A senior US trade official criticised the EC for what is seen in the US as
its failure to uphold a 'gentleman's agreement' that neither side would seek
to benefit from the effort to aid the emerging east European democracies
through trade. The issue threatens to become another in the lengthening
queue of trade disputes between the US and EC.
The US is insisting that Poland lower its tariffs before it renegotiates the
terms of its membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
The US may deny Polish products duty-free treatment under the Generalised
System of Preferences for developing countries unless the issue is settled.
'Over half their trade comes in (to the US) duty-free,' the trade official
said. 'We have been doing a major review to eliminate the barriers to Polish
trade. But its hard to defend this when our exporters are facing huge
differentials, and the Poles are refusing to talk to us about it.'
EC officials said any increases in central European countries' tariffs were
unrelated to their recent free trade agreements with Brussels, but were part
of their general move to a free market and to greater use of tariffs to
regulate their trade.
The Brussels officials said the EC's free trade accords with Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary were compatible with Gatt, and if the US wanted
lower tariffs in these countries, it, too, should negotiate a free trade
arrangement with them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BARE majority of presidents of the Commonwealth of Independent States are
expected at today's CIS summit in Tashkent - an attendance which may
foreshadow its disintegration. Five of the 11 heads of state have found
compelling reasons to stay away and are sending low level delegations.
Moldova is attending to allow Mr Valery Muravsky, its prime minister, to
present to foreign correspondents the Moldovan case on the conflict in the
self-declared republic of TransDnestr.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh leader, warned that the practice of
'mutual threats' between member states had led to a 'dead end' and many
leaders preferred 'autarchy' to co-operation.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, was expected to arrive yesterday
afternoon and the remaining five presidents who have said they will turn up
 -from Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - represent
states which are most dependent on Russian resources and/or military
protection.
The most important absentee will be President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine,
considered by most of his fellow CIS leaders to be the main cause of its
deterioration.
Since the last summit in Kiev on March 20, even those states which claim to
be most enthusiastic about the continued existence of the CIS have taken
further steps away from common policies. Russia has announced formation of
its own armed forces and, according to Mr Yeltsin, is to produce a
specifically Russian defence doctrine within the month. Only yesterday,
Interfax news agency reported Kazakhstan was preparing to introduce its own
currency on a limited basis, parallel with the rouble.
President Ayaz Mutalibov yesterday declared a state of emergency in the
Azerbaijan capital, Baku, as thousands of demonstrators protested against
his return to power. He was re-elected by the Azeri parliament, which
deposed him just two months ago.
His first act was to cancel June elections, which the opposition Popular
Front was expected to win. Political turmoil in Azerbaijan has been fuelled
by the Azeri setbacks in fighting with Armenians in and around the disputed
enclave of Nagorno Karabakh.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Pohl takes Bonn to task over economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, has stoked up fresh
controversy about Chancellor Helmut Kohl's economic policies - just at the
time when Germany is under increasing pressure from strikes and rising
budget deficits, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
In a book on the Bundesbank written by a German journalist, Mr Pohl is
quoted as criticising the Bonn government for allegedly putting the D-Mark
at risk over its policies towards east Germany. He also complains that the
Chancellor made too many concessions over European monetary union at the
Maastricht summit.
Mr Pohl's comments in the book were made in conversation with the author, Mr
Dieter Balkhausen, a television journalist, rather than in a formal
interview. There is no doubt, however, that the remarks ascribed to him
reflect his bitterness about Mr Kohl's handling of German unification and
European monetary union.
In the book, Gutes Geld &amp; schlechte Politik (Good Money and Bad Politics),
Mr Pohl is quoted as saying that at a cabinet meeting at the end of 1990 he
pleaded for a change of course to prevent state finances and inflation from
running out of control.
'But what followed was shameful. Neither were the necessary savings put into
motion, nor did the impossibly costly promises diminish.' Instead, 'the
amount of the expensive pledges and announcements increased'.
Mr Pohl makes clear that dissatisfaction with the government was an
important reason for his surprise resignation last July.
He is unhappy about the agreement at Maastricht on future economic and
currency union in the EC, while political union had still to be agreed.
'This is another crash course a la GDR (East Germany) that only the rich
brother can make possible.' He points to the huge costs of adjusting living
standards in Europe and says this cannot be done in a decade. (At
Maastricht, it was agreed that currency union would be introduced around the
turn of the century for countries meeting certain economic criteria.)
'A common currency only makes sense when economic, tax, finance, and social
policies are really interlinked,' he says.
Mr Pohl charges that Mr Kohl, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, and other
politicians agreed to too generous an exchange rate for the old East German
Mark for the German currency union of July 1990. The Bundesbank, which had
recommended a less favourable rate for the east Germans, agreed to the
government's wishes under political pressure despite its reservations, Mr
Pohl says.
'The vote of the Bundesbank was misused to stimulate expectations in the GDR
and thus improve election chances.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Serb bid to evade EC freeze on assets

THE Serbian authorities have been withdrawing assets from western banks, and
from banks in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, in an attempt to circumvent
further European Community sanctions.
The EC has not yet drawn up any concrete measures to seize such assets, nor
have central bankers received warnings or instructions to prepare for such a
possibility. Nevertheless, more than Dollars 1.5bn has been taken out of
Belgrade over the past six months, while assets held in the UK had
decreased, western bankers and diplomats said yesterday.
In Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, the Presidency building came under attack
yesterday, with shells exploding nearby every 20 seconds, according to Mr
Hajrudim Somun, an official inside. He said the Interior Ministry had also
been hit.
The largely Moslem Bosnian Territorial Defence Forces yesterday made a
desperate attempt to break a siege which Serb militia, backed by the
Yugoslav army, have imposed on the city for the past two weeks.
General Lew Mckenzie, a Canadian commander of the UN peacekeeping forces,
said Moslem forces tried to break out of the encirclement but the federal
army 'massively retaliated'.
Faced with severe shortage of food and medical supplies, the Bosnia militia
yesterday were forced to open up a route out of the city, thus ending the
fragile ceasefire announced by the Serb militia earlier in the week.
Eye-witnesses said Bosnian militiamen battled against Serb irregulars
between blocks of flats. One witness said: 'It is the worst street fighting
ever.'
Several mortar shells hit the Rainbow Hotel, which houses some 250 United
Nations peacekeepers, wounding a member of the UN staff and setting ablaze
12 vehicles.
Yugoslavia's assets abroad, not including assets held overseas by Slovene or
Croatian banks, totalled Dollars 2.9bn up to December 1991.
Claims on Yugoslav hard currency deposits held in the UK totalled Dollars
685m by the end of December - Dollars 582m held in foreign currencies, and
the remainder in sterling. This represents a sharp fall from the previous
quarter, when all Yugoslav assets in the UK totalled Dollars 1.1bn.
The decline is partly related to the withdrawal of these assets, as well as
moves by Slovenia and Croatia, who declared their independence last June, to
protect their assets against Serbia, and the Serb-dominated National Bank of
Yugoslavia.
EC diplomats said yesterday further sanctions against Serbia were discussed
by foreign ministers last Monday. There was no decision to freeze Serbia's
assets, a British official said.
Moves by the EC and the US to isolate Serbia have mounted over the past week
in an attempt to apply pressure on Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to
stop the fighting in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Serbia, and Montenegro, its ally, declared themselves
the successor to the former Yugoslavia, but the EC, the US and the countries
of eastern Europe have not recognised the new Yugoslavia.
The EC withdrew its ambassadors from Belgrade on Monday and will exclude
Yugoslavia from any discussions about Bosnia at the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe.

Roubles by the thousand change hands on a Moscow street as the capital's
citizens gather in a giant - and illegal - flea market, buying and selling
everything and anything despite city council attempts to ban such markets
from the centre.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday that the
government still intended to make the rouble convertible at a rate of 60 to
80 to the dollar - in spite of doubts voiced by officials at the Russian
Central Bank, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The minister told the Interfax
news agency that the rate was 'fairly realistic', given the Dollars 6bn
stabilisation fund provided by the IMF and the G7 countries - though he
admitted it would bring difficulties for importers and investors.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, central bank chairman, and Mr Dmitri Tulin, deputy
chairman, have poured cold water in the past few days on the government's
intention to move to a fixed and internally convertible rouble by the
autumn.
Timing the move towards fixing the rouble remains uncertain, given the
doubts of the Central Bank - without whose co-operation it could not happen.
The Central Bank will be in the dock itself next week, following a decision
of the Russian parliament to examine its performance. Many deputies consider
it has ceased to be responsive to the will of parliament, under whose
jurisdiction it falls.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Low-paid balk at cost of pulling down the Wall: German
public sector workers feel they are shouldering an unfair share of the
burden of unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE end, the money simply wasn't good enough.
The tram-drivers and refuse-disposal workers led the revolt, when a clear
majority of Germany's public sector workers yesterday rejected their 5.4 per
cent pay rise, and opted in effect to go back on strike.
Few believe they will do so. They have been abandoned by the other lesser
trade unions of the public sector - the railway and postal workers,
policemen and white-collar clerical workers. But their gesture has
nevertheless thrown Germany's industrial relations into further turmoil, and
provided a dramatic demonstration of the disgruntled mood at the grass-roots
of the country's workforce.
It was a revolt of the lowest-paid, even when they had done best out of the
deal, wrung out of the government last week after 11 days of unpleasant and
unprecedented strike action. According to the oTV, the largest public sector
union to which they all belong, the lowest paid were getting well over 6 per
cent pay rises from the deal, where the top ranks were being held down to
barely 5 per cent. But it still was not enough.
The union leadership was obviously taken aback by the backlash. Mrs Monika
Wulf-Mathies, hitherto seen as a tough and technocratic leader of a
ramshackle trade union, leading from the front, was clearly shattered by the
outcome yesterday.
'The result depresses us all, and it depresses me in particular,' she said.
'We simply had not reckoned with such a mood (in the union).'
Equally it was a shock to the public sector employers - the central
government, states and local authorities - who were dragged over the
threshold of a 5 per cent offer only after seeing that their workers
actually enjoyed a broad measure of public sympathy.
It is also a shock for the rest of the trade union movement, where the
mighty private sector unions, such as IG Metall, the engineering workers, IG
Bau in the construction industry, and IG Medien in the print industry, are
set on strike action for more cash. They urgently need a deal in the public
sector to use as their baseline for the coming battle.
'There is no doubt in my mind that IG Metall and the rest will be totally
frustrated by the outcome,' according to one Social Democrat politician, who
asked not to be named. 'They need to use the public sector pay rise as a
springboard, but that means they need to have it settled.
'On the other hand, the militancy of the public sector workers may convince
the other union leaders that they must hold out for more.
'IG Metall has already made a serious mistake by suggesting it would settle
for around 6 per cent.'
In fact the public sector vote seems to have been a two-edged revolt: on the
one hand by a radicalised grassroots membership against their own union
leadership; and on the other by a disgruntled workforce convinced that it is
shouldering an unfair share of the costs of German unification.
The perception of the German trade unions that the unification burden is
completely one-sided, was spelt out in detail yesterday by Mrs Ursula
Engelen-Kefer, deputy chairman of the DGB, the German trade union
federation.
'It all began to go wrong with the great 'tax lie',' she said, referring to
the repeated assurance of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues, before
unification, that there would be 'no tax rises to finance unity'.
First to go up were unemployment contributions, raised by 2.5 per cent on
April 1, 1991.
Then on July 1 last year came the big tax package: the 7.5 per cent
'solidarity surcharge' on income tax; petrol tax up; tobacco tax up; and,
from next January, value added tax will go up 1 per cent.
'All these measures put far more burden on the workers and those on social
security, for the financial costs of unity,' Mrs Engelen-Kefer insisted. The
extra contributions for pensions and unemployment alone will bring in about
DM50bn (Pounds 17bn) this year.
'The real incomes of workers sank in 1991 by 0.5 per cent, and in 1992 will
hardly show any real growth at all . . . . Between 1989 and 1992, the
purchasing power of pensions sank by some 0.5 per cent.
'Professionals, the self-employed and civil servants, as well as the higher
paid, have been very largely spared the costs, with the exception of the
solidarity surcharge,' she said.
As for the business sector, 'which has earned a massive amount from
unification', it had seen its tax burden reduced this year by DM5bn-DM6bn,
she said.
No doubt the government would quarrel with the figures. But Mrs
Engelen-Kefer does reflect (and inform) the thinking on the shop-floor. The
feeling is ever more widespread that 'it would have been better if the Wall
had been left where it was'.
In the German public sector, that general resentment has been aggravated by
growing strains inside the 900,000-strong oTV itself.
It is a diffuse union, representing wage scales ranging from DM2,000 to
DM20,000 a month, everyone from council administrators to refuse collectors,
and it has always had problems maintaining a united facade. Yesterday's
ballot result showed a gulf between the yes votes of white-collar workers,
and the no votes from the street.
Throughout the 1980s, the oTV concentrated on cutting working hours, rather
than pushing up wages. The result was that its members slipped down the
earnings league. Since 1989 they have been trying to claw it back, just when
the real boom years were over.
Last year Mrs Wulf-Mathies managed all right - she got an overall 7 per
cent. But this year her determination met the counter desperation of the
government with its back to the budget wall, and there was a limit to the
cash in the kitty. She thought it was enough, but her members disagreed.

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAY was cleared yesterday for European Community composite insurers  -
which combine life and non-life insurance operations - to open branches
throughout the EC after July 1994.
EC ministers agreed the third life assurance directive, although formal
approval will have to wait until it has been passed by the European
parliament. Earlier EC legislation restricted the rights of composite
insurers - mainly British, Italian and Belgian - to establish themselves in
other states.
Member states such as Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands, which had wanted
to maintain restrictions, yesterday dropped their objections. Restrictions
on new composite insurers will remain, subject to a later review of the
legislation: new composites wanting to open branches in third countries will
only be able to sell life and health insurance.
Insurance networks will be controlled by supervisory authorities in the
companies' home states. However, until the end of 1995 in Spain and
Portugal, and the end of 1998 in Greece, those national authorities will
continue to exercise local control over foreign insurers' subsidiaries,
according to the directive's rules.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday persuaded its EC partners to water down a declaration on
the abolition of frontier controls, so as not to prejudice its hard-line
position on the preservation of border-checks on people.
The declaration by internal market ministers outlines the measures which
need to be taken to remove barriers to the free movement of goods after
January 1, 1993.
But Mr Richard Needham, British minister for trade, insisted that the draft
declaration should be amended to make clear the UK's opposition to the
removal of checks on people crossing internal EC frontiers. For example, the
text no longer refers to the member states giving priority to the abolition
of 'all border controls'.
It is the second time this week that the UK has made clear its determination
to preserve checks, against the wishes of the European Commission. On
Monday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, reiterated the country's
determination to maintain controls over people. The Commission is
threatening the UK with legal action if it does not remove border checks on
travellers entering from other Community states.

FT  15 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y seeks court protection: Asks for insolvency law refuge
from creditors

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK Develop-ments, the world's biggest property developer, which
has debts of Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.7bn), last night applied to an Ontario
court for protection from its creditors under Canadian insolvency laws.
Lawyers for O&amp;Y and its bank lenders appeared before a judge in Toronto
after working hours.
O&amp;Y, owner of Canary Wharf, the Pounds 3bn office development in London's
Docklands, is the biggest company ever to make an insolvency filing.
The move, which seems likely to be followed by similar action in the US,
will send tremors through the North American and UK commercial property
markets, which are already in the grip of a severe recession.
Mr John Major was informed earlier this week that a protection request was
likely, as were the Canadian government, the Bank of England and the Bank of
Canada. A decision on whether to place Canary Wharf into administration
under UK insolvency legislation is expected to be taken in the next few
days.
The move to apply for protection was made under Canada's Companies'
Creditors Arrangement Act to prevent groups of creditors from seizing
assets.
Certain US subsidiaries were also expected to file under Chapter 11
legislation for protection for a limited number of properties in the US.
The insolvency filing marks the end of two months of frantic attempts by O&amp;Y
and its bankers to restructure debt without the help of court protection. Mr
Paul Reichmann, the company's publicity-shy founder, has desperately tried
to avoid the embarrassment of such an admission of his difficulties.
O&amp;Y made the filing with the support of its main bank creditors, led by
Citicorp of the US, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, in order to organise an orderly reconstruction
of its business.
The aim is to emerge from the protection of the courts as a going concern
after several months.
O&amp;Y will try to keep Canary Wharf out of administration for as long as it
can. However, one banker said earlier in the day that, if the parent company
went for CCAA protection, the 11 bank lenders to Canary Wharf - the
showpiece of government attempts to redevelop Docklands - may go for
administration. A decision is likely in the next few days.
This will depend largely on whether the UK government takes office space at
Canary Wharf for thousands of civil servants at a commercially acceptable
rate.
Mr Reichmann seems likely to remain in charge of the business. He will
continue to work with Mr Steve Miller, the partner of investment bank James
D. Wolfensohn who has been leading the negotiations with O&amp;Y's 100 banks.
O&amp;Y's bank creditors face big losses on the Dollars 12bn they have lent to
the company. However, bankers said they would have been forced to recognise
these losses even if the company had not made an insolvency filing.
O&amp;Y hopes that the Canadian and US courts will give it protection from the
demands of creditors for up to a year. During that period, it will continue
talks with banks on a plan to defer principal payments on the Dollars 12bn
of debt for five years and pay interest on Dollars 4bn in the form of new
shares.
Bankers decided that O&amp;Y should seek the protection of the courts because
four different groups of creditors were threatening to seize assets and
upset the process of restructuring the debt. If these creditors had
attempted to obtain control of assets in an unco-ordinated way, other
lenders to the company might have suffered, O&amp;Y and its bankers felt.
The latest blow to O&amp;Y's attempts to keep creditors at bay was a ruling
yesterday in the UK High Court that Dollars 240m owed to the US investment
bank Morgan Stanley was payable immediately. The debt relates to a deal made
in 1990 by which O&amp;Y purchased a long leasehold on Morgan's offices at
Canary Wharf.
Although the agreement was between Morgan and one of O&amp;Y's UK subsidiaries,
called Rochmoor, the liability falls on the parent in Canada. O&amp;Y will make
a decision before Wednesday about whether to appeal.
O&amp;Y's Canadian operations also face demands for an immediate payment of
CDollars 17m (Pounds 8m) in interest from holders of CDollars 325m of bonds.
The bondholders yesterday threatened to seize rents payable to O&amp;Y by
occupants of a Toronto office block, First Canadian Place.
Meanwhile, a syndicate of eight banks led by JP Morgan, the US commercial
bank, is foreclosing on a Dollars 160m loan secured on a New York property.
Finally, O&amp;Y has still to resolve the problem of how to redeem hundreds of
millions of dollars in commercial paper, a form of short-term debt
securities, which are secured against Toronto's Exchange Tower. O&amp;Y had been
hoping that the Canadian government would provide a bridging loan to
facilitate the sale of the tower and repay the commercial paper holders.
O&amp;Y's financial crisis was precipitated in March when holders of Dollars
800m of its commercial paper demanded immediate repayment. Although O&amp;Y
believes its assets have a net value of around Dollars 5bn, it has run out
of cash to meet short-term payments.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Ministers firm on Pounds 400m deal for Jubilee Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY FUTURE owner of Canary Wharf would be held to an agreement to contribute
Pounds 400m towards the planned extension of the Jubilee Line Underground
railway if Olympia &amp; York collapsed, ministers insisted last night.
But, amid disquiet about the severe blow it would deliver to the future of
Docklands, ministers accepted that the government would face intense
political pressure to inject more public money into the area to sustain
confidence.
With O&amp;Y seeking protection from its creditors, the government faces an
acute dilemma over whether to scrap the rail scheme if the banks refuse to
meet, or seek to scale down, the developer's contribution. Officials
predicted an intense cabinet debate before the government agreed an
approach.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, could be expected to
lead calls for an active role in preserving confidence. Last year he fought
successfully for the routing of the Channel rail link through east London as
part of an ambitious strategy to spur the development of the east Thames
corridor beyond Docklands. But the officials said he would face fierce
opposition from the Treasury to any increase in spending to support Canary
Wharf.
Downing Street said Mr John Major was being kept closely in touch with the
progress of negotiations between O&amp;Y and the banks. Following O&amp;Y's action,
it is thought that his first priority will be to limit the political damage
but also to minimise any immediate commitments until the future of Canary
Wharf becomes clearer.
There was little surprise at the suggestion that negotiations between O&amp;Y
and its creditors might collapse, but there was acknowledgment in Whitehall
that the final demise of the developer would mark a severe setback for the
government's ambitions for the area.
The ministers said that the departments of the environment and of trade and
industry were still talking about the possibility of moving civil servants
to Canary Wharf. But, so far, O&amp;Y's package had not been sufficiently
competitive to match a Commons pledge by Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, that any decision would be strictly commercial.
A minister closely connected with recent talks insisted that, if Canary
Wharf went into admin-istration, the government would expect the banks to to
contribute towards the rail extension.
The government plans to inject more than Pounds 1bn into the Jubilee Line.
It argues that the Pounds 400m due to be contributed by O&amp;Y is significantly
less than the additional value that a rail link would place on Canary Wharf.
There is private acknowledgement, however, that there is no binding contract
to force O&amp;Y or any subsequent owner to contribute to the line.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Economic hopes hit by jobless and earnings data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S economic strategy suffered a double setback yesterday with
news that unemployment jumped by 42,600 in April and average earnings rose
by 7.5 per cent in February and March.
The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment in April - the 24th consecutive
monthly rise - brought the jobless total to 2.7m, the highest since August
1987.
It followed the exceptionally low rise in March of just under 8,000 and
pushed the unemployment rate in April to 9.5 per cent.
Although the increase was bigger than City forecasts of a 29,000 rise, the
overall trend measured on a three-monthly basis continued to improve.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, described the rise as 'clearly
disappointing', but said the average rate of increase in unemployment in the
three months to April was the lowest since the three months to September
1990.
Over the past six months, unemployment has risen on average by 36,400 a
month. The Department of Employment said the underlying three-monthly rise
in unemployment was around 30,000.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Although the
monthly rise in unemployment exceeded that in previous months, trends
suggest that the pace of increase in unemployment is still gradually
easing.'
A bigger shock came from March's 7.5 per cent year-on-year increase in
average earnings, which fuelled worries about underlying inflationary
pressures.
The yearly rise in February was revised to 7.5 per cent from an initial
estimate of 7.25 per cent.
The growth in average earnings has consistently disappointed market
expectations since it began to decline from 10.25 per cent in July 1990.
The Department of Employment described the March figure as a 'blip'. This
probably reflected bonus payments made before the general election on April
9 because of fears that a Labour government would have imposed higher taxes,
it said.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said April's jobless rise
'shattered' the hope that the increase in unemployment was about to cease.
'It is now clear that the trend is firmly upwards and will carry on rising
for some time with all the waste and human misery it brings,' he said.
The bad news on unemployment and higher average earnings came the day after
Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said there was
little prospect of any early move to lower interest rates.

FT  15 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVE markets were very active yesterday as the Footsie future was
traded down to fair value for the first time since the general election,
writes Peter John.
The FT-SE contract for June delivery was around 20 points above the
underlying market for most of the morning. However, a large programme trade
on the sell side in the cash market and poor figures from conglomerate
Hanson led to a swift turnround at midday.
June was then sold down steadily and hit 2,702 shortly before the official
close. That is around the contract's current estimated fair value - the
premium that takes into account dividends and carrying costs - of 8 points.
The drop of more than 40 points on the day meant that opportunistic buyers
were bound to be tempted back. Sure enough, June was squeezed up to close at
2,710 with turnover high at 10,183 contracts.
In the traded options market, Hanson dominated the stock options with 6,111
lots dealt, as dealers responded to disappointing first-half figures. The
May series was being traded in lieu of underlying stock and the August
series saw around 2,500 lots dealt. British Aerospace was also popular, with
2,507 contracts traded. On the day, the market saw 36,576 contracts dealt,
compared with Wednesday's 31,759.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris leads retreat on US
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALL STREET's weakness affected most late-closing markets yesterday, while
some of the early closers had problems of their own, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS, after opening weaker, lost further ground in the afternoon session.
Apart from the Wall Street influence, disappointing first quarter results
from LVMH and Elf prompted heavy selling. The CAC-40 index closed down 36.17
or 1.7 per cent at 2,017.00 in turnover of FFr3.2bn.
LVMH slipped quickly to an intraday low of FFr3,901 before recovering to
close down FFr235 or 5.5 per cent at FFr4,030. Turnover was estimated at a
heavy FFr627m. A sell note issued by US brokers Goldman Sachs also affected
sentiment. LVMH units Au Bon Marche and Christian Dior fell FFr31 and FFr14
respectively to FFr721 and FFr336.
Elf, which upset the market with a 25 per cent decline in first quarter
operating profits, shed FFr10.80 to FFr379.20. Total eased FFr3.20 to
FFr266.
Elsewhere Saint-Gobain lost FFr16 to FFr579 and L'Oreal fell FFr15 to
FFr884. One of the few bright spots of the day was Pechiney International
which put on FFr6.30 to FFr208 after falls earlier in the week.
AMSTERDAM slipped back in spite of a strong performance by Royal Dutch on
its positive first quarter earnings. The CBS Tendency index closed down 1.4
at 128.8 on selling ahead of today's expiry of May options and futures
contracts.
Royal Dutch rose to an intraday high of Fl 154.50 before easing to close up
Fl 2.70 or 1.8 per cent at Fl152.70.
Profit-taking was noted in a number of issues following recent gains,
including publishers VNU, down Fl 1.30 to Fl 88.70 and Elsevier, down Fl
2.10 to Fl 114.
FRANKFURT lost more ground, the DAX index closing 7.16 lower at 1,742.26
after a drop of 2.93 to 704.05 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from
DM6bn to DM5.7bn.
Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf observed that the apparent
stability of German equities in the past month, in the face of bad domestic
news, had come at a time when international investors had been putting money
into the UK, France and Switzerland. 'In relative terms, the German markets
have been weak,' he said.
Lufthansa, which has passed its dividend, fell another DM3.20 to DM147.20
and Kugelfischer, the engineer which made a deep dividend cut after hours on
Wednesday, dropped DM10.90 to DM254.
Carmakers fell again, Volkswagen leading the way down with a drop of DM5.40
to DM385.60. Apart from the looming metalworkers' strike, the sector
continued to be a target for profit-taking, and reaction to the weakness in
the US dollar.
MILAN saw weakness in Fiat, Generali and a range of other blue chips on
business pessimism, and the political hiatus in Italy, and the Comit index
fell another 4.83 to another new 1992 low of 477.50.
Fiat fell ahead of today's 1991 results losing L89 to close at L4,941, and
dropping again to L4,860 in the post bourse. Generali fell L460 to L27,800
and Credito Italiano by L44 to L1,706 in a weak banking sector.
ZURICH gave up early gains to close with the SMI index 8.5 down at 1,944.8.
Insurers' fortunes varied. Zurich certificates topped the active list but
fell SFr90 to SFr2,030 on Wednesday's rights issue; Baloise certificates
gained SFr50 to SFr2,300 on capital restructuring hopes.
BRUSSELS followed other bourses lower with the Bel-20 index ending down 6.62
at 1,215.12 in turnover of BFr723m.
Petrofina shed BFr25 to BFr11,450 while Banque Bruxelles Lambert, which said
that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, its main shareholder, may sell part of of its
stake, lost BFr50 to BFr3,500.
MADRID may have been in festive mood, ahead of today's holiday and chose to
maintain its equilibrium in spite of Wall Street and a rise of 0.5
percentage points in Spain's core inflation rate. The general index closed
0.56 higher at 261.38.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking restricts
Nikkei to modest rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING eroded initial gains yesterday, but the Nikkei average closed
marginally higher after further strength in the yen had earlier pushed the
index up to the 19,000 level for the first time since March 31, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained a net 36.03 at 18,804.60. After a day's low of
18,804.09 recorded immediately after the opening, the Nikkei jumped on
active buying by foreign investors, which prompted dealers and investment
trusts to follow suit. The index briefly rose as high as 19,003.61, but
profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling then took their toll.
Volume increased to 450m shares from 394m, with institutional investors
remaining on the selling side.
Declines outnumbered advances at the finish by 501 to 484, with 155 issues
unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.49 to
1,396.73. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.60 to 1,114.07.
Some analysts said the downside risk for share prices had subsided. Mr Alan
Bell of Baring Securities said fears of a market 'melt-down' were now
non-existent. He added that the market faces some volatility during the next
few months, due to companies' profit announcements, but that it should post
a rally after mid-August.
Rises in the second section and over-the-counter market added to the
positive mood. The previous declines of smaller company stocks have been
steeper than those of the major section stocks, with the former perceived to
be more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy.
The second section index rose 18.11 to 2,103.79 and the OTC index gained
22.84 to 1,708.62. Traders said the advances reflected an improvement in the
earnings outlook for companies in the second section and over-the-counter
market.
Short-term speculative trading by dealers led activity. Japan Metals &amp;
Chemicals was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y38 to Y749, while
Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, retreated Y50 to Y1,500 on
profit-taking.
Export-oriented, high technology issues lost ground in reaction to the
higher yen. Hitachi slipped Y8 to Y831, Matsushita Electric Industrial
dipped Y10 to Y1,380 and Sony shed Y60 to Y4,370.
Housing shares were higher on favourable earnings results for the year to
March 1992. Daiwa House Industry registered an advance of Y30 to Y1,870. The
company posted a 1.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y90.5bn on a 9.9
per cent increase in sales to Y881.9bn. National House Industrial moved
forward Y20 to Y1,750.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 81.73 ahead at 21,428.63 in volume of
23.6m shares.
Roundup
A NUMBER of other markets in the region were also affected by profit-taking,
although enthusiasm for New Zealand was not to be denied.
NEW ZEALAND tested its peak for the year as the NZSE-40 Index added 20.64,
or 1.4 per cent, at 1,529.79, after gains of 2 and 1 per cent respectively
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
This was its highest close since January 6, on fresh buying orders from
foreign investors encouraged by falling domestic interest rates, a weak New
Zealand dollar and growing optimism that the depressed local economy is
starting to recover.
Forestry issues again claimed most attention: Carter Holt rose 10 cents to
NZDollars 2.68.
HONG KONG took a breather after three consecutive record highs, the Hang
Seng index closing 11.50 down at 5,746.46 in turnover up from HKDollars
3.99bn to HKDollars 4.53bn.
Afternoon profit-taking wiped out sharp early gains which had carried the
index through the psychologically important 5,800 barrier.
MANILA saw turnover rise from 218m pesos to 370m, but profit-taking in the
last hour of trading left the composite index only 9.31 higher at 1,337.35
following Wednesday's 93-point surge and a gain of 41.70 in the first hour.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone added 45 pesos at 1,065 after a good
overnight performance in the US. Philippine National Bank lost 5 pesos to
307.50 after the resignation of its president on Wednesday.
BANGKOK declined for the third day in a row, with investors worried about
opposition calls for a big rally against Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon
this weekend. The SET index lost 3.31 to 727.96 in thin turnover of
Bt2.49bn.
AUSTRALIA was led lower by a weaker futures market. The All Ordinaries index
finished 2.9 easier at 1,679.8 in turnover of ADollars 317m.
Foster's Brewing gained 6 cents to ADollars 1.86 ahead of tomorrow's
refinancing deadline.
TAIWAN weakened on fears that the strong Taiwan dollar would depress export
industries. The weighted index lost 25.78 to 4,300.60 in turnover of
TDollars 20.8bn.
BOMBAY drifted lower, the BSE index closing 36.65 down at 3,394.48.
SINGAPORE gained ground on expectations of an increase in first-quarter GDP.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 11.23 to 1,472.75. KUALA LUMPUR's
composite index receded 5.62 to 593.03 in turnover of MDollars 73.3m.
SEOUL fell on heavy institutional selling, the composite index ending 4.73
off at 587.56.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim telecom stocks find
international support - Dollars 10bn of new equity is expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications in the Pacific Basin are being unplugged from state
control. As privatisation of utilities gathers pace, high growth rates are
being forecast for the companies, and international investors have been
showing increasing interest in the sector.
Privatisations are expected in Singapore, Korea, Pakistan and Thailand in
the next few years with, according to a recent report by Salomon Brothers,
the US-based brokers, some Dollars 10bn of new equity coming on to the
market over the next three years.
Meanwhile, New Zealand has had the most recent experience of liberalisation.
Telecom, the former state-owned utility, was privatised last July; since
then, cost-cutting has allowed it to report a 20 per cent increase in net
profits for the first nine months to February.
The cost-cutting was initiated by Mr Peter Troughton, its former managing
director, who announced his sudden resignation in mid-February. There was
speculation that his decision to quit came after disagreement with leading
shareholders Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US - each of which holds a
37 per cent stake - over handling of a price-cutting battle with competitor
Clear Communications.
Salomon says there is still room for further economies in costs, as well as
renewed marketing initiatives to improve call volume.
Together with BZW, the UK broker, it still rates the stock as a buy in spite
of its recent disappointing market performance. BZW notes that the company
should deliver long term earnings per share growth of just over 10 per cent.
The Philippines, which liberalised telecoms six years ago, is dominated by
Philippines Long Distance Telephone (PLDT). Listed in both Manila and New
York, PLDT reported a 48 per cent jump in net profits for 1991, while EPS
rose to 98.90 pesos from 64.56 pesos. Listed in New York, its share price
movement in Manila is strongly influenced by its US performance earlier on
any given day.
According to Salomon, the potential for market growth in the Philippines is
enormous, given that at present there are only just under two lines per 100
people, compared with over 40 in Hong Kong and New Zealand. Restraints to
growth for PLDT, however, include the company's high gearing, estimated at
120 per cent in 1991, and the country's historic political instability.
Economic growth in Malaysia, coupled with tight monetary policy, has already
given a spur to institutional investment in the country. Telekom Malaysia,
in which foreign investors hold 7 per cent of the equity, is felt by
analysts to have excellent growth potential as the demand for improved
services continues. The group recently reported a 45 per cent increase in
pre-tax operating profit for 1991, helped by a 14 per cent rise in
subscribers.
Kim Eng Securities, the Singapore-based broker, notes that in spite of the
expiry of Telekom's five-year tax-exempt status at the end of last year,
which will cause a dip in 1992 earnings, long-term prospects remain good.
Salomon is forecasting long-term dividend growth of some 12 per cent.
Hong Kong is currently reviewing its telecommunications policy and assessing
whether the territory, which reverts to Chinese control in 1997, needs a
second operator. The domestic monopoly held by Hong Kong Telecom ends in
three years.
Hoare Govett argues that this review will have little effect on Hong Kong
Telecom, in which Cable and Wireless, of the UK, is the major shareholder,
since the group already has 'a high penetration in the domestic market and
will retain its more lucrative international franchise until 2006'.
However, along with a higher tax charge which will depress profits in 1992,
this has made some analysts cautious about short term potential, leading to
a number of 'hold' recommendations being issued on the stock.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften slightly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY MARKET rates softened slightly yesterday after the Bank of England
forecast a smaller shortage than had been expected in the discount market.
But the market's underlying view remained bearish about a cut in base rates
in the near future.
The cost of 1-month and 2-month money softened slightly after the Bank
forecast a shortage of only Pounds 500m in the morning. As the shortage was
easily taken up, 1-month money ended the day at 10 1/16 per cent, down from
10 1/16 - 1/32 per cent the day before.
2-month money also ended at 10 1/16 from a previous close of 10 3/32 per
cent.
One trader said that these reductions were purely technical. He said that
the overnight rate had dipped as low as 8 1/2 per cent because of the high
liquidity in the system and, as a result, traders were more willing to lend
at longer rates.
The market's underlying pessimism about a rate cut was reinforced by poor UK
economic figures. These showed that unemployment grew by a bigger than
expected 42,600 in April to reach 2,695,300. Average earnings in March also
increased by 7.5 per cent, the same as the February figure which was revised
up from the original estimate of 7.25%.
There was disappointment at sterling's performance on foreign currency
markets with the pound trickling away from its best levels and closing at
DM2.9375. Sterling futures reflected those poor figures. The September
contract ended the day at 90.24, eight ticks down on the previous close, and
implying that base rates in September will be at 9.76 per cent. The December
contract ended at 90.49, down ten ticks, and implying that base rate at the
end of the year will be 9.51 per cent.
The discount market had a very quiet day. In the morning, the Bank of
England forecast a shortage of Pounds 550m. The forecast was later revised
to a shortage of around Pounds 500m. The Bank then purchased Pounds 500m of
Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The shortage was later revised to
around Pounds 600m before taking account of the morning operations. The Bank
then purchased Pounds 109m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
German call money rates eased yesterday to just below 9.60 per cent for the
first time in two months after the Bundesbank added liquidity to the market
on Wednesday.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record copper demand forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER CONSUMPTION is likely to rise by 4.5 per cent next year to reach a
record 9.35m tonnes, according to the Metal Bulletin Research consultancy
organisation.
This should support a sharp increase in the average copper price from about
Dollars 1.03 a lb this year to Dollars 1.20 and 'set the scene for a major
bull market in the middle of the decade'.
In a special report, analysts Mr Neil Buxton and Ms Rosalind Stewart suggest
that copper supply will not be able to keep pace with demand next year.
Stocks should therefore fall by about 200,000 tonnes to 700,000 tonnes,
representing only four weeks of average consumption - the same level as
during the 1987-89 bull market for copper.
They say that beyond 1993 mine capacity should meet the likely need for
copper concentrate (an intermediate material) in the mid-1990s. But there is
concern about the level of smelting capacity.
The only new copper smelter likely to be in production in the next two years
is the 100,000 tonnes-a-year Luilu refinery in Zaire, scheduled to open in
July this year.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALCAN Aluminium's Quebec smelter workers have accepted a new four-year
contract providing a total 8.6 per cent in pay increases retrospectively to
May 1, 1991.
The unions also negotiated tighter job security clauses covering plant
modernisation and technological change.
The new agreement covers all Alcan's smelters in Quebec, except a small
plant near Montreal. In all the company has about 700,000 tonnes of ingot
production capacity in the province.
Alcan laid off about 4,000 employees world-wide in 1991 and shut down 8 per
cent of its smelting capacity because of low world prices. It has warned
further cuts of about 1,000 jobs world-wide might follow this year.
About half of US aluminium producers have already agreed short-term
contracts.

The TIN market reached 18 1/2 -month highs in the afternoon as the
three-months price, having broken Dollars 6,100 a tonne, quickly soared to
its next target area above Dollars 6,200. The price reached Dollars 6,240
before dealer selling and profit-taking pared gains. Traders said the rise
now appears to have become overdone with punters looking to take profits and
the trade keen to hedge at these higher levels. The tightness of nearby
delivery dates in ZINC flared again, taking the premium for cash metal over
three-month to Dollars 102 a tonne from Dollars 76.25 on Wednesday. New York
COTTON futures rallied in active midday dealings. Analysts said that the
Russian trade mission had reportedly purchased US cotton for the Moscow area
mills. London COCOA ended the day generally easier after the market
encountered another batch of origin selling from the Ivory Coast which
quickly eroded morning gains. 'The origins can't leave the market alone at
the moment, but the problem is many people just aren't buying,' one dealer
said. GOLD moved ahead on the London bullion market on early Middle East
short-covering and Japanese buying, which drove prices to a high of Dollars
337.75.

CHINA Investment Company, a closed-end fund which plans to invest in joint
ventures in China, looks set to raise over Dollars 15m from investors in the
US, Europe and the Far East, according to Crosby Securities, the Hong
Kong-based securities firm which is sponsoring the new investment company,
writes Sara Webb.
The fund is due to be listed on the London Stock Exchange this month and
will be managed by Crosby Asset Management (CAM).
CAM plans to invest most of the money raised in stocks listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in China, buying 'B' category shares
which are the type available to foreign investors. Longer-term, the fund
manager hopes to invest in equity joint ventures, mainly in the coastal
provinces of Zheijiang and Jiangsu. CAM said it would not invest more than
25 per cent of its assets in a single sector. A maximum of 4m ordinary
shares in the China Investment Company, with 800,000 warrants attached at
Dollars 10.60 per share, have been offered to institutional investors.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: New equity product for US
retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW type of equity product could soon provide US retail investors with
access to an investment strategy commonly used by institutional investors.
The first such product is expected to be listed on the American Stock
Exchange (Amex) next month, and further offerings, totalling close to
Dollars 1bn, are already in the pipeline, as banks rush to gain a foothold
in a potentially lucrative new market.
Known as equity participation trusts, these products will recreate for
individuals the practice of 'covered-call writing' - the common technique
among institutional investors of writing call options against a portfolio of
shares.
More particularly, they will allow retail investors to mimic a 'buy-write'
strategy, which involves simultaneously buying shares and selling call
options on the shares as a means of enhancing returns.
Short-Term Equity Participation Units (Steps), jointly developed by Morgan
Stanley, will be the first off the block. The Amex will list 2m units in a
three-year trust, called Technology Equity and Income Trust, which will hold
a basket of 12 technology stocks, sell call options against them, and invest
the proceeds from the call options in US Treasury strips (bonds which have
been stripped of their coupons).
Similar products, based on other market sectors, include PaineWebber's Trust
from Income Participation from Stocks (Tips); and Goldman Sachs is planning
a product called Stairs (Short Term Appreciation and Income Return Shares).
Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter developed their product in response to
growing retail demand for Preference Equity Redemption Cumulative Stock
(Percs) - essentially a buy-write strategy sold by a company on its own
stocks.
'The first Percs were sold mainly to institutions, but a high percentage of
the follow-on demand has been at retail level,' said Mr Richard Sandulli,
vice-president, corporate finance at Dean Witter.
While Percs allow investors to pursue a buy-write strategy on a single
stock, Steps apply the technique to a whole market sector. The technology
sector was chosen because technology stocks typically offer little or no
yield, but are highly volatile.
The product allows investors to earn more yield, though a portion of the
upside potential of the stocks is given up.
Steps were due to be listed on the Amex at the beginning of the month, but
the listing has been delayed by a regulatory problem with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
The structure 'will provide retail investors with a relatively inexpensive
means of adopting a sophisticated investment strategy,' said Mr John
Braddock, a director of the capital markets group at Amex.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Turkey acts to attract funds
into equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has introduced amendments to its capital market law in the hope of
encouraging local institutional investors and boosting liquidity on the
Istanbul stock exchange.
The amendments form the spearhead of a large reform package and, with tax
changes reducing incentives for holders of government paper, are aimed at
attracting funds into Turkish equities.
At present some 70 per cent of activity on the Istanbul stock market is
concentrated in government debt.
The legislation provides for greater investor protection, diluting the
powers of the Capital Markets Board (CMB) in Ankara, hitherto the
government's watchdog body, while tightening the rules on financial
disclosure, audit requirements and insider trading.
Moreover, for the first time the Turkish law provides specific penalties for
insider trading, with, for example, a minimum fine of TL1bn (Dollars
150,000) for creating false markets in shares.
The new law also enlarges the range of financial instruments available, to
include futures, options and non-voting shares. Companies or banks wishing
to issue financial instruments will now only have to register with the CMB.
Banks have also lost their exclusive right to run open-ended funds, which
can now be offered by brokerage houses, insurance companies and other
specialised financial institutions.
The difference between dividends on old and new shares has also been
eliminated. Hitherto this discouraged companies from making rights issues.
Taxes affecting the status of government debt are expected to be become
effective in 1993.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: MAN boosts truck output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Germany's MAN
engineering group, expects to produce a record number of trucks for the
second year running.
The rise in output, from 36,000 in 1990 to an expected 43,000 this year,
will help the truck maker increase turnover by DM800m to DM8bn (Dollars
4.8bn) for its fiscal year ending June 1992, according to executive board
chairman, Mr Wilfried Lochte.
The turnover increase for the trucks subsidiary - still benefiting from the
surging demand for trucks following German unification - underpins earlier
group forecasts that turnover and profits for the group will be maintained
this year.
This is despite lower orders in other group operating sectors such as
printing and industrial equipment. The truck subsidiary itself earned DM159m
net of tax last year, up from DM147m.
The company's sharpest growth in percentage terms is coming from buses
rather than trucks. Bus output has more than doubled over the past two
fiscal years, to 1,325 units, and demand from the east German states - where
MAN already claims 40 per cent of the bus market - is expected to help
sustain the momentum.
Mr Lochte said he expected bus turnover to increase by a further 35 per cent
in the current fiscal year.
MAN has recently completed the Pounds 20m (Dollars 35.4m) purchase of MAN
Truck &amp; Bus UK - the UK importer and distributor of MAN trucks - from the
Lonrho group.
The group plans to invest 'some tens of millions of Deutschemarks' in its
own dealerships in the UK in the hope of doubling UK market share, to
between 8 and 9 per cent, within the next five years.

sharp fall in non-consolidated earnings for the six months to March.
Pre-tax profits fell 45 per cent from the previous year to Y4bn (Dollars
30m) on a 3.3 per cent decline in overall sales to Y98.2bn. After-tax
profits fell 51 per cent to Y2.1bn.
Sales of bearings, the company's main profit earner, fell 6.5 per cent to
Y27.1bn, because of slumping overseas demand. Sales of electronic equipment
and components, manufactured mainly in Thailand, rose 7.4 per cent to
Y48.1bn.
Minebea's financial balance declined 65 per cent to Y688m because of a 53
per cent fall in interest income.
The company said orders for electronic equipment and parts such as precision
motors, keyboards and floppy disk drives, have been rising. However,
profitability for such products remains poor.
Minebea expects an improvement in the current six months. It is forecasting
a 36.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y9.5bn for 1991-92 as a whole, on
sales little changed at Y207bn.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Options exchanges worried by
over-the-counter trading - The IAOECH annual meeting in Chicago believes
they are losing business to customised deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR

<TEXT>
RISING competition from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets topped
the concerns this week at the annual meeting of the International
Association of Options Exchanges and Clearing Houses (IAOECH).
Options exchanges believe that a vast amount of money is slipping away from
their trading floors into unregulated, customised derivative deals. The 43
exchanges from around the globe that gathered in Chicago wrestled with the
question of whether this competition was a threat or an opportunity, and
decided at the end that it was both.
While they would prefer that the OTC markets be regulated in the same way
that they are, the risk of such customised deals is frequently laid off in
exchange-traded products, which provides a certain amount of business for
the exchanges.
Association officials said it is impossible to quantify precisely the
dimensions of the OTC derivatives markets. Some indication could come from a
plan for regulating the OTC market in the Netherlands, which goes into
action next month.
Despite the lack of figures, association officials remain convinced that OTC
markets are mushrooming. The same cannot be said of their own trading
volumes, at least in the more mature markets in industrial countries. Newer
markets tend to experience several years of extraordinary growth and then
see a significant slackening of pace.
US markets in particular are affected by a general decline in trading
volume. The most dramatic decline has been in traditional equity options.
According to the US Options Clearing Corporation, which handles all US
clearing, the average daily trading volume of equity options has dropped
from its peak of 650,000 in 1987 to 414,000 last year, though it has risen
to 449,000 so far in 1992.
According to a recent study by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the decline
in equity options activity derives in large part from a widespread lack of
knowledge about options.
The five American options markets and the US Options Clearing Corporation
Such plan to wage a joint advertising campaign to bring back the retail
customer.
Mr Alger 'Duke' Chapman, chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and
president-elect of the IAOECH, said: 'There's a whole new generation of
customers to be educated and a whole new generation of brokers to be
educated.'
Education for regulators is also badly needed, the IAOECH officials said.
While regulators have increasingly consulted each other across borders in
recent years, the association officials complained that they frequently do
not consult with the markets themselves.
Tjerk Westerterp, president of the Amsterdam-based European Options Exchange
(EOE), said: 'We have been astonished in Europe at the kind of regulation
they (the EC) had in mind for derivative markets.' The association is
pressing for greater international co-operation by regulators, in part to
stem regulatory arbitrage and to speed the approval of trading products
across borders. It took, for example, two years to get the EOE's Eurotop
options registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The IAOECH would also like to see unified clearing, though a single European
clearing house was deemed at least the first stop on that journey. Evidence
of that need came just last week when four European exchanges, the EOE,
Soffex, OM London and OM Stockholm, agreed on co-operation in the form of a
strategic alliance. Called First European Exchanges (FEX), it will provide
cross-market access, but with the goal of enhancing home markets.

<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the
Aa1 long-term ratings of Norinchukin Bank, the financial arm of Japan's
agricultural co-operative, under review.
The move follows a downgrading of Norinchukin's debts from Aaa last August.
Credit ratings at Japanese banks have been downgraded during the past year,
because of bad loans stemming from the sharp falls in stock and real estate
prices.
The rise in funding costs, because of the declines in ratings, is expected
to squeeze profit margins at the banks, which are already under pressure
from the increasing number of corporate bail outs.
Moody's said that though Norinchukin has negligible direct exposure to
domestic real estate-related business, the bank has big exposure through
loans made to non-bank financial institutions.
Norinchukin also faces deteriorating asset quality and profitability at its
local agricultural organisations.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Prague plods on towards a
regulated stock market - Czech privatisation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Czechoslovakia's progress towards an efficient and regulated stock market
system remains painfully slow, in spite of the urgent pressures arising from
the government's privatisation plans.
Under the privatisation programme, an estimated Dollars 8.6bn of equity from
some 2,000 enterprises will be distributed to the 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks
who bought a voucher book for a small fee earlier this year.
Voucher holders will start bidding for enterprises from Monday, and vouchers
are expected to become tradeable shares in newly privatised enterprises by
the end of this year.
Much will depend on the speed of the complex bidding process, which includes
five rounds during which over-subscribed enterprises will be re-offered to
bidders for more investment points.
Without the development of an efficient stock market trading system the
privatisation programme could become paralysed. Two private stock exchange
companies are to be set up, in Prague and Bratislava. These will be
independent market institutions, interlinked by computers and supervised by
the finance ministries in the Czech and Slovak republics.
Shareholders for the Prague Stock Exchange will include Czech financial
institutions. The law allows foreign banks to become shareholders but
foreign participation is limited at 30 per cent of the stock exchange's
capital.
So far, the only foreign banks holding a stake in the future stock exchange
company are Credit Suisse First Boston and Creditanstalt.
However, five or six applications from other foreign banks are being
processed, according to officials from the Prague Stock Exchange
Association,
According to Mr Petr Vyroubal, legal specialist at the association, 50
listed companies will first be traded on the exchange's first section, with
300 to 400 unlisted ones traded on a second section.
The remaining newly privatised companies are likely to be traded on an OTC
basis among banks.
However, the federal ministry of finance has proposed that these shares be
traded through the local computer offices which have monitored the
registration of citizens' vouchers.
The stock exchange will be equipped with the CAC trading system, received
under French government aid.
This has prompted some bankers to say that such state of the art technology
could justify trading through the computer network directly and not on the
physical exchange.
Bankers have also expressed fears about the legal basis of Czech trading
operations.
A draft of a securities act has been awaiting parliamentary review for
months. And also the relevant authorities have also not defined listing
procedures.

approval

<TEXT>
THE New York State Insurance Department has given the go-ahead for the
demutualisation scheme at The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the large US
life insurer.
This is by far the largest US demutualisation - the process whereby a mutual
insurer, controlled by its policyholders, turns itself into a 'conventional'
shareholder-owned company. Equitable policyholders have already approved the
move.
The next step in the process will be the flotation of Equitable shares on
the stock market, an event scheduled for this summer. Once that is complete,
Axa, the French insurance group, should emerge with a 40 per cent to 49 per
cent stake in Equitable in return for its Dollars 1bn infusion of capital
into the ailing US group last year.
Axa said that the initial public offering of Equitable shares in The
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US was expected to take place in
July, following a period for appeals against the demutualisation approval.

THE GAP, one of the most widely respected specialist retailers in the US,
yesterday reported an 11 per cent improvement in first-quarter profits, to
Dollars 45.3m after tax. Operating profits rose from Dollars 67.1m to
Dollars 73m.
Sales during the 13 weeks to May 2 rose from Dollars 490.3m a year earlier,
to Dollars 588.9m. This partly reflects store expansion.
The Gap operates 850 Gap outlets, compared with 814 a year ago; 151 Banana
Republic stores, compared with 131; and 235 GapKids, against 185.
The fashion retailer added that same-store sales had risen by 5 per cent,
and said that it was satisfied with the outcome. However, it warned that the
'economic environment continued to be challenging' with promotional activity
more pronounced than in 1991.
Wall Street, viewed the figures as disappointing, and marked the shares
Dollars 3 7/8 lower at Dollars 37, in early trading.
Tiffany &amp; Co, the US-based jewellery retailer, said first-quarter sales and
earnings results were below expectations, especially in Japan, Reuter
reports from New York.
Earnings declined to Dollars 3.1m from Dollars 4.4m in 1991, before a
Dollars 6.3m charge for an accounting change, in spite of a 10 per cent
increase in sales to a record Dollars 107.2m.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, one of the middle-ranking US carriers and in
bankruptcy since late 1990, reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 17.4m in
the three months to end-March.
This compared with a Dollars 181.3m loss in the same period a year earlier,
when the Gulf war-related slump in traffic volumes drove the industry
heavily into the red.
However, Continental acknowledged that the profit resulted from a
non-recurring gain of Dollars 52.8m - mainly as a result of the sale of
slots and gates at New York's La Guardia airport.
It did make a much-reduced operating loss of Dollars 3.7m in the period  -
compared with the Dollars 138m deficit 12 months earlier. Revenues in the
first quarter rose to Dollars 1.41bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in 1991.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADOLPH Coors, best-known as the third largest US brewer behind
Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing, announced yesterday that it plans to spin
off its non-beer interests as a separately-quoted stock market company.
Shares in the new company would be distributed free to the company's
existing shareholders.
The new company would take in a fairly diversified range of businesses,
including Coors's ceramics interests, its Golden Aluminum operation, a
packaging subsidiary and three smaller 'developmental' companies - namely
Golden Technologies, ZeaGen and MicroLithics.
Coors said that the plan should leave the Colorado-based Coors Brewing
Company largely intact. The businesses to be spun off had sales last year of
about Dollars 544m, or about one quarter of the group's total. Among Coors's
ceramics interests is a facility in Glenrothes, Scotland.
Coors's action is the latest in a spate of demerger moves by US companies.
Only last month, for example, Ralston Purina, the large US consumer products
announced plans to spin off its Continental Baking Company subsidiary, the
nation's biggest wholesale baker.
Securities Data has calculated that 13 demerger announcements were made in
the first quarter of 1992, double the figure for each of the preceding five
quarters.
Yesterday, Coors's shares rose strongly, up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 20 1/2
.
Coors was formed in 1873, and is still largely family-run. Under the
demerger plan, different members of the family would head up both entities.
The diversification into ceramics first took place in the 1920s, when the
prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the US temporarily shut down Adolph
Coors's fledgling brewery.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Asarco pauses for breath after
its headlong rush - How one US mining group has transformed itself from
lumbering copper smelter to integrated copper producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asarco, the US mining metals group which spent Dollars 1.1bn over the past
few years in a headlong rush to transform itself, is pausing for breath to
put its balance sheet in better shape.
The group has sought to throw off its old image as a lumbering
copper-smelter - mainly taking in material from other miners for refining -
and assuming that of an integrated copper producer.
In 1985, before the transformation got under way, the group could supply
only 25 per cent of the copper concentrate - an intermediate material -
needed to keep its smelters fully occupied. Today it can supply 100 per
cent.
Ironically, custom smelters have rarely been more profitable than today.
The world is suffering from a smelter bottleneck. Smelters are turning many
potential customers away because of an abundance of concentrate and their
treatment charges are very high.
Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, is not perturbed. 'The world might be short of
one copper smelter right now but money and time will take care of that,' he
says.
Asarco's short-term objectives are to ensure its heavy investments will pay
off. 'We must focus to a man on getting operating rates (at mines and
smelters) up to where they should be,' says Mr Osborne.
Asarco's restructuring took place at an opportune time. Mining properties
were available because the US oil companies were disposing of their metals
assets. Asarco also spent heavily to improve its own properties.
Its Mission mine in Arizona has been expanded by 42 per cent, enabling it to
produce some 124,000 tons of copper this year. A 58 per cent expansion of
the Ray mine was completed in February this year and it is expected to
produce 182,000 tons of copper.
A revamp of its El Paso smelter, to increase capacity by 38 per cent, will
be finished by 1993. And the redevelopment of its Silver Bell mine as a
leach operation is expected to be completed in 1994.
The group plans no further acquisitions in 1992. 'We must be careful that we
don't take opportunities at too great a pace for the company to absorb. We
must let the organisation pause every now and again,' says Mr Osborne.
However, he adds quickly: 'But we haven't stopped looking for
opportunities.'
Meanwhile, Asarco has set about repairing the damage high spending caused to
its balance sheet. Its debt has climbed from 26 per cent of equity in 1985
to more than 36 per cent. Mr Osborne says the aim is to reduce it to 25 per
cent as quickly as possible.
To this end capital spending will drop to about Dollars 100m this year from
Dollars 283m in 1991. The dividend payment will be halved, from Dollars 66m
to Dollars 33m. Mr Osborne says: 'In a cyclical business like ours,
dividends have to bear some relationship to results.'
Asarco hopes to sell its 31.2 per cent shareholding in Mexico Desarollo
Industrial Minero (Medimsa) for about Dollars 300m cash.
Asarco's transformation to an integrated metals group has increased its
exposure to the risks of the metals markets. Last year, poor prices for its
copper, gold, lead, silver and zinc knocked Dollars 100m off the company's
earnings of Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12 a share.
Continuing low metals prices have postponed the first fruits of the
company's metamorphosis. It reported first-quarter net earnings of Dollars
6.9m, or 17 cents a share, down from Dollars 8m, or 20 cents, a year ago.
Sales slipped to Dollars 458.4m, from Dollars 465.2m last year.
Asarco's new capacity in copper, with 1.5bn tonnes of reserves and 1992 mine
production scheduled to be 333,000 tonnes, gives cause for optimism. Profit
margins from an integrated mining business are significantly better than
those for custom smelting. 'The earnings capacity of Asarco today is much
greater than it would have been without these mining assets,' says Mr
Osborne.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, should soon know the
fate of its Halcion sleeping pill. The company's final appeal of the drug's
ban in the UK will be heard today.
In the US, the advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration is
scheduled to make its recommendations on the drug next week.
When Halcion was first banned in the UK in October following charges that
the drug was unsafe and caused memory loss and depression, the ensuing
furore led to extensive re-labeling in the US and bans in some other
countries.
Sales of Halcion, which was once the most popular sleeping pill in the
world, plunged 39 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
Although the UK is a small market for Halcion, there is some concern that if
the drug is not reinstated in the UK, other European countries will also ban
Halcion. The final UK verdict is expected by mid-June.
In the US, it is widely expected that the FDA advisory panel will recommend
that lower doses of Halcion remain on the market.
In November, the FDA approved a new package insert and smaller packaging of
Halcion in addition to changes in labelling.
Upjohn has vigorously denied that there were safety problems with the drug,
when it is used as directed. The company has said it welcomed the FDA's
review as a chance to show, in a scientific setting, that Halcion was safe
and effective.
Even if Halcion receives favourable decisions in the US and the UK, some
analysts believe that the damage to its reputation, and to sales, may be
irreparable.
On Wall Street, shares in Upjohn slid Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 at
mid-day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON, the Canadian-owned travel and publishing group, has blamed the
continued slump in advertising in its North American and UK regional
newspapers for a substantial first-quarter loss.
A 37 per cent drop in the North American newspaper division's operating
profit virtually wiped out improvements in earnings from the UK travel
business and lower interest charges.
The net loss, before preferred share dividends, was USDollars 47m, or 9
cents a common share, compared with a Dollars 48m loss, or 10 cents, last
year. The figures include charges of Dollars 17m this year and Dollars 16m
in 1991 for amortisation of publishing rights and circulation.
Total sales rose to Dollars 1.14bn from Dollars 1.08bn, with most of the
improvement coming from the travel and professional publishing divisions.
The company said North American newspaper results were hit by a 1.9 per cent
drop in advertising lineage in the US, and a 6.4 per cent slump in Canada.
Margins were also eroded by continued spending on product improvements.
The travel business has recovered strongly from the setback of the Gulf war.
The company reported a 24 per cent jump in packaged holiday sales last
winter, compared with 1990-91.
Sales of summer holidays are 8 per cent ahead of last year. The pick up in
traffic benefited Britannia Airways, Thomson's charter airline subsidiary,
and Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel shops.
The airline has found a buyer for all five of its Boeing 737-300s over the
next 12 months. They will be replaced by operating leases on four larger
Boeing 757s in 1993 and 1994.
Thomson said earnings from the North American professional publishing group
were below expectations, but should be largely recovered later in the year
when delays in product shipments were overcome.
Poor advertising hit the group's UK regional newspapers, but sales and
profits of UK-based professional, business and academic publications have
been encouraging.

<TEXT>
NINTENDO, the Japanese video game maker led by Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi who is
leading a consortium to buy the US baseball team Seattle Mariners, saw
record sales for the fiscal year ended March, due to strong sales of its
home video games in the US and Europe.
Non-consolidated sales at Nintendo rose 12.5 per cent to Y507.5bn (Dollars
3.89bn), thanks to firm domestic business. Operating profit rose 1.9 per
cent to Y140.3bn due to the stronger yen. However, the pre-tax profit rose
11.3 per cent thanks to a 74 per cent rise in interest income.
After-tax profits grew 20.8 per cent to Y85.3bn. Exports were affected by
the sluggish US economy and currency movements, and grew 1.1 per cent to
Y316bn. Nintendo's annual dividend was raised to Y60 per share, from the
previous year's Y50.
The company expects stronger sales in the US following price cuts for the
Super NES, its game hardware which uses a 16-bit processor. The planned
introduction of a new product which enables users to paint pictures and
compose music, is also expected to contribute to an earnings increase.
Nintendo also expects to introduce Super NES into the European market this
year.
For the year to March 1993, Nintendo forecasts a 6.2 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y166bn on a 6.4 per cent rise in sales to Y540bn.
The company plans Y10bn in capital spending, including a construction of a
distribution centre in Kyoto, Japan.

EARNINGS of Japanese property-related companies are under strain. Mitsubishi
Estate, the realtor, yesterday reported a 0.3 per cent increase to Y90.2bn
(Dollars 692m) in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March, and Daiwa House
Industry, the home builder, a modest 1.3 per cent rise to Y90.6bn.
However, Mitsubishi Estate is forecasting a 20.2 per cent decrease in
pre-tax profits for the current year, the first fall in 17 years, which it
blamed on the slow recovery of the property market and a new method of
assessing land tax.
Daiwa House is forecasting that pre-tax profits will expand by only 1.5 per
cent on sales up from Y881.9bn to Y950bn. The more optimistic sales figure
follows signs that the Tokyo housing market is gaining strength after two
years of falling demand and prices.
Last year, Mitsubishi's sales rose by 2.1 per cent to Y345.5bn, while for
the current period it is expecting sales of Y360bn. Daiwa's sales rose 9.9
per cent last year.
The impact of the collapse of the Tokyo stock market was reflected in the
erosion of both companies' share assets, with the unrealised gains on
Mitsubishi's holdings falling to Y293.8bn from Y436.6bn.
At Daiwa, the book value of short-term shareholdings fell to Y9bn from
Y9.4bn but the market value fell to Y7bn from Y11bn and the book value of
long-term holdings of stocks rose to Y85.2bn from Y80.3bn, while the market
value fell to Y145.8bn from Y173.3bn.
Mitsubishi said that while the Japanese property industry generally faces a
'difficult environment', its own situation will be made more difficult by
additional land taxes of Y11.5bn for the current year. However, the company
expects to spend Y344bn in construction and other investment, 14.5 per cent
up on last year.
Daiwa House said recent reductions in official interest rates could restore
some of the consumer and industry confidence lost after the collapse of the
country's financial 'bubble', and that house sales were likely to improve
later in the year.

AMCOAL, the coal arm of Anglo American, the South African conglomerate, has
recorded a 16.5 per cent rise in attributable profits to R321.1m (Dollars
112.66m) in the year to March, despite lower sales volume. Profits were
lifted by higher earnings from exports and from sales to Escom, the national
power utility.
Group turnover rose by 4.2 per cent to R1.89bn. However, volume sales of
coal and coke fell to 42.4m tonnes, a decrease of 1.1m tonnes from 1991.
Sales to Eskom by volume were down by 1.1m tonnes at 29.9m tonnes, while
export tonnage increased by 3 per cent to 10.3m tonnes.
Earnings from collieries supplying Eskom rose due to increased investment.
Higher tonnages helped raise export earnings, which were also assisted by
slightly higher dollar prices and a marginally weaker exchange rate.
Colliery working costs rose by 6 per cent, well below the inflation rate of
15 per cent.
Mr David Rankin, chairman, said lower sales to Eskom and to the industrial
and metallurgical sectors reflected the weak state of the economy.
Mr Rankin said that South African coal exporters, with Amcoal the largest,
had sold a total of 48.5m tonnes in 1991, 1.1m tonnes less than in 1990.
Coal exports remain South Africa's largest foreign exchange earner after
gold.
He forecast lower earnings for the year because of soft domestic and
international markets, lower interest earnings and a less favourable tax
position.
Earnings per share were 16.3 per cent higher at 1,275 cents, and the
dividend was lifted by 9.4 per cent to 465 cents.

<TEXT>
HASBRO, the US toy maker, is planning to buy Nomura Toy, a privately-owned
Japanese toy design and marketing company, in the latest in a string of
Japanese acquisitions by foreign companies.
Spurred by the decline in land and stock prices, foreign companies have
shown increasing interest in buying Japanese businesses, particularly
distributors and other groups with access to markets and marketing skills.
For their part, the owners of many Japanese companies involved in wholesale
and retail distribution are looking to sell their businesses in response to
recent easing of regulations designed to protect small shopkeepers.
Hasbro's proposed push into the Japanese toy market follows the success of
Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer singled out for praise for its efforts by
Mr George Bush, the US president, during his visit to Japan early this year.
Hasbro plans to establish a Japanese subsidiary which will take over Nomura.
The Japanese company, no relation of Nomura Securities, was founded in 1923
and employs 40 staff in the design and marketing of toy cars, games, dolls
and toy animals. The products are made by sub-contractors. Sales are about
Y3bn (Dollars 22.6m) a year. The purchase price was not disclosed.
Mr Koichi Nomura, the president, and his family are selling the company to
Hasbro because of difficult condi-tions in the market, said Nomura.
Hasbro said it was buying Nomura as a way of entering the Japanese market.
It would use Nomura to launch various toys on the market, including board
games.

SAN MIGUEL Corporation, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise,
yesterday reported a 25 per cent increase in net income, excluding
non-recurring items, in the first quarter of the year. Turnover was up 15
per cent in the period.
Net profit in the period was 589m pesos (Dollars 22.87m) on net sales of
13.4bn pesos.
The beer and food conglomerate said the improvement reflected improved
margins and 'better efficiencies and streamlining measures'.
Interest expense, which comprised a large portion of its costs in the past
two years, declined by 17 per cent in the 1992 period because of lower
interest rates.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to offer minority shareholders in
Super Club, its loss-making Belgian-based video rental chain, BFr150
(Dollars 4 1/2 ) per share for the 49 per cent of the company which it does
not already own, writes Ronald van de Krol.
Instead of cash, Super Club shareholders may also choose to receive warrants
on Philips shares worth BFr225 each, the liquidators of Swiss-based Super
Club Holding said.
They said that the price of BFr150 had been agreed with leading minority
shareholders, but it is not yet clear whether all shareholders will be
prepared to accept Philips' offer.
If all the minority shareholders choose the cash alternative, Philips will
have to pay BFr1.26bn to take full control over Super Club.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Sears, Roebuck, the large but ailing US retail and financial
services group, yesterday delivered a strong protest vote at the company's
annual meeting in Atlanta.
Two non-management motions, put forward by 'dissident' shareholders,
attracted the support of more than 40 per cent of all votes cast. This is an
exceptionally large percentage in the US, where institutional investors have
traditionally supported management. Non-supportive votes rarely top the high
teens.
The vote at the meeting comes amid some signs that the corporate governance
climate in the US is shifting. Institutions - in particular, the large
public pension funds - have shown increased willingness to flex their
muscles, and last month non-executive directors at General Motors ousted Mr
Robert Stempel, chairman, from the leadership of a key board committee.
Shareholder dissent has been rumbling at Sears for some years, as the share
price has stagnated and the company has been struggling to get its large but
ailing retail business back on track. Ahead of this year's annual meeting,
dissident shareholders had filed five proposals.
The most widely-supported motion yesterday suggested that the three-year
staggered board terms at Sears should give way to the annual election of all
directors; 41.2 per cent of all votes cast yesterday were in favour of this.
A second motion, to tighten the confidentiality of shareholder voting, won
the support of 40.9 per cent.
A proposal calling for the division of the chairman's and chief executive's
responsibilities between two separate people, won the backing of 27.4 per
cent; a motion asking for an independent study of the break-up values at
Sears found 23.3 per cent of votes in favour; and a suggestion that
directors should hold at least 2,000 shares attracted 19.3 per cent.
The three non-executive board members up for re-election at yesterday's
meeting were also returned.

<TEXT>
CAP GEMINI Sogeti, the leading European computing services group, is seeking
partners to join Germany's Daimler-Benz as shareholders in Sogeti, the
group's holding company, according to Mr Serge Kampf, the CGS chairman.
His comment follows the announcement by CGS that talks with Olivetti, the
loss-making Italian computer manufacturer, which had been going on since the
early part of the year, had been abandoned. A statement said the discussions
had become too complicated for the current state of the computer market,
currently in its worst recession.
The subject of the talks had never been made public but there had been
intense interest in the prospect of a deal between Olivetti, which is
expanding its interests in computing services, and CGS which has remained
independent of computer hardware manufacturers.
Olivetti has a broad range of alliances and associations with other
companies but no single large partnership comparable with the deal concluded
some months ago between Groupe Bull of France and International Business
Machines of the US.
Mr Kampf refused to make predictions for the current financial year but said
revenues in the first quarter amounted to FFr2.44bn (Dollars 448m) compared
with FFr2.49bn in 1991.
A new streamlined and decentralised structure for the company would be
announced next month, he said.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL SAPIN, the French finance minister, has approved a reform of
takeover rules, obliging companies to offer to buy all the shares of
companies they are bidding for, instead of just 66 per cent as previously.
The long expected change, which brings France more in line with UK takeover
practice, comes in response to repeated complaints from minority investors
that they were often left with small amounts of worthless shares in
companies subject to two-thirds bids.
Their frustration became a national issue late last year, when Pinault, the
diversified timber to retailing group, provoked an outcry by obtaining
control of Au Printemps, the department stores group, by launching an offer
for two thirds of the shares.
The plight of minorities won full support from stock exchange authorities,
who argued that clearer takeover rules would help stem the flow of
investment away from Paris to other European stock markets. The reform is
therefore no surprise. Indeed, some investors have already started to launch
full bids, once passing the 33.3 per cent stake at which an offer must be
triggered, instead of making old-style partial offers.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa turns in DM386m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, made a pre-tax loss of DM386m
(Dollars 234m) in the first quarter of 1992 and said it did not expect to
end up in the black this year.
To cut costs, it is shedding 1,000 employees this year and refraining from
new hiring. Originally, it had planned to take on 5,000 new people in 1992,
twice as many as leave normally each year. More jobs will disappear in 1993.
The loss, which came despite a rise of 23 per cent in turnover to DM3.4bn,
was lower than the DM476m of last year's first quarter, but this period was
heavily affected by the Gulf war. Mr Klaus Schlede, finance director, said
the second quarter also showed a loss and he did not expect an operating
profit for the full year.
The airline, in which the German state owns 51 per cent, said its 1991 loss
was DM301m before tax against a profit of DM142m the previous year. The net
loss was DM426m after a profit of DM15m. Turnover was 11 per cent higher at
DM16.1bn, with passenger numbers up by 11 per cent to 29.5m.
As well as the Gulf war, Lufthansa also suffered from the weak world economy
and sharply higher airport and traffic control charges. It has decided not
to take up 11 options on new aircraft in 1993 and to take 23 aircraft out of
service later this year.
Mr Schlede said the Gulf war cost Lufthansa a net DM388m, while airport and
traffic control payments were 24 per cent higher at DM2.1bn. Planned
aircraft sales could not be made because the second-hand aircraft market had
collapsed as a result of airline over-capacity caused by the first drop in
world air traffic since the Second World War.
The airline was also affected by landing and take-off delays, and Mr Jurgen
Weber, the chief executive, said some German airports were no longer
adequate. However, he hoped for some relief from the opening of the new
Munich airport next week.
Mr Schlede said Lufthansa's losses in Germany were around DM350m, with a
seat-load factor of only 55 per cent. Its total worldwide break-even level
is 67 per cent, but last year's seat-load factor was down by three
percentage points to 62 per cent.
Mr Weber said talks with US carriers on a partnership to increase
Lufthansa's access to the US market were continuing. He was also encouraged
by the Bonn government's determination to follow France's tough line and
push for improvements in the US-German airline agreement which he said
favoured the US.

FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: European venture capital rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of venture capital funds invested across Europe rose by 12 per
cent to Ecu4.6bn (Dollars 3.62bn) last year, in spite of the economic
downturn and a reduction of new funding from venture capitalists in the UK.
The findings come in the annual survey of venture capital conducted by the
European Venture Capital Association in conjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accountancy firm, which was released yesterday.
Investment from EC countries outside the UK grew by 29 per cent. UK funds
dropped from Ecu1.9bn in 1990 to Ecu1.7bn last year, but still represent 37
per cent of all European venture capital.
'Our main concern was whether venture capital was going to reflect the
slowdown,' said Mr Miguel Zorita Lees, chairman of the Association. 'It has
managed to weather the storm relatively well.'
There were 4,111 new investments in 1991 amounting to Ecu3.57bn and 2,796
follow-on investments valued at Ecu1.06bn. The average venture capital
investment was Ecu671,000.
Expanding companies and buy-outs accounted for 87 per cent of venture
capital contributed, while seed capital to finance new businesses grew by 49
per cent. But the absolute amount of seed capital - at Ecu46m - remained a
small fraction of all capital.
Mr John Hustler, head of venture capital at KPMG, said: 'Venture capital
investment assists with expansion-financing once a business is up and going.
The big question is how to get more seed-corn investment for start-ups.'
Small companies received the vast majority of venture capital, with 95 per
cent going to enterprises with less than 1,000 employees.
There was little investment in high-technology industries, in which venture
capital investment peaked in 1989. Mr Hustler said this was a function of
the structure of European businesses.
He said there had been a sharp increase in investment in the medical and
health sectors, while venture capitalists were still neglecting
opportunities in telecommunications.

ACCOR, the acquisitive French hotel group, yesterday forecast that its net
profits would rise 10 per cent this year.
Mr Gerard Pelisson, group co-chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting that
he expects net profits of around FFr1.05bn (Dollars 193m) this year, up from
the FFr948.6m reported in 1991. Last year's profit was 5.6 per cent down on
1990, the first fall in the group's history, due to the Gulf war and a
general fall in business travel and tourism.
However, Mr Pelisson warned that trading conditions this year and next would
not be as good as in the four years to 1989, when net profits rose on
average by nearly 35 per cent annually. He expected a stronger recovery in
1994 and 1995.
Accor was planning to sell up to FFr2bn of assets over the next few years,
to reduce debts built up to fund last autumn's FFr2.2bn takeover of Wagons
Lits, the Franco-Belgian group.

BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second largest bank, yesterday

Credit Communal is one of a half dozen public institutions which the Belgian

a more aggressive strategy than the others in linking up with private sector
banks.
BBL said it would explore the 'potential synergy' between the two banks.
The operating results at BBL improved by 17.4 per cent over the past six
months.
At the same time, however, it said it was increasing provisions by 20 per
cent to BFr4.9bn, in order to cover higher risks arising from lending to the
former Soviet Union.

Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh investment management company, is to manage
the stock market investments of Provincial Insurance, the privately-owned
general insurance company.
The Pounds 420m of funds will bring the total managed by Baillie Gifford to
Pounds 5bn, reinforcing its position as the largest Scottish fund manager
and one of the leading independent fund managers in Britain.
Provincial, based at Kendal, Cumbria, hived off its life assurance and unit
trust business to Prolific in 1988 to concentrate on general insurance.
Baillie Gifford is to manage Provincial's insurance reserves and general
funds, which were managed by Prolific. Last year Baillie Gifford won the
contract to manage Provincial's company pension fund.
The Provincial fund will be the largest single block of money under
management at Baillie Gifford after Scottish Mortgage, its biggest
investment trust.

suffers higher tax charge

<TEXT>
BANK OF Ireland, the Dublin-based banking group, yesterday reported a 43 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits from IPounds 53.5m to IPounds 76.8m (Pounds
70m) for the year to March 31.
But a higher tax charge resulted in a more modest 6 per cent rise, from
IPounds 27.4m to IPounds 29.1m, in after-tax profits.
Mr Paul D'Alton, chief financial officer, said the increase in tax to
IPounds 47.7m (IPounds 26.1m) was due to the group doing less tax-based
lending in the past year, and heavier losses in the US which cannot be
offset against profits in Ireland.
Mr Howard Kilroy, the bank's governor, said the group's 'excellent'
performance in the Irish market made this the 'key strategic strength.' A
substantial reduction in loan losses in the UK demonstrated 'that our
operations there are being managed back to profitability' However, in the
US, results from the New Hampshire businesses were 'very disappointing.'
The New Hampshire subsidiary lost IPounds 76.6m, but bank executives believe
that improvements seen in the first quarter figures, with an easing of
loan-loss provisions, mean this trend can be continued through 1992.
Bank of Ireland bought the First New Hampshire Bank in 1988 for Dollars 370m
(Pounds 203m) and has since had to write off almost Dollars 300m against bad
loans.
Mr D'Alton said most of the losses had occurred on the loan portfolio which
the bank assumed at that time. This had been hit by the downturn in the New
Hampshire property market. The bulk of those bad loans had been written off
and although a recovery in the New Hampshire economy was not foreseen in the
short-term the bank was 'cautiously optimistic' that there should be 'a
substantial reduction in losses this year.'
Losses in the UK were cut from IPounds 55.4m to IPounds 21.9m. Profits in
the Irish division rose by IPounds 1.4m to IPounds 131.9m. A one-off payment
of IPounds 7.6m was made in settlement of the recent industrial dispute
which affected all four Irish clearing banks.
Earnings per share were 6.1p (5.7p). The recommended final dividend of 5.84p
makes an unchanged total of 9.17p for the year.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps API achieve Pounds 2m
midway turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHOUT SEEING any real signs of upturn in the UK economy, API Group, the
packaging concern, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.34m for
the six months to March 28, compared with losses of Pounds 849,000
previously.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since February, ascribed the turnround mainly to
'sustainable internal cost improvements' - saving about Pounds 800,000 this
time - though the absence of exceptionals helped; last time there was a
charge of Pounds 570,000.
Last year a hostile bid from NMC, a rival packaging company, was parried, at
a time when, according to Mr Dennis Holt, finance director, API was
'leaderless'.
He was the only remaining executive director and had only been with the
company four months.
The defence against NMC had not left API weaker, claimed Mr Holt, though it
had cost about Pounds 1m and 'had motivated changes'.
Formerly chief executive of DRG, the paper and packaging group, until it
succumbed to Pembridge Investments, Mr Woolley is rebuilding API's depleted
management team.
Mr Eric Holroyd, acting chief executive since last year, is to be replaced
by Mr Mike Smith, chief executive of Jefferson Smurfit's print, packaging
and converting side, at the beginning of June.
Turnover in the six months was flat at Pounds 29.5m and Mr Woolley said he
was now looking to expand annual sales to the Pounds 100m-Pounds 120m mark.
Thanks to cost reductions - which in the period under review involved the
loss of about 140 jobs and significant changes in working practices  - there
was now plenty of available capacity to be exploited.
'The kit is up to date and the plant is running better - the building blocks
are now in place,' Mr Woolley said. The group was financially well
controlled, he added, and 'now it's the sales and marketing side that needs
a boost'. For example, Slaters, the image enhancement company, was only
exporting about 10 per cent of its output.
Earnings worked through at 4.5p (losses 2.7p) per share and the interim
dividend is lifted to 3.05p (2.75p), in line with the forecast in last
year's defence.
Net borrowings were Pounds 2.6m, giving gearing of about 10 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: UK co-managers selected in Wellcome Trust
sale

<TEXT>
Wellcome Trust, which is working towards the sale of the majority of its
73.6 per cent stake in Wellcome, the drugs company, yesterday announced its
selection of co-managers for the UK tranche of the issue.
The sale, which could raise over Pounds 4bn, and is being arranged on a
global basis, is expected in the summer. The co-managers are James Capel,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, Hoare Govett and NM Rothschild.
Co-managers in other regional syndicates will be announced later. It is
expected that a UK house will be included in the US syndicate because few US
brokers have published research on Wellcome.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Warning by British Gas after quarterly
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday warned that a combination of warm winter weather, low
oil prices and increasing regulation could damage results this year, as it
revealed an 11.5 per cent drop in first quarter current cost pre-tax
profits.
The stock market showed little surprise at the results, and the shares
closed down 4 1/2 p at 250 1/2 p. This was despite the company's
announcement that it would reduce prices to 17.8m domestic customers by 3
per cent from July.
Profit came to Pounds 860m (Pounds 973m) from turnover of Pounds 3.58bn
(Pounds 3.69bn). But the company said its underlying business remained
strong, with continued growth in the key tariff market sector, which
consisted mainly of domestic customers.
In the UK gas supply sector, operating profit was down to Pounds 719m
(Pounds 834m). Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said warm winter weather led to a
5 per cent fall in demand against 1991, and an 8 per cent drop compared with
what would be expected in a normal winter.
Sales in the tariff market showed strong underlying growth of 3 per cent,
although contract sales to larger customers fell 14 per cent because of a
combination of lower economic activity and increased market share by
competitors.
Mr Evans said 26 per cent of the UK firm gas market was now being supplied
by competitors to British Gas, equivalent to 15 per cent of the total market
including interruptible gas.
Profits from UK marketing activities were Pounds 7m higher through an
improved performance from installation and contracting. But flat appliance
trading sales reflected the continued slump in retailing.
Operating profits in the overseas gas supply sector rose to Pounds 71m
(Pounds 68m).
The exploration and production sector, in which British Gas is looking for
substantial growth in coming years as its share of UK gas supply is reduced,
suffered a slight downturn in profits to Pounds 104m (Pounds 111m). This was
mainly the result of lower oil prices, although sales, at 29.7m barrels of
oil equivalent, showed an increased from last year's 27.9m barrels.
Earnings per share came to 13.7p (15.1p).
Mr Evans said management faced a 'monumental challenge' in maintaining its
levels of profitability, confronted with the cost of hiving off the pipeline
business into a separate subsidiary. It must also reduce the share of the
industrial gas supply market, and face competition in the commercial gas
supply sector from later this year.
Analysts warned that while British Gas had long known its core domestic
supply business would reach saturation point in the second half of the
1990s, it was now facing an earlier-than-expected slowdown in that market.
The need to invest in the exploration and production and global gas supply
market to compensate for this would cut down the room for manoeuvre in
reducing its spending.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mid-States lower in difficult year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mid-States, the Nashville-based automotive parts distributor quoted on the
USM, reported 1991 pre-tax profits down from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 3.73m in
an 'extremely difficult year' for the US motor industry.
However, the company said that it had increased market share appreciably.
Turnover increased 17 per cent to Pounds 48.9m (Pounds 41.9m) mainly
reflecting a full 12 months contribution from two acquisitions in 1990.
Net interest costs increased from Pounds 169,000 to Pounds 735,000 due to
debt to fund acquisitions.
Earnings per share fell to 6.3p (8.9p). The proposed final dividend is
maintained at 2.25p for a total of 3p.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fleming European Fledgeling down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fleming European Fledgeling Investment Trust reported a 2 per cent fall in
net asset value per share to 74.4p at March 31 1992, against 76.1p a year
earlier.
Net revenue for the year dropped from Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 33,000,
giving earnings per share of 0.08p (0.48p).
As foreshadowed, no dividend will be paid due to the company moving to a
fully invested position and the low yields available on smaller European
companies.
The trust said it invested primarily for capital growth and any dividend
payments in normal circumstances were unlikely.

RIT Capital Partners achieved a 7 per cent rise in net asset value in the
year to March 31, ending at 140.7p, against 131.7p previously.
Investment income fell 19 per cent to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 14.2m) reflecting
the change in policy towards investing in equities against fixed interest
securities. Interest payable jumped to Pounds 3.09m (Pounds 1.87m) and after
tax of Pounds 2.38m (Pounds 3.07m) net profit declined 48 per cent to Pounds
3.7m (Pounds 7.17m).
A dividend of 1.15p (2.44p) is proposed for the year on earnings per share
of 1.69p (3.53p) undiluted and 1.61p (2.89p) diluted.

Helped by a surplus on sale of property, James Finlay, the overseas trading
and financial services group, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.52m to
Pounds 10.8m in 1991.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 144m (Pounds 149m) but the operating surplus rose
to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 11.1m) with the help of a Pounds 1.3m profit from
the sale of property by George Payne.
Contribution from plantations was held at Pounds 4.34m, confectionery and
beverage provided Pounds 6.57m (Pounds 4.56m) including the property deal,
merchant banking and international confirming moved from a Pounds 49,000
loss into a Pounds 729,000 profit.
Trading, manufacturing and merchanting saw a decline to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds
3.15m), property accounted for Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 343,000), and oil and
gas interests showed a deficit of Pounds 75,000 (surplus Pounds 324,000).
Geographically, the two biggest contributors were the UK and Africa with
Pounds 7.08m (Pounds 4.54m) and Pounds 5.08m (Pounds 3.77m) respectively.
North America fell behind at Pounds 985,000 (Pounds 2.53m) as did Asia with
Pounds 344,000 (Pounds 1.6m), but Australasia cut its loss to Pounds 645,000
(Pounds 1.36m).
Earnings per share were 6.8p (6p) and the dividend is held at 4.15p with a
second interim of 2.15p.

With the inclusion of exceptional credits John Foster &amp; Son, the specialist
textile group, made substantial inroads into its losses in the year to
February 28.
Trading conditions remained depressed, with the resultant intense
competition for business. Turnover fell to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 26.6m) but
the operating deficit was reduced to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.56m); taking in
credits of Pounds 1.02m (debits Pounds 676,000) left the year's pre-tax loss
at Pounds 381,000 (Pounds 2.24m).
Losses per share were 2.3p (14p) after tax credits of Pounds 131,000 (Pounds
678,000). The dividend is again 0.5p.
Mr David Allen, managing director, reported that the balance sheet was
strong, new products and designs had been well received and, despite two
difficult years, the group was in good shape.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: N America boosts Hartstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPANSION into the fragmented North American leather market helped
Hartstone, the hosiery and leathergoods supplier, reveal profits almost
trebled at Pounds 22.1m last year on sales which increased more than three
times to Pounds 237.8m.
Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the company had increased market share in
both divisions during the 12 months to March 31. Hartstone claims the
world's number one position for leathergoods distribution and is Europe's
second largest hosiery manufacturing and distribution group.
The acquisition of Michael Stevens and Etienne Aigner last year contributed
most of the rise in the leathergoods division, which increased from Pounds
4.2m to Pounds 19.8m at the operating level.
Mr Trevor Brentnall, head of the North American leathergoods operation, said
the two US businesses had shown significant like-for-like growth. Sales at
Michael Stevens were ahead 84 per cent, while Etienne Aigner improved
turnover by 14 per cent. Both businesses had increased margins by improving
sourcing and were also benefiting from a strengthened management team.
Hosiery rose on the inclusion for three months of the Spanish and French
companies, Aznar and Cogetex, which contributed Pounds 1.5m. Operating
profits for the whole division advanced by Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 5.8m.
Mr Barker said margins in the UK hosiery business had suffered from
overstocking by retailers. However, the relaunch of Bear Brand in the autumn
had resulted in significant increases in volume.
Hartstone was also making good progress on tapping the growing European
hypermarket sector. The French Well brand of tights had already been
introduced into Spanish, Dutch and Belgian supermarkets.
Capital expenditure came to Pounds 6.5m, compared with a depreciation charge
of Pounds 3.8m. Most of the spending had been devoted to increasing
warehousing space at Michael Stevens and opening 18 Etienne Aigner stores in
the US for a total of 30.
Depreciation would rise sharply to Pounds 7.6m next year, compared with
capital spending of Pounds 6.5m, due to Aznar and Cogetex. Mr Barker said it
was likely that the group would exercise its option to buy Aznar Industrial,
the lingerie arm of Aznar, in January.
Hartstone ended the year with gearing of about 50 per cent and interest
cover of 7.4 times. Interest charges rose sharply from Pounds 648,000 to
Pounds 3.4m.
Earnings per share advanced from 15.1p to 21.1p. The proposed final dividend
is raised from 2p to 3p, for a total of 4.875p (3.25p).

In another difficult interim period, Tomkinsons, the floor coverings group,
limited its drop in sales to just over 4 per cent, but saw pre-tax profit
fall by 22 per cent.
For the six months to March 21, sales came to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 10.4m) and
profit to Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 491,000) after interest charges were cut to
Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 65,000).
Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, was confident that the performance would prove
to be better than many competitors. He said an operating margin of 3.9 per
cent, coupled with low gearing of 1.5 per cent, continued to demonstrate
underlying strength.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.5p. Earnings per share dropped 1p to
4.2p.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Tight cost controls and greater efficiency
behind Fine Art rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Fine Art Developments rose 15p to 440p on news that the mail order
and greetings card company had achieved a 12 per cent rise, to Pounds 29.7m,
in pre-tax profits over the year to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 26.6m was struck on turnover ahead a more modest 3 per
cent to Pounds 287.3m.
Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said there were no indications of recovery in
the retail sector - Fine Art's progress was gained through 'tight cost
controls and increased efficiency'. The company had to 'really fight for its
sales'.
However, he acknowledged that, although manufacturers of white goods, for
example, might suffer in a recession, the public tended to continue buying
greetings cards, even if they traded down.
In the same vein, Mr Chapman said Home Farm Hampers - the business where
people pay throughout the year for food for a 'decent Christmas' -
traditionally did well in hard times. Sales rose 65 per cent with a
substantial increase in profits.
Overall, the mail order side made operating profits of Pounds 20.7m (Pounds
18.7m) on turnover of Pounds 150m (Pounds 146m), helped by the Pounds 31m
capital investment in an automated order fulfilment system at the warehouse
at Accrington, Lancashire.
However, both Express Gifts and the charities business suffered downturns in
the value of average orders, though the overseas side - which serves markets
in France, South Africa and Germany - made gains, especially in France.
Since the year-end, Fine Art has expanded across the Atlantic with the
acquisition of Tom-Wat of Connecticut for Dollars 1m (Pounds 550,000) cash.
A provider of charity mail order services, it has annual turnover of Dollars
18m.
The educational mail order business lifted profits and market share.
Operating profits and turnover in the card and paper products division both
rose 3 per cent to Pounds 19.3m and Pounds 137.4m respectively. The success
of Hambledon Studios and Gallery Studios was offset by the small loss at
Papertree, the retail chain. Mr Chapman said he wanted to cut the number of
outlets, from the current 80 and the 115 of 18 months ago, to less than 70.
Earnings rose 10 per cent to 25.36p (22.96p) per share and the proposed
final dividend is lifted by 1p to 8.3p for a total of 11p (9.8p).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR the disposal of Macmillan and Official Airline Guides will not be
determined before June, creditors to Maxwell Communication Corporation were
told yesterday.
A group of 200 creditors overwhelmingly endorsed proposals for the future
changes at MCC in their first meeting since the group went into
administration under UK insolvency law last December.
Mr Mark Homan, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse and one of the
joint administrators, told 200 creditors at the Cafe Royal in London that he
was considering legal action against past and present directors of MCC.
He said two further small European subsidiaries will be sold in the next few
weeks.
Nimbus, the Wales-based manufacturer of compact disks, is to be sold by the
end of this month, and Panini, an Italian manufacturer of stickers, by early
June.
The administrators, in consultation with JP Morgan, the merchant bank
appointed recently to advise them, had not yet decided how to sell Macmillan
and Official Airline Guides, Mr Homan said.
They are still trying to decide whether to use two large sales, dispose of
the underlying assets of the two groups piecemeal, or reorganise the group
and distribute their shares to creditors.
Asked about possible legal action, he said investigations on the recovery of
'mis-applied' assets were continuing. 'We are not ruling out legal action
but it is too early to say who we would be taking action against.'
There are about 3,000 creditors and 7,000 bondholders to MCC, owed a total
of Pounds 1.5bn.
A five-strong creditors' committee was formed at the meeting, comprising
representatives from the Bank of Novia Scotia, Chase Manhattan, Credit
Lyonnais, Fuji Bank, and Bayerische Vereinsbanke - which represents a number
of bondholders.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPA to enlarge UK and Irish float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA is planning to sell more shares in the UK and Ireland in next month's
flotation, according to indicative figures published in the preliminary
registration in the US.
The filing came as Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of the aircraft leasing group,
yesterday launched the pathfinder UK and Ireland prospectus which values the
shares on offer at about Dollars 800m (Pounds 452m) and the group as a whole
at Dollars 2.4bn.
As reported, the company is issuing 28m new shares and 12m of the 95m
existing shares, excluding convertibles, are to be sold by existing
shareholders.
The 40m new shares (which are doubled following a 1-for-1 scrip issue) are
to be priced between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12.50. American depository
receipts, comprising of two shares, will be priced between Dollars 20 and
Dollars 25.
Advisers to the sale said the allocation between UK and Ireland, New York,
Japan and the rest of the world would depend on demand. However, the US
preliminary registration document, which gives indicative figures, shows
that the group expects to sell slightly more shares in the UK with the rest
evenly split although amounts may change by the time of the sale.
A UK prospectus offer for sale will be published on Monday June 8 with
pricing, allocation and commencement of the sale on June 17.
GPA also confirmed that 75 per cent of its shareholders had agreed to a
binding lock-up agreement not to sell their shares for a year after the
float, with a further 11 per cent giving morally binding commitments.
Nomura, the Japanese global co-ordinator, is confident of persuading a few
of the 14 per cent of shareholders which have not signed a binding lock-up
agreement to do so within the month.
The group also announced its year end results which showed a 2 per cent
increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 268m (Dollars 262m) for the year
ended March 31 1992. Fully diluted earnings per share were up 4 per cent to
Dollars 2.30 (Dollars 2.21).
Mr Maurice Foley, chief executive, said the results showed the resilience of
the group during the 'most severe recession since the beginning of the jet
era'.
The extent to which the company evolved over the past few years was
illustrated by the lastest breakdown of revenues.
Over the past year aircraft leasing increased to 42 per cent or Dollars 837m
while sales of aircraft fell back to 56 per cent or Dollars 1.1bn. Fees,
commission and other income accounted for just 2 per cent or Dollars 46m.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pentland US arm to float on NYSE with
Dollars 120m-Dollars 135m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND, the sporting goods supplier which owns the Speedo brand name,
yesterday announced that Authentic Fitness Corporation, its US affiliate, is
to float on the New York Stock Exchange with a value of between Dollars 120m
and Dollars 135m (Pounds 68m to Pounds 76m).
Proceeds will be used to pay AFC's heavy debt burden, the legacy of a highly
leveraged Dollars 85m management buy-out in 1990. After the float, AFC is
expected to have about Dollars 20m in debt.
AFC, which designs and sources Speedo in the US, intends to come to the
market in July with 3m shares at a price to be pitched between Dollars 14
and Dollars 16. Pentland, which paid Dollars 10m for its 39 per cent stake
in 1990, will see its holding fall to about 26 per cent.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said the float would benefit Pentland
next year through an increased contribution from associated undertakings.
AFC's high interest payments, which were Dollars 7.4m in the nine months to
March 31 1992, would be substantially reduced, he said. AFC's pre-tax
profits rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 5m in the same period.
Pentland had no intention of further diluting its holding in AFC, Mr Farrant
added. The Dollars 10m investment had been written off 18 months ago and now
represented a value of between Dollars 31m and Dollars 35m. The UK group
retained its worldwide rights to the Speedo name and would continue to
receive royalties from AFC.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the Luxembourg-listed life assurance and property
group, and Capital &amp; Counties, the UK property group in which TransAtlantic
owns a majority stake, yesterday announced terms for a recommended merger.
As part of the deal, TransAtlantic will make an application to list its
shares in London.
The market capitalisation of the enlarged group would amount to Pounds 970m.
Last month, TransAtlantic, which is advised by SG Warburg, the merchant
bank, announced a one-for-four rights issue to raise Pounds 149m.
Principal terms of the merger are: five TransAtlantic ordinary for every six
C&amp;C shares; 100 TransAtlantic 6 per cent convertible preference shares for
every 100 C&amp;C 5.75 per cent convertible preference; and 65p cash plus
accrued dividends for each C&amp;C 4.2 per cent preference share.
Explaining the move Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of TransAtlantic, said it
would increase his company's ability to raise capital and was something
'that we have been trying to achieve for a long time.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert gives warning of 'substantial'
pre-tax loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSURES of a factory and a warehouse and the abandonment of a
leisurewear line has led Jacques Vert, the womenswear group, to warn of a
substantial pre-tax loss for the year just ended.
Yesterday's warning that there would be a substantial exceptional charge in
the annual results follows a fundamental review of operations. Before
exceptionals, the group had been expected to break even at best.
The problems came to light in January when the group shocked the market with
a Pounds 125,000 pre-tax loss for the six months to October 26. About Pounds
1m profit had been expected compared with the previous year's Pounds 1.23m.
The factory to be closed is at Upton, Yorkshire, mainly used for making
skirts. Mr Malcolm Heald, who has replaced Mr Sashi Mylvaganam as finance
director, said it had been losing money for some time. One of the nails in
its coffin was the prospect of having an open-cast coal mine next door to
it.
Production would mainly be replaced by outside sources. The group has been
making nearly 60 per cent of its goods in-house.
The discontinuance of the Alain Cannelle leisurewear label, which had
quality problems, would also mean closing a warehouse in Harlow.
In closing the two main sources of group losses, 174 jobs would be lost,
leaving the total workforce at 750.
Mr Heald said the Jacques Vert label and JV Plus had remained profitable.
The write-offs would reduce shareholders' funds, which stood at Pounds 11.7m
in April 1991. Net debt was about Pounds 6m at the interim stage and had not
materially changed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company which runs protection programmes for tropical rain forests and
non-human primates is the new owner of Oxford United Football Club.
Biomass Recycling has bought the 89.5 per cent stake in the club previously
owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell from Buchler Phillips, the receivers of
his private estate.
Mr Tim Midgley, a Biomass director, said one of the aims would be to create
'an ecologically benign stadium'. For example, solar panels in the roofs of
the stands could charge batteries to run the floodlights.
With thousands of fans coming through the turnstiles each week, the stadium
would demonstrate the sustainable use of materials and energy. It was a way
of promoting the Biomass ethic, which also included community involvement.
'We started as a group of conservationists 15 years ago and felt we could
have a major impact on the rain forest and its sustainable use.' But with so
much forest still being cut down, 'we realised that we also had to do it by
education.'
Oxford United is set to move out of its cramped five-acre Manor Road ground
in Headington.
Mr Midgley said that although the club had come close to being put into
administration, it was operating profitably. 'it does not have debts as
such, but it has several legal problems over several sums of money.'
Mr Peter Phillips, the receiver, said that although the club was only a
small part of the estate, it had taken 700 man hours to sort out the sale.
He said the chasing of Mr Maxwell's assets was 'like putting a jigsaw
together when you have no picture on the box.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Arjo Wiggins chief quits over strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN WALLS, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French
paper group, is leaving the company after losing a board-room battle over
strategy.
Mr Walls, known as a deal-maker, was prevented from making a substantial
acquisition by AWA's board. The decision and subsequent resignation
represents a significant change in direction for the group which may adopt a
much more conservative management style. It also represents a victory for
AWA's French minority shareholders.
Mr Walls, 44, will leave the company in September.
He was managing director at Plessey before the electronics group was taken
over by General Electric Company and Siemens of West Germany. He is believed
to have left Plessey with about Pounds 1m from his outstanding contract and
share options. He was earning nearly Pounds 400,000 a year at AWA.
Analysts believe Mr Walls wanted to buy a 35 per cent stake in KNP, a Dutch
manufacturer of coated paper which also has substantial paper merchanting
operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
The deal, worth as much as Pounds 400m, was opposed by AWA's non-executive
directors, which include Mr Nicholas Worms, senior partner of Maison Worms,
Mr Pierre Dufournier, a former chairman of Arjomari-Prioux, and Mr Bernard
Dumon, managing director of Saint-Louis.
Mr Henry Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, was a non-executive director
until 10 days ago when he resigned over 'differences of principle'. Mr Wendt
said yesterday his resignation was not for public discussion.
Analysts believe the acquisition of KNP would have required raising money
from the market and a dilution of the French interests in the company.
Worms et Cie, the French financial group, indirectly owns about 39 per cent
of AWA. It holds a 38 per cent stake in St Louis, which owns 97 per cent of
Arjomari-Prioux which in turn holds 39 per cent of AWA. However, French
sources deny the deal would have diluted their stake.
Analysts believe Mr Walls wanted to take advantage of AWA's low gearing and
the present low prices commanded by paper companies which have been hit by
over-capacity and demand.

FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Initial excitement at Grand Metropolitan's interim figures proved
short-lived yesterday. Though the 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was
above best expectations, a large part of the gain was thanks to currency
movements. Organic growth in the continuing businesses was only 2 per cent.
And while the interest charge was cut by 42 per cent compared with the same
period of 1990-91, net borrowings have actually increased slightly since
September.
The market's second thoughts may nevertheless have been overdone. Organic
growth would have been higher without the losses at Pearle, which will
doubtless eventually be set on its feet and sold. The borrowing figure was
inflated by both a seasonal rise in working capital and the fact that
disposal proceeds of some Pounds 170m had not been received when the
accounts were struck. There may be a wait before economic recovery is felt,
but longer-term prospects make a rating just below the market average look
grudging.

FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was rightly impressed by Shell's first quarter figures. In the
same period, the big US oil companies' net incomes on a replacement cost
basis fell between 40 and 60 per cent and BP's dropped nearly 90 per cent.
Stripping out exceptional credits, Shell managed to limit the damage to less
than a third of its income. It also generated Pounds 1bn of surplus cash and
invested Pounds 1.2bn, leaving gearing at a mere 5 per cent. In the oil
sector at least, Shell is not so much ahead of the pack as in a class of its
own.
Its present strength comes from its diversity. The US market was predictably
awful but was more than offset by growth in European gas volumes and a
strong downstream performance in the Far East. Its huge investment programme
is already paying off, and the group is scarcely under peer pressure to
increase its dividend any faster. Although the sector's cyclical problems
are not over yet, Shell looks singularly well set for the long term.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, a multiple of 9.8 to 11.9 times historic earnings - well
below the UK market average - looks a meagre valuation for a company with
GPA's track record and global ambition. In view of the unusually public
brouhaha over the offer price, it raises the question of whether investors
are ending up with a bargain.
Certainly GPA has had to counter an image problem from the start, not least
because of unpleasant comparisons with the ill-fated business of computer
leasing. Under UK and Irish accounting rules, to be sure, the company takes
the profit on its aircraft sales up front notwithstanding any liability to
meet lease payments if an airline customer goes bust. A depreciation policy
of 25 years with a 15 per cent residual value, moreover, is a bit racy by
some people's standards. That said, something pretty bizarre would have to
happen for GPA's assets to end up as technologically obsolete as Atlantic's
computers. The second-hand market for the sort of aircraft in GPA's
predominantly modern fleet looks reasonably stable, and the manufacturers
have a strong vested interest in keeping it that way.
Given the one year lock-in provisions for existing shareholders and the
company's prediction yesterday that a pick-up in leasing rates may still be
18 months away, some may be tempted to wait and pick up shares in the
after-market. But this may be the kind of recovery story which stock markets
like to climb aboard good and early.

FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two possible reactions to the resignation of Arjo Wiggins
Appleton's chief executive five days before the annual meeting. First, the
company is better off for having resolved its internal tensions, however
brusquely. Second, the event is alarming evidence of strategic disarray at
the heart of one of Europe's biggest paper-makers.
The latter judgment is probably not so much wrong as premature. At the heart
of the row is not merely a disagreement over whether to grow aggressively by
acquisition. There is also a classic confrontation between the traditional
autonomy of an Anglo-Saxon chief executive and the traditional controlling
rights of a 40 per cent French shareholder. St Louis must now demonstrate
that its preferred and safer route of organic investment need not mean
unexciting earnings growth. In view of the prospective upturn in the paper
cycle, that may not prove too difficult. But the London stock market will
also want St Louis to make clear, if only through its choice of a new chief
executive, whether it wants Arjo Wiggins to continue as an Anglo-French
merger or become a French company pure and simple.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless Olympia &amp; York will provoke more than a passing shudder in the
banking and property sectors by seeking protection from its creditors. But,
in practice, its situation will be no worse than it was before. It might
even be better, since protection would clear the way for an orderly
work-out. Otherwise the process could become dangerously bogged down in
sniping between groups of lenders to one or other arm of the Reichmann
empire. If creditors are now wondering what their security was ever really
worth, at least they can be reasonably assured of equal pain.
If bank lenders have tacitly agreed to the plan, it also seems safe to
assume that they have decided the pain will be bearable. There is certainly
no systemic risk. Mexico had eight times as much debt as O&amp;Y when it
defaulted in 1982, even before inflating the figure to today's values. O&amp;Y
also has assets, which must be worth more than a Mexican promise to repay
appeared to its shocked bankers 10 years ago.
Still, O&amp;Y's banks face a protracted and complex restructuring with heavy
bills for write-downs and unpaid interest. That much is probably already
reflected in bank share prices. The main danger now is that the O&amp;Y debacle
could worsen the troubles confronting the rest of the property market. In
this broader context, the protection that O&amp;Y is seeking from its creditors
may afford the latter some protection too.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Council spending statement may be delayed until autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROBABLE DELAY in the announcement about next year's overall local
government spending is set to cause difficulties in the negotiations over
arrangements for the first year of the council tax.
The government usually announces in July the maximum amount it believes
local government should spend in the following financial year (total
standard spending) and the total amount of external support through
government grant and the business rate. However, the Department of the
Environment believes that this year the statement may have to wait until
October.
The likely delay is already being interpreted as a sign of how tight the
coming public spending round will be. Environment ministers believe it is
vital to secure a reasonable revenue support grant settlement for next year
to ensure that the first year of the council tax does not produce the sharp
rises in bills that bedevilled the first year of the poll tax.
One problem is that ministers still do not have detailed information about
the tax base for the council tax, under which bills will be based largely on
the value of the property in one of eight bands.
The valuation exercise is not expected to be completed until the end of next
month at the earliest, and until its results are available it is difficult
for ministers to know the scale of the transitional relief scheme they will
want to put in place. 'I don't see how we can say anything sensible until
the autumn,' one official commented.
A further complication is that the extra money to go to local authorities to
take account of their new duties in providing community care has yet to be
sorted out.
The government is still considering whether the grant should be
'ring-fenced' to ensure that councils cannot spend it on other services.
The department's difficulties have been increased by the plan for the House
of Commons to disband for the summer recess in mid-July, slightly earlier
than usual.
The news emerged as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, announced
in the Commons that the government intended to limit the spending of 10
English local authorities that had breached the criteria for 'capping' which
had been set out in advance.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, warned that the
Department of the Environment and the Treasury were 'locked in a battle
which will leave local government the loser. This is a bad start for Mr
Howard's tenure at the department.'

<TEXT>
Sir, You report (People, May 13) that a deputy secretary in the Environment
Department has just been made a non-executive director of Anglian Water.
'There will be no conflict of interest,' you say, 'because the department
has been restructured' following the privatisation of the water companies.
You say that the appointee has also been a director of a subsidiary of John
Laing.
Such appointments are and always will be particularly insensitive and
inappropriate. The fact that a public servant has the time to devote to one
or more non-executive board appointments and the fact that remuneration is
paid for such services are matters of considerable public interest.
I hope that the powers that be in the Environment Department (or indeed any
other department) will look again at this and any similar appointments and
realise that the granting of such permission is an error of judgment which
should not be allowed.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: Carbon tax a dead duck for EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARCUS RAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Carbon tax faces Europe with steep cost rises' (May 14)
raises a number of key issues. By making the proposed tax conditional on the
US and Japan following suit, the EC tax is in fact a massive dead duck with
no chance of being implemented. The US has resisted any proposal to reduce
its own emissions, and is certain to ignore this.
In reaching this 'achievement', the EC has abandoned plans for Europe-wide
renewable energy and efficiency initiatives. These initiatives, like the
carbon tax, are necessary to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by 2000 to
1990 levels.
The net result of this massive compromise to the fossil fuel lobby will,
according to the EC's own analysis, result in a 12 per cent increase in the
emissions of carbon dioxide by 2000.
The conditionality of this announcement has effectively handed over EC
decision making on global warming to a former oil company head: George Bush.
The best the EC can offer in the build up to the Earth Summit is to do
nothing. But by doing nothing the EC has taken a determined step: to
increase its contribution to global warming.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: Auditors: questions of responsibility and of cost
(2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BERNARD JUBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For the enlightenment of the outgoing president of the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants ('Move to cut audits attacked', May 8),
the cost of an audit is a regressive 'tax' on small businesses.
With 78 per cent of all UK companies having an annual turnover of less than
Pounds 100,000 (only 2 per cent with a turnover of more than Pounds 1m and 1
per cent more than Pounds 10m) most businesses are very small.
The business development unit of Manchester Business School has produced
figures from which it can be shown that the cost to a company with a
turnover of Pounds 20,000-Pounds 50,000 is between 5.5 and 2.2 per cent of
turnover, while for a company with Pounds 1.5m-Pounds 2m turnover it is only
0.3 to 0.2 per cent, a difference of 25 times at the two extremes.
When a business is wholly-owned by husband/wife the additional cost of an
audit over and above the accountancy fees is obtrusive and worthless. It is
also an unnecessary extra cost and the sooner it is scrapped the better.

appropriate that you should publish it on the same day as the radical
Auditing Practices Board proposals to widen the power and scope of auditors.
Although auditing is long established, it is not yet the oldest profession
in the world. It should therefore heed carefully Kipling's famous warning
about 'power without responsibility . . . .'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Making sense of the auditor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALL its merits, the traditional British audit report, with its central
assertion about the truth and fairness of company accounts, did not stand up
well to the test of the financial scandals and corporate collapses of the
1980s. The mandarin phraseology of the report has always meant more to
auditors than to those whom the auditors are supposed to serve. And since
the true and fair formula appeared to hold out the promise of certainty in
an area where subjective judgment is critically important, it gave a
dangerously misleading impression to people whose grasp of accounting was
limited - a category which, if academic surveys are to be believed, includes
a majority of British fund managers.
So much the better, then, that Britain's new Auditing Practices Board is
setting out to make the auditor's report more informative. In one of its
first three exposure drafts for public comment, published this week, the
board is seeking to clarify the role of the auditor and to explain how the
audit process has dealt with uncertainties that remain unresolved when
financial statements are approved.
The clarification of the auditor's role will no doubt provide satisfaction
to the board's own immediate constituency since it will emphasise the
narrowness of the auditor's remit. It has always been the directors' job to
prepare the accounts, while the auditor's duty is merely to express an
opinion. We will now be reminded of this division of labour ad infinitum in
the annual report.
Judgmental areas
The more substantive reform concerns the judgmental areas in company
accounts. Under existing auditing standards, the audit report has far too
little to say about the nature of the uncertainty affecting the accounts.
The threat of a qualified report has admittedly given auditors a stick with
which to prompt management into making fuller disclosure in the notes to the
accounts. Yet where the auditor's report is unqualified, the reader of the
financial statements may not be aware of the significance of a given note
within the context of a difficult audit process. On other occasions, the
auditor will express a qualified opinion without giving adequate information
to explain the implications for the business.
The Auditing Practices Board now proposes that the auditor should qualify an
opinion only where there is genuine disagreement over the accounting
treatment of uncertainty and the adequacy of its disclosure; or, again,
where uncertainty is caused by management placing some limit on the scope of
the auditor's work. The auditor will be required to draw readers' attention
to those uncertainties that are so fundamental that a judgment one way or
the other could have a serious impact on the picture that the accounts
reveal. And the basis of the auditor's opinion will be supported by a brief
description of audit procedures.
Weak link
This is potentially helpful. But it is important to remember that audit
failures in the 1980s were not solely to do with the uninformative nature of
the auditor's report. There is a weak link in the chain of accountability,
in that the auditor's fees, though formally sanctioned by the shareholders,
are for all practical purposes in the gift of the management on whose
stewardship the auditor is supposed to pass an independent opinion. The
quality of audit judgments has also declined as the big accounting firms
have come to regard the audit function - privately, if not in public - as a
loss leader for lucrative consultancy services. To make matters worse, the
judgment in the recent Caparo case limited the auditor's liability for
negligence to present shareholders, leaving third parties wholly
unprotected.
A tighter framework of accountability is needed. And it may not be enough
simply to call for disclosure of consultancy fees from audit clients, as the
Cadbury committee is shortly expected to do. The auditor must be seen to be
free from such conflicts of interest. Whether that can be achieved without
restructuring the accountancy profession is a moot point. But such an
upheaval may, in the end, be unavoidable. In the meantime, a statutory
clarification and extension of the auditor's responsibility to all
stakeholders in the business is badly needed.

FT  15 MAY 92 / No more jobs for the boys: 'Non-employment' is the burning
issue, not 'unemployment'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slow growth and rising unemployment are fuelling social discontent across
the developed world: anti-immigration French nationalism, a threatened
general strike in Spain, rising crime in Britain, riots in America are all
worrying examples.
At next week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Economic
Co-operation and Development in Paris unemployment is at the top of the
agenda. Yet the representatives of the world's richest and most successful
market economies will have little alternative but to wring their hands and
shake their heads. Everyone knows unemployment is a problem; but nobody
fully understands why it has remained so high for so long, or how to reduce
it.
The ostensible cause of the rich countries' renewed concern is the
combination of forthcoming elections and rising unemployment: not one with
which politicians can feel happy. But a deeper sense of unease is revealed
in the internal OECD papers prepared for next week's meetings. These
describe how the developed countries have become increasingly troubled by
the links between joblessness and economic deprivation: drug use and abuse,
racial tensions and a rising tide of crime and violence. The OECD fears that
the economic slowdown, and ensuing increase in unemployment, will make these
problems both more perceptible and acute, with dangerous consequences for
social cohesion and political stability.
At least the OECD is sure that it understands the facts: unemployment has
risen in almost every important member country in the 1980s; the rise was
concentrated among men, not women; it has remained persistently and
exceptionally high in Europe.
The experience of two countries that did not follow the trend - the US and
Sweden - are the basis for the OECD's rather tentative policy
recommendations. America's flexible and deregulated labour markets have
allowed it to to absorb a large inflow of immigrant labour, without any
apparent rise in unemployment, while Sweden's extensive and expensive labour
market programmes underpin the OECD's support for 'active' policy measures
to re-train the unemployed and help them back to work.
But is the OECD's reading of the facts correct? The concentration of
long-term unemployment in Europe is only part of the wider picture. By
focusing on 'unemployment' - people who are available and actively looking
for work - the OECD excludes a group that should be of great importance to
policy-makers: people who have no jobs and have given up the search for
employment.
Male labour force participation has dropped sharply over the past decade as
many have shifted from being 'unemployed' to 'economically inactive'. The
common characteristic of these two groups is that they do not have jobs; all
can be classified under the general heading of 'non-employed'.
The international pattern of non-employment looks different from that for
registered unemployment. The US may be a low 'unemployment' country, but it
is a low employment country too as the chart shows. The US has, in fact,
been the standard on which the rest of Europe has converged. The
non-employment rate of men aged 25-55 has doubled in the US since 1970, but
tripled in the UK, France and Germany.
This suggests the OECD should be asking two fundamental questions: Why do so
few men work now, compared with 20 years ago? And what do they do, instead?
Slow growth: Unemployment rises in recessions when growth is depressed. The
OECD's latest forecasts are for subdued growth of 1.8 per cent among OECD
countries this year. .The European unemployment rate is expected to jump
from 8.7 per cent in 1991 to 9.4 per cent in 1992, and continue rising into
next year. Yet slow growth cannot explain why non-employment remained so
high throughout the period of strong economic growth in the latter half of
the 1980s.
Unions and real wages: Alternatively, maybe trade union 'insiders' pushed up
their real wages when growth picked up, preventing the unemployed
'outsiders' from being re-employed. If so, advises Professor Dennis Snower
of Birkbeck College, London University, governments should reduce trade
union power and make it easier to fire insiders by reducing severance pay or
simplifying firing procedures.
This is music to the OECD's ears; but does it fit the facts? The pace of
real wage growth across Europe in the 1980s was rapid in light of the
overhang of unemployment, especially in the UK. But why did this rise in
non-employment in the UK occur when trade union membership was falling and
labour market regulations were being relaxed?
Co-ordinated wage bargaining: The pattern of wage bargaining is yet another
explanation for permanently high non-employment. Trade unions may be more
effective in obtaining higher real wages for their members when collective
bargaining is decentralised as in the UK, rather than centrally co-ordinated
as in Germany and Sweden (as the chart shows). Unions encourage employers to
pay above-average wage settlements to motivate their workers, but at the
expense of higher wage inflation.
Sweden's centralised wage bargaining requires comparatively small increases
in unemployment to bring inflation under control. Yet Australia has suffered
from high non-employment despite centralised bargining and moderate real
wage growth.
Disincentives for job search: Vacancies were high in the late 1980s, so
either the unemployed were not looking for available jobs or they were
unqualified for those available.
What appears to affect the behaviour of the unemployed is not the level of
unemployment benefits but the length of time they are paid, according to
Professor Richard Layard and Dr John Philpot of the Employment Institute, a
UK-based independent think tank. Countries such as Sweden and the US, with
limited duration of unemployment benefits, tend to have lower unemployment.
Yet the link between unemployment benefits and unemployment is misleading.
Studies find a positive, but small, relationship between benefits and
unemployment. But once unemployment rates are replaced with non-employment
rates, the simple correlation between benefit duration and joblessness
breaks down.
The duration of benefits may, instead, merely determine how joblessness is
recorded. 'The real problem is non-employment and not unemployment,' argues
Professor Larry Summers of Harvard University. 'Countries with what appear
to be long-term unemployment problems are often just countries where the
non-employed keep being counted as unemployed for longer.' More brawn than
brain: The variation across countries - in rates of economic growth,
wage-bargaining institutions, benefit levels, and active support for the
unemployed - are large. But these national disguises conceal something they
all share: the collapse in the demand for unskilled male labour over the
past two decades.
The rise of low-cost suppliers in the newly developed countries and the
comparative advantage of developed countries in highly skilled,
technologically advanced production has rendered much of the developing
countries' manufacturing capacity obsolete. The rapid rate of productivity
growth in manufacturing has been as important.
This structural shift has left a residue of poorly educated, unskilled male
labour whose market value has fallen sharply. These are the groups which
have been hit hardest by unemployment.
Countries have been affected in different ways, and their policy responses
have differed. In the US, where wages are very flexible, the real wages of
the lowest-paid 10 per cent of workers have fallen by 30 per cent since
1970, while the wages of college graduates have grown.
Very low relative wages for unskilled jobs and a lack of income support have
been cited as one cause for the rise in crime. The LSE's Professor Richard
Freeman points to the way the increase in incarceration has been
concentrated among the uneducated in the 1980s. By 1986, 7.4 per cent of US
male high school drop-outs aged 25-34, and 26 per cent of black male
drop-outs, were in prison.
Continental Europe has taken a different route. The relative rigidity of
wages, and high unemployment benefits, have prevented unskilled real wages
from falling. But employers have been unwilling to hire the unskilled at
those wages. Unskilled men subsist on state benefit.
The UK lies somewhere in-between. The real wages of the low paid have not
fallen, but wage inequality rose more sharply than in Europe as labour
market regulations were dismantled. Unemployment benefits, though permanent,
are low compared with the rest of Europe. Little wonder then that the UK has
taken on many US characteristics: high vacancies and rapid female employment
growth alongside a rising pool of non-employed, and increasingly
unemployable, men 'active' outside the system.
Sweden appears to have bucked the trend. It, too, suffered a fall in
manufacturing employment. But it has maintained relatively low unemployment
and non-employment, high unemployment benefits and a relatively equal wage
distribution. Sweden has provided an alternative: employment in the public
sector. Public sector employment has tripled over the past two decades; by
1987, more than 30 per cent of employed Swedes worked for the government
compared with 15 per cent in the US. Japan has taken a not dissimilar route,
but through highly inefficient private service sector employment.
The heavy costs of Sweden's third way have meant a much larger public sector
and higher marginal and average tax rates than in other OECD countries. The
electorate has now rebelled, electing a conservative government pledged to
reduce the size of the public sector.
Dealing with the collapse in the demand for men whose principle skill is
their physical strength is at the root of the economic and social problem
facing all OECD countries. Nobody has yet found a satisfactory solution:
supporting the unskilled unemployed to do nothing is wasteful; giving them
public jobs is expensive; excluding them from society altogether is
dangerous. The Los Angeles riots suggest inaction can have painful, and
expensive, consequences.

FT  15 MAY 92 / A cartoon Community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relationship between the European Commission's president Jacques Delors
and the British government is like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Tom, the cat,
will stop at nothing in his efforts to swallow Jerry the mouse. Traps are
set. Dynamite is fused and lit. Anvils are dropped. There are hair-raising
moments, and sometimes a trick or two is won by Tom, but in the end Jerry
always skips away free.
That is what happened at Maastricht in December. The draft treaties on
European political and monetary union gave the Commission powers to make
policy and issue directives in most areas of government. Brussels proposed
to use the European parliament to impose direct taxes, and even to rule in
matters of foreign policy and defence. Every paragraph contained a pratfall
for believers in a Europe des patries. The actual treaty, to be presented to
the Commons next week, maintains the EC as a congeries of states. Its
policies are determined by negotiations between member governments. Some -
perhaps too many - involve majority voting, but the nature of the
association is such that consensus is usually sought. Tom would dearly love
the EC to be a superstate, but it is not; nor is it inevitable that it will
become one.
The dwindling band of Thatcherite nationalists disagrees. So does Mrs
Thatcher herself. Her few remaining acolytes in the lower house will vote
against the treaty, but since Labour plans to abstain that is of merely
symbolic importance. What matters now is the next stage of the argument. For
in spite of his recent equivocations in advance of the Danish referendum on
Maastricht, Mr Delors remains a sincere believer in a united states of
Europe. The Commission may have been frustrated in December, but it will be
back. It never gives up.
There are two possible strategies that might ensure that it continues to
lose. One is defence, the other is attack. The first is favoured by the
British government, as Mr Douglas Hurd indicated a fortnight ago. In his
Guildhall speech, he urged the EC to wait until the agreed date of 1996
before reviewing the Maastricht deal. The foreign secretary could not resist
a dig at Mr Delors' dream of a strong single executive, a council of
ministers working by majority voting and a strong single parliament - in
short a powerful government of a centrally-managed superstate. 'I believe
that concept is now looking somewhat old-fashioned,' said Mr Hurd.
Echoing his boss, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the junior minister for Europe,
said in Bonn yesterday that 'Britain stands firmly by the Maastricht
treaty'. It is not difficult to see why. Mr Garel-Jones stressed every
clause that strengthens the powers of national governments rather than the
Commission. Foreign and security policy will be dealt with by a separate
mechanism, as will cross-border policing. National parliaments could take
the opportunity to scrutinise Commission proposals before they are debated
in the Council of Ministers. He hoped that 'on the analogy of the US Supreme
Court, the European Court will give increasing emphasis to the rights of
member states'. This could be easier now that the principle of subsidiarity
is 'enshrined' in community law.
We could call this aggressive defence. Attack might be better. One strategy
is suggested by Mr Frank Vibert in a paper published by the European Policy
Forum*. He proposes that commissioners should be limited to two five-year
terms; that national parliaments should be able to propose EC legislation;
that the Commission itself should be 'unbundled', thus separating its
administrative, judicial and regulatory functions; and that the EC should
recognise that not all member states will always want to participate in all
areas of policy. He speaks of extending the European Union 'on the basis of
'non-coercive' techniques for joint action'.
The precise details are of less immediate moment than the question of
whether Britain should thus attack Brussels expansionism. Re-opening
Maastricht before 1996 would be a nightmare; sending out signals of the
Vibert kind might dissuade the Commission from making any such attempt.
Britain is in a strong position in the EC this year. The French and German
governments are in temporary difficulties. There will be plenty of miniature
'Euro-rows' - over border controls, for example, or social policy - but Mr
Major's stance, at the 'heart of Europe' is convincing. The British
presidency, which begins in a few weeks' time, will take further the debates
on enlargement and the Community budget. The single market has yet to be
completed. The Common Agricultural Policy needs restructuring. It is
tempting to regard this full agenda as a protection against the introduction
of further structural ideas before 1996. Perhaps it is. Yet the best defence
is counter-attack, as when Jerry ties the cracker on Tom's tail. Remember?

FT  15 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Doubts about the Eurofighter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MILITARY technology knows of all kinds of sights; the most awkward of these
is hindsight. If one could go back now and plan from scratch for a fighter
to meet European air forces' requirements, the result would doubtless be
different from the current European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme.
It might be a less ambitious aircraft, or a different partnership. Britain
and France have every cause to rue the mutual hubris that made them take
separate paths in 1985, leaving France to produce its own, smaller,
high-performance fighter and Britain to continue EFA with Germany, Italy and
(after some hesitation) Spain. This regret is all the more acute for Britain
as Bonn is vacillating over the project.
Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's new defence minister, says he is sceptical whether
a 'super-bird' is needed in view of the 'changed political circumstances'.
EFA was designed as a next-generation, highly agile fighter to fill a very
specific gap - an aircraft to match the latest MiG and Sukhoi fighters which
would escort any Soviet bomber attack. That threat has receded to the point
of implausibility, and Russian aircraft no longer breathe down Nato's collar
at forward bases in central Europe.
Even when full development of EFA was launched four years ago, German
politicians were questioning whether it was worth the cost. Since then EFA
has evolved into a symbol for many Germans of wasteful Cold War spending.
Recently, the climate appears to have become even more hostile to the
project. A working group report to the governing coalition parties is due on
June 1. It may not come out flatly against EFA, but is not expected to bring
joy to EFA supporters, either.
Final stages
But EFA is by now almost ready to fly. With Pounds 8bn already spent on the
prototype phase, it is unlikely at this stage that any aircraft of
comparable performance would prove cheaper than proceeding with EFA
production. None of the partners envisages the option of buying no fighters
at all. The question is whether they need the performance.
EFA's backers argue that the 'threat', in terms of the quality of potential
adversaries, has not dwindled; the MiGs and Sukhois are still being
produced, enhanced and widely marketed. They also claim EFA to be a
thoroughly versatile aircraft. It had to be, since the partners had to
reconcile different requirements, including the UK's that it should be able
to double up as a ground-attack aircraft.
Intriguing options
Among the alternatives Bonn is considering - ranging from the French and
Swedish contributions to the new agile generation, to a jazzed-up version of
the 20-year-old Tornado - the safest would be current, well-proven US jets
such as multi-purpose F/A-18 Hornets. But by the same token, these are not
new aircraft, and have limited scope for further evolution.
The most intriguing option is the MiG-29, undercutting all the competition
on price. But Russia's reliability as a source of spares is so questionable
as to make the idea still look eccentric.
If Bonn does pull out, EFA could reach the borderline of viability.
Reductions in Italian, Spanish and possibly UK requirements could bring the
production run, not counting potential exports, to little more than half the
original objective of 800. That, the manufacturing consortium reckons, would
only just be enough to bring the basic production price per aircraft down to
the target Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m.
German withdrawal would at the very least deal a damaging blow, both to the
aerospace industry which Bonn has been trying to nurture and to
international collaboration. If it brought the project down with it, the
repercussions on British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi and other UK defence
contractors would be very grave. It would also raise doubts about the
capacity of European industry ever to mount such a venture again.
But to avoid that requires a blitz on costs. The expensive arrangement,
derived from the Tornado programme, whereby work is meticulously allocated
among the partners and each carries out its own final assembly and flight
tests needs urgent rethinking. Having got this far, EFA is probably worth
pursuing, but not at any price.

One of the highlights of the week is Paul Merton's contribution to the BBC2
quiz Have I Got News For You (10.00). The lines delivered by chairman Angus
Deayton are often funny, but so they should be since his are scripted.
Merton is working off the top of his head (or perhaps the seat of his pants)
yet his jokes, delivered with marvellous casualness, are almost always fast,
dry and sharp. Sometimes they sound, to a non libel specialist,
hair-raisingly close to actionable.
At 10.30 you can switch from the end of that Hat Trick Production to the
beginning of another: Clive Anderson Talks Back on C4. Here the chairman
from 'Whose Line Is It Anyway', which brought Paul Merton to our attention,
runs a chat show which is funny and in which the egos of chairman and guest
are just about equally served. Since the talented Rory Bremner is now doing
another batch of his impressioist/comedy series on BBC2 at 9.00 Friday has
become rather a good evening for laughter.
Just for a change BBC2 launches a series about Spain. To be fair, this one,
Spain On A Plate, is about cookery, which should make a change from Spanish
history (7.30).

Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, has enticed Alastair Kerr onto
its UK equity sales team, part of the rebuilding process in that department.
Kerr - 'one of the most successful and experienced UK equity salesmen in
London', according to Salomon - has to date only worked for UK houses,
latterly Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and before that Morgan Grenfell Securities.
He began his career at Hoare Govett in 1975, and will find himself sitting
close to an old Hoare chum at Salomon, Peter Stephens. While rivals say he
could 'get a rude awakening' - finding that business does not always flow as
easily as at a mainstream UK broker - they are in no doubt he will be
handsomely rewarded.
The fall-out after last summer's bond-rigging scandal hit the equity side,
including the UK, particularly badly, with key salesmen leaving. Gary
Wolens, head of European equity sales, says the rebuilding process will
entail hiring a few more select 'best'. But Salomon still has to convince
its rivals. Said one salesman at another house: 'It's like hearing the first
cuckoo in spring even though it's pouring'.

Fairbairn's background is unusually broad for a computer executive. It
includes a spell in New York as marketing director of Guinness Overseas and
a period as worldwide marketing director for EMI Medical, overseeing sales
of the pioneering brain and body scanners.
Immediately before JMA, he was director of the National Computing Centre, a
Manchester-based organisation which aims to help companies make better use
of their data processing facilities. He is a member of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, a member of the board of the Patent Office and president
of the Institute of Data Processing Managers.

FT  15 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: No Mareva for bank collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEWIS &amp; PEAT (PRODUCE) LTD AND OTHERS v ALMATU PROPERTIES LTD AND OTHERS
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and Lord
Justice Beldam): May 7 1992
MONEY IN the hands of a bank, collected by it as agent for another bank in
exchange for bills of lading deposited by an exporter under an agreement by
which export proceeds are to be credited to his revolving overdraft account,
cannot be frozen by Mareva injunction in execution of judgment against him,
in that it is not his property but is a payment to the principal bank
entitling it to credit it to his account towards reduction of the overdraft.
The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the plaintiffs,
Lewis &amp; Peat (Produce) Ltd and others, from Mr Justice Gatehouse's decision
discharging injunctions restraining the respondent, Midland Bank plc, from
dealing with collected monies pending execution of judgment in an action
against Almatu Properties Ltd and others.
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that on March 13 1991, Lewis &amp; Peat obtained
judgment against three defendants one of whom was a Mr Musa K Suma, for a
total of Dollars 1m.
They had been making urgent and energetic attempts to execute judgment by a
combination of garnishee proceedings against various persons and Mareva
injunctions.
Those attempts resulted in court orders which included a garnishee order
nisi against Midland, and injunctions restraining Midland from dealing with
the proceeds of sale of two cargoes of cocoa and coffee beans, after
collection of those proceeds by Midland.
On June 20 1991, Mr Justice Gatehouse set aside the garnishee proceedings
and discharged the injunctions against Midland.
He declared Midland was free to deal with the proceeds of sale in accordance
with the instructions of its customer, the National Development Bank of
Sierra Leone (NDB); and that NDB was free to give such instructions as it
might see fit, including instructions to transfer the monies out of the
jurisdiction.
Lewis &amp; Peat sought to set aside discharge of the injunctions, and the
declaration.
It was common ground that for the purposes of the appeal Mr Suma and
Techprofit and Sumatu, two companies in Sierra Leone owned and controlled by
him, were regarded as being in effect Mr Suma.
On November 12 1990, NDB granted Sumatu an overdraft facility of 32m Leones
(Pounds 43,578) for 12 months.
The terms and conditions of the facility were that it should be on the
revolving basis and that Sumatu would export all produce through NDB; and
that the counter-value of the export proceeds in foreign exchange would be
credited to Sumatu's account with NDB.
On February 1 1991, Lewis &amp; Peat obtained an injunction against Mr Suma
restraining him from exporting or dealing with coffee and cocoa. As a
result, NDB wrote to Sumatu on March 15 calling for payment of the account.
On April 2, the two cargoes were shipped at Freetown, Sierra Leone. On April
5, Techprofit sent NDB a full set of shipping documents for each cargo with
instructions to forward them to the buyer, Tagville Ltd, in exchange for
Pounds 77,360 for the cocoa cargo and Pounds 104,369 for the coffee cargo,
and on receipt of the export proceeds to credit Sumatu's account with NDB.
On the same day, NDB sent the documents to Midland 'for collection of the
proceeds from Tagville Ltd'. The documents and covering letters were
received by Midland on April 8.
But for the intervention of Lewis &amp; Peat, those two routine documentary
collections would have proceeded in the ordinary way. Midland would have
collected the monies, credited them to NDB's current account and informed
NDB.
NDB would then, in accordance with instructions, have credited them to
Sumatu's account in reduction or extinction of the overdraft.
As a result of Lewis &amp; Peat's intervention, operations had been held up. The
collections had been made but had been credited to a separate
interest-bearing account in NDB's name and frozen there by the orders which
were discharged by Mr Justice Gatehouse. They were still frozen pending the
present appeal.
The issues on the appeal were: (1) whether the sale proceeds were to be
regarded in Midland's hands as an asset held on trust for or a debt due to
Techprofit, or were simply a debt due to NDB; (2) whether the courts should
treat documentary collections like bills of exchange or letters of credit as
obligations to which the Mareva jurisdiction had no application, for the
reasons given by Lord Justice Kerr in Z v A-Z (1982) QB 558; (3) whether the
principle in (2) applied even to injunctions in aid of execution.
Mr Page for Lewis &amp; Peat submitted that the answer to question (1) was that
the proceeds should be regarded as belonging to, or as a debt due to,
Techprofit/Sumatu/Suma, and that the answers to questions (2) and (3) should
be 'no'.
The House of Lords decision in Mackersy v Ramsay (1843) 9 Cl &amp; F 818,844
presented Mr Page with insuperable difficulty.
The facts appeared from Lord Campbell's speech.
He said Ramsay &amp; Co, as bankers, were employed by a customer to obtain
payment of a bill of exchange drawn on a person in Calcutta, payable to
their order. They were to receive payment of it for Mackersy, having a lien
on the bill and its proceeds for any balance due to them from him.
Payment was to be made to persons to be employed by them, to whom the bill
must be endorsed. Mackersy was not to interfere with the proceeds of the
bill until he was credited.
Ramsay &amp; Co employed as its agent Coutts &amp; Co, which o employed Alexander &amp;
Co, which duly received payment from the acceptor and, having given Coutts
credit in account, five months later became bankrupt.
Lord Campbell said: 'I conceive that these circumstances amount in point of
law to a payment to Ramsay &amp; Co, and that they were bound to place the
amount to the credit of Mackersy.'
The document there to be collected was a bill of exchange whereas the
present case was concerned with bills of lading and other shipping
documents, but that was not a relevant distinction.
The factual situation was the same, save that here two rather than three
banks were involved.
The documents, having been lodged with NDB for collection, passed out of the
control of Techprofit/Sumatu/Suma, and NDB had a lien on them to the extent
at least of Sumatu's overdraft.
NDB then sent the documents to Midland for collection. As soon as collection
was made, it was to be regarded as payment to NDB by Midland. NDB's
customer, Sumatu, then became entitled to a credit in the amount of the
collection.
That credit might or might not result in a debt due to Sumatu by NDB,
depending on the state of Sumatu's account and any other arrangements
between Sumatu and NDB, but those matters were of no concern to Midland
whose obligations were to NDB and no-one else.
If in the result a debt did become due to Sumatu, that debt would be
situated in Sierra Leone and not in the UK.
There was no basis on which it could be successfully contended that the
proceeds of the collections were the property in the UK of Techprofit,
Sumatu or Suma, or constituted a debt owed to any of them by Midland.
In the light of the above, issues (2) and (3) did not strictly arise, but
the answer to both questions was 'yes', save in very exceptional
circumstances.
It was of the first importance that routine banking transactions such as
these should not be subject to interference by the Mareva jurisdiction,
unless an exceptionally strong case could be made out that for some reason
or another the well-settled principles of banking law were inapplicable.
The appeal was dismissed.
Lord Justice Beldam gave a concurring judgment. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
agreed.
For Lewis &amp; Peat: Hugo Page (Clifford Chance).
For Midland Bank: Richard Siberry QC and J Smouha (Stephenson Harwood).

pairs of shoes sold in the UK.
The company says the initial cost-cutting and stabilisation is complete and
BSC is planning to introduce further commercial and operational improvements
to place the division on a 'sound footing for the future'. In order to
implement the second phase of rationalisation, Sears announced a string of
senior management appointments at BSC.
John Osborn, the managing director who pushed through the initial
restructuring phase, steps up to the post of deputy chairman. A successor as
md has not yet been named but in the meantime Stephen Smith has been brought
in as deputy managing director from the Freemans mail order business.
Jeff Nash, retail operations director at the successful Adams childrenswear

Cheaper and faster monitoring systems for detecting fire or extreme

Normally fibre-optic cable is unaffected by heat or physical disturbance.
But the company has discovered that if the cable is microscopically bent at
specific points then it becomes sensitive to temperature change. This can be
registered within seconds on a central computer.
The new method, dubbed the Erica sensor, is particularly suited to
monitoring over large distances or areas. Applications are likely to include
fire and entry alarms and monitoring systems for power distribution cables
and large heating systems. Ericsson Network Engineering: Sweden, 468 764

FT  15 MAY 92 / Management: Breaking the taxman's code - Virginia Rounding
went through the hoops in an attempt to become a top civil servant. She
found that her Renaissance concepts were not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA ROUNDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Number 24 Whitehall has a daunting look about it. It is the home of the
Civil Service Selection Board and the place where Britain's high-flying
civil servants are chosen. I recently went there for a two-day programme of
tests and interviews - in the hope of joining Her Majesty's Tax Inspectors.
Inside everything is painted an institutional dark green and most of the
rooms are empty. The first test is to find the third floor common room - not
easy as the door is closed and displays an arrow pointing somewhere else.
Inside, two rows of armchairs face each other and are gradually filled by
nervous-looking applicants. Most look like recent graduates, in their first
suits, and there is only one other woman. No one speaks.
At 9am, the CSSB administrator arrives with a silent colleague who hands out
badges displaying our names and numbers as well as a clip-on lunch pass. We
are led off for our first assignment.
This is called 'Biographical Information'. After filling in our CSSB number,
we have 35 minutes to write about our leisure pursuits, important memories,
our regrets, and experiences that have marked us. We have to describe
ourselves as both our best friend and worst enemy might see us. There is
also the usual Civil Service interest in parental places of birth, ages at
death and so on.
At this point we are told about the competition. There are 15 vacancies this
year; there were more than 2,000 applications and we are now in the last 75
to 100.
Next we have coffee and rather nice biscuits while we meet our assessors -
the chairman, an 'observer' and a psychologist. We are put in groups of four
and sit round an oblong table, while the three assessors look on silently.
The observer selects a topic - 'Should boxing be banned?' - and we discuss
it while the assessors take notes, their faces betraying nothing. Without
warning, the observer changes the subject: 'Will universal peace ever be
attained?'
Ten minutes later we are sent back to the test room. Each candidate is given
a dossier entitled 'Sink or Swim'.
The problem is centred on a fictional shipyard - Hopper Ltd which is
experiencing problems. Three options are available: to let Hopper go bust
and buy from the US the Navy supply vessels that it makes; to save the yard
with an injection of public funds; or to let a Far Eastern company buy it.
Candidates have two hours to write an analysis and recommendation for 'our
minister'.
This takes us up to lunch, when most of us decide to avoid the subsidised
restaurant - wisely, we gather from those who do try it.
The afternoon begins with the first of the 'cognitive' tests. Rather like
Mensa intelligence tests, these are supposed to introduce an objective
element and have to be completed at great speed.
Next, we write a letter on behalf of our 'minister' giving a diplomatic
response to somebody who has been laid off at the shipyard.
My last assignment of the day is an interview with the psychologist. She is
friendly, but I leave with the impression that she finds me odd. There is
no-one in the common room, so I remove my badges and go home.
The next day is a similar mixture of tests, group work and interviews; by
now there is a certain camaraderie among the candidates. The first part of
the morning is taken up by an exercise in which we each chair a 15 minute
meeting. In the first session, we pretend to be embassy staff at an
emergency meeting called by the British Ambassador to Batrakia. The prime
minister is arriving tomorrow, but British sailors have been disgracing
themselves and are now in jail. Local and British journalists are writing
inflammatory copy. Our job is to tell the PM whether to come.
Next we weigh the pros and cons of spending Pounds 50,000 on a park for the
disabled rather than a sculpture called 'The Hulk', and discuss the merits
of a football stadium on the site of the defunct Hopper's Shipyard. The
assessors remain impassive.
Today's cognitive tests are horrible, especially the one where you have to
fill in the missing domino in what look like increasingly random patterns.
But the young man next to me finishes early and sits ostentatiously creaking
his shoes.
There remain the interviews with the observer and the chairman. With the
observer, a civil servant from another department, I discuss creeping
privatisation in the NHS and the merits of the National Curriculum. The
chairman, a retired tax inspector, seems in reflective mood and we end the
day discussing the Renaissance concepts of decoro, sprezzatura and grazia.
And that's the last I hear from CSSB - until a week later when I receive a
two-line letter saying I have not been selected for appointment as HM
Inspector of Taxes. Oh well, I never did like playing dominoes much.
The author has returned to her job as an administrator of The Consort of
Musicke, an early music group.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Management: A change of address on Quality Street - Why
Nestle is moving the head offices of some of its businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Very few multinationals have yet taken the radical step of shifting the
global headquarters of one or more of their businesses out of the parent
company's home country. The best-known to do so is IBM. Late last month the
select band was joined by Nestle. In the wake of its controversial takeover
of Perrier, the Swiss food group made the astute move of announcing that the
HQ of its mineral water business would be transferred to France.
Yet only a few months earlier, Nestle made a quiet shift in precisely the
opposite direction with another high-profile business, confectionery. It
unwound an international strategy group for confectionery which, as part of
its politically- sensitive acquisition of Britain's Rowntree in 1988, it had
established with leadership in York, Rowntree's headquarters in northern
England.
In one sense, the unwinding of the York arrangement was only to be expected:
Nestle has a managerially sensible (and politically convenient) habit of
allowing its acquisitions a long leash while both sides get to know each
other. It tends to integrate them fully into its organisation only after
three years or more. Yet cynics might claim that Nestle has broken the
promise it gave to the citizens of York, and Rowntree's more chauvinistic
shareholders, at the time of the 1988 takeover bid.
The reality is both more straightforward and more complicated.
It is more straightforward in two senses. First, any feeling of betrayal
should be removed by the fact that the confectionery strategy shift, from
York to Nestle's headquarters in Vevey on Lake Geneva, was advocated
strongly by its English ex-Rowntree management, who found the original
arrangement difficult and exhausting to manage.
Second, mineral water and confectionery are two very different cases. The
former is a much newer and less well-developed business for Nestle than was
confectionery, and much more based in one country, with only a handful of
export markets. Perrier also dwarfs Nestle's existing businesses in the
field, whereas Rowntree merely doubled Nestle's existing chocolate
interests. The French HQ could, therefore, prove longer-lasting than was the
York-led strategy group.
There are also two main reasons why the reality of the York group's
unwinding is more complicated than it might seem. First, the confectionery
unit's staff were never all based in York, as many outsiders thought.
Four-fifths of its 60-plus staff worked in Switzerland under the leadership
of the Rowntree boss in York.
Second, the unwinding of the confectionery strategy group occurred last
autumn not in isolation, but as part of a radical reorganisation of Nestle's
corporate HQ. Among other things, this involved the creation of a set of
'strategic business units' (SBUs) in Vevey for each Nestle business. Many of
the tasks of the former confectionery strategy group have now been subsumed
into an SBU which covers confectionery and ice cream, with a staff of only
about 20. York still plays a special role within Nestle, since a
much-expanded research and development centre there has retained the lead
international responsibility for Nestle's chocolate R&amp;D.
The new SBUs are intended to be a head office counterweight to Nestle's
independent-minded national operating companies. But why was the strategy
group so difficult to run from York in these days of electronic
communication and regional jet flights?
Two men, above all, can explain the chocolate rethink. The first is
48-year-old Peter Brabeck, an Austrian who recently joined Nestle's group
management. He now supervises, among other people, the heads of four SBUs,
including the confectionery and ice cream unit (its head is an ex-Rowntree
Briton).
Having had several years of bitter experience trying to co-ordinate Nestle's
Buitoni pasta business in the late 1980s, when it was still being run from
its original Italian HQ, Brabeck declares that 'you can't physically devolve
yourself from the power circle in Vevey: that's where the shoulder-rubbing
has to take place'.
This is precisely what the second key player in this drama, Peter Blackburn,
found when he ran the confectionery strategy group for two exhausting years.
'Ran' is very much the operative word.
Blackburn, a Rowntree man for 20 years, took over chairmanship of the
strategy group in May 1989. 'I got increasingly sucked into Vevey because of
the need to talk to the various regional managers, and to all the corporate
functions and services,' he says.
'I travelled there two or three times a month for between three and four
days. It took me seven or eight hours just to do the one-way journey.' On
top of that, he had to travel the world.
Within a year, he told the Nestle top brass in Vevey that when the time came
to hand the strategy job over, 'my successor mustn't be put in York'. That
change occurred in 1991 when Blackburn moved to London to become head of
Nestle UK (which now includes Rowntree).
Even after everyone had got to know each other, 'things wouldn't have
improved materially,' says Blackburn. 'I don't believe in electronic
communication: face-to-face discussion is vital, especially in a group the
size of Nestle'. This principle is very much encouraged within Nestle - even
if it creates for some top managers a hectic, Blackburn-style travel
schedule.
Could a new head of the strategy group not have moved to Vevey, leaving some
subordinates in dispersed locations such as York? On the same principle, why
not base the heads of the new SBUs at Vevey, but leave some staff in York
and elsewhere?
Peter Brabeck points out that, if Nestle's new structure is to work
smoothly, all SBU staff - not just their heads - need to have close contact
with staff in the various regional units based in Vevey.
There is also a strong internal logic, within each SBU, for everyone being
co-located: the need to turn previously separate functional specialists from
marketing, production and so on into a really integrated team. Even as
things stand, Brabeck says the SBU heads and the managers immediately
beneath them will have to spend up to half their time travelling away from
base.

<TEXT>
FRESH evidence of muscle-flexing by Labour backbenchers emerged last night
after more than 60 MPs were reported to have signed a round robin calling on
the party leadership to rethink its tactics on next week's Maastricht
debate, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Lobbying led by Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwinger, has mustered
support on all sides of the party for a rethink of Labour's decision to
abstain once the bill, ratifying the European Community treaty changes, is
put to a vote.
Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, and Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign
secretary, argued vigorously at a parliamentary Labour party meeting on
Wednesday that voting against the bill would contradict Labour's election
stance on the Maastricht agreement and the stand it had taken in early
votes.
It would also prove an albatross at the next election, they said.
Eight MPs argued from various viewpoints that the party could justify voting
against the bill because of its failure to include UK involvement in
community forums.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE management of PSA Services, the government agency that carries out
building works for the Civil Service, has been censured by the Commons
public accounts committee.
The agency - which is due for privatisation later this year - had to write
off invoices worth Pounds 65.6m in its 1990-91 accounts because customers
would not accept them. That followed difficulties in implementing new
systems which the PAC describes as 'a most serious matter'.
The snags arose when government departments became free to employ
private-sector companies for building works on April 1 1990. PSA Services
introduced new financial systems to cost and invoice work at the same time
as preparing for privatisation.
Difficulties in implementing the new systems and inadequacies in the
underlying records led to errors on customers' invoices. Payment on those
invoices was delayed or withheld and the Pounds 65.6m shortfall was met from
public funds.
The PAC notes PSA Services' assurances that there is no evidence of
impropriety, but says the breakdown in controls created an environment 'in
which impropriety could flourish and be difficult to detect'.

ABOUT 16 hospital units or groups have notified the Scottish Office of their
interest in obtaining trust status since the general election on April 9.
One unit has submitted a formal application.
The idea of obtaining trust hospital status was originally much slower to
gather momentum in Scotland than in England.
There are 56 hospital units in Scotland, of which two became trusts on April
1, with a third poised to become a trust on April 1 next year. If all the
hospital units that have applied or expressed interest were granted trust
status, a third of Scotland's hospital units would have opted out.
The Scottish Office said yesterday: 'The expressions of interest just keep
tumbling in.' Hospital units have until June 30 to make formal applications
for trust status starting next April.
The move towards trust status is being viewed with quiet satisfaction by the
government and with consternation by health service unions and Labour
politicians.
Last year Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, came under strong pressure from
opposition parties and unions to refuse the three opt-out applications that
had then been submitted.
The application by the Foresterhill hospital unit in Aberdeen became a big
issue in the nearby Kincardine and Deeside by-election last November, which
the Tories lost disastrously.
Princess Margaret Rose hospital in Edinburgh is the first of the new crop to
submit an application.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Lamont in talks on EC drink duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the UK drinks industry are to meet Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor
of the exchequer, today to discuss the government's approach to the European
Commission's proposals for minimum duty rates on spirits.
The issue, which has been the subject of intense argument for the past year,
is expected to be on the agenda at a meeting of EC economic and finance
ministers in Brussels on Tuesday.
Protests from the industry in July last year persuaded Mr Lamont to withhold
Britain's agreement to EC proposals for a minimum duty of Ecu 1,118 (Pounds
783) a hectolitre of pure alcohol for Scotch whisky, gin and other spirits.
EC ministers agreed on a zero rate of duty for wine and a rate of Ecu 187
for beer.
The proposed rate for spirits would have added about Pounds 2.50 to a bottle
of whisky in southern European countries.
Industry leaders believe such a move would also have hampered their efforts
to reduce discriminatory taxation of products in other countries.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Norris at launch of Countdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time and motion: Steven Norris, minister for transport for London, yesterday
attended the launch of Countdown, a passenger information service being
installed by London Buses.
From September, passengers at bus stops on the 18 route will be given an
Underground-style countdown to the arrival time of the next bus, Richard
Tomkins writes.
London Buses hopes the Pounds 700,000 system will overcome the uncertainty
involved in waiting for buses, often cited by passengers as the main reason
for not making more use of them.
The progress of buses will be monitored by roadside beacons and by radios in
the buses. A central computer will interpret data and transmit the predicted
arrival times of the next three buses to dot-matrix screens at stops along
the route.
Installation of the equipment follows an earlier short-term experiment on
the 36 and 36B routes in 1986-87. The new system uses technology developed
by Serel, a French electronics company, now in use in several French towns
and in Malaga, Spain.
The 18 route runs from King's Cross to Sudbury in north-west London.
London Buses estimates that increased revenue should pay for the system in
less than three years. If it succeeds, the system may be extended to 100 or
more London bus routes at a cost of Pounds 35m.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Council contracts out tax collecting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLECTION of local taxes and the payment of benefits is to be contracted
out to the private sector by East Cambridgeshire district council, in the
first successful competitive tender for a local-authority white-collar
function.
The council sought competitive tenders for the collection of poll tax and
business rates - and council tax when that is introduced next year  - and
the payment of housing benefit and poll tax benefit. The contract, worth
Pounds 3.5m over five years, has been awarded to Capita Group from this
month.
The council's 23 revenue collection and benefits staff have chosen to
transfer to Capita, and the service will continue to be provided from the
existing premises. If service targets are exceeded, Capita will be paid a
performance bonus. If standards are not met, their fee will be reduced.
Capita already works under contract for more than 20 local councils in
chasing up poll tax payments by phone, but this is the first contract
involving the entire revenue collection and benefits payment service.
Competitive tendering is due to be extended to a wide range of council
professional and technical services under legislation passed in the last
parliament. Details of the scope of such contracting out and the timetable
are due to be announced soon, after officials have considered more than 500
submissions on a consultative paper issued last autumn.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Arms plant to halve workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EROSION of jobs in the defence industry continued yesterday with
confirmation that Royal Ordnance will almost halve its workforce at
Blackburn, Lancashire.
Announcing 350 job losses, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace
warned that the future of the site, which specialises in fuses, was
'entirely dependent upon future order intake'.
The plant has already cut 640 jobs since 1990 and the latest cut will reduce
the workforce to 370. The company said it hoped the cut would be largely
through voluntary means, early retirement and redeployment, but it did not
rule out compulsory redundancies.
Royal Ordnance's workforce has fallen by 2,000 to about 8,500 since 1990, in
spite of its purchase last year of the 1,000-employee German small-arms
company Heckler &amp; Koch.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Commercial vehicle output surges: April car output down on
last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR PRODUCTION in the UK was 2.3 per cent lower last month than in April
last year but output of commercial vehicles was sharply higher, continuing
the strong recovery started late last year.
Car output in April, at 108,641, fell from 111,138 in the same month a year
ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders and the Central Statistical Office.
In the first four months of this year, car production was 1.2 per cent lower
at 451,959 compared with 457,301 in the same period last year.
Output for the domestic market has strengthened and rose year-on-year by
13.8 per cent in the first four months to 263,962. That was offset by
falling production for export markets, which were 16.6 per cent lower at
187,997.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, car output in the past six months was 1 per
cent higher than in the previous six months but 6 per cent lower than in the
same period a year ago.
Commercial vehicle production of 22,555 in April was 24.6 per cent higher
than in the same month a year ago. Output in the first four months was 17.5
per cent higher, at 89,399, compared with 76,063 in the same period last
year.
Output of commercial vehicles has been helped by an increase in output of
small vans by Ford, which started producing its new Courier high-roof Fiesta
van range at Dagenham late last year.
UK sales have fallen for 31 consecutive months year-on-year and the domestic
commercial vehicle market remains depressed, but the rise in output this
year has been supported by a big jump in exports.

Producer Choice.
Mr Tony Lennon, Bectu president, said: 'The management will have difficulty

FT  15 MAY 92 / Urban policy undermining Bush campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE in President George Bush's ability to manage the severe urban
problems of the US is being eroded to the point where it could jeopardise
his bid for re-election.
The message of several recent public opinion polls, including one in the
Washington Post yesterday, is that the administration's attempt to blame
inner-city unrest on the liberal Democratic programmes of the 1960s is
falling on deaf ears.
The Post survey found 55 per cent ascribing the principal blame to the
perceived policies of urban neglect practised by the Reagan and Bush
administrations. Two thirds thought a new approach to urban issues was
required, and there was widespread doubt about Mr Bush's ability to produce
one.
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic candidate,
scored higher than the president as a man more able to to deal with problems
of race relations, poverty and the cities. Mr Ross Perot, the main
prospective independent candidate, outscored both as the man more likely to
improve the economy and unemployment, with Mr Bush last in both categories.
This did not much change the national balance of current preferences among
the three, which remains near-level. Mr Bush was given 33 per cent, Mr
Clinton 29 per cent and Mr Perot 28 per cent, compared with a 36:31:30 split
in the Post's April survey.
But the Bush campaign had nakedly hoped that the main effect of the Perot
boom would been the relegation of Mr Clinton to third place, thus
embarrassing the Democrats. The evidence is that he is drawing from Mr
Bush's core support as much as from Mr Clinton's and, in the south west and
west, probably more from the president.
Mr Bush's apparent inability to establish leadership concerns his campaign
managers. This explains why he is now spending much time in deprived urban
districts, including one in Washington yesterday. But these tours to places
he rarely used to visit are being widely dismissed as little more than
'photo opportunities'.
His administration is continuing to dribble out announcements that extra
federal funds are being earmarked to repair the destruction in Los Angeles,
including a further Dollars 600m in Federal Home Loan Board advances. Even
so, the gap between administration programmes and urban demands continues to
grow. The US conference of mayors has called for a Dollars 35bn action plan
 -roughly 10 times what Mr Bush has promised.
There is also a sense that the bipartisan spirit of co-operation by the
president and Congress, evident at the start of the week, is beginning to
come asunder.
In private, even some senior Republicans are acidulous about their
president's performance. One prominent senator is preparing to propose that
Mr Bush (and Mr Clinton and Mr Perot) be grilled individually on television
by the Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and the Republican Warren Rudman, both
of whom announced their retirement recently on the grounds that Washington
was failing to come to grips with critical budgetary and social issues.
That senator was not sanguine that the president would acquit himself well
in such a session. In fact, the Bush campaign has yet to commit itself to
the televised debates by the presidential candidates that have been a big
feature of most elections since 1960.
Mr William Safire, the independent-minded conservative columnist, wrote
yesterday in the New York Times, apropos vice-presidential candidates: 'The
weak end of the Bush-Quayle team is Mr Bush, who should be grateful that the
confident Dan Quayle is not trying to dump him.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Citicorp points to new money for Brazil restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REED, chairman of Citicorp, has said Brazil's commercial bank
creditors would put up Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn in new loans for a debt
restructuring deal, implying that Citicorp itself has decided to contribute
a significant sum in new money, writes Stephen Fidler in Braslia.
Bankers close to the transaction say Mr Reed's statement suggests Citicorp
could be willing to put up Dollars 500m for the deal, now under negotiation
by leading creditor banks and Brazilian officials in New York.
The chairman's comments, to journalists in Braslia late on Wednesday,
suggested that only 'mathematics' stood in the way of an agreement. However,
his statements may prove controversial among banks that are less
enthusiastic about a debt accord with Brazil.
The chairman of Citicorp, the largest foreign bank lender to Brazil, said he
believed Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn would be needed for enhancements under the
accord. Enhancements provide finance for guarantees of concessional bonds
used in debt-reduction deals such as that being negotiated by Brazil.
Some bankers say this suggests Citicorp has conceded the need for
enhancements to be phased in over time - an approach controversial with some
leading bank leaders.
Mr Reed and his vice-chairman, Mr William Rhodes, were in Braslia to meet
President Fernando Collor and Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister.
Both sides now accept an agreement in principle is likely before the end of
June - perhaps significantly sooner.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Partial reprieve for spotted owl in logging lands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday gave a partial reprieve to the Northern
Spotted Owl, but proposed sharp reductions in the conservation areas set
aside for the threatened species.
It also agreed to allow logging in a portion of the ancient Oregon forest
that provides the bird's habitat.
The Endangered Species Committee (known as the God Squad because of its
power to condemn a species to extinction if it sees a greater public
interest) agreed to let the federal Bureau of Land Management sell timber on
13 parcels of land, although logging there might jeopardise the owl's
existence.
Only once, in 1979, had the committee overruled the requirements of the
Endangered Species Act by granting such an exemption.
Also, Mr Manuel Lujan, Interior Secretary, proposed a plan he said would
stabilise the spotted owl population, but would cut the federal land set
aside for the birds from 5.4m acres to 2.8m acres. An alternative plan which
would have aimed not merely at preserving the owl population but at
restoring its numbers would cost 32,000 jobs in the region, the Interior
Department said.
'Our preservation plan takes a common sense, middle ground approach that
will save more than half of the 32,100 timber industry and related jobs that
would be lost through strict compliance with the Endangered Species Act,' Mr
Lujan said. 'It will give us a better than even chance that the owl will be
preserved for the next 100 years.'
The fate of the spotted owl has become the focus and the symbol for the
conflict between jobs and environmental protection in the north-western US,
which is heavily dependent on the timber industry.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Libya 'to renounce terrorism'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LIBYA claimed yesterday that it was renouncing terrorism but again refused
to hand over the two men accused by the US and Britain of responsibility for
bombing a PanAm aircraft over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people,
writes Our Middle East Staff.
Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, Libyan foreign minister, said in Indonesia,
where he is attending a meeting of the non-aligned movement, his country's
laws prevented extradition of the two suspects. A foreign ministry statement
issued in Tripoli referred only to the second part of UN Security Council's
Resolution 731 which called on Tripoli to cut all links to terrorist groups.
Libya's failure to comply with the first part of the resolution, demanding
the extradition of the two suspects, led to the imposition of sanctions last
month which cut its international air flights, imposed an embargo on arms
sales and scaled down diplomatic representation.
Britain repeated yesterday that Libya had to comply with all and not just
some of the UN demands. 'The resolutions aren't a menu from which the
Libyans can pick and choose,' a UK official said in London.

FT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK store's surprise Russian profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLEWOODS, the British clothes, mail order and retail group, is
forecasting an unexpected Pounds 1m profit from its pioneering St Petersburg
stores this year. It is to plough the money back into expansion because it
will not be able to remit it back to the UK. The group says there is
immediate room for four more stores in St Petersburg and it is looking at
moving next into Moscow and Kiev.
However, Mr Des Pitcher, the group's chief executive, warned that growth
would depend on political stability in Russia. He said demand was strong and
accounted for a level of success that had been greater and achieved faster
than anyone expected.
Littlewoods, which runs 250 shops in the UK, opened two stores in St
Petersburg last year. One trades in hard currency and offers the full range
of Littlewoods goods on sale in western Europe. The other, in the famous
Gostini Dvor department store on Nevsky Prospekt, sells Russian-made goods
for roubles.
The Gostini Dvor goods are made by the Mayak Tailoring Association under
Littlewoods' supervision as part of a joint venture arrangement.
Mr Pitcher said Mayak was now making clothes for the hard-currency store as
well as the rouble one, but they could be bought at a discount in hard
currency. Hard-currency cash flow was used to buy the raw materials for
Mayak's manufacturing operations.
The Pounds 1m surplus was being generated in roubles by the Gostini Dvor
store. 'We cannot remit these funds, so we shall be using them to expand. We
viewed this whole venture as a trial and would have been happy if it had
just washed its face financially, so we are very pleasantly surprised.'
The company has invested about Pounds 700,000 in the project so far. The St
Petersburg operations are small, involving floor areas of less than 10,000
sq ft each, with frequent queues outside.

FT  15 MAY 92 / EC carbon tax may run into political sands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's proposal on the introduction of an energy and carbon tax could run
into the sands because it is conditional on the US and Japan adopting
similar measures.
The Bush Administration is considered most unlikely to adopt a carbon tax.
Aside from the fact that Mr Bush is fighting an election this year, his
administration has staunchly resisted pressures for a fiscal solution to
energy and environmental problems.
The US aversion to deadlines on emissions controls was highlighted by Mr
Bush's earlier wavering on whether to attend the Rio Earth Summit. He made
his attendance conditional on a redraft of the treaty on climate change to
exclude specific deadlines for emission controls. The US is the only major
industrial nation which has not adopted the year 2000 deadline to reduce
emissions to 1990 levels.
Instead of taxes, the US strategy is based on a range of specific measures,
such as tightening efficiency standards for equipment, and promoting energy
efficiency audits.
The question, however, is whether the US can make progress on these fronts
without an energy tax. Last week the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics concluded taxation should form a key part of any
strategy to combat global warming.
The Japanese government, keen to take a high political profile on
environmental issues, was caught out of step by the Commission's approval of
such a tax on Wednesday.
Debate is continuing within Japanese ministries over an energy tax, but two
of the more powerful, the ministry of international trade and industry
(Miti) and the ministry of transport, have generally opposed a tax that
would increase fuel costs for industry.
Their concerns were reflected in Japanese delegates' insistence that the
Tokyo Declaration, issued last month at a UN-sponsored eminent persons'
meeting on the environment, contain only an ambiguous reference to energy
taxes and emphasise the importance of economic growth.
'Countries may wish to consider special taxes and charges in the context of
the global partnership being forged at Rio de Janeiro (the Earth Summit),
keeping in mind the impact on international competitiveness,' the
declaration said.
The EC announcement puts particular pressure on Mr Noboru Takeshita, the
former prime minister and faction chief within the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party. He hosted the eminent persons' meeting and has made clear to his
political colleagues that the environment issue is his territory.
'We are not surprised that the EC has made an announcement, but we are
surprised by the timing,' a Miti official said.
It will take the direct intervention of Mr Takeshita to settle an
inter-ministerial debate that has so far lasted more than three years. A
month ago, Miti insisted that government discussion of an energy tax was
'only informal', but last night the ministry said that such a tax was 'under
consideration'. Some Japanese officials argue that the country has already
made a contribution by agreeing to 'freeze' carbon dioxide emissions at the
1990 level by the year 2000.
However that ambiguous policy includes a per capita 'freeze', which has
allowed Miti to set a separate target for an 8 per cent increase in
emissions until the end of the decade. The target is based on projected
annual GNP growth of about 3.6 per cent.
The Environment Agency is in favour of an energy tax, and has suggested a
sliding scale of charges that would reflect the amount of carbon dioxide
emitted. And the finance ministry is apparently not opposed to doubling the
present petrol tax from Y2.4 to Y4.8 per litre, raising about Y400bn that
could be devoted to environment protection and used to cover a tax revenue
shortfall.
In the Netherlands, which strongly favours using taxation for ecological
ends, Environment Minister Hans Alders said: 'The more countries that
participate, the better it is ..But to make it dependent (on US and Japanese
participation) means nothing will get done,' he said.
Mr Ken Collins, the chairman of the European Parliament's environment
committee, said after the decision that he had decided to cancel his
attendance at next month's Earth Summit in Rio. He described the event as 'a
sham'.

SPAIN'S cost of living index rose just 0.2 per cent in April marking the

Madrid. Year-on-year inflation fell from 6.9 per cent to 6.5 per cent - the
start, according to the finance ministry, of a gradual approach to its
inflation estimate for the year of 5.8 per cent. That would still be a rise
on the 5.5 per cent recorded in 1991 but there have been sharp VAT increases
in the first quarter of this year.  Despite the good April figures, however,
underlying inflation (which excludes energy and processed food prices) is
still high at 6.8 per cent.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK aims at compromise over European forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN outlined proposals last night for military forces to come under the
authority of the Western European Union. It accepted for the first time that
the controversial joint corps planned by France and Germany might be among
the forces made available to the WEU.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, insisted however that Nato should
have first call on troops in the event of a crisis.
He said he hoped WEU ministers would reach a consensus at a meeting in
Germany on June 19. But it was unclear yesterday whether the UK proposals,
expected to be welcomed by Washington because of their emphasis on Nato
ties, can form the basis of a compromise.
The row over how Europe should move towards forming its own military
capability has been brewing for the past year, after Nato drew up plans for
a British-led rapid reaction corps and France and Germany countered with
proposals for a joint corps under separate command. The Franco-German plan
bewildered both the US and Britain, which saw it as competing with Nato.
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl are to finalise
plans for the corps next week. The 35,000-strong corps is due to be in place
in October 1995.
Mr Rifkind said the corps, which Bonn and Paris have invited other WEU
members to join, could be among forces made available to the WEU. These
might also include the current UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force and the new
air mobile division which Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are
setting up as part of the Nato's rapid reaction forces.
UK officials made clear no British troops would be assigned to the
Franco-German corps.
Mr Rifkind said command of European forces in cases where Nato was not
involved would come under the WEU's council of ministers, and a special
planning cell would draw up contingency plans. But he opposed setting up
standing WEU forces or a command structure in parallel with Nato's.
In a lecture to the Centre for Defence Studies in London, Mr Rifkind made an
apparent concession by accepting that the WEU might use forces in certain
circumstances within Europe. But this would only happen when Nato chose not
to be engaged, for instance in humanitarian operations.
Bonn has assured Britain that German troops in the Franco-German corps will
remain assigned to Nato. French forces are outside Nato's military
structure, but arrangements are envisaged for the whole corps to come under
Nato operational command in the event of a war in Europe.

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK avows support for Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday proclaimed its strong commitment to the Maastricht treaty
providing for a European monetary and political union, while stressing that
the treaty's objective was not to create a European 'super-state'.
In a forthright presentation of the UK's policy to the Konrad Adenauer
Foundation in Bonn, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British minister of state
for European affairs, said the treaty was both 'good for the Community and
for Britain in the Community'. He added that the EC 'can ill-afford months
or years of institutional paralysis at a time when it has heavy
responsibilities to shoulder'.
At the same time, he was at pains to underline the distinction made in the
treaty between the 'core functions' of the Community's institutions and
those areas, such as foreign policy, immigration and the fight against
drugs, terrorism and crime, which remained subject to intergovernmental
co-operation.
On the controversial issue of EC frontier controls, Mr Garel-Jones said the
UK accepted that there must be 'no systematic controls' over the movement of
Community nationals.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (10) - Part of the fabric of
life / Wine, Vine cultivation on the steep and windy slopes of the Cinque
Terre requires strong leg muscles and a head for heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU NEED a passion to do it. Many only keep up the tradition out of respect
for their parents.' So Mr Nello Capris, a leading Genoese wine expert,
describes the task of vine cultivation in the wild Cinque Terre, where
strong leg muscles and a head for heights are as much pre-requisites for
success as green fingers with the grape.
Producing wine on the steep and windy slopes of the Cinque Terre, the five
small villages just north of La Spezia, around 75 miles south of Genoa, is,
says Mr Capris, 'a heroic task'. The narrow terraces perched along the
near-vertical hillsides plunging down towards the sea offer little scope for
mechanisation. Much of the work, including the carrying, is still done by
hand.
'No one could keep a family solely on the income from growing wine,' he
explains. 'Growing vines is now virtually all part-time work, either done as
a second job or left to those who have already retired.'
In spite of the immense difficulties, the wine business has not eroded, like
many of the harsh hillsides which face the sea. For growing wine is part of
the fabric of life in a region which, in spite of its immense tourist
appeal, still depends largely on traditional sources of income for its
livelihood. Without their vineyards, the five villages which make up the
remote Cinque Terre would still be magnets for visitors on account of their
ragged beauty and commanding views, but part of their magic would be lost.
It is largely because of tourism that the two white wines of the Cinque
Terre - Cinqueterre and Sciaccetra - are among the best known of all
Liguria's produce, in spite of the relatively small quantities produced
visitors buy the fruity Cinqueterre or, to a much lesser extent, sweet
Sciaccetra dessert wine, in much the same decorative three-bottle cardboard
packs as are found in other locations where tourism and wine-growing go hand
in hand like Rudesheim on the Rhine or the villages south of Strasbourg in
Alsace.
Like their counterparts elsewhere in Italy, the growers of the Cinque Terre
have recently woken up to the possibilities of 'agro-tourism'. Largely
united in the Co-operativa Agricoltora Cinqueterre, the local growers are
now starting to convert some of the small abandoned shacks dotted around the
hillsides into basic accommodation for visitors.
Tourists searching for five-star luxury should look elsewhere. But the
provision of electricity and running water to the huts, traditionally used
for storage and even temporary accommodation for workers on outlying
vineyards, could appeal to the thousands of walkers and ramblers who descend
on the region each year. Meanwhile, for the local economy, converting the
huts could persuade visitors to stay for longer than the usual day-trip,
which contributes little revenue to the community.
By combining their interests, the members of the co-operative have helped to
maintain an industry marked by a steady decline in the past. 'The problem is
that the population is getting older, and the young people are drifting
away. You can't change it,' says Mr Capris. Economic pressures make it
increasingly difficult for younger members of wine-growing families to
maintain the family business.
The co-operative may not be able completely to reverse the tide, but it is
at least trying to make the best of what is left. Agreement has already been
reached with some local growers to give the co-operative the right of first
refusal over their land should they decide to go out of business.
Meanwhile, the co-operative, which comprises around three quarters of the
local producers, has also strengthened their lobbying powers when it comes
to outside bodies. Most recently, they secured funding from the European
Community to install around 30 narrow mini-railways up some of the steepest
local slopes to make the task of transporting grapes after harvest less of
an endurance test.
The Cinque Terre is the best known of the wine-growing areas of Liguria, but
the region as a whole is as unfamiliar to most Italians as it is to
foreigners on account of its limited output. Producing only around 300,000
hectolitres of wine a year, Liguria is one of Italy's smallest wine-growing
zones, representing barely 0.5 per cent of national output.
However, it is slowly gaining ground, reckons Mr Capris. Quality has
improved, especially over the past decade. 'Ligurian wine was not always
produced that professionally. It didn't always look good, nor keep well. Now
we've managed to convince more top restaurants to take local wines, and
they've been pleased with their choice,' he says.
Like much in Liguria, the wine-growing region forms two sides of an arc with
Genoa at its head. Although most of the wine business is concentrated in two
areas around Albenga to the west and La Spezia to the east, even Genoa
itself has some wines.
The city's wines do not merit being classed among Italy's top-drawer
'Denominazione di Origine Controllata' (DOC) rating. However, they are
ranked one notch down the scale as table wines coming from a strictly
defined geographical region.
Even that may seem surprising to those who remember that the local white
Valpolcevera was known for decades as the standard tipple for Genoa's
thirsty dockers. 'Mornings would start with a swig of wine and continue in
much the same way all day,' jokes Mr Capris.
However, change is now on the cards for Genoa's local wine, as well as for
Verminto di Ne and Bianco di Verici, two other local whites. Subject to a
variety of approvals, including the European Commission, the local wines
will eventually all be called Golfo del Tigullio, a name harking back to the
inhabitants of the Gulf of Genoa in pre-Roman times.
While wines from around La Spezia, including the Cinque Terre and the nearby
Colli di Luni stretching south to Tuscany, account for around half Liguria's
output, wines from areas to the west of Genoa form much of the remainder.
The Rossesse di Dolceacqua DOC, produced in about five villages around
Ventimiglia on the border with France, accounts for a fraction of that
total. The red wines, similar to the well-known Barolo from Piedmont to the
north, have been produced for centuries and are strong and mature quickly.
But rather than seeking out obscure growths, visitors to Genoa would do well
to remember the names of Pigato and Vermintino, two of Liguria's most
commonly found wines, which make up the bulk of the output from the western
Riviera. The two whites are 'classic Ligurian wines', says Mr Capris, light
and fruity. 'Some experts even claim to detect a a hint of salt, brought in
from the sea,' he adds, somewhat sceptically. Both wines, along with the
less familiar red Rossesse, form part of the 'Riviera Ligure di Ponente'
DOC, which is concentrated around Albenga.
Surprisingly, little or no wine is produced from the shady valleys in the
hinterland behind Genoa and the other coastal resorts. The relatively high
altitude of the Apennines and the cool temperatures are the main culprits,
although depopulation has also played a role. 'There were few people there
before, and there are even fewer now,' notes Mr Capris.
As in parts of the Cinque Terre, many smaller or less accessible vineyards
have been abandoned or sold. The Italian legal system, which requires an
estate to be split between all the heirs, has not helped, as holdings have
been divided into increasingly small fractions over the years. And Liguria's
harsh geography, with a lack of land which can be cultivated easily, has
encouraged new owners to convert fields once devoted to wine to other, more
profitable or essential, uses.
Although a law now exists to give tax advantages to farmers amalgamating
wine-growing plots, human interests often come into play. 'Ligurians are
very individualistic. Even setting up the Cinque Terre co-operative was a
herculean task,' says Mr Capris.
The economic pressures on growers are particularly evident around Albenga,
one of the few parts of Liguria where the coastal strip broadens out from a
thin belt, sandwiched between the mountains and the sea, into a sizeable
area of flat, easily arable land. Here, the competition is from
horticulture, which is already dominant further to the west. Growing flowers
is not only less labour intensive and more easily mechanised, but more
profitable, too.
Such factors mean Ligurian wine will always remain a speciality in Italy.
The difficulties of growing vines in the region are reflected in the price
of grapes, which, at around L2,000 a kilo, is almost three times as high as
in neighbouring Piedmont. Those costs are naturally mirrored in the price of
a bottle of Ligurian wine, which at around L8,000-L10,000, is above the
Italian average.
However, local growers are not despondent, particularly in view of the
greater recognition they have received over the past 10-15 years. And for
visitors who want to impress their Ligurian hosts, a gift of Sciaccetra,
which weighs in at around L50,000-60,000 a bottle, should go down
particularly well.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (9) - Football's year to
remember / Sports, The Columbus festivities in 1992 include international
cycling, water polo, athletics, roller skating and sailing events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A COUNTRY totally dominated by football, Genoa is certainly no exception.
It was here in 1893 that a group of British subjects founded the first
Italian sporting society, the Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club, at the local
British consulate.
The cricket and athletics gave way to association football, and today the
city is divided between Genoa, the club that descended from the society of
yore, and Sampdoria, the side that brought home the Italian championship
title last season.
The title was captured by a team revitalised through the investments of
chairman Paolo Mantovani, who in just over 10 years pushed what had long
been considered 'Genoa's other team' to success against clubs backed by the
largest business empires in Italy (Agnelli's Juventus and Berlusconi's
Milan).
Whether sustained by a prestigious past or more recent successes, the
Genovese are first and foremost grandstand 'supporters': impassioned,
sometimes even sombre, always extremely fair - and rather satisfied with
results in 1992.
For the first time in their history, both teams have been involved at the
highest levels of international tournaments at the same time.
While the Genoa club missed out on the UEFA cup, it had the consolation
prize of playing in the semi-finals and achieving two historic victories
against Liverpool.
Meanwhile, the Sampdoria fans are busy organising their expedition to
Wembley, where their team will battle Barcelona for the Champions' Cup.
But the 1992 sporting year in Genoa will not be dominated by football: the
Columbus festivities include international cycling, water polo, track and
field and sailing events.
The Genovese have become aware that the Columbus festival offers an
opportunity for relaunching the city, and that sport can encourage the
process. So they have partly overcome their traditional reluctance to embark
on relatively risky investments. In the case of sports, the financial
caution of public authorities and private sponsors even went so far as to
penalise activities in which the city was once outstanding.
One of the chronic problems afflicting sports in Genoa is a lack of
management, facilities and space in which to build arenas and playing
fields. The city is now trying to remedy this problem which, for example,
resulted in the loss of a basketball team, Emerson, and the shift of the
water polo centre to the nearby Riviera, which has better facilities.
Other lost opportunities include a world swimming tournament, the baseball
World Cup and international boxing, motorcycling and sailing events, and
probably the finals of the volleyball World League.
So, while the Genovese await new facilities (which will include a new sports
arena and the new 'Sciorba' multisports centre), they are seeking to make
the most of what they have.
In the events that did not escape in 1992 they have demonstrated a new
enthusiasm: speed of execution and managerial capacity on the part of
organisers and a great deal of interest from the public.
The big sport in February was track and field, first with the CUS Genoa
Trophy, which attracted international athletes such as Leroy Burrell, the
American runner, and Jamaica's Merlene Ottey, both favourites to win sprint
gold medals at this year's Olympic Games to be held in Barcelona.
This was followed by the three days of the European Indoor Championships, a
testing ground for the Olympics, marked by the first participation of teams
from Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
The latest event, following the World Under-20 Fencing Championships last
month, was the departure of the Columbus '92 Quincentenary Grand Regatta,
with the participation of Spain, Portugal, the UK, Puerto Rico, the United
States and, of course, Italy.
One hundred and fifty veteran ships, including 25 school vessels, will
undertake six legs from Genoa to Liverpool, where they are due to arrive
between August 13 and 16 after covering 9,300 miles of ocean sailed in the
name of Columbus.
One of the organisers of the regatta is the Yacht Club Italiano of Genoa,
one of the world's prestigious sailing clubs, which for more than a century
has been helping to uphold the city's maritime tradition.
Founded in 1879 with the patronage of King Humbert I, the YCI has provided
outstanding figures in world sailing, such as the late Beppe Croce, who
succeeded Peter Scott as president of the International Yacht Racing Union.
With Giovanni Novi at its helm today, the club boasts around 1,000 members
who were able to meet the rigorous membership requirements. The most
illustrious include leading businessmen such as Raul Gardini, Carlo Bonomi,
Gianni Verasi and Giorgio Falck.
Genoa will also be the scene of an international cycling competition this
year: in addition to the Apennine Tour earlier this month, the Tour of Italy
will once again start out from Genoa (May 22-25) after a 12-year absence,
with the first pink jersey awarded in the name of Columbus.
The APT tennis tour will be in Genoa from June 15 to 21 with the IP cup (won
last year by Carl-Uwe Steeb). Thereafter the city will host the World
Rollerskating championships (September 3-6), thanks in part to Ingrid Van
Marie, the multiple international title winner and Genovese by adoption.
Young athletes, ranging from six to 14 years of age, will take part in the
national finals of the Youth Games from October 4 to 10; there are 8,000
Italian participants (plus 1,000 Spanish and American guests), who will
compete in events scattered throughout the Ligurian region. The final awards
ceremony of the Games will be held in the new Expo area inside the port.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (8) - Highs and lows amid the
diversity / City guide, Haig Simonian takes a stroll around Genoa to view
the contrast between its classic and modern architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STAND with your back to elegant via Roma, facing Piazza De Ferrari in the
heart of Genoa, and you could be in any well-kept Edwardian city, with the
newly-cleaned civic buildings opposite proclaiming their wealth and
well-being.
The first surprise comes to your left, where the 'new' Carlo Felice opera
house demands a closer look. The arcade along via Roma and the imposing
portico on the square instantly bring to mind a classical theatre, perhaps a
little touched up of late,
But it is the huge fly tower, thrusting 200 feet into the sky, which gives
the game away. Post-modernism is the theme in architect Aldo Rossi's
striking design for one of the best known landmarks, which was partly
destroyed in 1944 and only reopened to the public late last year.
The fly tower has been the most controversial part of the generally
well-received project. A close second came the series of windows and
balconies which look over the stage inside. The shuttered windows, evoking
the exteriors of a typically Genovese street, led to loud protests from the
purists. But the overall effect, which gives the audience the impression it
is looking at real life from the outside, is eye-catching and effective.
On the same square, but with its baroque main facade just round the corner
in Piazza Matteotti off via San: Lorenzo, is the lavishly restored Palazzo
Ducale, the best example of the Columbus-led urban revival now taking place
in the city.
The scaffolding covering the former seat of Genoa's Doges is only just
coming down to reveal white walls and gilded ornamentation. The sumptuous
interior, not yet open to the public, will provide a new exhibition and
meeting space akin to the restored Palazzo Grassi in Venice.
A few steps down the hill is the Cathedral of San Lorenzo, another
architectural gems. Its splendid Gothic facade, in multilayered marble,
leads into a majestic interior, with a fine rose window and a wealth of
intricate carving.
If Genoa from Piazza De Ferrari evokes civic glories, the city seen from the
top-floor balcony of the renamed and revamped Terrazza Colombo lends a
wholly different perspective. The 31st floor viewing gallery of the
skyscraper in Piazza Dante offers commanding views over the hills, city and
harbour. At the foot of the building is the heavily restored Porta Soprana,
a medieval city gate, near to which are the remains of what is believed to
be Columbus's house.
What is revealed from the terrace is more like modern Marseilles than an
ancient Italian city. The sprawling port and ageing 1950s' buildings nearby,
which would have counted as skyscrapers in their time, strongly recall the
French port.
The third place to see Genoa's diversity is beside the Loggia dei Mercanti,
also still covered in scaffolding, in Piazza Banchi in the thick of the old
town. Here the impression is of casbah rather than cosmopolitan metropolis.
The area, which some Genovese shun by night, is a maze of narrow alleys and
ancient, often delapidated buildings. The atmosphere is Neapolitan, if not
distinctly Middle Eastern, the exotic flavour heightened by the large
numbers of north African immigrants.
Genoa claims to have the biggest historic centre of any city in Europe and,
for anyone wandering around this area, it is easy to believe.
So far, there are only small islands of restoration. One day, there may be
more, although beautifying the area could, ironically, detract from its
seedy charm. However, sea change in Genoa's attitude towards its
architectural heritage is already apparent at the Columbus exhibition site
nearby, where four of the old 16th Century bonded warehouses have been
lavishly restored.
Finally, there is the modern, high-rise Genoa of the San Benigno office
complex, which includes the multi-storey World Trade Centre and a number of
other glass boxes in its midst.
The truth is that Genoa is full of contrasts. What could be more striking
than the difference between the solid 16th Century palazzi of via Garibaldi,
one of the finest streets in Italy, and the narrow lanes of the old town
only minutes away?
Via Garibaldi is rightly viewed as Genoa's architectural crown, with each
building, many now turned into banks, more splendid than the next. Their
history goes back to the 16th Century, when wealthy patrician families, many
of them in the banking business which made Genoa famous alongside its trade,
compete with one another to build splendid palaces, rather like the rivalry
between the elite of Tuscan towns such as Florence and Siena a century
earlier. Much remains, and a number of the buildings also contain fine art
collections.
The most obvious contrast of all is that of Genoa's differing heights. From
the harbourside to the top of town by the Castelletto is a long walk. But
once up on the Belvedere terrace, from which there is another fine view over
the rooftops out to sea, the effort proves worthwhile.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (7) - An annual Mecca for
sailors / Fairs, The October Boat Show is one of the biggest events of its
kind in the world and attracts around 350,000 visitors
</HEADLINE>

PERCHED on the delta of the river Bisagno on land rescued from the sea,
Genoa's fair symbolises much about its host city.
With the Mediterranean its immediate neighbour and the city centre just
minutes away on foot, the fair highlights the advantages and disadvantages
of Genoa's geography. For while the setting may be unbeatable, the narrow
site offers little scope for expansion.
In spite of its limitations, the fair comes into its own for 10 days each
October, when it hosts the International Boat Show. One of the biggest
events of its kind in the world, the Boat Show attracts around 350,000
visitors, more than half from outside Genoa and around 20,000 from abroad.
The figures for the Boat Show are impressive, with more than 800 exhibitors
and 1,500 boats on display in every corner of the narrow site. The biggest
boats are reserved for Hall B, which, with its four-storey height, can take
big sailing boats up to 32 metres long, masts and all.
Bigger vessels, which are also seen regularly in Genoa, have to stay on the
water in the specially-built marina used as additional exhibition space
during the show and rented out to local sailors for the rest of the year.
Having the marina at hand means Genoa can offer much the same amount of
exhibition space as its bigger international rivals.
Although the boat shows at Dusseldorf and Miami are about the same size, no
other exhibition of its kind offers the same combination of sophisticated
interior facilities and external possibilities on the water, says Mr
Giuseppino Roberto, the fair's secretary-general.
The Boat Show, which will celebrate its 33rd anniversary this year, used to
be held in February until it was shifted to October in 1972. 'The choice of
October was very fortunate. Although it is at the end of the season, it is
still very much late summer in Liguria, meaning the weather is very pleasant
and people want to come to look at boats,' says Mr Roberto.
He is less communicative about the competitive factors which may also have
forced the change. Boat shows have become big business in rich European
countries and in the US. Apart from Dusseldorf and Miami, Genoa also faces
rivals in London, Paris, Barcelona and a number of the Scandinavian
countries.
The decision to hold a boat show in Genoa reflects the thinking behind the
creation of the fair in the mid-1950s. Building started in 1959, and the
first Boat Show opened in 1962. 'With Genoa's traditions as a seaport, the
original idea was to create a big event concentrating on communications,
especially on a cultural level,' Mr Roberto recalls. However, early
'communications fairs' showed the concept had little commercial validity, he
admits.
It was a different story for the Boat Show, which gave Liguria's
recreational shipbuilders a chance to show off their wares and the region's
sea-loving public the opportunity to gawp and, sometimes, to buy.
But while exhibiting boats turned out to be a swift success, the fair had to
dream up other commercially-viable attractions. Many have fallen by the
wayside, but two - Tecnhotel and Euroflora - have become established events.
The first is devoted to the hotel business, while the second, held every
five years, is a huge horticultural extravaganza. The success of both fairs
illustrates the importance of presenting shows which have some local roots.
With its huge tourist business and thousands of hotels along the Riviera,
Tecnhotel fulfils a clear need. Likewise, staging Euroflora, which pulls in
around 700,000 visitors for its 10-day run, is appropriate for Genoa given
the Riviera's role as Italy's horticultural heart.
Tecnhotel, which now has an additional fair on contract furnishing tacked
on, began in 1965, while the first Euroflora was held in 1966. The most
recent show, held last year, understandably had a Christopher Columbus
theme, with the focus on the plants and flowers of north America, says Mr
Roberto.
While the Boat Show, Tecnhotel and Euroflora are Genoa's three big
international events, the city also holds a variety of other, more
specialised, fairs. Riabitat, held every two years, concentrates on the
businesses of restoring and modernising buildings. Restoration often
features as a side event at many big international building fairs. But no
other city has an event devoted solely to the subject, says Mr Roberto.
'It's particularly appropriate if you think of Italy, with its historic city
centres, where there is a culture of building which must last for
centuries.'
More recently, the fair has come up with Auto Story, a specialist exhibition
of prestige and veteran cars, now in its second year. The fair has had a
good reception from the public and car dealers, he says.
But in a business noted for its competition, both internationally and
between fairs in their own countries, Genoa will have to carry on thinking
up new ideas if it is not to rely exclusively on its three big international
events, one of which, after all, is only held twice a decade. The fair
recognises, but may not have yet met, the challenge.
Domestically, both the Milan and Bologna fairs are appreciably bigger in
terms of size and prestige. Genoa ranks roughly on a par with cities such as
Turin, Verona and Bari, all of which have around the same amount of space
available and which all hold at least one event of international importance,
as well as many other shows of more local interest.
But in some ways, the priority for Genova is to hold its own, implies Mr
Roberto. Surprisingly, the fair is not seen as a potential profit-maker for
the city. Rather, he takes pride in the fact that it has generally managed
to balance its books. Small surpluses in the past 10 years have been used to
improve the facilities, with L12bn being spent on creating the marina and
L8bn on modernising the congress centre.
However, the L15bn investment now needed to upgrade facilities and improve
essential services such as electricity and water will have to come from
outside sources. 'The big profits come from big events which draw over
50,000 visitors. We don't have many of those,' Mr Roberto admits. 'Our aim
is more towards providing an overall benefit towards the city.'

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (6) - Symbol of lost
opportunities / The Harbour, The flag of privatisation is now flying highest
at the port - surprisingly, for a former centre of hard-left politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A CITY renowned for its reserve, nothing provokes an argument faster than
the port. For its critics, the port symbolises decades of politicised
management, bungling and lost opportunities, notably in failing to come to
terms with containerisation.
Added to that has been a reluctance to confront restrictive labour
practices, which led to high costs and an inevitable downward spiral of
lower competitiveness and steady decline. From 51m tonnes in 1980, cargo
handled fell to 44m last year, including oil and related products, which
comprised more than half the overall tonnage in 1991. Meanwhile, the number
of dockers has dropped to just over 1,000 from more than 7,000 15 years ago.
To some extent, the argument has already been won. Even the port's
management, concentrated in the 13th Century Palazzo San Giorgio, admits
Genoa must adapt or die. What they add is that change is already well under
way.
Surprisingly for a former centre of hard-left politics, it is at the port
that the flag of privatisation is now flying highest. Under plans originally
drawn up in 1984, and subsequently refined, the Port Authority is bringing
in private companies as partners in a number of joint ventures within the
traditional port area. Meanwhile, at Voltri, six miles to the west, a L180bn
scheme is under way to build the biggest container terminal in the
Mediterranean, with the Port Authority as only a junior partner to private
sector capital.
The Port Authority has singled out seven activities in the old port in which
it wants private-sector participation, explains Mr Rinaldo Magnani, a former
dock worker and ex-president of Liguria, who is now its chairman.
The terminals include fruit, general bulk cargoes, fertilisers and roll-on
roll-off transport. The most likely private sector shareholders will be the
big companies already using the facilities, he explains. So far, Coeclerici,
a leading trader and fruit importer, has joined forces with the Port
Authority at the fruit terminal, Ferruzzi and two other private companies
are participating on the ro-ro side, while the Camelli group has come in for
bulk cargoes. 'We're trying out a concept which could eventually be applied
to other Italian ports too,' says Mr Magnani.
Sceptics say the decision to turn to private companies has come more out of
desperation than desire given the sorry state of the port's finances and the
financial pressures on the Rome government, which has been so generous
towards Genoa in the past. Much of the expected L300bn investment in the
terminals is supposed to come from the private sector. The biggest single
investment - some L75bn - is going on the cruise and ferry terminal, while
L20.5bn is earmarked for the specialised bulk cargo terminal and L47.5bn for
ro-ro.
If the scheme for the terminals is ambitious, that for Voltri is bigger
still. Here, the Port Authority has joined forces with Fiat - a traditional
bogey of the hard left in Italy. Together, they have set up a new company,
Voltri Terminal Europa (VTE), in which Sinport, a subsidiary of Fiat's
Cogefar-Impresit civil engineering arm, has 95 per cent of the shares and
the port the rest. Significantly, overall management will be left to
Sinport, which has been given the concession to run Voltri from the Port
Authority, which controls the land.
When it opens next year, Voltri, covering more than 1m square metres, will
be able to handle three 'jumbo' container ships simultaneously. Volume in
the first year is forecast to reach 100,000 containers, rising to 250,000 in
1995 and 500,000 by the year 2000.
But ambitions for Voltri do not end there. Mr Magnani says the eventual aim
may be to float VTE on the stock market, while other big industrial
shareholders may also be brought in. Such partners could include leading Far
East shipping groups, such as Evergreen, say local industry sources.
Negotiating long-term contracts with big Far Eastern shipping companies is
part of the Port Authority's strategy. 'I know there's a lot of interest,'
Mr Magnani says.
He wants the new facility to become a 'point of reference' in the
Mediterranean, especially given Europe's steadily rising level of imports
from the Far East. The Port Authority plays on Genoa's proximity to Europe's
main markets, which can be reached easily via the adjoining motorway and
rail network. By offloading at Voltri, shippers from the Pacific, sailing
via the Suez canal, would save about a week's journey time compared with
using established container terminals in northern Europe such as Rotterdam.
In spite of having recently returned from an extensive Far Eastern marketing
trip, Mr Magnani will not comment on how close Voltri has come to signing
long-term contracts with big 'round-the-world' shipping groups. Nor will he
reveal whether such companies might become future shareholders in VTE.
However, he draws attention to the fact that a canny group like Fiat is
unlikely to have commited so much money to Voltri if it were unsure about
the outcome.
Mr Magnani admits Voltri may take some business away from the port's two
existing container terminals. However, he notes the facilities are
complementary rather than competitive. Voltri will be able to berth
appreciably bigger ships than can dock in Genoa now. He also points to the
growth of 5-6 per cent a year forecast for Mediterranean traffic. So, while
the old port may lose some business, it should remain busy, he claims. More
important, the lower costs of using Voltri thanks to deregulated labour
could provide a salutary stimulus for altered working practices among the
port's existing dockers.
Surprisingly, Mr Magnani is reticent when it comes to assessing the effect
of Voltri on Marseilles and Barcelona, the two other big container
facilities in the western Mediterranean with which it will compete. 'I don't
say we should be competing with them. Rather, we should be winning back the
business that now goes from Milan to Rotterdam, instead of coming to Genoa,'
he says.
But will Genoa, still bearing the stigma of rotten industrial relations for
many shippers, be able to rise to the new challenges? For many Genoese
businessmen, the port's conversion to the cause of privatisation is hard to
swallow.
Mr Riccardo Garrone, the chairman of the ERG petroleum group and a leader of
the city's business community, responds with scepticism mixed with hope. His
doubts are largely based on the way in which the port has been run in the
past. 'The wrong people were in charge. When motorways were being built all
over Europe, making other, more reliable, ports competitive in spite of
being further away from the main markets, Genoa failed to react.'
The port has undoubtedly lost ground. La Spezia to the south now handles
appreciably more containers, although it is less conveniently placed for the
big cities of northern Italy. Even smaller ports such as Savona have gained
at Genoa's expense.
Mr Garrone focuses on the lack of internal competition and transparency as
the port's biggest problems in the past. Though showered with government
money, the cash went to cover the losses caused by its myriad inefficiencies
rather than being ploughed into investments for the future. Meanwhile, the
regular doses of state funds cushioned dockers and even businesses connected
with the port from feeling the harsh winds of competition, he thinks.
Mr Garrone hopes that part-privatisation and the development of Voltri will
mark a new chapter. But he warns that they will only succeed if there is
genuine competition between port operators. For Mr Garrone, one of the
gravest mistakes of the past was that the port was run by a single, largely
unaccountable entity. Privatisation is definitely 'a step ahead. But there
must true competition' if the schemes are to succeed, he stresses.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (5) - A room with a view of the
sea / Hotels, City centre accommodation is being improved but many visitors
still prefer to go further afield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

POORLY served until recently by top hotels, Genoa has used the Columbus
Exhibition to spur both rebuilding and new construction in a bid to offer
business travellers more choice.
The closure some years ago of the Colombia, Genoa's member of the Aga Khan's
luxury CIGA hotels chain, has made the lack of top hotels more evident than
ever. However, business visitors should note that the Colombia is supposed
to re-open as a residence, which could be useful for those planning a longer
stay.
While the options within the city are now improving, the limited range and
the fact that Genoa's leading hotels are often booked up months in advance
for big events such as the annual Boat Show, means many visitors prefer to
look outside town. For those not facing early-morning appointments in the
city centre, staying somewhere along the coast could be a positive boon. And
all the seaside towns except Portofino have good rail links with Genoa.
Running from west to east, and beginning in Genoa itself, here is our
choice:
The high rating for the down-at-heel Savoia Majestic, facing the Colombia on
the other side of Principe station, seems to stem primarily from the fact
that none of the guide books which recommend it highly have been there
recently. The hotel has also suffered from the general shift in Genoa's city
centre from Principe station in the west to Brignole further east.
Well located between the two is the Jolly Plaza. Even with building work to
revamp the hotel still under way, it is surprisingly characterful by the
Jolly chain's normally bland standards. There is also a car park nearby.
Ten minutes away on foot is the Bristol, set under the arcades of busy via
20 Settembre. For some, the sombre hotel, all red leather upholstery and
restrained colours, exudes the atmosphere of a London club, and typifies
Genoa's Anglo-Saxon leanings. I found it depressing.
Just by Brignole station in the new Corte Lambruschini complex is the Star,
completed last year, and striking for its angular architecture. The hotel,
expensive by local standards, is all a modern businessman's base should be -
and little more. A range of facilities is available for conferences of up to
580 people as well as smaller meetings, and there is underground parking.
The absence of a hotel at Genoa's small Christopher Columbus airport should
be corrected towards the end of this year with the opening of the big new
Sheraton. It may be worth a try, in spite of the inconvenient location.
Substantial facilities for meetings and conferences are also planned.
Outside the city, visitors should look exclusively along the eastern
Riviera, rather than the industrialised immediate west.
The choice starts at the small town of Nervi, now incorporated within Genoa
itself, and runs down to the Portofino peninsula.
Nervi itself, six miles from the city centre, is a quiet resort of
considerable charm once away from the busy main road running above the town.
None of its hotels is in the luxury class, but most are pleasant, especially
the small Pagoda, in spite of its disappointingly utilitarian room
furnishings. Lying in a small park on the edge of Nervi's public gardens, it
even has its own path leading to the lovely seaside promenade.
Camogli, 16 miles from Genoa and coming just before the Portofino peninsula,
offers the Cenobio dei Dogi, a historic old hotel full of atmosphere
overlooking the sea in its own grounds.
Rapallo, Santa Margherita Ligure and Portofino itself are all on the eastern
side of the peninsula, and offer a wide choice of hotels.
Rapallo, with 26,000 inhabitants, is as much a small town as a seaside
resort. Its leading hotel is the Grand Hotel Bristol, often confused with
the hotel of the same name in Genoa. Built by the British early this century
and expensively restored eight years ago, the Bristol is an unfortunate case
of money ill-spent, Mirror glass cladding on the back and a range of garish
colour schemes within may have been the last word in chic when commissioned.
They could even become a 'feature' within a few decades. However, the effect
today is pretty dire. Rooms are comfortable, with commanding views across
the bay, and there are good meeting and conference facilities.
Santa Margherita offers two luxury hotels, as well as a long list of more
modest accommodation. Both the Imperial Palace and the Grand Hotel Miramare
are set in fine grounds and face the sea. The town itself is first and
foremost a resort, as evidenced by the many pleasure craft in its pretty
harbour. However, it can become unpleasantly crowded on sunny weekends, and
especially during the peak Sunday afternoon passeggiata.
Three miles down the peninsula on a narrow, twisting road where drivers must
fight the temptation to admire the view if they are to avoid head-on
collisions, is Portofino. Called the Splendido, one hotel stands out above
all else in the region, Genoa included.
Justly feted in an industry known for its hype, the Splendido is one of
those places guests do not want to leave. Set in a beautiful terraced garden
high above Portofino, with views down to the harbour, sea and neighbouring
hills, it is an ideal place to wind down - as witnessed by the large number
of well-heeled Italians who regularly return at weekends.
Of course, luxury accommodation, manicured grounds and a ratio of almost 100
staff for just 63 rooms do not come cheap. Yet the quality is so high and
service so good as to make even the Splendido's extremely weighty bills seem
reasonable in the circumstances. And guests can always console themselves
that the hotel, now owned by the Venice Simplon Orient Express (VSOE)
subsidiary of the Sea Containers group, is still appreciably cheaper than
either the Cipriani in Venice or the Villa San Michele in Fiesole, VSOE's
two other Italian hotels, both of which, especially the latter, are likely
to provoke Latin American standards of debt for those contemplating an
extended stay.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (4) - An international meeting
place / Conferences, The new Congress Centre in the old cotton warehouses
gives the city a high-tech, purpose-built venue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Confindustria, Italy's employers' federation, held its most recent
congress earlier this year, it opted for Genoa. But rather than meeting in
some well-established centre, the 2,000-odd delegates found themselves
occupying the stalls of the Carlo Felice opera house.
The choice of Genoa, and the theatre, probably reflected a desire to promote
the city in Columbus year. And many of the delegates would undoubtedly have
been keen to see the lavishly-restored theatre, which has received heaps of
publicity.
But it also demonstrated Genoa's lack of a suitable venue. Only with the
opening of the new Congress Centre in the converted old cotton warehouses,
which form part of the Expo site, will Genoa be able to boast a high-tech,
purpose-built venue of its own.
Converting the cotton warehouses, built by the British at the beginning of
this century, has been a race against time, with workers in the building
virtually up to a minute before its formal opening with the annual
shareholders' meeting of the Banca Popolare di Genova.
However, visitors are likely to be impressed. With its twin halls on either
side of a central stage, the centre offers flexible seating for up to 1,500,
along with a series of smaller auditoria seating up to 400. There is also a
huge amount of exhibition space on the four floors.
Typical of the iron and brick port architecture of the era, the long, thin
cotton warehouse stretches for almost a quarter of a mile along the Molo
Vecchio wharf jutting out into the harbour. While the exterior has been
largely preserved, much of the interior has been transformed.
The final section housing the conference centre has been gutted. From its
upper floors, delegates will be able to look over the port, while a smaller
building alongside houses all the services, such as sophisticated air
conditioning, needed for a new conference centre. The complex even has its
own telecommunications centre for live teleconferencing.
The congress centre has already lined up five big international conventions
to run concurrently with the Christopher Columbus exhibition, as well as a
range of seminars and lectures. All will focus on maritime issues, including
environmental protection and preservation, as well as legal matters.
The creation of the congress centre means Genoa now has two venues for
conventions, not counting the opera house, which is likely to revert to
full-time cultural use. Over at the fair, the convention centre offers
facilities for up to 800 in its largest auditorium, while a smaller hall can
accommodate around 400 delegates.
Further facilities are available at a number of hotels in the city, notably
the Star, hard by Brignole station in the Corte Lambruschini complex.
However, conference-goers should have an even wider range of choice come
October, when a new hotel is expected to open near the airport, with a range
of meeting halls of its own.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (3) - Families dominate the
scene / Business, For many, Genoa still means steel and shipbuilding, though
both have shrunk beyond recognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE traditional split in Genoa's business community between a public sector
concentrated in engineering and a private sector specialising in shipping
and trade has been eroded as a result of the crisis in heavy industry and
the part-privatisation of the local steel industry. But the broad
distinction is still valid.
In spite of repeated shrinkage, the giant IRI state holding company remains
Genoa's biggest employer. Its Finmeccanica engineering arm controls Ansaldo,
the city's leading heavy engineering group, whose roots under the Perrone
family go back to the early days of Italy's industrialisation.
Ansaldo has taken some heavy knocks in recent years, notably after the 1987
referendum ban on nuclear power, making the company's nuclear power division
redundant virtually overnight. In spite of that and competition from bigger
international rivals such as Siemens and ABB, Ansaldo has bounced back. Its
Genoese operations are in energy, transportation - especially rail equipment
and signalling - and heavy engineering.
Finmeccanica's other big Genoese offshoot is the Elsag Bailey precision
engineering group. Often presented as one of Italy's high-tech jewels, the
reality is slightly less extravagant. However, the company, which makes a
range of specialised equipment for factory automation, mechanised letter
sorting and various other purposes, has grown rapidly through acquisitions.
After buying the US Bailey group, more than half of sales now come from
abroad, a point stressed heavily in the group's stock market flotation last
year.
For many, Genoa still means steel and shipbuilding, though both have shrunk
beyond recognition. The lavishly renovated headquarters of Ilva, the state
steel group, in an Art-Deco palace in the posh Carignano district, must
count as one of Italy's most impressive corporate headquarters with its
starkly contrasting white interiors, black leather furniture and halogen
lighting.
Ilva's remaining industrial activities, based in the Cornigliano industrial
zone west of the port, are another matter. Most basic steelmaking has long
been moved to southern Italy, while part of the Cornigliano plant has been
privatised. Plans are now in hand to convert much of the remaining
industrial wasteland into a business park for smaller industrial and service
companies as part of Ilva's ambitious but controversial 'Utopia' project.
Most closely identified of all the public-sector companies with the Columbus
Exhibition is IRI's Italimpianti subsidiary, which masterminded the L500bn
building and general contracting project for the Expo site.
Based in a distinctive pencil-shaped tower (the Mattitone) near the western
docks, Italimpianti was merged this year with Italstat, another IRI
subsidiary, into a new group called Iritecna. The aim was to create a large
Italian group combining engineering, contracting and construction skills and
able to compete with foreign rivals such as Germany's Mannesmann and Philipp
Holzmann on big overseas infrastructure projects.
However, Iritecna has so far failed to emerge from the political controversy
and management in-fighting that mar many of its public-sector counterparts.
Many of its problems, like theirs, stem from having too many bosses and
criss-crossing responsibilities.
So while the dream behind Iritecna remains laudable, it will only be
realised if IRI's chairman Mr Franco Nobili, who has a building background,
manages to knock heads together and unblock the difficulties which have so
far paralysed what should be Italy's champion in the international building
and general contracting field.
Genoa is no longer the Italian base for the international oil majors, though
the port remains the country's leading terminal for importing refined
products, which are then distributed nationally or sent on via a direct
pipeline to Switzerland and Germany.
The only big private-sector oil operator left is the Garrone family's ERG
group. Mr Riccardo Garrone, the chairman, is a pugnacious 56-year-old who
assumed control as a youngster after his father died in 1963. Under him, ERG
has grown into Italy's biggest private-sector oil group, with more than
2,000 petrol stations and about 6 per cent of the market.
But even its Genoese activities have slimmed down in recent years. Though
based in the towering World Trade Centre by the docks, most of its
industrial operations are now elsewhere, with a big refinery in Sicily and
other offices in Rome. Genoa remains the nerve centre for top management,
concentrated in the family holding company.
Mr Garrone himself, a keen hunter, is an entrenched critic of the city's
left-wing politicians, whom he accuses of having caused its decline. At last
month's general election, he failed to win a seat in the Senate as a
candidate for the small Republican party. However, his local prestige - and
lavish spending, according to his critics - was enough to lift the party's
share of the vote to 15 per cent from around 4 per cent normally, in spite
of competition from Mr Guido Carli, Italy's treasury minister, and other
candidates.
Genoa's foremost representative in shipping and trade is the privately-owned
Camelli group. Somewhat confusing in its structure after a spate of recent
takeovers of small stock market quoted companies, it now comprises five main
branches.
Camelli concentrates on oil trading, as well as having some refining and
distribution capacity. Gerolimich, a quoted subsidiary, controls various
industrial stakes, both directly and through Unione Manifatture, which is
also quoted and is best known for owning the company making Sweda cash
registers. Other recent acquisitions include Navigazione Alta Italia (NAI)
in shipping and Rodriquez, a shipbuilder famous for its fast catamarans.
Jointly owned by the Camelli family and by Mr Luigi Regis Milano, who
masterminds its affairs, critics say the group now needs to simplify its
structure after the string of takeovers. Meanwhile, trading in the shares of
a number of the quoted subsidiaries is still suspended.
Among Genoa's other top private companies are the Costa group, now most
familiar for its cruise ships which ply the Caribbean and Mediterranean.
Costa Crociere, quoted on the bourse, is all that is left of what was once
one of Italy's foremost private companies, which rivalled and even surpassed
giants such as Fiat and Pirelli. Mr Angelo Costa, a former boss, ranks as
one of the most famous former chairmen of Italy's Confindustria employers'
federation in the early 1950s.
The group's decline is closely associated with that of the port in the
1970s. But the cruise business has led a partial comeback in recent years
and resulted in a string of orders for huge new vessels - albeit at the cost
of a substantial rise in debt.
Completing the list of the city's big shipping and trading families are the
Clericis, whose link with former British partners, the Coes, is enshrined in
the name of their Coeclerici group.
Their Bulkitalia subsidiary owns a fleet of bulk carriers, which used to be
jointly owned with the big Ferruzzi group. However, Mr Giacomo Clerici,
universally known as Jack, bought out Ferruzzi's then boss, Mr Raul Gardini,
to take sole control.
Now in his 80s, Jack Clerici, whose mother was British, ranks as one of
Genoa's grand old men. His international links, particularly with the former
Soviet Union, have won him a reputation akin to that of the legendary Mr
Armand Hammer in the US.
Mr Giovanni Battista (Gaimba) Parodi is probably Genoa's least known
businessman to outsiders. But for many Italians from the city and beyond, he
counts as one of the richest men in the country.
His operations include the quoted Acquedotto de Ferrari Galliera group,
which distributes half the city's drinking water, and a number of activities
in the construction business, as well as a range of financial holdings,
including stakes in big quoted companies such as Pirelli.
The Parodi family's Genoese roots go far back. The former Banca Parodi was
one of the regional institutions swept up in the founding of the Bank of
Italy, and Mr Parodi is today on the board of the central bank.
Another of the grand old men of Genoa, Mr Parodi is every inch the retiring
millionaire. Famous for his modest lifestyle, his quirks reportedly include
being chauffeured in a tiny Fiat mini-car and occupying the former servants
quarters in a family-owned Palazzo in the majestic via Garibaldi.
The Romanengo family has come to prominence outside Genoa only relatively
recently. Last year, its Sci property group was floated on the bourse.
Having already made a mark on the city's skyline with developments such as
the World Trade Centre and other buildings in the big Centro San Benigno
project, Sci, in which Mr Garrone's ERG group now has a 12.75 per cent
stake, is now extending its property development activities abroad.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (2) - Famous son repays his home
town / Columbus Exhibition, The attempt to cash in on Genoa's most
celebrated mariner has been done with true Italian panache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEWHERE underneath the flyover, not far from the container lorries and
next to the apparently interminable road works is the horseshoe-shaped piece
of Genoa's old harbour housing the exhibition on Christopher Columbus, Ships
and the Sea, the reason for the city's present jamboree.
The attempt to cash in on the Columbus business has been done with true
Italian panache, meaning constructive chaos. The paint may still be wet in
patches, the mortar not quite set on every stone, but the exhibition should
open on time. That in itself will be an achievement considering the
landscape of cranes, pick-up trucks and pneumatic drills that dominated the
scene until just a few weeks back.
The project turned into a race against time after early construction work
unearthed the remains of 12th and 14th Century port installations just where
the aquarium was supposed to go. In came the archaeologists and out went the
blueprints as the site had to be redrawn. In the end, the aquarium and other
linked buildings were shifted 50 metres out to sea.
'We knew all along it wouldn't be ready on time,' says Mr Gianfranco Medri,
the managing director for the L750bn Expo project. 'The experts said it
would take five years to have the aquarium fully functioning. We've done it
in less than three, even if all the tanks won't be full yet. But then, we
started a bit late.'
Europe's biggest aquarium, and the second largest in the world, is just one
of the attractions which the Columbus '92 Exhibition hopes will pull in the
crowds to its redeveloped 12-acre site, just minutes from the city centre.
Looking out to sea, visitors will be struck by the restored old cotton
warehouses, now converted into a congress centre and exhibition space, to
their left. On the right, another long jetty shoots out to sea. It will
incorporate the boat-shaped Italian pavilion and the aquarium behind it.
Straight ahead is a huge spider-like structure, the Bigo, rising from the
water, which has become one of the exhibition's symbols. Recalling a giant
ship's crane, it is the brainchild of Genovese architect Renzo Piano, best
known as one of the two partners behind the Pompidou Centre in Paris, who
has had overall responsibility for the design of the exhibition site.
Yet, in spite of all the money and effort behind it, the exhibition is still
having difficulty getting noticed. Pipped at the post by Seville in Spain,
which has used the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World to
mount a vast international extravaganza, Genoa has had to look for niches to
justify its belated attempt to honour its most famous son. The resulting
event, which is not just about Columbus, but on the more general theme of
'ships and the sea', has turned out worthy, with a stress on scientific
research and international conferences, but rather dull.
'Seville is a very different thing,' says Mr Merdi. 'Their intentions are
completely different. The site alone is 10 times bigger than ours.'
Wishful thinking? The existence of the much bigger Seville show, which also
started earlier, and the blanket promotion lavished on it, has obliged the
Genovese to think hard about what their Columbus celebration is all about.
'Ours is based on culture. It's designed to appeal to more thoughtful
visitors who will appreciate the exhibits but be just as interested in the
redevelopment of the old port,' he argues.
Genoa, perhaps making virtue out of necessity, stresses its show is neither
Eurodisney nor Seville. For sheer fun, better to head for the outskirts of
Paris. And if the aim is to gawp at a huge international exposition of the
old school, housed in mind-boggling buildings, Spain is the best
destination. But for those who are content with a more limited, and rather
more intellectual treat, Genoa could fit the bill.
Of course, the exhibition is not without its popular attractions, notably
the aquarium. Likewise the crane, which incorporates a 60-metre revolving
glass lift to hoist visitors aloft to admire the harbour and city from the
sort of perspective more familiar to a young midshipman up the mast of his
vessel than a mariner of today. But the feature in Genoa is more the general
redevelopment project and Renzo Piano's aim to 'open the waterfront again
and reunite the city with the sea' than providing the fun of the fair.
The unspoken rivalry with other big European attractions this year and
Genoa's much more modest means and space are among the reasons why the
project has already excited local tempers, especially over how many people
will actually come. The debate has been fuelled by the city's local
newspaper, Il Secolo XIX, whose family owners favoured a rival scheme to
promote the project.
The Expo's organisers are banking on between 3m and 3.5m visitors during the
Expo's three-month run. Others are more sceptical. They question how many
people, especially from outside the city, will be drawn to an event which,
for all its merits, is short of really big attractions for the general
public. And many claim the L25,000 entrance fee is steep for what is on
offer.
'I'm not expecting a big rush from the start,' says Mr Medri. 'We haven't
gone in for the sort of blanket promotion used by Seville and Eurodisney. I
think that approach can be counter-productive as people tend to get fed up
with being bombarded by promotional publicity.'
He hopes interest in Genoa's show will grow steadily through word of mouth.
'Things will start moving after the first two weeks,' he says. But, in a
familiar refrain, he admits that 'we set off late with the promotion'.
The bulk of visitors will come from Genoa itself or the immediate region.
Around two thirds will be Italians, the remainder foreigners, either from
nearby France or others visiting the Riviera for their summer holidays.
The projections recognise that few will be coming to see Genoa itself, in
spite of all the city's efforts to smarten its appearance. Almost all the
Italian visitors will be day-trippers, and the publicity has been
specifically designed for them.
Apart from the Genovese themselves, the organisers expect the exhibition to
appeal to millions of Italians from big cities such as Milan and Turin, both
less than two hours away by train or car. 'We certainly don't expect they
will all sleep in hotels in the city,' notes Mr Medri.
But once the holiday season starts, he hopes for a wider public as
holidaymakers along the Riviera may be tempted to desert the beach and spend
a day seeing the exhibition for themselves.
But the debate about numbers is probably irrelevant when considered against
the exhibition's wider aims. True, it should provide some entertainment for
the Genovese and their neighbours for a few months this spring and summer.
But more important is the event's role in promoting the rediscovery of a
rundown part of the city, yet lying cheek by jowl with some of its finest
houses and shops. Though not on a scale with harbourside redevelopments in
cities such as Baltimore, where hundreds of acres have been revived and
whole new entertainment zones created, the Genoa exhibition has also been
planned with the future of the city in mind.
More than 80 per cent of the site will remain untouched after the exhibition
closes on August 15, compared with the large-scale demolition which usually
follows a big international event of its kind. Once over, visitors will even
be able to see archaeologists at work on the port installations: it was
their discovery which delayed plans for the aquarium.
But the main contribution of the exhibition will be to have made the
Genovese themselves take their city more seriously. Irrespective of the
attendance figures, the exhibition has triggered off an architectural
revival, with restoration schemes going well beyond the old port itself. So,
while Genoa may have served Columbus badly when it failed to finance his
expedition across the Atlantic, its most famous son has repaid his former
home handsomely today.

FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (1) - A look back to the future
/ First Impressions, Nowhere else do the normally chauvinistic Italians play
so strongly the foreign card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TO UNDERSTAND Genoa, you have to understand the British,' is the cliche
regularly quoted to any remotely Anglo-Saxon visitor to Italy's biggest
port, now belatedly rediscovering its cultural heritage as an instrument to
counter years of economic decline.
Nowhere else do the normally chauvinistic Italians play so strongly the
foreign card. And nowhere else is the link so close with the UK. From
Genoa's heyday in the early Middle Ages as a mercantile city-state and
traditional rival of Venice, the relationship stretches through centuries of
two-way trade and a flow of tourism and culture which has tended to move
more in one direction than the other.
Always important for the British in their Mediterranean commerce, the
arrival of the Suez Canal made Genoa a vital stop for points further east as
well, notably India. Soon, the British aristocrats, who had already
discovered the mild breezes and jasmine gardens of the Riviera on either
side of the city, were joined by less titled, but equally well-heeled,
Britons who made the city and its surroundings a staging post on their way
to India and beyond.
Sojourns in Riviera watering holes became more than just a way of avoiding
the beastly British winter. For those either returning to the UK from the
colonies or just setting out, a spell on the Riviera became an acceptable
way of adjusting to the climatic changes ahead.
Climate and culture also appealed to the region's most famous British
visitors, the Romantic poets. The bay of La Spezia, 75 miles south of Genoa,
is still sometimes sold to the tourists as the 'Bay of Poets'. Byron used to
swim regularly in Portovenere, just north of La Spezia. In 1822, the
Shelleys rented a small house near the village of Lerici opposite. Sailing
along the coast from Leghorn to La Spezia on his way home Shelley drowned.
With the bicentenary of his birth this year, the number of British literary
tourists is bound to surge.
Genoa still makes much of its Anglo-Saxon links, a factor often cited today
to explain its charms and failings. For fellow Italians, the Genovese are a
dull lot; cool and reserved, they speak a barely comprehensible dialect and
seldom display the extrovert verve usually associated with their fellow
nationals. Like the Piedmontese to the north, they are also known throughout
Italy for a caution with money which is associated more with the Scottish
than the English.
The Anglo-Saxon air still hangs over parts of the city, though more in terms
of manners and society than art or architecture. Though exaggerated by their
fellow Italians, the tradition of reserve remains. Genoa's rich do not
flaunt their wealth like those in Milan and especially Rome. Money is
suggested rather than seen behind the high hedges and wrought-iron gates of
their big villas perched on the hills near the Staglieno cemetery towering
over the city.
Visitors to Genoa are often carted off to Finollo, an old-fashioned tie and
shirt maker on elegant via Roma, to savour for themselves the city's
Anglo-Saxon air. The dark and narrow store, full of ties in regimental
stripes, certainly recalls some of its counterparts in London's Jermyn
Street. But it is a measure of popular misunderstanding about the UK that
the shop, whose proprietors seem to have confused the distant politeness of
the British with a patronising smugness, verging on the rude, should so
often be used as a showcase.
Such self-satisfaction is at the heart of many of Genoa's problems, which
have dogged it for decades and which partly explain why its corner of the
famous economic triangle with Milan and Turin has shown signs of lapsing.
'Genoa's error is a bit like the problems of the British,' says Mr Carlo Da
Molo, chairman of Italgas, one of Italy's leading companies, and a born
Genovese.
Over the past three decades, the city failed to adapt to changing economic
circumstances and continued to rely heavily on the port as its main source
of livelihood. 'They didn't appreciate that things were changing', says Mr
Riccardo Garrone, a leading Genovese businessman whose ERG group is the
biggest private-sector petroleum company in Italy.
The complaints are levelled as much at the state as the private sector.
After the Second World War, public money poured into the bomb-scarred city
to rebuild heavy industry and set up new activities, notably in steel.
Meanwhile, more cash was ploughed into the port, as much in later years to
cover inefficiencies and restrictive labour practices as to adapt to new
trends, such as containerisation.
Change came only when the political balance tilted away from the hard left,
which dominated both the port and local politics, or when the inefficiencies
of both became too obvious to ignore.
The bell began to toll for the steel industry in the late 1960s, when
production started to shift to southern Italy. Though largely a political
decision, the move was also in recognition of the fact that Genoa's narrow
coastal strip, bounded by mountains and the sea, hardly lent itself to the
development of large-scale, integrated steelworks. Meanwhile, shipbuilding
suffered at the hands of cheaper foreign competition, and production of the
biggest vessels was eventually concentrated elsewhere.
Yet, the accusation of short-sightedness is levelled as strongly at Genoa's
private sector. Geared to shipping and trade, the city boasts next to no
private-sector industry, apart from the small Piaggio aircraft group and the
remains of the now partly-privatised steel business.
Showing native caution, Genoa's businessmen tended to stick to what they
knew best, maintaining their traditions as merchants rather than
entrepreneurs. Others suffered indirectly from the slow decline of the port.
'There were no industrialists in the private sector,' says Mr Garrone. 'And
the big private companies that did exist were too divided among themselves
to organise as a lobby to press for change'. Arguably, the development of
much better communications from the late 1950s, with excellent motorway
links between Genoa and the big cities of the north, may have encouraged the
tendency towards individualism. Local businessmen, frustrated by left-wing
politics locally, may have preferred to invest in the growing areas of
Lombardy and Piedmont to the north rather than Genoa itself. Others may have
chosen the less legal, but well-trodden, route to Switzerland for their
flight capital.
'Our refinery had to be closed because its chimneys released private-sector
smoke,' recalls a still bitter Mr Garrone. 'But the fumes from the Italsider
steelworks were good, because they were public-sector fumes,' he says
angrily. 'Mind you, as soon as it went private, it also came under attack.'
Though most critical of the hard left councils which governed Genoa for
years, he sees the city's recent past as having been tainted with a general
hostility to the private sector that went beyond the Communists to influence
other political groups, too.
The changes in Genoa today may be too sudden and dramatic to last. But the
optimists hope financial stringency in the public-sector will prove salutary
in stimulating a concentration only on activities which are viable. At the
port, partial privatisation of some operations and the construction of a
huge new container terminal at Voltri to the west have offered the chance of
regaining a role as the foremost trading post in the Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, local politics have taken a significant move towards the centre
with the arrival of a soft-left council two years ago.
Looking ahead, many Genovese point to the Christopher Columbus exhibition as
providing the spur to regenerate after decades of delay. Further off, but
even more important in its potential economic effect, is the planned
high-speed rail link with Milan.
That could cut the journey time from two hours to around 40 minutes. But
rather than seeing themselves as potential losers to their bigger neighbour
to the north, the Genovese are confident their city will be the clear
beneficiary from such an improvement in communications.
The link would make the coast far more accessible to northern Italians, for
whom Genoa would be the gateway. It may not trigger the development of new
heavy industry, but the high-speed line could be just the incentive for
creating the new service sector activities the city is looking for.

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: TI declares Pounds 504m Dowty bid final -
Only unlikely appearance of white knight would affect offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, yesterday turned the heat up
on bid target Dowty by declaring its Pounds 504m offer final.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman and chief executive, said that the
original 4 for 15 share offer, which values the bid at 186p and its cash
alternative of 175p, fully valued Dowty.
By taking the unusual step of making its first offer final, TI is confident
that it was pitched high enough to see off potential rival bidders. However,
it retains the right to increase its offer in the increasingly unlikely
event that a white knight emerges with a rival bid.
Mr Bruce Ralph, chairman of the aerospace and information technology group,
said there was nothing new in TI's document, which still presented Dowty
shareholders with an offer that was too low.
As part of the defence, which is expected early next week, Dowty is likely
to reveal an estimate of profits and earnings for the year ended March 1992.
Stockbrokers have estimated profits between Pounds 18.5m and Pounds 22m  -
giving earnings of 4.1p to 5.4p - down from Pounds 60.6m in 1991.
Mr Ralph said he was glad the phoney war was over and warned that some
analysts might be embarrassed by their low estimates of 1991 earnings.
Dowty will also try to slow the momentum TI has developed in the three weeks
since it launched its hostile bid by focusing its shareholders on the
strengths of its future order book and its development programmes.
Late yesterday Dowty also said that Mr Christopher Bunker would no longer be
joining in August as finance director from Westland, the helicopter
manufacturer where he holds the same position.
In what Mr Ralph called a humanitarian gesture Dowty had agreed to Mr
Bunker's request not to join Dowty in the middle of a bid.
In his letter to Dowty shareholders yesterday, Mr Lewinton repeated that the
Cheltenham-based company had lost its way after diversifying into
information technology.
He said he recognised the problem from when he joined TI in 1986 and found
that TI - formerly Tube Investments - had diversified from its core
businesses into Raleigh bicycles and consumer products.
TI has been refocused and built into an international group. The acquisition
of Dowty would provide a third aerospace leg to add to the tubes and seals
businesses.
Dowty has two weeks to produce its first defence document and 28 days to
convince its shareholders of the strength of its management.
Dowty's shares fell 6p to 181p on news of TI's final offer while TI shares
fell 1p to 697p.

<TEXT>
LEADING industrialised nations assured Africa yesterday they remained
committed to rescuing its fragile economies, despite increased competition
for aid due to changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc, Reuter
reports from Dakar.
The Netherlands minister for development cooperation, Mr Jan Pronx, told the
annual meeting of the African Development Bank it was difficult to see where
resources required to assist growth and attack poverty would come from,
without more effective rescheduling of debt.
'In the view of the Netherlands, we still have to strive for a write-off
debt of all least-developed countries,' he said.
Representatives of other industrialised states stopped short of endorsing a
need for new debt relief schemes, but chorused their intention to stand by
Africa.
'My country is committed to remaining engaged in this continent,' declared
Mr Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury.
Mr Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, Nigeria's finance minister, said debt relief now
provided 'a glimmer of hope', but Africa's economic plight was alarming.
He proposed that concessions which multilateral aid agencies allowed to the
poorest countries should be extended to the less well-off, middle-income
states.
But Mr Wethington told a news conference that Washington was reluctant at
this stage to agree to such a proposal.
He outlined at the meeting a two-pronged approach by his country in its
economic relations with Africa in the post-Cold War world.
While helping to meet social and economic needs, it would stress the value
of democracy and market-based economies, and favour changes to promote the
private sector.
'The long-term future lies with encouraging private enterprise,' he told
reporters. 'The private capital markets will be able, in the long term, to
provide resources that will exceed those available through official
channels.'
Mr Alhaji urged industrial countries to open their markets. 'At present,
excessive subsidies to agricultural products of the developed economies
create the double-edged sword which keeps our farm products out of their
markets and, at the same time, depresses markets for our products,' the
minister said.

INTERNATIONAL news organisations and Unesco told the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe yesterday that its promotion of press freedom in
Europe could affect other parts of the world, AP reports from Helsinki.
'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. . . . without
interference. The CSCE can make these hopes a reality,' said Mr Leonard
Marks of the Washington-based World Press Freedom Committee. 'Established
democracies now have an unparalleled opportunity to give help and guidance
to the new democracies as they build their new highways of freedom,' he
said. The committee is a co-ordinating group of national and international
news organisations.
Mr Marks urged delegates in a plenary session of the 52-nation security and
human rights conference to adopt a 10-point charter rejecting censorship and
other restrictions on information and the movement of journalists. 'If a
democracy is to be firmly rooted, there must be no law infringing the
freedom of the press,' he said.
The charter, approved in January 1987 at a London conference on censorship
problems, outlines principles designed to permit free, independent news
media to function effectively.
It says journalists should be free to travel over national borders and their
visa applications should 'be handled promptly'.
Mr Frederico Mayor, Unesco's director-general, said in a message read to the
delegates by an aide that freedom of the press is one of the most essential
components of a democratic society.

THE UKRAINIAN parliament yesterday tried to brake Crimea's separatist drive

'all necessary means' to restore constitutional order in Crimea.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Rebirth of a Leipzig capitalist: A businessman amid the
ex-communist ruins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD Kratzer turned a cardboard box of tiny plastic lorries on to the
table, and handled one fondly: 'There's no market for them any more. In
1972, they earned me DM12m a year.'
Today, at an age when many would be long retired, Mr Kratzer has taken up
the daunting challenge of rebuilding the factory he was forced to sell to
the East German government in May 1972.
His company, Uniplast MK, was one of 13,000 firms commandeered by the then
communist regime. He is now one of a handful still fit enough to have his
factory returned to him. The task is to make something of its ruins.
For Richard Kratzer, it was, literally speaking, ruins: an 'accidental' fire
during the night before his return to the factory on the outskirts of
Leipzig in April 1990 destroyed all stocks, the computer system with all
company records, and all invoices, contracts and other important papers. The
plastic moulding machines that were unchanged from when he left them 18
years earlier were standing deep in water. It was a month before he could
resume any production.
'I have tried to rebuild what I can,' he says. Today, those same machines
are pressing out simple plastic bottles, and plastic parts such as bottle
caps as he mounts a range of makeshift operations to raise funds for a
proper new business.
Alongside the half-dozen vacuum-pressing machines is a large room stacked
floor-to-ceiling with basic household items such as plastic waste-paper
baskets, buckets and draining-racks for dishes - another makeshift
operation, this time wholesaling between other east German companies and
hardware shops in the Leipzig area.
The profits from both activities are intended to fund a DM500,000 (Pounds
170,000) investment in what he hopes will be one of two businesses: making
vacuum-moulded plastic doors. At present, this business consists of a
one-room assembly operation, an outdoor concreted area where the future
factory building will be, and a handful of commandeered shipping containers
which have proved useful for rainproof storage. He hopes to start making
doors this month.
Apart from illustrating the grim determination needed of eastern Germany's
former capitalists - and perhaps of those starting from scratch today -
Richard Kratzer provides potent evidence of the fragile foundations of the
industrial rebirth of Germany's eastern states. He has been forced to
scratch around for equipment, funds, partners and markets. None has come
easily.
Funds have come not from the banking sector, but from the remnants of DM1.6m
paid to Mr Kratzer in 1972 by the communists for his factory. After they had
clawed DM1m for various 'expenses' linked with the takeover of the factory,
the communists had left him with DM300,000 in a non-interest-bearing bank
account.
After knocking on doors across western Germany, he has found two potential
partners in Europe. Metaku in Germany have agreed the joint venture making
plastic doors for the east European market. The local construction boom
expected in coming years from regeneration funds is forecast to create
strong demand for house doors, and Metaku's plastic products cost barely
half the price of a wooden door.
Faber Jalousie in Denmark have given him a licence to make their Solarflor
vertical blinds. One virtue of the Faber agreement is that a buy-back
arrangement has saved Mr Kratzer the daunting task of finding his own
market.
'Finding a market in eastern Europe is very difficult at present. There's no
money,' he says: 'But in one or two years, with the rouble and other east
European currencies more settled, then I think we can do good business. Even
now, I'm making a profit - though all the money is going back into
investment in new machinery.'
Plastic doors and window blinds may not have the romantic appeal of
miniature plastic lorries, but after 20 lost years, it is not romance that
Richard Kratzer is looking for. His company was one of some 13,000
commandeered by the communist regime. He is one of a handful fit enough to
have it returned to him
'There's no money. But in one or two years, with the rouble and other east
European currencies more settled, then I think we can do good business.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sainsbury chairman rejects accusations of
high food prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD SAINSBURY, the outgoing chairman of the food retailer, yesterday
countered suggestions that UK food prices were high compared with those
abroad by saying that the group's return on capital employed, at 21.4 per
cent, was similar to that achieved by leading US and French food retailers.
The group's UK food retail operating profit margins rose from 7.7 per cent
to 8 per cent in the year to mid-March, higher than those made by retailers
outside the UK.
High margins in the UK have led to criticisms that British food retailers
are overcharging customers.
Lord Sainsbury said the increased margins were the result of opening larger
stores which offered more higher margin goods than the smaller ones.
He said these stores involved heavy capital spending.
Mr David Sainsbury, deputy chairman and Lord Sainsbury's successor, said
that group capital expenditure had fallen slightly in the latest financial
year to Pounds 766m.
He expected it to rise to about Pounds 800m in the current year.
After last year's rights issue which raised Pounds 489m, gearing had fallen
to 17 per cent. It would rise to about 20 per cent in the current year, Mr
Sainsbury said, but would then stay at about that level.
Annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 628m (Pounds 518.2m) came after
capitalising Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 51.4m) of interest.
Lord Sainsbury said that the Sainsbury and Savacentre chains had achieved
sales of Pounds 7.9bn, a rise of 12.9 per cent, and operating profits of
Pounds 632.2m, up 17.3 per cent.
During the year, 21 new supermarkets were opened, including the group's
first store in Scotland. The sales area of the Sainsbury chain rose by
nearly 10 per cent to 7.6m sq ft. No new Savacentres were opened.
Homebase, the group's DIY chain, also increased profits, by 17.7 per cent to
Pounds 15.5m on sales 14.7 per cent higher at Pounds 257.6m. Lord Sainsbury
said Homebase was one of only two of the leading DIY chains to increase
profits as the recession had made it a tough market.
In the US, Shaw's, the New England supermarket chain, suffered a sharp drop
in profits as recession led to customers trading down. Shaw's operating
profits fell by a third in dollar terms but in sterling were 29 per cent
lower at Pounds 21.4m on sales 7.7 per cent higher at Pounds 1bn.
Haverhill Meat Products, which sold its Palethorpes subsidiary in the
1990-91 year for Pounds 14m, incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a
Pounds 2.7m profit.

FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market passes Pounds 154m rights
issue test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES survived another severe test of nerve, closing in reasonably good
shape, after the recent post-election trickle of small-sized rights issues
began to flow stronger yesterday. BICC, the international cables and heavy
electrical group, emerged to ask the market for Pounds 154m via a straight
rights offer.
However, the rights issue's effect was cushioned somewhat by a handsome set
of preliminary figures from J. Sainsbury, which inherited from Marks and
Spencer the mantle of the UK's most profitable retailing organisation. There
was also another rock solid performance by sterling against the dollar and
the D-Mark. The pound's strength led more market participants to expect a
further reduction in UK interest rates.
There was further good news from an encouraging survey of UK business
confidence, carried out by the Confederation of British Industry. Adding to
an overall cheerful mood in London was renewed overseas buying of UK stocks.
The FT-SE 100-share Index, after one of its most subdued sessions since the
general election, closed 1.9 off at 2,720.5. Brokers remained more than
happy, however, with the level of business moving through the market.
Yesterday saw turnover in equities top the 600m-share mark to reach 604.6m,
compared with Tuesday's 592.1m shares.
Although Tuesday's turnover was below recent levels, the value of customer
business remained well ahead of the Pounds 1bn daily level regarded as the
minimum requirement to provide a profitable market-place for broking firms.
More good news regarding the strength and flexibility of London securities
houses came with news that Kleinwort Benson Securities had carried out a
Pounds 40m-plus deal, placing with its institutional clients a 3.26m block
of shares in Securitas, the Swedish company, on behalf of Group 4 Securitas.
The BICC rights issue, plus another, albeit much smaller, fund-raising
exercise by Transfer Technology, which asked shareholders for Pounds 24m,
coming so soon after the bout of profit-taking and indigestion caused by
recent placings and bought deals, resulted in only momentary problems for
the market.
The Footsie began the session almost five points lower at 2,717.5, but was
quickly on the recovery trail after J. Sainsbury delighted its investors in
reporting a 21 per cent leap in preliminary profits to Pounds 628m,
leapfrogging Marks and Spencer's Pounds 623.5m, reported on Tuesday, and
increasing its market share. Sainsbury shares surged higher on exceptionally
heavy turnover, taking those of fellow food retailers Tesco and Argyll with
them.
Insurers were also very much in demand, with Royal sought ahead of today's
first-quarter numbers, which are expected to show a slight improvement
against the corresponding quarter. Guardian Royal Exchange initially
responded to whispers that one of the big European insurers may be casting a
predatory eye over the UK composite. Ratners shares are expected to come
under pressure this morning, after the group said it would need to make an
exceptional charge of Pounds 98m in its 1991/2 accounts to accommodate
rationalisation costs.

FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS spoke of a dull session in stock index futures, with business once
again carried out in a tight range and turnover poor, writes Joel Kibazo.
Sporadic selling characterised the early activity in the June contract on
the FT-SE, which opened at 2,745. It slipped back to 2,740 by mid-morning,
although the downward direction was briefly halted around midday when a few
independent traders were caught short.
Having filled their positions, June once again drifted lower, and further
falls were recorded with the weak openning of Wall Street.
June traded between the 2,740 to 2,750 area for most of the session. It
closed at 2,740, around 15 points above its estimated fair value premium to
cash of about 8. Turnover was a low 5,121 contracts.
In the traded options market, dealers said 'selling premium' was the main
feature of the day. Turnover at 31,759 was an improvement on Tuesday's poor
figure.
The FT-SE option had a total of 8,043 contracts traded. Asda was the busiest
stock option on 2,958 lots, with the October 40 puts particularly active.
This was followed by British Gas, in which 1,820 contracts were transacted.

FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fail to give
Dow a boost
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITIES largely ignored the day's economic news and traded in a narrow
range yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 6.86 higher at 3,391.98 after
light volume for the New York SE of 176m shares. Advances held a slim lead
over declines by 869 to 808. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.16 up at 416.45
while the Nasdaq composite eased 1.58 to 582.28.
The market failed to respond to two sets of economic data for April. The 0.2
per cent rise in the consumer price index confirmed low inflation prospects,
while the 0.9 per cent increase in retail prices was consistent with
moderate economic growth.
Although it is still possible that the Federal Reserve will cut interest
rates, the unexpectedly strong retail price report reduced expectations of
an imminent easing. There was some confusion following the Fed's aggressive
adding operation in the morning, when it arranged overnight system
repurchase agreements. The strength of the open market intervention was
unexpected, but it was generally seen as a technical move.
Marion Merrell Dow led big board trading, dipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars
32. Late on Tuesday, 16m shares were priced at Dollars 32 a share. A group
of shareholders, including the company's chairman emeritus, will offer 12.8m
shares of the total in the US, with the remainder offered abroad. Delivery
is scheduled for May 19. The company will not receive any proceeds from the
offering.
Eastman Kodak rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 . At the annual meeting
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, predicted improved sales and
earnings in the second half of this year.
Polaroid, Kodak's main US rival, gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 after
Prudential Research increased its second-quarter estimate for the company to
50 cents a share from 37 cents. At Polaroid's annual meeting a day earlier,
a proposal to remove its so-called 'poison pill' takeover defence was
quashed. The defeat, however, was narrower than the previous year when a
similar suggestion was also rejected.
The Limited regained Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/8 in heavy trading after
dropping Dollars 2 5/8 on Tuesday on disappointing first-quarter results.
A number of banks firmed in active afternoon trading, including Citicorp, up
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 19 5/8 , BankAmerica, Dollars 1 1/8 higher at
Dollars 49 5/8 , Chase Manhattan, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 30 1/8 ,
and Chemical, Dollars  7/8 ahead at Dollars 38 3/4 .
Live Entertainment jumped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 2 3/4 on news that its
home-video business had signed a three-year distribution agreement with a
unit of Time Warner.
On the Nasdaq market, high-tech and telecommunications issues led trading.
Microsoft fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 112 3/4 and Intel dipped Dollars
3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO weakened late in the day, with declines seen in bank and utility
shares. Banks fell on rising nervousness that Olympia &amp; York is having
trouble with its debt restructuring process and faces the seizure of several
assets.
The composite index finished 23.7 down at 3,404.2, while falls outscored
rises by 313 to 258. Volume rose to 31m shares.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates ease slightly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S good performance on foreign exchange markets and promising
figures on UK inflation led to a slight easing of rates in the sterling
money markets yesterday.
Traders were impressed that sterling had made gains against the D-Mark in
spite of the dollar's heavy losses the previous day. Tuesday's lower than
expected figure for core inflation also continued to have an effect on the
market.
On Tuesday, the index of prices of manufactured products for domestic
consumption rose in the year to April by 3.8 per cent, leading to
suggestions that this Friday's RPI figure could be smaller than forecast.
One analyst said that a third reason for optimism was the bullish
performance of the French franc yesterday, which momentarily crossed its
central rate against the D-Mark. 'The market feels that there is no reason
why sterling shouldn't do the same,' he said. Sterling has been nudging its
central rate of DM2.95 for nearly a week.
As a result, period rates ended the day a fraction lower. Three-month money,
a key indicator of the market's view on future base rates, ended at 10 1/16
per cent, down  1/16 from Tuesday's close. At the long end, both nine-month
and one-year money ended the day at 10 per cent, also down  1/16 from
Tuesday's close.
The futures markets showed less inclination to believe that rates might be
cut. June short sterling ended the day at 89.95, continuing to show heavy
resistance at 89.99. The volume for September trading was far higher than
June at 11,878 lots, and the contract closed at 90.30, indicating the
market's view that base rates in September will be 9.70 per cent.
In the discount market, trading was taken up easily. In the morning, the
Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m. In early operations the
Bank purchased Pounds 150m of bills for resale to the market on June 1 at 9
15/16 per cent.
In further operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 10m of Band-2 bank bills at
9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 140m for resale to the market on June 1 at 9 15/16
per cent. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 750m.
In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 186m of Band-1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent and Pounds 14m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank
provided late assistance of around Pounds 150m, leaving a shortfall of
around Pounds 100m.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stabilises after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar stabilised against leading currencies on the foreign exchange
markets yesterday after suffering heavy losses in European trading on
Tuesday, writes James Blitz.
Comments about trade policy from the US Treasury Undersecretary had sent the
dollar down to Y130.30 in late American trading the previous day. But in
overnight trading in Asia the dollar managed to resist further falls, and by
the end of yesterday's European trading it had slipped only a little further
to Y130.25. The US unit was helped by a surprising 0.9 per cent rise in
April retail sales announced yesterday, dampening speculation of an imminent
cut in the Federal Reserve's funds rate.
However, dealers said a downward revision in March retail sales, to a 1 per
cent fall from a 0.4 per cent decline, had tempered dollar bullishness. The
bears were also quick to point out that figures for M2 money supply growth
are due out today and could force the Fed's hand on interest rates. The
growth of M2 money supply, a crucial determinant of interest rate policy,
has been extremely low in recent weeks.
D-Mark holders had a mixed day. The German currency was unable to gain from
the dollar weakness and closed fractionally down against the US unit at
DM1.6220. It recouped early losses against other currencies in the European
Monetary System, but was still on the defensive in late trading because of
continued worries of more industrial unrest in support of pay claims.
One beneficiary was sterling. In spite of the adage that a weaker dollar
usually means a weaker pound, the UK currency managed to hold on to its
recent gains against the D-Mark. Sterling ended  1/4 pfennig stronger at
DM2.9425. The D-Mark also lost ground to the Swiss franc. Anticipation that
Switzerland may link itself to the EMS this weekend pushed the Swiss unit up
to DM108.40 per 100 Swiss francs from DM107.82.
The French franc stole the limelight in Europe yesterday morning, continuing
its upward march against the D-Mark and crossing its central rate against
the German currency for the first time in 18 months. It was briefly quoted
at FFr3.3535 per D-Mark, crossing the central rate of FFr3.3539. By the
close the D-Mark had fought back to FFr3.3565, roughly the same finish as
the day before.
Analysts predict that the franc will have difficulty breaching its central
rate more positively because of market fears that the French authorities
will respond to this by cutting interest rates. Mr Michel Sapin, the French
finance minister, tried to offset those fears yesterday by saying that an
interest rate cut at the central rate was not necessary, and it would be
right to encourage the franc to rise further.
In New York the dollar fell to DM1.6092 and Y129.60.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ahead despite strong retail
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices wavered yesterday morning following the release of two
sets of economic data for April, but by mid-session the market had moved
slightly higher.
In late trading, the Treasury's 30-year bond was up  3/16 at 101 3/4 ,
yielding 7.84 per cent. The two-year note was  1/8 higher with a yield of
5.09 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight system
repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 3 3/16 per cent. The
operation, which adds liquidity to the banking system, was more aggressive
than expected and left some players perplexed about the Fed's intentions for
monetary policy.
Shorter-dated maturities firmed as Fed funds fell as low as 3 1/2 per cent
in the afternoon before picking up to 4 per cent in late trading. The Fed's
perceived target for the rate is 3 3/4 per cent.
Expectations of a near-term easing of monetary policy were dampened by the
release of an unexpectedly strong retail sales report for April. Retail
sales climbed 0.9 per cent, well above the 0.4 per cent increase widely
expected. However, the March figure was revised to show a 1 per cent decline
from a previously-reported fall of 0.4 per cent.
There was no real surprise from April's consumer price index, which rose 0.2
per cent.
LONGER-dated UK government bonds gained about  1/4 of a point yesterday in
thin trading as investors focused their attention on the publication this
Friday of the latest retail price index figures.
Market estimates put the April year-on-year headline inflation rate at
anything from 4.2 per cent to 5 per cent, compared with the 4 per cent rise
recorded in March. The difficulty of assessing the phasing out of the
community charge (or poll tax) and the effects of VAT changes accounts for
the wide discrepancy in views.
Whatever the outcome, the latest RPI number may be a poor guide to the
future - and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday again stressed his
view that inflation will continue to fall in the UK.
Yesterday's rally, helped by the firmness of sterling, saw the yield on
10-year gilts fall to within 133 basis points of their German equivalents,
down from about 140 basis points a week ago and about their lows for the
year so far. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 yielded 9.09 per cent by the
end of the day, down from 9.16 per cent the day before. Of longer-dated
issues, the yield on the 9 per cent bonds due 2008 fell from 9.03 per cent
to 8.89 per cent on the day.
On Liffe, the long gilt futures contract rose from 98 to 99 1/32 in moderate
trade.
Friday is expected to bring the latest announcement of further supply to the
gilt market, with the market expecting anything up to Pounds 1bn in the form
of a tap stock.
WHILE other European bond markets moved around it, the cash market for
German government bonds remained little changed.
Most investors continued to await the outcome of wage negotiations involving
IG Metall, the 4m-strong engineering union. Union leaders threatened a
strike ballot next week - thought all the more likely given the outcome of
German public sector workers' strike.
On Liffe bund futures gained nearly 20 basis points, rising to 87.34 in late
trading.
A SHARP appreciation in the yen drove a sharp rally in Japanese government
bonds yesterday. As the yen strengthened to 129.93 against the dollar, a
gain of some Y1.5, bond yields tightened. The yield on the bond No 129
closed at just under 5.5 per cent, down from 5.6 per cent.
The market returned to its levels of about a month ago, before tumbling
share prices and concern about the weakness of the banks drove yields up to
over 5.7 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds advanced strongly against German bonds yesterday
morning on the back of a strong currency. However, profit taking took OATs
back to their opening levels by the end of the day.
Having closed yesterday on a yield some 61 basis points above German bunds,
10-year French government OATs closed to about 57 points before retreating
to yesterday's level. The 8.5 per cent OAT maturing in 2002 closed unchanged
on a yield of 8.57 per cent.
Traders were said to have switched to shorter-dated paper in the hope of a
further interest rate cut on the back of the powerful performance of the
franc. However, most analysts continue to believe that a rate cut to below
German levels remains unlikely.

SKF, the Swedish roller bearings group, is raising up to Ecu145.3m (Dollars

The Swedish group will be the first European company to use liquid yield
option notes (known as LYONs), the zero coupon convertible bonds developed
by Merrill Lynch. LYONs have been used by several companies in the US -
including Disney and Eastman Kodak - since their launch in 1985.
The 10-year bonds will be issued at a price of Ecu426.22, presenting a
discount of 57.378 per cent on the face value of the bond. Each note, with a
principal amount of Ecu1,000, can be converted into 24.9 unrestricted SKF
series B shares.
The issue is being managed by Merrill Lynch, and part of it is expected to
be placed privately in the US.
SKF said it may raise up to Ecu145.3m, which would correspond to 8.5m
unrestricted series B shares if the entire issue is converted.
The money will be used to refinance some of the company's debt. SKF
increased its debt by about SKr2bn when it acquired part of Ovako, a
speciality steel producer which has plants in Finland and Sweden.
Moody's Investors Service has given the SKF LYONs issue a Baa1 senior debt
rating in view of SKF's 'moderately leveraged capital structure and Moody's
expectations that returns and cash flows are likely to remain under pressure
in the intermediate term'.
Moody's points out that while SKF has a strong business position in
bearings, its operating earnings are expected to recover only gradually
because of losses at Ovako and the expected 'sluggish economic upturn' in
the automotive and capital goods markets in the US and Europe.

bond futures markets are most active
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French and German government bond futures markets are the most active
when compared with the level of trading in the underlying cash markets,
according to the Bank for International Settlements. Lower transaction costs
and greater liquidity are its explanation for the substitution of futures
trading for cash market activity in these countries. Turnover in Italian
bond futures accounted for one tenth of cash market trading.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Equitable flotation scheme
approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York State Insurance Department has given the go-ahead for the
demutualisation scheme at The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the large US
life insurer.
This is by far the largest demutualisation - the process whereby a mutual
insurer, controlled by its policyholders, turns itself into a 'conventional'
shareholder-owned company - to take place in the US. Equitable policyholders
have already approved the move.
The next step in the process will be the flotation of Equitable shares on
the stock market, an event scheduled for this summer. Once that is complete,
Axa, the French insurance group, should emerge with a 40-49 per cent stake
in Equitable in return for its Dollars 1bn infusion of capital into the
ailing US group last year.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, one of the middle-ranking US carriers and in
bankruptcy since late 1990, reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 17.4m in
the three months to end-March.
This compared with a Dollars 181.3m loss in the same period a year earlier,
when the Gulf War-related slump in traffic volumes drove the entire industry
heavily into the red.
Continental, however, acknowledged that the profit resulted from a
non-recurring gain of Dollars 52.8m - mainly as a result of the sale of
slots and gates at New York's La Guardia airport.
It did, however, make a much-reduced operating loss of Dollars 3.7m in the
period - compared with the Dollars 138m deficit 12 months earlier. Revenues
in the first quarter rose to Dollars 1.41bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in 1991.

advertising

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME Incorporated, the magazine and book publishing subsidiary of the Time
Warner group, is to acquire Media One, an in-store advertising company.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it is believed to have cost Time
around Dollars 20m.
Media One, which is based in New York, is the second biggest in-store
advertising company in the US. It has a network of display units in more
than 6,000 grocery stores including big chains such as Safeway, Kroger and
Winn-Dixie.
The company's most recognisable product is a two-sided display at
supermarket check-out counters.
Time, which is making its first foray into the advertising business with
this acquisition, said it planned to offer Media One's display products to
prospective advertisers in the company's magazine division.
In a separate development, Time Warner said a consortium of banks led by
Bankers Trust and Chemical bank had given a commitment that a previously
disclosed Dollars 6.2bn new loan facility would be available by the end of
June.
It emerged last month that Time Warner was seeking to reschedule more than
Dollars 7bn of debt, substantial amounts of which would have begun coming
due next year. The centrepiece of the plan was to stretch out repayments of
principal with the new and longer term Dollars 6.2bn loan.
Another part of the plan was the raising of Dollars 850m by way of a recent
private placement and a commitment from Merrill Lynch to provide Dollars
250m of bridging loans, to be replaced later this year by a 10-year bond
issue.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pearlstine to resign from Dow
Jones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN PEARLSTINE, executive editor of The Wall Street Journal and the
man who launched the newspaper's European edition 10 years ago, is resigning
from Dow Jones, the media group that owns The Journal, to start his own
media company.
Mr Pearlstine, 49, joined Dow Jones in 1968 as a reporter in The Journal's
Dallas bureau, and in 1976 became the first managing editor of The Asian
Wall Street Journal, based in Hong Kong.
In 1983, after directing the launch of the paper's European edition, Mr
Pearlstine returned to New York to become a vice-president of The Journal
and managing editor of the US edition.
Last year he was named executive editor and took on responsibilities such as
the launch of SmartMoney, a personal business magazine that is a joint
venture between Dow Jones and the Hearst group.
Mr Pearlstine will leave Dow Jones on June 30, but he will remain a
consultant to SmartMoney and to Dow Jones on book and television projects in
which he has been involved.
Mr Paul Steiger, who became managing editor of The Journal in 1991, will
take responsibility for The Journal's news department.
Mr Peter Kann, chairman of Dow Jones, said he regretted Mr Pearlstine's
decision to resign, but that 'the entrepreneur in any of us' could
understand it.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Texas Inst to enter PC chip
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXAS Instruments, one of the largest US semiconductor manufacturers, will
today announce its entry into the market for personal computer
microprocessor chips with the introduction of its own version of an
Intel-designed device.
Texas Instruments could become a formidable challenger to Intel, which is
already facing increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices and other
chip companies that have produced 'clones' of its leading microprocessor
products.
In advance of Texas Instrument's announcement, Intel yesterday announced
that it would slash the price of its 486SX microprocessors by 50 per cent in
the third quarter of this year.
Intel aims to steer computer makers away from the older 386 generation of
microprocessors toward the 486. In particular, the company aims to take
advantage of the high growth in low-cost personal computers through mass
merchants in the US.
'Now for the about the same price, computer users will be able to buy an
Intel 486SX based system that outperforms any 386-based system on the
market,' including those containing competitors' versions of the 386, said
Mr Paul Otellini, vice-president and general manage of Intel's
microprocessor group.
Intel said its price cuts were not related to Texas Instruments' anticipated
announcement. However, TI's product introduction might provoke a legal
battle between Texas Instruments and Intel, pitting two of the largest US
semiconductor manufacturers against one another.
Intel has filed suit against other chipmakers that have launched 'clones' of
its microprocessors, including Advanced Micro Devices, Chips &amp; Technologies
and Cyrix.
Although Intel and Texas Instruments have a long-standing agreement to cross
license each other's patents, Intel may have other grounds for complaint,
industry analysts predicted.

DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company which last month agreed to buy the
nylon business of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, yesterday said it
may try to sell its electrical connector division.
The business, which employs 3,200 people and has annual revenues of more
than Dollars 400m, is to be hived off as a wholly owned subsidiary so that
shares can be offered to the public.
Du Pont indicated that the decision to sell shares would be made later in
the year. The connector business itself is described by the company as
'moderately profitable'.
In a separate development, Du Pont said it would cut 275 jobs in its
computer division to reduce costs as the latest step in its plan to slash
costs by Dollars 1bn by the end of the year.

STRONG volume gains in its core soups business helped Campbell Soup, the US
food group, to report after-tax profits of Dollars 91.5m in the three months
to April 26.
This represents a 20 per cent improvement on the Dollars 76.4m seen in the
same period a year earlier. Sales were up marginally, by 3 per cent, to
Dollars 1.54bn.
In the Campbell North America division, operating profits rose 9 per cent
overall to Dollars 155.7m, the company said. Soup volumes were up 11 per
cent, helped by an acquisition. Strong volume performances were registered
in V8 juices and in Prego spaghetti sauces. However, frozen food sales fell
sharply, as fierce price competition took its toll.
The biscuit and bakery business reported an 11 per cent advance in operating
profits. Campbell International saw a decline from Dollars 11.7m to Dollars
8.9m.
On the international side, sales from continuing businesses were up by 3 per
cent, excluding the effect of unfavourable exchange rates.

NOVO NORDISK, the Danish pharmaceutical and industrial enzymes group,
increased first quarter net profit by 38 per cent to DKr324m (Dollars 51m)
from DKr234m.
Sales were up by 20 per cent to DKr2.66bn from DKr2.22bn in the first
quarter of last year. Pre-tax profit was 33 per cent higher, rising from
DKr354m to DKr470m. Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent from
DKr7.41m to DKr8.74m.
Novo Nordisk warned that sales and profits would not rise as fast in the
rest of the year. First quarter results were affected by the fact that some
important customers took delivery of shipments earlier than expected. Sales
were also boosted by currency factors.
The company expects to achieve at least 15 per cent growth in pre-tax
profits, in line with its long-term earnings objective. The group's capital
expenditure will increase strongly from DKr1.3bn to about DKr2bn, mainly
with the aim of increasing production capacity internationally.

<TEXT>
AUDI, the up-market subsidiary of Volkswagen, is looking at the possibility
of building a car plant in North America, where its sales are recovering
after several difficult years.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Audi chief executive who takes over as head of VW next
year, said yesterday Audi was evaluating sites in Mexico, the US or Canada
to produce cars from the mid-1990s. VW already has a plant in Mexico which
it has modernised to serve the US market.
Audi's efforts to set up a transatlantic base are in line with Mercedes-Benz
and BMW, its main German rival. Mercedes, owned by the Daimler-Benz group,
will begin small-scale assembly of car kits in Mexico next year. BMW is also
looking at likely US production sites, with a decision expected soon.
Audi, whose net profits jumped 30 per cent last year to DM370m (Dollars
224m) on a turnover rise of 22 per cent to DM14.8bn, has suffered in the US
from allegations that its cars accelerated without warning.
But with new models priced competitively in the US at levels near those of
Japanese cars, Audi's sales in the US rose 41 per cent to 5,100 cars in the
first four months of 1992.
The company said profits should show a further increase this year, with
turnover expected to reach DM16.2bn.

FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y seeks extra funds for
Canadian operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON, ALAN FRIEDMAN and REUTER

   MONTREAL, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York wants lenders to provide extra funds for its Canadian
operations before paying CDollars 17m (USDollars 14.2m) in overdue interest
on a series of publicly-traded bonds secured by Toronto's tallest office
building.
It also emerged yesterday that bankers in a loan syndicate led by JP Morgan
are so infuriated by a recent O&amp;Y decision to divert cash on a collateral
property from bank creditors to bondholders that they have decided to
foreclose on a Dollars 160m O&amp;Y loan made last year.
The foreclosure - to occur next week - would be the first seizure of O&amp;Y
assets since the restructuring of the Canadian property group's debt began.
It places Morgan in an awkward spot since the bank is serving as both a
financial adviser to O&amp;Y and a creditor with an estimated Dollars 50m of
total loan exposure.
Sir Dennis Weathertone, Morgan's chairman, yesterday defended the
foreclosure move and said it would not lead to a collapse of the overall O&amp;Y
debt restructuring. 'We're confident we've done the right thing,' he told
Morgan's annual meeting.
Meanwhile, Canadian banks have yet to respond to O&amp;Y's request to draw down
the remaining USDollars 130m of a USDollars 240m facility provided by four
Canadian banks.
The cash-strapped developer has indicated that without these funds it is
unable to pay interest due on CDollars 325m in bonds secured by the
72-storey First Canadian Place.
It has also failed to retire about CDollars 150m in commercial paper secured
by the Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building adjacent to First Canadian
Place.
Interest on the bonds came due last week, but under the bond covenants, O&amp;Y
has various grace periods which expire tomorrow.
O&amp;Y says it has made a compromise proposal to the bondholders' trustee,
Royal Trust.
O&amp;Y yesterday ended the second day of its fight to stave off a potentially
damaging demand for Dollars 240m in the High Court in London, but no ruling
was made, Reuter reports.
The appeal, which is being heard in private, is over the timing of the
payment owed by the group to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
The hearing will continue today, when a ruling could be made. If O&amp;Y loses
its appeal, the money becomes due immediately.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Value of GPA flotation scaled down to Dollars 800m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA will today announce the flotation of 40m shares in the world's largest
aircraft leasing group, which is likely to value the shares on offer at
around Dollars 800m (Pounds 442m), almost half what was originally
envisaged.
The group's earlier hopes for a Dollars 1.5bn flotation were scaled back
because of lack of demand in Japan and fatigue in the US equities market
inundated with new issues.
The final price will be determined by market conditions at the time of the
sale in mid-June. Mr Gerry Grimstone, director of Schroders, the UK lead
manager, last night said: 'If the marketing goes well the number of shares
for sale will be increased.'
The pathfinder prospectus, published today, shows that the group plans to
issue 28m new shares while selling 12m of the 120m existing shares,
including convertibles, at a price of between Dollars 20 and Dollars 25. In
the case of the UK portion of the sale there will also be a two-for-one
share split, giving a price range of between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12.50.
Some banks distributing the shares in Europe believe they can sell the
shares for more than Dollars 20 and have therefore argued for an eventual
price range of Dollars 18 to Dollars 23. Mr Grimstone said he was confident
that the price would not fall below Dollars 20.
However another adviser said: 'It is possible that the shares could go for
less than Dollars 20. But given the crisis in the airline industry it is
still a tribute to GPA's managerial skills.'
While most of GPA's existing shareholders have agreed not to sell more than
20 per cent of their shares for a year from today - when the year-end
results are announced - some shareholders are still opposed to any such
compulsory lock-up agreement.
As of yesterday some Japanese investors who bought stock at Dollars 32,
including Nippon Life and Kawasaki, had declined to sign a lock-up
agreement.
GPA's advisers, which include Schroders in the UK, Merrill Lynch and Goldman
Sachs in the US, and Nomura in Japan as global co-ordinator, will announce
this morning that 75 per cent of shareholders have agreed to a formal
lock-up agreement and a further 11 per cent to a morally binding commitment.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA chief executive, had warned that anything less than 85
per cent could jeopardise the float. Mr Grimstone said he was still
'delighted' that so many shareholders had agreed to a lock-up agreement.
Many Irish institutions refused to sign a lock-up agreement because they
cannot enter into legally binding agreements, although they have written to
the company saying they do not intend to sell more than 20 per cent of the
shares in the first year.

FT  14 MAY 92 / MPs warn Lloyds Bank on Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR TORY MPs yesterday warned Lloyds Bank that it may be prevented from
integrating Midland fully for at least two years if its conditional bid for
its fellow UK clearer is successful.
The delay could arise because of the need for a private Act of Parliament to
transfer assets and liabilities from one bank to another. 'Lloyds needs to
take account of the fact it might be necessary for them to run Midland as a
subsidiary for two years or more,' according to one MP.
The warning came at a private meeting at London's Horseguards Hotel with six
senior Conservative backbenchers, including two former ministers. The
meeting took place against a background of increased lobbying at Westminster
by both Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, its rival for
Midland.
However, Lloyds advisers do not anticipate that the time needed for a
private Bill to pass through parliament would present a problem because it
would not wish to transfer assets immediately after a takeover.
MPs present at yesterday's meeting with Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman,
and Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, included Mr Peter Brooke, the
former Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Tim Renton, former arts minister
and chief whip. Other issues discussed included the effect of a Lloyds
takeover on competition in the corporate banking sector and the question of
how best to address the problem of the differing regulatory requirements
applying to domestic and cross-border bids.
According to one account, Mr Pitman argued 'forcefully' that Britain was
overbanked and that a 'planned' reduction in capacity was the best approach.
'I found him persuasive on that point,' the MP said.
Ten MPs signed an early day motion backing Hongkong's offer on the grounds
that a takeover by Lloyds would reduce competition.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Norwich Union fined for advert: Regulator decides that
four-page Sun supplement was misleading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWICH UNION, one of the UK's largest life insurers, has been ordered to
pay Pounds 65,000 in fines and costs for misleading advertising in the Sun
newspaper. It is the first such fine levied on a life insurance company.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance industry, said yesterday
that the Pounds 50,000 fine and Pounds 15,000 in costs are the first since
it was granted authority to levy such fines last autumn.
Its disciplinary committee is reviewing eight or nine other cases against
life insurance companies which may result in fines. Most of these involve
failure properly to control sales agents.
Lautro is seen as having taken a tougher stance on life industry sales
practices in recent months, following rising complaints about mis-selling by
sales agents.
The fines against Norwich Union stem from a four-page pullout advertisement
supplement in the Sun on April 25 1991 offering a 15-year savings plan with
initial monthly premiums of Pounds 10 or Pounds 20. Lautro said the style,
layout and presentation of the advertisement made the material
indistinguishable from the Sun's editorial matter so that readers could have
believed they were reading a journalist's independent account of a new
product.
'The revolutionary SunCare savings offer is unveiled today', the
advertisement began.
'Every adult reader of The Sun aged between 18 and 65 has the chance to
build a nest-egg.'
'And the offer could be worth Pounds 130 to you thanks to our TWO great
bonuses.'
The advertisement was placed by one of Norwich Union's so-called tied
agents. These do not work for the company directly but sell its products
exclusively and earn commissions for each policy sold. Lautro has said that
tied agents account for a disproportionate number of complaints against life
insurers.
The tied agent, SunCare, was a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, a nationwide
chain of financial services brokers, and was formed for the sole purpose of
the Sun promotion campaign. SunCare no longer exists. Norwich Union said it
would continue offering its products through Sedgwick subsidiaries despite
the incident.
Norwich Union said 6,000 people responded to the advertisement, roughly
4,500 taking up the offer. At Lautro's request, it wrote to all clients
pointing out that the product did not have the Sun's endorsement, an action
which led to requests for refunds from only two policyholders. Norwich Union
took steps to inform potential investors of many of the misleading aspects
of the advertisement before ordered to do so by Lautro.
However, regulators felt the advertisement's format was so obviously
misleading that a substantial fine was justified.
Lautro said the advertisement also misled investors by failing to tell them
their premium payments would have to rise by 20 per cent a year in each of
the first five years of the plan.
The advertisement also wrongly implied that illustrations of potential
investment returns were calculated on a conservative basis and thus actual
returns were likely to be higher.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Heseltine reaffirms mergers policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine signalled yesterday that his move to the Department of
Trade and Industry would not presage an early change in the government's
competition-based approach to monopolies and mergers.
The president of the board of trade made no direct reference to the present
takeover battle for Midland between Lloyds bank and Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation.
But his reaffirmation of the so-called 'Tebbit doctrine' is likely to be
welcomed by Mr William Purves, the Hongkong chairman, who urged the
government not to move the 'goalposts' of its competition policy.
It will also win approval in the City where there has been disquiet over
suggestions that he might want to take broader judgments of 'national
interest' into account when assessing takeovers.
Mr Heseltine restated, in a parliamentary answer, the doctrine which
establishes the impact on competition as the main criterion for decisions on
whether proposed mergers should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
In his reply, Mr Heseltine referred to both the statement on merger policy
set out in 1988 DTI white paper and the 1973 Fair Trading Act.
He quoted the white paper as saying: 'The government's policy is that the
main, though not exclusive, consideration in determining whether mergers
should be referred to the MMC should be their potential effect on
competition.' Mr Heseltine then added: 'This remains the position.'
Replying to a question from Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman,
Mr Heseltine said that the Fair Trading Act of 1973 required the MMC to take
into account 'all matters which appear to them in the particular
circumstances to be relevant in determining whether a merger or proposed
merger operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest'.
This meant that competition was an important consideration, though not the
only one, in the monopolies commission's deliberations.
Mr Heseltine's comments suggest that for the moment he has decided against
adopting publicly wider criteria - including calculations of the national
interest - for government policies on mergers.
But the careful phrasing also suggests that he has left open the possibility
of individual referrals on grounds other than competition.
Mr Purves said yesterday he would be 'very disappointed' if Hongkong's bid
for Midland, which is being examined at European Community-level, was
referred to UK competition authorities.
'I would think the goalposts had been moved,' he said, emerging from a
meeting with some 40 Conservative backbenchers. He said it would not be good
for investment in Britain if current government policy was changed in any
way.

FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Package tours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The notion that last year's collapse of International Leisure Group would
stabilise the package holiday market is looking suspect. Prices of early
season holidays are already being heavily discounted. Perhaps more
revealing, yesterday's figures from the Civil Aviation Authority for the
1991 season showed that tour operators in general remained stubbornly
over-optimistic about capacity. Their estimates for this year's volume look
the more difficult to attain, not least because pre-election doubts may have
caused buyers to delay holiday bookings along with new cars and houses.
It also looks as if consumers are less prepared to pay in advance and are
booking later, perhaps in the hope that nervous operators will concede price
reductions. That will erode the seasonal cash benefit traditionally enjoyed
by the tour companies. Admittedly, this year's peak season bookings are
reported as healthy at this stage. All the same, the startling rise of
Airtours' shares, which outperformed the market by more than 300 per cent
last year, is unlikely to be repeated in a hurry. Investors will doubtless
be alert for further signs that the package holiday business is reverting to
type.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar's weakness must be exasperating those who were predicting a
steady recovery in 1992. Against the D-Mark, however, its behaviour is
easily explained by interest rate differentials. With Germany apparently
condemned to tight money for the foreseeable future, it has become expensive
to go short of the D-Mark - all the more so since there is no sign of a US
recovery strong enough to prompt a rise in US interest rates. April may have
seen a 0.9 per cent jump in US retail sales, but this has to be set against
a downward revised fall of 1 per cent in March. The 3.9 per cent annual rise
in core US inflation (retail prices excluding movements in food and energy)
even suggests room for the Federal Reserve to ease policy again.
Harder to explain is what is happening to the yen, which has been the main
beneficiary of the dollar's fall this week. The interest rate differential
with the dollar is small, but Japanese insurance companies have turned heavy
sellers of the dollar. With the Nikkei off its lows, it is unlikely that
this has to do with the need to repatriate funds to bail out the banks.
More likely, the institutions are responding to the renewed attack from the
US Treasury on Japan's trade surplus. Accompanied as its remarks are by
allegations of Chinese and Taiwanese currency manipulation for export gains,
it looks as though the US means business. The natural response by Japan
would be to talk the yen higher. Since higher short-term interest rates are
hardly appropriate for the present stage of the cycle, it is difficult to
see how this could produce a sustained effect on the currency - unless it is
accompanied by fiscal pump-priming which would boost the economy and push
bond yields up to more attractive levels.

FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BICC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least BICC appears to have lined up a couple of acquisitions and can
hardly be accused of raising expectations of imminent recovery. That said,
the enthusiastic response to yesterday's Pounds 154m rights issue brings to
mind the market's prematurely positive reaction to all those cash calls in
the contracting sector exactly a year ago. The rest is history.
Investors are doubtless relieved by the impact on the balance sheet,
although a 9 per cent yield on the new money emphasises the cost of cutting
gearing in this way. That, of course, is not how the company sees it. BICC
continues to insist on its convertible capital bonds being treated as
equity, brushing aside those who were gloomily predicting year-end gearing
including the off-balance sheet debt of close to 100 per cent. On the other
hand, if there is not an unspoken fear that the Accounting Standards Board
will soon put a different gloss on the in-house calculations, one is
entitled to ask why the company really thinks the cash call was necessary in
the first place.
The case against the shares, though, rests more on doubts about whether the
dividend can be raised fast enough hereafter to justify the 7.6 per cent
yield on yesterday's ex-rights price. It is not just that dividend cover of
two times still looks to be some way off. The question is whether the
company can afford to be generous given the continuing cash demands from its
property business. At 356p, moreover, the shares are already discounting a
good part of the upturn.

FT  14 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The grocer triumphant
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Sainsbury's farewell message to the press yesterday was grandiose but
impressive. When he took over as chairman in 1969, Sainsbury's profits were
one ninth those of Marks and Spencer. They are now bigger. The 17 per cent
rise in last year's earnings per share is in astonishing contrast to the
corporate sector in general and to Sainsbury's suppliers in particular.
Although the group's UK supermarkets enjoyed underlying volume growth of 1
per cent at best, margins were up and growth was higher in the second half
than in the first. If this is Sainsbury in a recession, what can go wrong
hereafter?
One answer is by now familiar. As the company continues to pour capital into
new stores - some Pounds 800m this year and next - it has to keep raising
margins if it is to maintain its return on capital. It is argued that bigger
new stores deliver higher margins automatically by virtue of their cost
structure, even without higher sales. But that assumes that Sainsbury and
its rivals can retain these savings indefinitely on behalf of shareholders,
rather than being obliged by competitive pressure to pass them on to the
customer.
But whatever the operational risk, at least the financial risk seems to be
abating. Gearing by the end of this year will be around 20 per cent. It may
not rise materially thereafter. Two years ago, Sainsbury's free cash flow
covered 56 per cent of its capital expenditure. The figure is now 75 per
cent, and should reach 100 per cent within the next two or three years. At
yesterday's 459p, the shares are on 18 times historic earnings, compared
with Marks and Spencer's 22 times. Though the operational risk is real
enough, it is perhaps in the price.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Lamont rejects steep rise in European Commission budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT flatly rejected yesterday the European Commission's plans
for a steep rise in the Brussels budget. He also dismissed any suggestion
that the government would accept any reduction in Britain's rebate.
In his first set-piece speech to the House of Commons since the general
election, the chancellor warned his cabinet colleagues to rein back their
ambitions for higher public spending too.
Mr Lamont said control of the EC budget was essential to his overall plans
to hold down public spending and borrowing. He dismissed as an 'ambitious
shopping list' the plan by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to raise
progressively the ceiling on the EC's resources.
His implied threat of a veto on any changes which challenged Britain's
rebate from Brussels followed a German call earlier this week for the refund
to be considered alongside the so-called 'Delors II' package on EC
financing. The Commission is preparing its own proposals on the rebate.
Officials said that Mr Delors' financing plan could add Pounds 1bn a year to
Britain's contribution to Brussels, which will reach Pounds 2.4bn in 1992
even after the rebate is paid.
Mr Lamont's remarks came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought
to minimise the size of an expected revolt by Conservative MPs against
legislation to implement the Maastricht treaty. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the
former prime minister, plans to launch today a scathing attack on the
Commission's ambitions. Mr Hurd told a crowded meeting of Conservative MPs
that the government had halted the drive to federalism.
A Labour decision yesterday not to vote against the Maastricht treaty
assures its passage in the House of Commons, but up to 20 of the
government's own supporters plan to oppose it.
Reviewing the domestic outlook, the chancellor expressed confidence that the
promised economic recovery would become 'firmly established' during 1992.
But with ministers braced for official figures today showing unemployment
still on an upward trend, he was careful not to put a more precise timetable
on his forecast.
Mr Lamont stuck to his Budget forecast of a Pounds 28bn public borrowing
target in the current financial year but warned cabinet colleagues there
could be no overshoot in spending targets for the next three years.

official is probably over. But she is only 49, is a well-known public
figure, and has run a big organisation. Her abrupt departure from the GPMU
suggests she doesn't like playing second fiddle.
Unlike most of her colleagues she is respected in some Conservative party
circles and counts people like Lady Howe among her friends. No doubt she
could find a home in an outlying quango. Perhaps Gillian Shephard, the new
employment secretary, might find her a job. It would make wonderful PR for

It is good to see that the worst slump in living memory has not affected the
property industry's sense of humour. Guest of honour at the British Property
Federation's annual bash was none other than the hapless Sir John Quinton,
chairman of Barclays, which has been pilloried as the largest UK lender to
the property industry.
To bring the point home, a speech of thanks was made by the federation's
outgoing president Trevor Osborne, chairman of Speyhawk, which has just lost
Barclays a small fortune. 'Sir John,' quipped Osborne, 'we owe you more than
we can ever repay.'
Osborne was not alone in his gratitude to Sir John, whose speech contained
much that the property industry wanted to hear. 'Banks would far rather work
with, not against, their customers, and the incumbent management who know
the assets best,' he said.
It would all have been quite reassuring for the industry had it not been for
the composition of the guest-list. The largest contingent, occupying no
fewer than five tables, was from Madagans, a well-known firm of bailiffs.

The arrival of Anthony Simonds-Gooding as the new chairman and chief
executive of the Design and Art Directors' Association, better known as
D&amp;AD, has caused a bit of a stir. Not only is it a bit of a comedown for the
54-year-old Simonds-Gooding, once considered a contender for the top job at
Guinness, but it also comes after a long bout of grief for the UK's leading
design and advertising award-making organisation.
D&amp;AD has effectively been without a chief executive since the start of 1992.
Some would argue that lack of effective administration started much earlier
than that; in 1984 it was discovered that D&amp;AD had not filed accounts for
nine years.
Edward Booth-Clibborn, who had been executive chairman of D&amp;AD for yonks,
was suspended in January and up until this week lawyers were wrangling over
the wording of the statement concerning his final departure.
D&amp;AD is a registered charity. But the board discovered all kinds of
activities being conducted under its aegis which seemed to have little to do
with the running of an annual awards dinner, D&amp;AD's main raison d'etre. At
the very least, financial control seems to have gone haywire. Yesterday it
was announced that Booth-Clibborn was leaving.
In hiring Simonds-Gooding, a former Whitbread and Saatchi marketing whiz and
ex-boss of British Satellite Broadcasting, the D&amp;AD seems to be taking a
sledgehammer to the problem. But better late than never.

Will Premier Major's classless society accomplish something plain reason has
failed to do for 70 years: get Britain's top mandarins to change the name of
their union, the Association of First Division Civil Servants?
What the name meant was clear when the outfit was set up in 1919 because the
civil service was then organised into three divisions. But that structure
was abolished three years later, taking with it the reason for the title.
Prospects of a re-naming initially looked bright at the association's
conference in London yesterday. Proposing a change, the social security
department's Justin Wickens said the title's elitist ring deterred potential
recruits.
But in the end the reform was blocked, despite the absence of honorary
member Sir Humphrey Appleby, of Yes Minister] Tax inspector Will Richardson
substituted, arguing that the title is a well recognised brand, and adding:
'We may look like a snooty, elitist union, but at least people know which
snooty elitist union we are.'
The killing blow had come earlier, though, when Wickens told members that
with the demise of the first division of the football league, for them too
'it was time for a change'.
That very same phrase had been used by the Labour Party, said a speaker from
the floor - and look where it got them.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Multimedia beats a path to Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How would you like to play golf on the Augusta National course, with Jack
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as your partners? They will be like old friends,
exchanging comments with you on the tilt of the green. You will be able to
do this without stirring from your arm chair and with no more exertion than
flicking a few switches on a remote device.
Or choose a film from a catalogue of thousands and arrange to view it after
dinner. Order a pizza if you don't want to cook tonight.
Welcome to the world of 'interactive multimedia' - a confluence of computer,
communications and consumer electronics technologies that promises to
transform your television set into a multi-functional entertainment,
information and communications device.
This is the vision that is spurring executives from US computer companies to
beat a path to Hollywood. International Business Machines and Time Warner
are said to be talking about a joint venture. John Sculley, chairman and
chief executive of Apple Computer, is exploring synergies with the movie
industry.
The huge potential of interactive TV is also the driving force behind AT&amp;T's
plans to enter the digital satellite broadcasting equipment market and forge
alliances with cable television companies.
There are also start-up companies with big ambitions. TV Answer is
developing a system that would allow customers to pay bills and order
products. USA Video is testing a system that can send a film from a 'video
library' to a customer's TV over phone lines.
Interactive multimedia is not a new idea. Hardware and software companies
have been talking about it for years but failed to identify a mass market.
Industry debate has focused upon technical standards and whether the
personal computer or the television should be the 'platform' for multimedia.
Breathing fresh air into these long-winded arguments is a growing consensus
that a relatively simple application of multimedia technology may be the key
to creating mass-market appeal.
'Movies on demand', a service providing consumers with the opportunity to
view at any time a film of their choice from a catalogue of thousands, is
now seen as the 'Trojan Horse' that will bring multimedia into the home.
By providing the convenience of any-time viewing and a far broader selection
than the local video store, cable and broadcast television services aim to
steal a large portion of the Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8bn) annual US video
rental and sales market.
The critical technology for 'movies on demand' is digital signal processing
 -the technology at the core of other multimedia applications. To pipe
thousands of movies through a cable television network, or broadcast them
via satellites to regional cable operators, the signals must be compressed,
without loss of quality. At the receiving end the signal must be decoded to
provide a high-quality image.
Once digital signal processors are in place, other applications become
possible. These might include an electronic library, video games or
educational programmes. Fibre optic cables that can carry a bigger load of
signals than conventional copper cables may also play a part in bringing
interactive multimedia to a mass audience. Switching systems, much like
those used to direct traffic on telephone networks, will also be needed.
Satellite broadcasting may also play a role, although in the US, where 60m
homes are connected to cable television systems, direct broadcast is not
expected to be the primary method of delivering interactive TV signals to
the home.
There are potential stumbling blocks to the development of interactive
multimedia services. Although most of the technology challenges have been
met, the cost of a signal processing device that would sit on top of the TV
set is prohibitive - over Dollars 1,000.
In the US, regulatory issues might also prevent telephone or cable TV
companies from expanding into each others territory.
Yet the momentum building behind interactive multimedia seems unstoppable.
The advent of digital high-definition television, in the mid-1990s, with
sharper pictures and clearer sound, can only accelerate the trend.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Shifting to high gear - Computer-aided design is
finding new roles in countless productions across the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadcam may no longer be in its infancy, but after the heady growth rates of
the early 1980s the market for computer-aided design and manufacturing
equipment and software still looks a long way short of reaching maturity.
While other sectors of manufacturing technology languish in recession, the
world Cadcam market grew more than 10 per cent last year to Dollars 16bn,
according to Dataquest, and will reach nearly Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn) in
1995 - a compound annual growth rate of 12 per cent since 1990.
The importance of Cadcam, and in particular 3D solid modelling, to
concurrent engineering - the team approach to cutting product development
times and improving quality - makes it virtually a necessity in mechanical
engineering.
But other applications of Cadcam are now expanding faster, even though huge
untapped opportunities remain in the dominant mechanical sector. Meanwhile,
the industry is adjusting to much higher predicted growth rates for software
than for the hardware that it runs on, and forming partnerships with
industrial users to understand their needs better.
All these trends are illustrated in current strategy at Matra Datavision,
the biggest European-owned Cadcam supplier. And Michel Neuve Eglise,
chairman and chief executive, is hoping for annual growth of 20-25 per cent
over the next few years at the Paris-based subsidiary of Matra.
Achieving that, and pushing Matra Datavision up the US-dominated league
table of big players in the industry, will depend on recent initiatives at
the 13-year-old company, whose success has been built on its Euclid-IS
mechanical Cadcam software which produced the Renault Espace (right).
As Cadcam hardware becomes a commodity item, companies such as Matra are
trying to boost the share of revenues represented by software. The in-phrase
at Matra, therefore, is what Victor Waknine, president and chief operating
officer, calls the 'software factory' approach to help penetrate new markets
and develop existing ones.
A key element is a new generation of Case (computer-aided software
engineering) tools designed to build the company's own factory of
applications software, help Euclid users change their applications, and
provide new application solutions for independent software houses. The
product, for complex assembly design, will be available next year.
A second initiative is a new entry-level solid-modelling system,
Prelude/Solids, designed to attract companies currently using 2D or
3D-wireframe-based systems - surface modelling which is like stretching
clingfilm across a wireframe but does not completely define an object in 3D
as occurs with solid modelling. The ability, for example, to compute masses
and moments of inertia makes solid modelling a powerful tool for reducing
product development times.
Matra is launching Prelude in the US - a good testing ground, says Waknine,
for a mass-market product. It is designed to attack low-cost software such
as AutoCAD, the Autodesk flagship product.
But Matra also has its eye on the emerging market for 'conceptual
engineering,' where the very earliest design sketches can be captured on
computer, thus saving more time in the product development process by
eliminating the 'back-of-an envelope' stage. Prelude's compatibility with
Euclid-IS is an important element here, Waknine believes.
Prelude is being launched in the US to correct Matra Datavision's weakness
in a market where it sees considerable growth for 3D solid modelling.
The US and Asia are the main areas of planned expansion for the company,
although other markets have potential. The UK looks encouraging, with
turnover up 40 per cent last year to Pounds 1.4m, and expected to rise to
Pounds 2.4m in 1992. Currently 80 per cent of Matra's installed base is in
Europe, 15 per cent in North America and 5 per cent in Asia, but Waknine
hopes to increase Asian and North American shares to 20 per cent each by
1995.
According to Matra, European manufacturers have realised the benefits of 3D
solid modelling earlier than their counterparts in the US and Japan, because
of the need for increased productivity in manufacturing, and education that
has made possible a better grasp of the mathematical principles.
But US and Japanese demand has been strong in the past two years, says
Waknine, and solid modelling is becoming mandatory in Japan. Accordingly,
Matra is rapidly expanding its US distribution network, and last year it
signed an agreement for NEC to distribute Euclid-IS in Japan.
Elsewhere in Asia, the company is negotiating two joint ventures, one in
China and another with a big industrial concern outside China. It has begun
co-operating with the Chinese space agency, and sees enormous potential even
if it can convert only a small percentage of 20,000 engineers to Euclid.
Other regions are likely to require more patience, says Waknine. In the
former Soviet Union, he says, large companies have realised the potential of
solid modelling - helped by the unofficial import of pirated western
software - but are restricted by financial difficulties.
Matra is exploring barter deals to enable it to sell to the former Soviet
Union, and earlier this year took an indirect stake in Mazintergixi, a joint
venture distribution company.
According to Dataquest figures, Matra is the world's eighth largest supplier
of software in the mechanical Cadcam market for workstations, the most
important hardware 'platform,' but Neuve Eglise has ambitions to push the
company into the top five.
That could be tough, according to Petra Gartzen, Dataquest analyst. 'Matra
have a very good product and are doing the right things, but the mechanical
Cadcam market is not showing the same growth rates as other sectors because
of conditions in manufacturing. That makes it very difficult for any company
to increase its market share.'
However, Matra's greater emphasis on software for the mechanical market,
which is forecast to grow twice as fast as the hardware, should help.
Matra is also expanding into the faster-growing architectural, engineering
and construction (AEC) sector of Cadcam through a system developed by
Framatome, the French power plant builder. Unlike many AEC systems, says
Gartzen, the Framatome system is targeted towards plant design, where there
are big opportunities in the European Community because of environmental
legislation.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Enterprise seeks out
holes in space - Gary Mead reports on new ways to monitor promotional
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To watch 7 per cent of one's cash disappearing into a black hole each year
might be thought madness.
Yet when it comes to advertising in the printed media, 7 per cent of booked
advertisements do not appear at all, appear in the wrong format, at the
wrong time, or in the wrong position. Given that UK expenditure on
advertising in newspapers and other publications is some Pounds 4bn
annually, some Pounds 280m of UK advertising might be vanishing,
uncontrolled and unnoticed, into a void.
Advertisers and their agencies are under pressure to cut costs. Checking
that print advertisements appear when and in a form which was paid for would
seem an obvious step to take. Many do not.
Advouch has been in business for eight years. It handles the print
advertisement verification for about 60 per cent of the leading British
advertising agencies, checking advertising worth Pounds 600m annually. Tony
Law, managing director, believes that of the remaining 40 per cent of
agencies, 'half do it themselves, the other half don't do it at all'.
Law has identified that 7 per cent of his clients' advertisements are
misplaced or forgotten altogether and believes this is probably an
industry-wide phenomenon. Advouch's business is to make sure that the gap is
plugged and that advertisers and agencies are getting what they paid for.
The advertisements which fail to appear or appear incorrectly do so for a
variety of reasons. According to Law, the problem is seldom incompetence or
fiddling. Instead, printers suddenly find themselves with insufficient space
and fail to run the advert, without alerting the advertiser or agency. In
Law's experience, regional newspapers have the poorest record.
Between December 1991 and April 1992, he found that 10 per cent of his
clients' regionally-placed ads were failing to appear or appeared
incorrectly, against 5.3 per cent in national newspapers, 5.4 per cent in
consumer magazines and 4.2 per cent in trade magazines.
Law calls his business the 'spit and sawdust' end of the advertising world,
although it is heavily dependent on computer technology. The system holds
details on 12,153 publications and a multitude of cross-references between
agencies and publications. Each month the 22 staff deal with between 60,000
and 80,000 individual advertisement bookings, relating to 6,236 advertisers
and 15,141 products.
But does it really matter if advertisements do not appear on time, or at
all? For large consumer goods manufacturers it is a debatable point but it
can be crucial for recruitment advertising. Advouch's biggest client,
Barkers LBW, an advertising agency which specialises in recruitment
advertising, uses the service to check more than 20,000 advertisements a
year; if a job advertisement fails to appear, Barkers - and its clients -
know immediately; no-one applies.
Advouch sends each of its clients a weekly activity report with a bundle of
vouchers stapled to publications in which their advertisements have
appeared. Without a voucher from Advouch stating that the booked advert has
appeared correctly, the advertising agency can refuse payment to the
publication. The whole process is about establishing trusted verifications,
thus reducing cash-flow problems for all concerned.
Computer technology has enabled Advouch to find a niche in an increasingly
complex market; it is also enabling marketing directors to find their own
niches among consumers who blithely pass by the 80,000 outdoor poster sites
in Britain. NOP Posters, part of the MAI information services group, has
just launched a new service with its subsidiary, Pinpoint Analysis.
Called Posterpin, the service costs between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 40,000
a year. For that, subscribers get a desk-top processor from which to obtain
a wide range of information on poster sites including details of consumer
expenditure, wealth indices and consumer demographics.
They can also scan maps of a specified area, pinpointing poster sites, who
owns them, how many panels they have and their availability.
Users of the system will be able to call on a database to give the numbers
of - for example - premium canned lager drinkers living in the area.
According to Pinpoint the new service 'offers not just a mapping procedure
but also useful marketing information'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Laying it on the line for future
auditing standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOLD red line slices across the black and white cover of the exposure
drafts issued earlier this week by the Auditing Practices Board. To certain
senior accountants contemplating the birth pangs of the new standard-setting
regime, it represents more than a simple design feature.
It was at an 'awayday' conference for members of the Auditing Practices
Committee at the Gatwick Hilton three years ago that Mr Graham Stacy, a
technical partner with Price Waterhouse (and now representing the firm for
its work as auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International), purposefully picked up a red felt-tipped pen.
With it he drew a horizontal line across a blank flipchart. Above it he a
placed a wiggly line, and on top of that a second straight line running
along the peaks. The lowest line represented existing auditing standards;
the middle one, the quality of auditing actually achieved by the large
accountancy firms; and the top one, the firms' own ideal standards.
'Some members of the committee were arguing that we should set auditing
standards very high to give firms something to aim for,' he recalls. 'I said
the big firms always have to keep their own standards far higher, so even
when they fall short of perfection, they are still clear of the minimum.
Otherwise they won't be able to survive.'
'Stacy's red line' - which has become part of the folklore at Price
Waterhouse - has jumped sharply up the page following the publication of the
first salvo of proposed documents from the Auditing Practices Board (APB) on
Tuesday.
It also stands as a symbolic high-water mark below which the old Auditing
Practices Committee (APC) has drowned. The APC may have seemed a significant
step forward when it was created to draw up coherent guidelines in the late
1970s, but a decade later it was looking very stale.
That was the main conclusion of discussions held by the APC at the same
Gatwick venue, and in a widely-leaked letter penned afterwards by Mr David
Tweedie, the final chairman of the APC and now chairman of the Accounting
Standards Board, and Mr Ian Brindle, his predecessor and now senior partner
at Price Waterhouse.
The APC was underfunded, unwieldy and undemocratic. It was far too secretive
in its operations. And its decision-making was continually being slowed down
by its owners, the six members of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy
Bodies: the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in
Scotland and in Ireland, the Chartered Institutes of Management Accountants
and of Public Finance and Accountancy, and the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants.
The new, improved APB, which began operations early last year, looks in much
better shape to address the criticisms facing auditors in the 1990s, even if
it is still owned by CCAB. There are 18 voting members - of which half are
not practising accountants - and four observers. A series of working groups
is beginning to tackle an ambitious series of future auditing standards.
'Exposing' the drafts for public comment and focusing on users of accounts
as the APB's customer is a prudent if obvious step.
The process of producing in plain English just two types of statement -
standards (which are mandatory) and practice notes (which are best practice
on emerging issues) - is a welcome relief from the range of confusing edicts
with varying degrees of authority that were loftily pronounced in the past.
On the downside, criticism of the APB's tardiness in getting to work over
the last year are somewhat petty. A more significant concern - how
independent the body can be - can only be judged over time. But its refusal
to tow the line of the accountancy firms - which argued against the expanded
audit report it has now put forward - bodes well.
In place of a meaningless, pro forma paragraph that has been almost
universally ignored, the auditors' report in companies' accounts will from
next year become a dense and detailed page of text, which users of financial
information will do well to turn to very early in their perusal.
Some will see the proposals as defensive. Much of the text will still have a
standard - albeit lengthier - format. A good chunk (if not provided
elsewhere in the accounts) will spell out that it is the directors and not
the auditors who are responsible for the accounts being true and fair.
The number of qualified audit reports (present in just 6 per cent of UK
companies last year) is likely to fall, because auditors will no longer be
required to qualify companies facing 'material' or 'fundamental'
uncertainties in the following 12 months, provided they are satisfied that
disclosure of these elements in the accounts is adequate.
That will at least ensure any remaining qualifications are unequivocal,
rather than in terms of unqualified approval 'subject to' certain items, as
the current guidelines allow.
At least on paper, auditors are being given greater powers to actively use
their skills to detect these uncertainties, and cast their judgment forward
as well as back across the previous year to which the financial statements
relate. While the qualification will be lost, the proposed audit report will
have a section flagging the uncertainties in compensation. But that raises
two potential difficulties.
First, the definition of 'fundamental' is likely to generate intense debate.
The draft guidelines cite examples such as cash flow problems, inadequate
borrowing facilities, major litigation and large debts falling due.
Assessment of their significance may well prove highly contentious.
Second, it will be difficult to tell how far companies will accept
disclosure of these fundamental items in the new-style auditors' report.
Theoretically, each would currently result in a qualified audit report. In
reality, directors fight very hard to resist a qualification, and may have
been able to conceal some important information from their shareholders up
till now as a result.
The hope is that some of these uncertainties that might previously have just
escaped attracting a qualification will now be clearly flagged. But
companies may fight equally hard to prevent disclosure, arguing, for
example, that it would jeopardise their commercial position.
A separate but vital point is the relationship between the APB and the
Accounting Standards Board. The proposed auditing guidelines do nothing to
clarify what constitutes 'true and fair' in accounts. Until new ASB
standards have dealt with what Mr David Tweedie calls 'accounting fiddles',
there is little the auditors can do. They can only be as effective as
accounting standards allow, while finance directors hide behind these
current standards.
That point is reflected in the preface to the APB's 'going concern' draft,
which calls on the ASB to develop a standard on the treatment of
uncertainties. There is little sign yet that the ASB has taken the issue
seriously in its own work programme.
A final problem is how the new auditing standards will be policed. Mr Bill
Morrison, chairman of the APB, talks about a 'twin barrel' approach. The
Financial Reporting Review Panel is scrutinising companies, while the
self-regulatory Joint Monitoring Unit of the accountancy bodies is watching
the auditors, now armed with improved auditing guidelines.
Unfortunately, like the deliberations between auditors and their clients, a
great deal of the regulatory process remains behind closed doors. Whether
that is inevitable or even desirable, it does little to remove the suspicion
of accountants and auditors by the outside world.
Users of accounts must hope that Stacy's red line does not open up new gaps
below as it eagerly rises up the page of future APB documents.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR took a further small step towards open government yesterday by
announcing who had been appointed to the Downing Street policy unit.
The five new members of the unit were appointed on the advice of the unit's
head, Mrs Sarah Hogg. She took over within days of Mr Major becoming prime
minister but inherited some colleagues from Mrs Thatcher's policy unit.
Joining the Downing Street team are: Mr David Poole, on secondment from
James Capel where he is a director; Ms Lucy Neville-Rolfe, a civil servant
from the ministry of agriculture; Ms Katharine Ramsay, formerly a
ministerial special adviser; Mr Damian Green, formerly industrial editor of
the Channel Four Business Daily programme and unsuccessful Tory candidate in
Brent East last month; and Ms Jill Rutter, a Treasury civil servant.
Mr Nick True, the unit's deputy head, and Mr Alan Rosling, continue in their
posts.
While the announcement was the first formal press notice of such
appointments, membership of the policy unit has scarcely been a matter of
state secrecy in the past.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government beat Labour charge by 52
majority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government last night secured a majority of 52 (335-283) to defeat a
Labour charge that it had failed to adopt economic policies to promote
industrial and commercial investment, and improve education and training.
Winding up the six-day debate on the Queen's Speech, Mr Tony Newton, leader
of the House, promised full consultation about procedural changes in 'the
most radical shake-up to our working practices for many decades'.
The government's majority soared to 314 when, with Labour MPs abstaining, a
Liberal Democrat attempt to condemn the omission from the Queen's Speech of
a commitment to take Sterling into the narrow band of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism was defeated by 332 votes to 18.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs rebuffed on Maxwell appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners yesterday criticised the
rejection by a junior minister of their suggestion that the government
should seek ways of keeping pension funds open until investigations into the
state of the Maxwell funds were complete.
Mr Richard Page, Tory MP for Hertfordshire South-West, and Mr Frank Field,
Labour chairman of the social security committee in the last parliament,
will meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, on Tuesday to press
for a 'lifebelt' for the pension funds.
The talks follow a cross-party meeting on Tuesday, attended by more than 60
MPs, which called for an immediate Commons statement, and asked the
government to consider how the funds might be kept open as 'a humanitarian
as well as a practical gesture'.
But Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister, said it would be
premature for the government to commit itself to any form of action, and
questioned the usefulness of any move to 'drip-feed' the funds.
The MPs believe that keeping the pension funds alive is critically important
in increasing the prospects that the assets can be tracked down and
retrieved by the trustees.
The prime minister told pensioners of Maxwell-owned companies that
compensation could be paid if there had been 'maladministration, either by
the Department of Trade and Industry or Imro'.
Sir Robert McCrindle, for Mr Major, said that if a complaint was made to the
parliamentary ombudsman and an investigation proved maladministration had
occurred, 'we may be in a similar situtation to that which prevailed in the
case of the Barlow Clowes investors.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Gould back reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR must reject the notion that minor policy changes will prove adequate
to win the next election and instead develop a platform with an appeal that
embraces the interests and aspirations of middle-class voters.
That is the view held by both contenders for the party leadership in
articles published in New Statesman and Society magazine today.
Shadow chancellor Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite, and Mr Bryan Gould,
his challenger, definitively reject the so-called 'one last heave' notion,
which argues that the party should simply repackage its current policies and
improve on its communications with the electorate.
But their approaches to broadening the party's appeal vary subtly, with Mr
Gould delivering a thinly-veiled attack on his rival for his handling of
economic policy.
Mr Smith argues that Labour should play heavily on the argument of
enlightened self-interest, a broad concept of freedom and economic logic.
The shadow chancellor suggests that the 'comfortable and contented' are
anxious about inner-city degeneration, unemployment and the decline in the
quality of life.
Mr Gould begins by criticising Labour's election campaign for failing to
offer motives to middle-class voters to support the party.
In a passage that will infuriate Mr Smith's supporters, he says the party
endorsed Tory macroeconomic policies by accepting a simple goal of monetary
stability, offering no route to full employment or recovery. He also asks
why constructive proposals such as contributors' control over pensions
funds, share ownership schemes and better employee rights were not proposed.
In future, electors should not be treated as socio-economic groups but as
individuals given the power that leaves them 'properly equipped to operate
in a market place that would otherwise treat them unfairly'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plans to abstain in
Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs will be ordered to abstain in next week's vote on legislation to
ratify the controversial Maastricht agreement on European Community treaty
changes, the shadow cabinet agreed unanimously last night.
Their decision guarantees the government a comfortable majority on the issue
and brings to an end an impassioned debate within the Parliamentary Labour
party.
At a heavily attended weekly meeting of the PLP, about eight MPs argued
vigorously that the party had several grounds on which it could justifiably
vote against the government. But Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign
secretary, warned that to oppose the legislation would be inconsistent with
Labour's stance at the general election.
He was backed by Mr Neil Kinnock, the leader, who wound up the hour-long
debate by reminding MPs that an opposing vote could be used against the
party at the next election.
Mr Stan Orme, the PLP chairman, argued that the Tory rebellion would be
limited and the Liberal Democrats would almost certainly vote with the
Conservatives.
Liberal Democrat MPs agreed last night to support the Maastricht legislation
on its second reading.
But they will attempt to force debates during its passage on Economic and
Monetary Union, the European parliament and the social chapter.
The leadership's decision means Labour will table an amendment criticising
the government's European stance, but will abstain on the main motion. But
some Labour rebels can be expected to defy the whips and vote against.
Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood was last night elected unopposed as the
party's new chief whip.
He replaces Mr Jim Wallace, the member for Orkney and Shetland, who becomes
leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Chancellor upbeat on growth aims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S return to economic growth would become 'firmly established' in
1992, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons last night.
Confidently predicting a further reduction in inflation he said: 'We have a
once-in-a-generation chance to push towards price stability'.
The chancellor hoped for an increase in demand as the tax cuts made in the
March Budget reached pay packets next week, and home-buyers used the extra
money at their disposal through reductions in mortgage interest payments.
He expected some of the increase in disposable incomes would 'feed through
into higher consumer spending'.
Mr Lamont's optimism contrasted with the judgment of Mr John Smith, shadow
chancellor and front runner in Labour's leadership contest, who, on the
final day of the debate on the Queen's Speech, led an attack on the
government's continuing failure to halt the rise in unemployment.
The chancellor also came under fire from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader,
over his refusal to state the year in which the objective of returning to a
balanced budget 'in the medium term' would be achieved.
Mr Lamont stressed that he was not 'altering in any way' the forecast of a
Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement in the current financial
year.
The published figures for the PSBR in subsequent years - including the
Pounds 32bn for 1993-94 - were 'assumptions' and not forecasts.
The chancellor claimed that the projection for the last year covered by the
table in the Budget Red Book - which Mr Kinnock emphasised was Pounds 6bn -
was 'very close to balance indeed'.
Mr Lamont said the uncertainty caused by the possibility of a Labour victory
in the general election had held back company investment and orders, and
subdued consumer demand.
Now the message from forward-looking surveys of business and consumer
confidence was clear, and the stock market and foreign exchange markets had
signalled their renewed confidence in the government's policies.
He emphasised,too, that with last week's  1/2 percentage point cut in bank
rate the differential between British and German interest rates had been
reduced from about 7 per cent to just a quarter of one per cent, lower than
at any time in the past decade.
Thanks to the government's refusal to bow to short-term pressures, Britain's
inflation performance had improved out of all recognition, he said.
Underlying producer-output price inflation was lower than at any time since
the early 1970s, and he expected it to fall to below 2 per cent in 1993.
The chancellor emphasised the need to control public expenditure, but Mr
Smith deplored the lack of any reference in the Queen's Speech to
unemployment and the recession, and accused Tory MPs of being interested
only in 'the level of their shares on the Stock Exchange'.
He said the government had failed to foster the manufacturing sector - the
wealth-producing sector of the economy.
To taunts from Tory backbenchers over the outcome of the election, Mr Smith
said Labour's defeat did not alter the fact that investment was falling,
unemployment rising and that the government had failed to support industry.
He warned that Britain had no future as a low cost, low-skilled
'bargain-basement economy'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Dean to quit post in merged print union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS BRENDA DEAN is to resign from her job as deputy general secretary of the
GPMU print union. She became a household name during the Wapping dispute
with News International.
Ms Dean, 49, failed to become leader of the new union last year when Sogat,
the general print union which she had led since 1985, merged with the
smaller NGA skilled print union. After she was beaten by Mr Tony Dubbins,
the NGA leader, by 78,442 votes to 72,657, it was assumed she would not stay
long as his deputy.
Ms Dean said she was sad to leave after 32 years in the union movement but
was going with 'no recriminations'. She added that the future was 'a blank
sheet of paper' but she is expected to have no difficulty in finding a
prominent position, probably in the public sector.
According to some union officials Ms Dean might have left GPMU earlier but
felt a duty to protect the senior officers of her former union after the
merger. Sogat moved into the NGA's Bedford headquarters after the merger,
reinforcing the impression that it was more a takeover by the NGA.
Ms Dean accepted that there had been friction at national level after the
merger, but added that overall 'it has gone much better than expected'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Investigator into BCCI is accused: MP names Abu Dhabi
official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ABU DHABI official actively involved in that country's investigation into
fraud at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International was named
in the Commons last night as having benefited from 'clearly fraudulent'
transactions in BCCI shares.
Mr Ghanem Faris Al Mazrui, who was the Abu Dhabi government's representative
on the board of BCCI, gained from 'no risk' deals, according to a report by
lawyers acting for BCCI creditors and disclosed by Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP
for Leicester East.
Mr Vaz emphasised that he was convinced that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan
al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, knew nothing about the deals.
Similar accusations have been made in reports by Price Waterhouse, the
auditors to BCCI, but their emergence last night could undermine the
provisional agreement on a compensation deal for BCCI depositors which is
awaiting the approval of creditors.
The disclosure by Mr Vaz under parliamentary privilege of the report's
contents is likely to upset the Abu Dhabi government at a critical point. It
will also increase pressure on BCCI's liquidators.
Mr Mazrui is a senior adviser to Sheikh Zayed and is still involved in Abu
Dhabi's investigations into fraud at the bank. Mr Vaz called for Mr Mazrui
to make a statement, 'either to deny knowledge of what this report refers to
or to give an explanation of his actual involvement.'
The MP read extracts from a report compiled by Norton Rose, the firm of
solicitors commissioned by the BCCI interim creditors' committee to study
the proposed compensation package, which includes Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds
937m) injected by the Abu Dhabi government.
The leaked report said: 'Mr Al Mazrui, according to Price Waterhouse,
admitted that he had benefited from 'no risk' transactions in which he
purchased BCCI Group shares. Such transactions, including the manipulation
of the BCCI Group share price, were clearly fraudulent. Mr Al Mazrui
apparently informed other government officials of his involvement in April
1990.'
Another passage, read by Mr Vaz and referring to the majority shareholders
which included the Abu Dhabi government, said: 'We see no means by which Mr
Al Mazrui's knowledge (if any) can be imputed to the majority shareholders.'
Mr Vaz also protested about documents held in Abu Dhabi to which the
creditors' lawyers had not been allowed access. He called for the UK
government to intervene and also to provide more help for the 1,200 former
BCCI employees and 40,000 depositors. Mr Vaz said that if the government
'was to support the view of depositors and creditors that more money should
be made available, I believe the Abu Dhabi government would act positively.'

<TEXT>
BBC SELECT, the subscription television service of the BBC, may launch
family educational programmes including language tuition for children. A
pilot programme on French for children aged seven to 11 has been produced,
and talks on collaboration have started with publishers.
Ms Angie Mason, senior commissioning editor for education at BBC Select,
said: 'It's a question of which publishers we decide to go with.'
She was speaking after the official launch of BBC Select, which plans to use
spare capacity on BBC 1 and BBC 2 transmitters in the early hours to
broadcast specialist programmes to businesspeople, accountants, lawyers,
farmers and yacht owners.
Ms Mason believes BBC Select may have identified a gap in the market by
delivering a range of educational programmes direct to the home. The first
BBC Select subscription service - the Executive Business Club - will start
broadcasting on May 27. Professor Graham Robinson, chairman of the service,
said yesterday he expected to reach Pounds 2m turnover in its first year of
operation.
Prof Robinson said he had 131 clients including three high street banks and
Prudential Assurance.
The charge for a company intending to make copies of the training programmes
available to 2,000 staff is less than Pounds 10,000 a year. Meridian
Television, which defeated TVS in last year's competitive tenders for ITV
licences, has lost its director of news and regional programmes. Ms Dianne
Nelmes resigned yesterday and said that after setting up programme
structures and hiring key people she did not wish to remain.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Warning over costs in accounts proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS unveiled yest-erday by the Auditing Practices Board may create
extra costs and impose additional responsibilities on directors and
auditors, experts warned yesterday.
The plans were welcomed by Mr Roger Davis, head of audit at Coopers &amp;
Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm. However, he warned that auditors
would be put on the spot by the proposed requirement to express an opinion
on whether a company was a going concern for the following 12 months.
Mr Hugh Collum, chairman of the 100 Group of leading finance directors, said
the going concern statement was an important contribution but 'it's going to
need careful handling, particularly for companies in difficulties.'
The Confederation of British Industry commented: 'It puts a heavy burden on
directors and auditors.'
The proposal for an expanded report spelling out that directors and not
auditors are responsible for the accounts giving a true and fair view of the
business was welcomed by the Institute of Directors.
A report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales said that an expanded report would be useful in reducing the
'expectations gap' in public understanding of the role of auditors.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Commercial freedom for nuclear body urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Atomic Energy Authority should have more freedom to undertake
commercial activities outside the nuclear industry, the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission said yesterday.
The authority is now known as AEA Technology, and it exploits expertise
gained from the nuclear power programme.
The commission said AEA was 'significantly inhibited' by constraints which
prevent it manufacturing non-nuclear products and forming joint ventures
outside the nuclear field.
It has investigated AEA as part of its programme to review all public-sector
bodies. The commission also said that AEA's businesses, which range from
atomic research to petroleum services, 'rest uneasily in the public sector
where their entrepreneurial activities are inevitably somewhat constrained'.
The MMC concluded that AEA could generate higher net revenue. The report
identified weaknesses in financial and project control, investment appraisal
and marketing.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Councils criticised over planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST councils are failing to meet government targets for faster planning
decisions in spite of a fall in development activity, the Audit Commission
says in a report published today.
The government spending watchdog says only a handful of English councils are
satisfying the target of deciding 80 per cent of planning applications
within eight weeks. The target was set in 1982 by Mr Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary.
The commission says the proportion of applications decided within eight
weeks declined from 70 per cent in 1982-83 to 46 per cent in 1989-90. It
adds that there has been only a small improvement since 1989-90 in spite of
a fall in applications and a rise in staff.
The commission says councils should take advantage of lower workloads to
streamline and improve their planning procedures.
The report was welcomed yesterday by the Conservative-led Association of
District Councils; the Association of London Authorities, which represents
most Labour London boroughs; and the Council for the Protection of Rural
England (CPRE), the environmental group.
Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, warned, however, that 'proper
protection for the countryside cannot be secured by rushed planning
decisions to meet artificial deadlines imposed by the government'.
During 1990-91, English local authorities made decisions on 518,000 planning
applications compared with more than 600,000 applications in each of the two
preceding years. Applications last year, however, were still 40 per cent
higher than 10 years before.
Mr Bob Chilton, local government director at the commission, said: 'Having
survived the pressures of the development boom of the late 1980s, local
authorities should use the current easing in the volume of applications to
assess the quality of the local service they provide and to prepare for the
next surge in applications.'
The commission said that time wasted in administration could be put to
better use in improving assessment procedures and providing greater public
consultation. It urged planning departments to avoid wasting time by setting
clear objectives and providing opportunities for discussion and advice
before developers submitted formal applications.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Ministers review London bus plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL proposals for the deregulation and privatisation of the London
bus network appear to be undergoing a review by the fresh ministerial team
at the Department of Transport.
The department yesterday announced that a working party comprising a range
of interests in the capital had been set up 'to advise on the practical
aspects of implementing deregulation.'
Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said the government
remained committed to extending bus de-regulation to the capital.
However, the creation of the working party follows last week's surprise
omission from the Queen's Speech of legislative proposals for London bus
deregulation, which previous transport minsters had consistently promised
early in the next parliament.
Transport ministers seem unlikely to drop deregulation altogether, but some
Conservative MPs in the capital are believed to be deeply concerned about
the proposals in their present form.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Big rise reported in formation of company audit committees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY British companies have created audit committees voluntarily in the past
few years, but few disclose much about them in their accounts, according to
a report commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales.
A sample of 300 organisations was polled and replies were received from 202
industrial concerns, including listed companies, and 44 financial
institutions.
Two thirds of the industrial concerns and 88 per cent of the institutions
had audit committees, compared with 17 per cent of large UK companies in a
1985 study
Mr Paul Collier, a lecturer in accounting at Exeter University who carried
out the research for the institute early last year, said greater levels of
control and the requirement for compliance committees explained the higher
incidence among financial institutions.
The typical audit committee has one executive director and three or four
non-executive directors, appointed for an indefinite period. It meets three
times a year and reviews company accounting principles and practice. Half of
the committees in the survey review auditors' fees.
But the annual reports of 45 per cent of the industrial concerns and 21 per
cent of the institutions did not disclose even the presence of an audit
committee. Among industrial concerns, many public-sector organisations and
listed companies had audit committees, while other businesses and the
subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies had very few.
More than half of the committees had been created within the previous five
years. The most frequently cited reasons for their creation were good
corporate practice and strengthening the effectiveness of non-executive
directors.
Many companies without audit committees dismissed them as an additional
layer of bureaucracy, and said that their costs would outweigh their
benefits.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Work experience western-style: Peter Norman reports on the
Russian 'secondees' who are eager converts to capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEIR resolve stiffened by an outward bound course in the Welsh mountains,
the first of up to 1,000 young Russians will soon start working with British
financial institutions under Mr Norman Lamont's scheme to spread practical
knowledge of the market economy in the former Soviet Union.
Last night the first pilot group of 20 'secondees' and their employers
attended a reception in 11 Downing Street to mark the formal beginning of
what has become known as the chancellor's Financial Sector Scheme.
The idea, first put forward by Mr Lamont last October, is that banks,
building societies, insurance companies, brokers, accountants and solicitors
across Britain should provide jobs for financial services personnel from
Russia and the other former Soviet republics for between six months and a
year.
On their return they will become an elite cadre that will help build the
financial, legal and accounting infrastructure needed to modernise the
former Soviet Union.
'A modern financial system is basic to the future of Russia,' Mr Lamont
said. 'I think they need help there. By asking each company really to make a
small sacrifice, just to pay somebody for a short period of time, it seemed
to me that by harnessing private effort we really could achieve quite a
lot.'
Having met five of the Russians this week, it seemed more likely that the
first group of employers - which range from NM Rothschild in the City to the
Marsden Building Society in Nelson, Lancashire - will be gaining a valuable
asset rather than making a 'small sacrifice' by employing the secondees.
All were extremely keen to start work around the end of this month after
completing an intensive course in business English and finance at Middlesex
Polytechnic in Hendon.
They also proved to be surprisingly knowledgeable, reflecting, in some
cases, intensive study of capitalist ways in academic institutions under the
communist regime.
Mr Viatcheslav Butyrski, at 28 the head of securities trading at
Promstroybank in Moscow, was looking forward to six months with Swiss Bank
Corporation in London in which he would be able to relate his theoretical
knowledge of share and bond trading to modern practice.
He obtained a degree in capital market studies from the USSR Institute of
Banking before joining the 70-year-old Promstroybank after it was converted
into a joint stock bank a year ago.
Ms Marina Krupina, 37, will be working in Cardiff with the Bank of Wales,
where she hopes to learn how a medium-sized western bank operates.
She says she has already gained some insight into western accountancy and
taxation practices after working at Promstroybank for five years on joint
ventures with foreign companies.
Mr Igor Kostikov, 33, is already an entrepreneur in his own right as one of
the owners and directors of Marka, a private sector financial consultancy
and stockbrokerage. His varied career began with the study of Marxist
political economy. But he claims that he has spent six years acquiring
expertise about the British economy, including the privatisation of the oil
and electricity supply industries.
The main computer centre of the USSR Ministry of Finance may seem an odd
apprenticeship for a stockmarket career. But Ms Elena Shakhurina, 26, is now
a fervent advocate of equities and privatisation and looking forward to
applying experience acquired with Nikko Europe when she returns to Moscow's
International Stock Exchange in six months' time.
Just a year ago Mr Max Diakonov, 22, graduated from Moscow's finance academy
and joined the international department of Inkombank, one of the new Russian
commercial banks, as head of correspondent banking.
'I have very good relations with western banks. But I don't have enough
experience. That is why I am here. I will work in Lloyds Bank in London and
Birmingham and try and find something really good for the Russian economy,'
he says. 'I want to be an expert, the best in my sphere.'
This first batch of secondees are impressive. But officials from the British
Council, which is managing the scheme, point out that the first candidates
'self-selected' themselves, after hearing about the plan on the Moscow
gossip circuit or having been tipped off by employers that were in close
contact with the British Embassy or British Council in Moscow. They then had
to go through a rigorous selection procedure, including a tough test in
English.
Sir Derek Thomas, European adviser to NM Rothschild, helped to interview the
candidates. He has no doubt that Russia and the other republics will make
the transition to the market economy if the pilot group is representative.
So far about 300 UK companies have promised to take on a secondee. 'And if
we can get 1,000 people, that actually is a very big thing,' Mr Lamont said.
But the young Russians now in Britain are under no illusion that the hard
work begins once they return home.
As Mr Diakonov says: 'The main aim of the scheme is to help but not to solve
our problems.'

FT  14 MAY 92 / Holiday operators expect a tough year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPECTED post-election boom in package holidays has failed to
materialise, leaving tour operators facing a second difficult year.
A number of tour operators have cut the price of holidays in May and June by
as much as 60 per cent to fill empty seats - in some cases up to a quarter
of their capacity. With Thomson, the largest operator, last-minute
bargain-seekers can buy for Pounds 199 a fly-drive holiday to Florida which
would normally cost more than Pounds 400.
Analysts also point to a new trend for holidaymakers to wait longer before
making bookings, depriving tour operators of the benefit of early deposits.
The move to last-minute bookings means that tour operators now have less
cash on deposit earning interest over several months.
The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday published figures showing that tour
operators had overcapacity of 1.6m holidays in the 12 months to September 30
last year and a turnover of Pounds 440m less than the tour industry had
predicted.
The 40 largest operators had obtained CAA licences for 11.9m passengers, but
actually carried only 10.3m. This year, tour operators have told the
authority they expect to carry 13.5m passengers, an increase of more than 30
per cent on last year's actual figures.
Authority licences for this year project turnover of Pounds 4.44bn, a
substantial increase on both the forecast for 1990-91 (Pounds 3.65bn) and
the turnover achieved (Pounds 3.21bn).
Thomas Cook, the travel agent, said yesterday that those in the industry who
expected 'a post-election expansion of package holiday demand' had been
disappointed.
Holidays for May and June have 'not been selling as well as would have been
liked' but Thomas Cook said the case would be different in the latter part
of June through to September. Summer bookings - where discounting has not
yet been necessary - are already 'full to the brim'.
Thomas Cook believes that the projections by some operators of an increase
of 20 per cent to 40 per cent in demand this year is over-optimistic. 'Those
which are looking for a 7 per cent to 10 per cent increase are being more
realistic', it said.
Mr Harry Coe, group finance director of Airtours, the third largest
operator, said the level of discounting was not unusual. 'Every year there
is excess capacity in May and June, and every year there is price-cutting in
the late bookings market in order to move it,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Watchdog urges profit clawback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government could have increased its proceeds from the privatisation of
the electricity distribution industry in 1990 by clawing back part of the
profits which the companies reported in the subsequent year, according to
the National Audit Office.
In a report on the sale of the 12 regional electricity companies the
government spending watchdog says the Department of Energy considered
introducing a provision for profit clawbacks over several years but decided
against it because this could have affected the payment of dividends by the
companies and cut the proceeds.
The Audit Office says it would have been 'appropriate' for the department to
explore whether higher proceeds could have been obtained by clawing back at
least a portion of the profits that exceeded the companies' forecasts.
The office also says that with hindsight the government could have earned
more from the sale by retaining a portion of the shares to take advantage of
the rise in the share price during the offer period. It recommends the
government retains a substantial minority in future privatisations for this
purpose.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Companies act to exploit upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY MANUFACTURING companies have acted during the recession to take
advantage of an economic upturn which is already under way, according to a
survey published yesterday by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy
firm.
The Gallup survey of 450 of Britain's biggest manufacturers shows that most
have implemented cost-reduction programmes and have speeded up the
introduction of new products. They have also invested more in new production
processes, increased export business and improved delivery times.
In spite of figures suggesting manufacturing investment has fallen during
the recession, the survey shows that more than two thirds of manufacturers
have maintained or increased the cash value of capital-investment
programmes.
More than a third of companies expect to have more employees in training
within three years, and a quarter report that they are training more people
than in 1989. Only 12 per cent of companies surveyed suggest that poor
relationships with their workforces are affecting performance.
Coopers says the survey provides evidence that many of the factors which
contributed to the decline of manufacturing in the past decade are being
reversed. It says manufacturing is making significant advances across all
sectors.
The survey also highlights some of the continuing problems which have
weakened performance. It shows short-term attitudes on the development of
businesses still prevail, with only one in 15 companies making any business
plans for more than five years ahead, in contrast to Japanese competitors,
which plan up to 25 years ahead.
Nearly half of the companies surveyed cited Britain's 'roller-coaster'
economy as an obstacle, while three quarters blamed high interest rates.

Uxbridge UB8 1QQ. Free.
THE GOVERNMENT must change its attitude to manufacturing if British industry
is to prosper, according to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of Weir Group,
the Glasgow-based pump manufacturer, James Buxton writes.
Its policies of the 1980s aimed at making Britain a post-industrial economy
by fostering the growth of services were misguided, Mr Garrick said in his
1992 Engineering Manufacturing Forum lecture in Glasgow yesterday.
He added: 'The most successful economies in terms of growth of gross
domestic product also have the strongest manufacturing industries.' He
wanted better policies for export credits, overseas aid and the Pounds 5bn
the government spends on research.
He said he was not seeking interventionist policies. British manufacturing
had improved its performance substantially in the 1980s and now needed to
regain ground lost to imported equipment.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Health trust managers strive for a new relationship: Lisa
Wood and Catherine Milton on the effects of government reforms on industrial
relations in the NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE most immediate effects of government reforms to the National
Health Service is likely to be on employee relations.
Many personnel managers in the new self-governing trusts, which are allowed
to set their own pay and conditions, are examining ways of leaving national
agreements.
But a Financial Times survey of more than half of the first 57 NHS trusts
which came into existence just over a year ago shows that most are initially
moving with caution.
Mr Bob Rotchell, director of operations at West Dorset Community NHS Trust,
said that nationally agreed terms and conditions in the health service had
been a 'personnel manager's nightmare'. Like most trust managers, however,
he said the devolution to trusts of managerial responsibility for industrial
relations was not easy. 'Any group who thought when they established a trust
that setting local pay and conditions would be easy must have been very
naive,' he said.
Nevertheless, greater flexibility should eventually mean a smaller,
better-trained NHS workforce. Within weeks of becoming self-governing a year
ago, Guy's and Lewisham Trust in London announced plans to shed several
hundred jobs to cut Pounds 5m from labour costs. The trust is now balancing
its books and has given lower-paid staff an extra Pounds 5 per week above
national rates, but Mr Peter Griffiths, chief executive, expects the trust
to operate with up to 20 per cent fewer staff in Guy's hospital in five
years. Such reductions are likely to become widespread in the health
service. The jobs of its many unskilled ancillary workers and of some
laboratory and other technical staff will be at risk.
The FT survey also highlights managers' ambitions for an overhaul of the
traditional negotiating machinery. Most trusts want a single pay spine, or
scale, for all their employees. That would replace the dozen or so present
scales, including those negotiated by the Whitley Councils, which have
traditionally set pay and conditions in the NHS. It would also replace the
newer pay review bodies for nurses, doctors and professions allied to
medicine.
An overhaul would facilitate local pay bargaining. The government says it
will not abolish national machinery, but it could become redundant or, at
best, a 'benchmark' for local deals. Bradford Hospital Trust said: 'Nobody
will be worse off. Whitley is regarded as a minimum.'
All trusts in the survey agreed that pay would not be squeezed as a result
of the changes. Most said they were affected by skill shortages and the need
to attract staff, but Southend Health Care Trust warned: 'In some cases we
will pay more than Whitley and, if we don't need to, we won't'
Harmonising conditions for employees could, in the short-term, increase pay
bills. But the process is likely to be linked to greater flexibility.
Several trusts are taking on new healthcare assistants to assist trained
nurses in wards from which student nurses are being removed. United Bristol
Healthcare Trust said: 'As the number of people available as nationally
trained nurses falls, so we will be forced to take on more people who are
trained locally.'
Other findings of the survey include:
Only a few trusts have negotiated formal recognition agreements with unions.
A few were reluctant to discuss the issue, including Central Middlesex
Hospital and Nuffield Orthopaedic Trust.
One, West Dorset Community Health Trust, has successfully agreed and
implemented a pay package, including a local performance pay deal, with
unions this year. Homewood Trust in Chertsey, Surrey, has agreed with unions
a package that includes what is in effect a no-strike deal. But no local pay
offer has yet been agreed. Northumbria Ambulance Trust has awarded employees
a local pay deal this year, but it was negotiated with the Association of
Professional Ambulance Personnel (Apap), a union not affiliated to the
Trades Union Congress. Apap has been given sole negotiating rights at the
trust.
No other first-wave trusts plan to give sole rights to a union, although
most want single-table bargaining, in which several unions appoint
representatives to conduct joint negotiations. Cohse, the health-service
union, says that only 15 trusts have signed formal agreements with unions to
negotiate over pay and conditions.
Acas, the conciliation service, sees great strides in employment
relationship among trusts. It adds, however, that 'there often remains a
lack of expertise in this area among local managers and trade union
representatives alike'.
Most trusts in the survey offered slightly different conditions of
employment in contracts offered to new staff. Mr Brian Carpenter, personnel
director of South Devon Healthcare Trust, said it had introduced changes to
time off and had brought in performance-related pay for senior managers.
Changes made by other trusts include limiting appeal rights and adjustments
to maternity leave.
Many trusts are using outside consultants to investigate job evaluation.
Nine trusts in the south-west of England are working together on
investigating job evaluation, a system trusts say could add to wage bills.
Mr Rotchell of West Dorset said he had been told by consultants that the
exercise could add 5 per cent.
Most trusts want a single pay spine covering all staff although a few said
such ambitions would be hard to realise because of the complexity of
arranging so many groups of staff on one scale. Southend said it would like
five or six spines and proposed big changes such as abolishing the increment
related to length of service. It did not plan to introduce
performance-related pay.
Harmonisation of terms and conditions is favoured by trusts, but all agreed
that such a move would incur costs.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Eggar seeks power price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA and ANDREW SLADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE electricity industry must cut domestic bills to reflect cheaper coal
prices, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday.
Mr Eggar, speaking during a visit to Rufford and Ollerton collieries in
Nottinghamshire, said it was vital that consumers were given the benefit of
any deal between the electricity producers and British Coal.
He was confident British Coal would be able to produce coal at prices that
would benefit electricity consumers. 'The challenge that faces this and
other pits is to reduce their costs to produce coal competitively,' he
added. 'It is a challenge I am convinced British Coal can meet.' Mr Eggar
said it was important for British Coal to be privatised without delay. This
meant that it must agree contracts to sell coal to the electricity industry
as soon as possible. These contracts would determine how many British Coal
pits would survive, Mr Eggar added.
He would not confirm rumours that the government was about to negotiate an
agreement between British Coal and the electricity industry. He saw a role
for the government as a 'facilitator'.
The government, British Gas, the regulatory body Ofgas and 11 of the
regional electricity companies in England and Wales are to set up an
independent Energy Savings Trust to promote the efficient use of energy,
Andrew Slade writes.
The initiative promised in the Conservatives' general election manifesto was
announced yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. His
department said the government expected funding to come from the electricity
industry and consumers. a

FT  14 MAY 92 / CBI survey points to recovery areas: Yorkshire and
Humberside region, east Midlands and Wales are expected to lead growth in
services and manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALES, the east Midlands, and the Yorkshire and Humberside region are likely
to lead the economic recovery, according to the Business Strategies
consultancy.
Its conclusion is based on a regional breakdown released yesterday of
prospects for manufacturers, conducted by the consultancy with the
Confederation of British Industry.
Ms Bridget Rosewell, joint managing director of Business Strategies, said
the three regions all combined relative strength in manufacturing with
reasonably good prospects for services - which account for about three
quarters of gross domestic product.
The study is based on the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, which
questioned 1,328 manufacturing companies between March 27 and April 13.
According to the study, manufacturers across the UK are generally more
optimistic than four months ago. Expectations about a recovery were
particularly marked in East Anglia, the south-east and the west Midlands.
All three areas were hit hard in the early stages of the recession in 1990.
However, the north of England and Scotland - two regions relatively little
affected in the early part of the recession - appear to be suffering more
now in terms of depressed orders and output.
Out of the 11 UK regions, five have seen a decrease in the past year in the
proportion of companies working below capacity. These are the south-east,
East Anglia, Yorkshire and Humberside, east Midlands and Wales.
Most regions have continued over the past four months to see a fall in
output and orders, but at a lower rate than last year.
Another relatively gloomy conclusion is that all regions except the north
expect a decline in investment in plant and machinery over the next 12
months.
The expected rate of reduction in capital spending appears to be slowing in
the east and west Midlands and Wales.

UNIONISTS in Northern Ireland were reported last night to be dismayed at the
leaking of a submission to the round-table talks on the province's political
future, our Belfast Correspondent writes.
The submission from the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party was
tabled as part of the first phase of the talks. It proposes a European-style
consultative assembly which would involve the appointment of commissioners
for the province, including one by Dublin.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said he
was furious at the breach of confidentiality. SDLP officers also expressed
anger.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the leak 'rather
strikes at the trust which has been maintained until now and I hope will be

FT  14 MAY 92 / Job prospects up in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOB PROSPECTS improved in the first quarter of the year, the Alfred Marks
recruitment agency said yesterday. It added that the number of temporary
posts rose much faster than the total of permanent jobs.
The employment department is expected to announce a further rise in
unemployment today. Economists in the City of London are predicting a
monthly increase of about 25,000, in line with the recent underlying trend
of a slight improvement. Unemployment has risen steadily since March 1990.
According to the Alfred Marks survey, temporary posts rose 13.2 per cent
compared with 9.4 per cent in the same period last year. Permanent posts
rose 1.2 per cent compared with a 6.6 per cent fall in the first quarter
last year.
Using temporary staff enables employers to respond more flexibly to
fluctuations in demand. It is not clear, however, whether the increase in
temporary work indicates a more flexible labour market or employers'
continuing uncertainty about the strength of any economic recovery.
The figures show more vacancies in the north and west of England than in the
south and east. Vacancies rose 23.5 per cent in the west Midlands compared
with a fall of 5.5 per cent a year before.
In the north of England vacancies increased by 11.9 per cent compared with a
fall of 4.4 per cent last year.

FT  14 MAY 92 / George warns on single EC currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING about the practical difficulties involved in the move to a single
European currency was delivered last night by Mr Eddie George, deputy
governor of the Bank of England.
In a speech at Hull University, Mr George questioned both the timetable for
European economic and monetary union, and the credibility of the proposed
European Central Bank.
The remarks by Mr George - a noted sceptic on Emu - may influence MPs ahead
of next week's Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty, which last December
set the general framework for a move to union later this decade.
Mr George also held out little prospect of any early move by the government
to reduce base rates further, following last week's 0.5 percentage point
reduction to 10 per cent. In the longer term he hinted at the possibility of
bringing UK rates lower than those in Germany, on condition that Britain
kept its inflation low and retained the confidence of the financial markets.
On Emu, Mr George said practical difficulties meant the schedule as set out
at Maastricht looked ambitious. Under the Maastricht plan, the final stage
of Emu will start up with or without Britain by 1999.
The problems included converting national currencies into European currency
units, and producing the necessary coins and notes. Another was establishing
Ecu payments systems.
Mr George was particularly sceptical about the operation of the proposed
central bank. It is planned that in the final stages of Emu the bank would
administer the single currency and set pan-European interest rates.
He said that the central bank might be 'vulnerable to misjudgment and to
outside influence'.
In terms of determining the correct level of interest rates, the central
bank would be faced with huge problems in monitoring how factors such as
financial liberalisation affected the pan-European economy.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Ramos catches up with rival in Philippine poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR FIDEL RAMOS, the former Philippine defence chief, last night caught up
with his main rival Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, in the race for the
presidency, according to latest unofficial counts based on a sixth of the
votes cast in Monday's election.
Earlier Mrs Santiago, a lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner, had claimed
victory but her opponents had said her claim was premature.
Quoting Winston Churchill, the outspoken Mrs Santiago said she would be
magnanimous in victory.
'Certain losers among the presidential candidates might try to cheat, and
may even have started doing so,' said Mrs Santiago, who hopes to undermine
the country's oligarchy of influential families, 'but the youth and all the
Filipinos who helped me to win will not allow the triumph of evil'.
Mr Ramos had said yesterday afternoon that he expected the rankings to
change in his favour as votes came in from the provinces following Monday's
presidential, congressional and local elections.
The lengthy manual process of counting ballot papers - each with up to 44
handwritten names - from as many as 27m voters has already given rise to
several disputes in local political contests, but businessmen have reacted
favourably to the relatively peaceful conduct of the poll.
Both Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago are regarded as candidates who would
encourage private enterprise and foreign investment, and the twin stock
markets of Manila and Makati rose more than 7 per cent yesterday from their
levels on Friday after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The Manila Stock
Exchange composite index rose 93.02 points to 1,328.04.
A glance at the official table of comparative statistics on violent
incidents in recent elections helps to explain the euphoria.
Between January 12 and yesterday morning there were only 12 'liquidations'
(assassinations) throughout the islands, compared to 95 in the chaotic 1986
presidential elections and 93 in the local elections of 1988.
Sceptics, however, have noted that the election cannot be said to be
finished until the results are clear and have expressed fears about the
destabilising effect of the long counting period.
In an attempt to defuse the tension, the Commission on Elections yesterday
warned candidates against making premature victory claims and announced an
agreement with television and radio stations under which all unofficial
counts - except for one authorised by the Commission - would cease from noon
today.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S state-owned financial institutions took part in large-scale share
purchases yesterday to reverse a price collapse on India's stock markets.
The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index rose 11 per cent, adding 344.76 to
3,431.13, wiping out Tuesday's sharp decline. The two-week tumble in share
prices had been triggered by revelations of a financial scandal that
resulted in the syphoning of funds from the government securities market
into equity purchases.
The massive intervention by the financial institutions came after the stock
exchange authorities overnight banned forward selling in 85 shares.
In an effort to curb abuses in the interbank securities market the Reserve
Bank, the country's central bank, yesterday issued fresh guidelines to
commercial banks operating in the market. The central bank said banks should
not hold an oversold position in a security - meaning that a bank should not
sell a security which it did not actually hold.
Finance Ministry officials say that some of the abuses in the securities
market involve 'fraud and potential criminality.' The Reserve Bank is also
probing securities dealing by ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered, Bank of
America and Citibank, as well as 15 Indian state-owned banks.
ANZ Grindlays, India's largest foreign bank and the one believed to be most
exposed to losses from abuses in the securities market, last night declined
to comment further on its involvement. It issued a press release which said
that the bank sees 'no useful purpose in adding to speculation in the
market'.
According to widespread market reports, National Housing Bank issued a
cheque to Grindlays for a large sum which was then credited to the account
of Mr Harshad Mehta. Mr Mehta is the Bombay broker who was forced to repay
Rs6.2bn (Pounds 122m) to State Bank of India to settle outstanding accounts
in the interbank market in government securities.
In its new guidelines the Reserve Bank also banned the use of brokers'
accounts in interbank dealings. In the present financial scandal the worst
abuses occurred as a result of connivance between brokers and bankers in
what are normally direct transactions between banks.

In a speech to be given in London last night, marking the 50th anniversary

importers/manufacturing exporters'. He said the import purchasing power of

of this process.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Iran pulls out the biggest plum from Afghan pie: Tehran has
won influence via the Persian speakers who now control Kabul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN BARRACLOUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE dust begins to settle over Kabul, the foreign players are counting
their takings. Many countries have stuck their fingers into the Afghan pie
during 14 years of civil war, but none has emerged with as much to show as
Iran.
Iran backed Afghanistan's Shia parties throughout the Afghan civil war,
hosting the leaders and giving shelter to 1m refugees. It supplied arms to
Shia mujahideen groups, vying with Sunni Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for
control of the jihad (holy war).
However, with the fall of the Soviet-backed regime last month, Tehran's
primary aim in Afghanistan shifted. It turned from promoting Shia Islamic
revolution to the promotion of Persian culture. As Afghanistan began to
splinter along ethnic lines in the post-communist vacuum Iran placed its
weight firmly behind the Persian-speaking Tajiks and Uzbeks who control
Kabul.
'The Iranians support (defence minister Ahmad Shah) Masood,' said a moderate
Afghan leader in Peshawar. 'They think Masood will take care of their
interests because he speaks their language.'
Mr Masood is not the only Persian speaker in Kabul. The ex-government
militia controlling Kabul's streets are Persian-speaking Uzbeks. General
Asif Dilawar, appointed commander-in-chief of the Afghan army forces by Mr
Masood last week, is also a Persian speaker.
Furthermore, Tehran hosted a meeting this year with Afghan
president-designate Burhanuddin Rabbani and representatives from Tajikistan
to promote Persian-based cultural links between Iran, Afghanistan and
Tajikistan.
With most power centres in Kabul filled by Persian speakers, the Iranians
are sitting pretty. 'I'd like to say we've done very well out of the last 14
years,' said Iran's consul in Peshawar, Mr Hamid Reza Sherkhodai.
A Persian-influenced government in Kabul is indeed a rare achievement.
Afghanistan has been ruled almost continuously by the majority Pushtun
tribe, who are spread throughout eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan.
In fact, only once has a non-Pushtun controlled Kabul, when Tajik
waterseller Bacha Siqa ruled for six months in the 1920s.
To bolster the new government in Kabul, the Iranians sent fuel and food to
Afghanistan's western provinces. A religious delegation brought gifts and
aid to Herat. Iran is also trying to open a supply route all the way to
Kabul.
The Iranians bring to the Afghans not only aid but a cultural influence. 'We
have certain cultural roots with these people,' said Mr Sherkhodai. 'We have
a common language and common religion.'
Iran is encouraging these links, offering to fund academic study of Persian
literature and celebrating the ancient Zoroastrian New Year in common with
the Afghans.
'Iran is offering the Afghans a copy of Ferdowsi (a Persian poet) with every
sack of wheat it sends,' said one western observer.
Of course, Tehran has not abandoned the Shia parties entirely. It continues
to back the Shia Hazara tribe in Afghanistan and provides moral and
financial support to Shia mujahideen group Hezbe Wahdat and pressure groups
such as the TNFJ in Pakistan.
But Iranian hardliners elected in the fiery last days of Iran's war with
Iraq who might have forced these groups higher up the Iranian agenda have
found their influence waning in Tehran. President Rafsanjani's reformist
supporters have just won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections
characterised by an electorate more concerned with economic well-being than
ideological purity.
At the heart of Iran's acceptance of the status quo in Kabul is a fear of
the alternative. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, radical Pushtun and main recipient of
Pakistani and US military assistance for the last decade, leads an informal
coalition of parties opposed to the Kabul government.
As the most powerful leader outside Kabul, Mr Hekmatyar would stand to take
over the mantle if Kabul's new government fell. Tehran fears that Mr
Hekmatyar, as a Pushtun, would favour Pakistani interests over Iran's.
Iran is embroiled in tough competition with Pakistan and Turkey over the
re-opening of trade routes with land-locked central Asia. Afghanistan
borders three central Asian states of the former Soviet Union so any
significant trade depends on stability in Kabul.
In April, Iran announced the start of a new railway line from Turkmenistan
to Iran's southern coast. It agreed to provide oil pipelines from Tajikistan
and Turkmenistan through to Turkey to the west.
And this week it joined an agreement to re-open the east-west silk road
across Asia.
Pakistan, meanwhile, is planning an Export Processing Zone in its North West
Frontier Province bordering Afghanistan, providing 50 per cent relief on
rail freight, duty-free import of raw material and reduced duty on exports.
Iran's influence on Kabul is already bearing fruit. Iranian official sources
said Kabul had this week ordered a significant supply of oil from Iran.
A quick settlement in Kabul would also rid Iran of the financial burden of
supporting refugees. With its inflation conservatively estimated at 30 per
cent, and imports nearing an all-time high at Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.6bn),
Iran badly needs to patch its economy together.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S enterprises had piled up Rbs1.43 trillion (million million) in
debts to each other and to the banks by May 1, the central bank said
yesterday. This sum is greater than the country's gross national product for
the first quarter.
Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, the bank's vice-chairman, said inter-enterprise debts
were increasing at the rate of Rbs27.5bn a day.
Talks are under way between the government, central bank and parliament on
ways to solve this rapidly gathering crisis - including debt forgiveness and
a bigger budget deficit.
Yesterday, the government more than doubled teachers' and doctors' pay after
they had threatened to strike for a 10-fold increase. The two groups are
among the poorest in Russia, earning about Rbs700 a month (the minimum wage
has just been increased to Rbs900).
The government also announced plans to levy import taxes of 5-10 per cent to
reduce the import bill. These will come into effect in August, and they
follow a 13 per cent increase in first-quarter imports, compared with a year
ago. That pushed the balance of payments deficit for the period to Dollars
2bn. Mr Pyotr Aven, foreign economic relations minister, told Interfax news
agency that the government was also considering an extra 28 per cent VAT on
imports.
Meanwhile, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, central bank chairman, said the system of
trade between the main republics of the former Soviet Union was increasingly
breaking down.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Havel tries to keep the family together: Ariane Genillard
and Anthony Robinson set the scene for the Czechoslovak election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Czechoslovakia's economic reforms and the fate of the Czech
and Slovak federal state will be the main issues of debate in a hard fought
general election campaign involving more than 40 political parties which
began yesterday.
The opening shot was fired by Mr Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech and
Slovak Federal Republic. Addressing the nation from Bratislava, the Slovak
capital, he warned against 'unconsidered and dangerous attempts' to break up
the country's fragile federation.
Moves to break up the union and reconstitute it as 'a vague dualist union'
would lead to 'a chaotic break-up of the state which would exact as high a
price as similar break-ups in Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Union'.
The presidential warning was directed mainly at nationalists striving for
greater autonomy for the Slovak republic, which holds a third of the
country's 16m population.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic Slovakia is expected to
re-emerge as the largest party in Slovakia after the June 5 elections, has
promised, however, that he would adopt a new constitution and declare Slovak
sovereignty if his party wins.
Polls place Mr Meciar well above other Slovak politicians, with 34 per cent
cent support. The remaining votes are likely to be split between a plethora
of parties including the governing Christian Democrats led by Mr Jan
Czarnogorsky, the former Communists, now re-named the Party of the
Democratic Left, and a new Social Democrat party. This is led by Mr
Alexander Dubcek, hero and then victim of the 1968 'Prague Spring' attempt
to create 'socialism with a human face' which was then crushed by Soviet
tanks.
Last week an attempt to establish a new Slovak constitution failed to
achieve the required 60 per cent majority in the Slovak parliament. But the
strength of nationalist feeling was shown by the over 50 per cent vote in
favour of a move which, had it succeeded, would have violated the federal
constitution.
Most parties in the more prosperous Czech republic have voiced support for
the federation. Here the most popular party is the Civic Democratic Party
led by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister, which the polls
calculate now attracts 20 per cent of the vote in the Czech lands.
His right-wing, free market party, whose privatisation and other economic
policies are modelled closely on those first introduced by Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, former leader of Britain's Conservatives, is one of the few to be
represented in both the Czech lands and Slovakia.
As in Poland, however, no party is expected to win an overall majority. The
combination of proportional representation and many contesting parties, is
expected to produce fragmented parliaments at both republican and federal
levels and could lead to complex negotiations to put together coalition
governments.
Mr Klaus, who already dominates economic policy-making also has strong ideas
about the future constitutional shape of the country.
He proposes that a new federal system should be devised after the elections
to devolve greater powers to the republics. The federal government would be
reduced to the core functions of finance, defence and foreign affairs.
This creates the possibility of a compromise which would satisfy both
moderate Slovak nationalists and those in both republics who chafe at the
unnecessary expense and duplication under the present Communist-imposed
system of republican and federal governments.
Increasingly, however, some Czech politicians, too, have spoken about the
possibility of a divorce. But, as President Havel repeated in his latest
speech, this could only be achieved by means of a referendum. and according
to opinion polls, the majority of Czech and Slovaks still prefer to live in
a common state.

THE United Nations peace-keeping headquarters for Croatia, which is based in
Sarajevo in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, has been urged to withdraw
because of the fighting in the Bosnian capital.
The call yesterday from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general, coincided with a lull in the fighting in Sarajevo as Serb
irregulars from the surrounding hills, who have besieged the city, declared
a five-day ceasefire. Shops and cafes reopened, and people emerged from
their cellars.
In a report to the UN Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'I am
convinced by the operational and security arguments in favour of the
temporary relocation of the bulk of the force's HQ staff from Sarajevo.'
His report also questioned the future of UN peace plans for Croatia.
He added that he would instruct General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN
forces in the former Yugoslav republics, to relocate temporarily 'pending
the restoration of calm in the city'.
Mr Boutros Ghali also ruled out the possibility of expanding peacekeeping
operations to Bosnia, where Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army,
have seized control of half the territory.
But in a further apparent setback for UN operations in the region, the
report cast doubt on the future of the UN peacekeeping plan for Croatia.
The plan calls for the withdrawal of the Serb-led federal army, and the
demilitarisation of three UN Protected Areas after the deployment of 14,000
peacekeepers, which had been scheduled for later this month.
UN officials say local Serb leaders in Croatia have refused to demobilise
reservists if the UNPAs are not extended to include other regions populated
by Serbs in Croatia.
The 11-page report said failure to demobilise would make it impossible to
implement the UN operations.
The recommendations were based on a fact-finding mission by Mr Marrack
Goulding, the UN under-secretary, who last week met Serb, Croat and Moslem
leaders. Mr Boutros Ghali warned that renewed hostilities in Croatia could
not be ruled out.

FT  14 MAY 92 / German finance minister promises era of austerity:
Supplementary budget cuts deficit by DM2.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday sought to reassure
the international community that he would bring public spending under
control by 1995 with a determined austerity programme.
He also resolutely rejected calls for tax increases to reduce the budget
deficit, describing them as a 'recipe for recession.'
Mr Waigel said the government was doing everything it could to create the
economic conditions, which would allow the German Bundesbank to bring down
interest rates.
'If we succeed in getting all levels of government to reduce spending, if
wage agreements are appropriate, if the rise in wage unit costs can be
stopped, then we will be creating political and economic preconditions which
open scope for movement on the interest rate front,' he said, stressing the
independence of the central bank in deciding monetary policy.
He won unanimous backing yesterday from the German cabinet for a medium-term
consolidation plan, which would keep the nominal rise in central government
spending to 2.5 per cent per year, maintain a moratorium on new spending
plans, and cut the budget deficit from a forecast DM42.7bn (Pounds 14.5bn)
this year to DM25bn in 1995.
This year's budget deficit is already going to be lower than anticipated by
DM2.6bn, thanks to a supplementary budget also approved yesterday, providing
for increased tax revenues and other income of DM6.5bn, against increased
spending of DM3.9bn.
Mr Waigel did not spell out concrete measures to cut government spending,
apart fromstopping central subsidies of the Federal Labour Office, which
pays out unemployment benefits, and finances training and job creation
schemes in eastern Germany.
However he made it clear that the German government will not subsidise any
big prestige projects in the coming years, such as Hanover's plans for an
international Expo 2000, and Berlin's hopes to stage the Olympic Games in
the same year.
He showed the real sensitivity of the German government to international
opinion when he promised to bring forward presentation of his 1993 budget to
July 1 - two weeks ahead of normal - in order to be able to present it to
his colleagues at the Group of Seven (G7) world economic summit in Munich
the following week.
The lack of adequate austerity in German public spending was sharply
criticised at the last G7 meeting in Washington, and by the International
Monetary Fund last month.
Mr Waigel's medium-term financial plans are based on an assumption of
overall 2 per cent growth this year, followed by 3 per cent in 1993, and 3.4
per cent in 1994. With a nominal 2.5 per cent growth in central government
spending, and 3 per cent in the rest of the public sector, that means real
cuts will have to be found.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Brawl adds to the drama of electing Italy's next president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE politics of electing Italy's ninth president turned into pure theatre
yesterday.
In the first special session of the joint houses of Parliament, everyone
voted in the knowledge that no candidate stood the chance of success. Nor
was any candidate intended to succeed by obtaining the necessary two thirds
majority of the 1,014 potential voters.
The only deviation from the script was a minor brawl before voting, provoked
by a deputy of the neo fascist MFI party who shouted 'Robbers]' at his
Christian Democrat colleagues. The insult touched an especially raw nerve
yesterday since Senator Seve Citrisi, the Christian Democrats' national
treasurer had just been served with notice of investigation in the
ever-expanding Milan municipal corruption scandal.
This procedure might have seemed a perverse way of finding a new head of
state to replace Mr Francesco Cossiga who resigned on April 25th, two months
before his seven year term was due to end. But when all the 16 parties in
parliament have been unable to agree in advance, either among themselves or
between each other, it made subtle sense.
Like bridge players opening the bidding to discover strengths of the other's
hand, the parties put forward their own, usually disposable, candidates to
test how their members would vote on a whip.
It was therefore virtually meaningless that the candidate who garnered the
most votes was Mr Giorgio Di Giuseppe, an insignificant Christian Democrat
and among the least supported was a politician with a reasonable chance of
success, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the republic's interim president. Simply the
Christian Democrats possessed the largest number of votes and the
republicans are one of the smallest parties.
Mr De Giuseppe, a worthy southern back bencher, was drafted on the day as
the Christian Democrats flag bearer after the party had failed to decide
among its various factions whom to back and what alliances to form. The 296
votes he chalked up were for the party not him.
The parties' heavyweights like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime
minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the secretary, held back to study form. Mr
Andreotti, ever the master of ambiguity, sat hunched in his seat - not a
trace of emotion to suggest the presidency remains his final ambition after
40 years in government.
Every other party heavily backed its own players as expected. Such was the
predictability of the first round that only a handful of deputies bothered
to remain in the vast ornate parliament chamber to hear the results
announced. Most were already milling in the main bar (which looked like the
saloon of a transatlantic liner) or trading alliances behind closed doors.
The party bosses appear to have decided to play for time until the fourth
round and after when the two thirds majority of 676 votes alters to a simple
majority of 508. This phase is not likely to begin until Friday.
The main problem with the election process is that the outoing four party
coalition lacks a convincing majority and is uncertain whether to plump for
a well known figure of their own in the hope of finding other allies. The
joker in the pack remains the populist Lombard League with 80 decisive
votes.
The Leagues abstained in protest at their exclusion from the choice of 58
regional councillors chosen to vote with the two chambers.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Pay row worsens in Germany: Public workers set to reject
strike deal as engineering talks break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WIDENING German pay row worsened last night as public sector workers
seemed set to reject a strike settlement and key talks to avert stoppages in
the engineering industry broke down.
The vote by public sector workers, to be announced today, seemed certain to
upset the deal accepted by union leaders last week after an 11-day strike.
It could herald a new stoppage, although this is not certain.
The deadlock in the engineering talks and the public sector workers'
defiance show the deep concern in Germany at the costs of unification with
the former communist east Germany in 1990.
In the engineering dispute, leaders of the powerful IG Metall union met
employers for regional talks in Frankfurt yesterday, but the talks collapsed
without a new pay offer being made.
As a result, the union leadership in the state of Hesse today will declare
the negotiations failed and call a ballot to clear the way for a strike from
May 25. Another last-ditch effort to reach agreement will come today in the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
But so far engineering employers in all regions have refused to raise their
3.3 per cent offer. The union originally claimed 9.5 per cent, but has since
moderated its stand, saying it will not accept a deal below 6 per cent.
Public sector union leaders last week accepted a 5.4 per cent deal, wrung
out of the Bonn government and other state and local authorities by a wave
of strikes that disrupted transport, rubbish collection and other public
services. The deal seemed last night to have run into trouble with members
of the biggest public sector union, the oTV, although two smaller public
sector unions - the white-collar DAG and the railway workers' GdED - have
approved it.
The vote among 470,000 affected members of oTV was forecast last night to be
only 40 per cent in favour - well short of the 50 per cent needed for
endorsement under the union's rules. The union executive was meeting to
decide its response.
While it looks increasingly likely that IG Metall will call out engineering
workers on strike from May 25 - probably precipitating a lock-out by
employers - the chances of a simultaneous resumption of the public sector
strike are much less.
As for the engineering workers, the two sides seem to be dug in for a long
struggle. Mr Karl Kronawitter, Frankfurt district leader of IG Metall, said
the union was not prepared to settle for anything less than the public
sector workers' award.
Mr Walter Schlotfeldt, the employers' chief negotiator in Hesse, and a board
member of Opel, the motor manufacturer, said the union attitude was simply
'not acceptable'.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Business leaders say Tecs on brink of collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL training structure is on a 'knife-edge' and may collapse unless
the government gives greater freedom from Whitehall interference to the
1,000 business leaders responsible for running it.
A confidential memorandum to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
from leaders of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils warns that without
'major reform' the 1,000 senior executives running the Tecs 'will simply
walk away'.
'There will be no mass protest,' says the memo from G10, the body which
represents Tecs to government. 'But their effectiveness will drain away into
the sand of inertia'.
The Tec leaders are scathing about the extent of Whitehall bureaucracy and
the absence of a clear cross-government approach to training. They say that
Tec successes are now jeopardised by 'a welter of administrative procedures'
and cite interference in their accounting and business methods from
Department of Employment officials.
They are particularly anxious to win more discretion in the way they manage
the two main training programmes: Youth Training, which provides up to two
years' training for 300,000 under 18s, and Employment Training, which
provides up to one year's training for 149,000 long-term unemployed adults.
Very few of these trainees currently go on to jobs.
They doubt whether it is cost effective to retain the existing guarantees of
a place on either ET or YT and claim it cannot be done without additional
funding.
The document continues: 'There is a conflict between the strategic focus of
national targets . . . and the pressure of the guarantee for unemployed
young people on the other. There must be proper public funding to meet this
guarantee without seriously eroding the longer-term build up of national
skill levels.'
The issues of targets and flexibility will come to a head next week in talks
between Tec leaders and Mrs Shephard. She may be ready to give some ground
if it does not involve abandoning the training guarantees. Loosening these
would be controversial and might raise headline unemployment. Today, the
unemployment figure for April is expected to rise by about 25,000.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, said more flexibility for Tecs
might be desirable but 'it would be disgraceful if there were any reduction
in help for the growing numbers of unemployed'.
The Tec leaders want tax breaks for companies meeting the demanding
Investors in People training standard. Only 50 companies have done so. They
also want much greater Tec involvement in the careers service, currently run
by local authorities.

FT  14 MAY 92 / Brussels approves energy tax to fight global warming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday approved its controversial draft directive
to tax energy to combat global warming.
EC figures indicate that the tax would have its biggest impact on industry
and power station operators. It would result in a rise in the price of
petrol and diesel fuel by the year 2000 of 6 per cent and 11 per cent
respectively.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, hailed yesterday's
action as 'a historical turning point'. But the Commission made the
introduction of the tax conditional on the US and Japan adopting similar
measures to curb carbon dioxide emissions.
This prompted claims by environmentalists that Brussels had all but shelved
the measure.
However, Mr di Meana warned that if the US rejected consideration of a
similar strategy at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in three weeks' time,
the EC might press ahead with a modified version of the tax.
Mr Ripa di Meana said the Commission proposal was revolutionary: 'This is
the first time price and market instruments have been incorporated for the
defence of the environment in such an extensive manner.'
If approved and applied by the 12, the tax would start at Dollars 3 a barrel
of oil equivalent in 1993, rising Dollars 1 a year to reach Dollars 10 a
barrel in 2000, by when the EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at
1990 levels.
The levy would fall half on the fuel content of all non-renewable energy and
half on its carbon content, and would be balanced by tax reductions in other
areas.
Brussels reckons that economic growth would be affected only marginally,
dropping by between 0.04 and 0.2 per cent a year under the full tax, with
additional price rises of between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent a year.
The draft directive seeks to protect the competitive position of European
industry if the EC's partners fail to introduce similar measures. These
include exemptions for energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, steel,
cement and paper.
In addition, member states in particular economic difficulties could reduce
the tax level, and/or get EC funding to help them implement it.
The safeguards were intended by Mr Ripa di Meana to enable the EC to go
ahead unilaterally.
Now, however, the decision to await the response of a US administration
which has ruled out fiscal means to fight the build-up of greenhouse gases,
appears to have handed Washington the power to veto the EC going ahead.
The tax as framed should now get endorsement in principle from the 12 at the
council of environment ministers on May 26.

Italy's presidential election began with scuffles yesterday when neo-fascist
MPs, shouting 'thieves', tried to storm the benches of Italy's largest
party, the ruling Christian Democrats. Members of parliament traded blows
before voting began. Against the background of a bribery scandal which has
hit all the main parties, 1,014 electors drawn from the two parliamentary
chambers and Italy's 20 regions must choose a new head of state before a new
government can be formed. A result is not expected before Friday night.

FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury produces the goods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPARKLING results from J. Sainsbury had the company in the unusual position
of trying to persuade analysts to be cautious about upgrading their
forecasts. The shares were the best performers in the FT-SE Index, climbing
20 to 459p in brisk turnover of 7m.
A combination of increased sales, tight cost control and productivity
improvements gave the stores group a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits,
and the dividend payment was lifted from 7.27p to 8.25p.
Mr Bill Currie at BZW said: 'These were really outstanding figures.
Sales-led growth is the best quality type of results a company can deliver.'
He is now forecasting Pounds 735m for 1992-93, a rise of Pounds 15m.
Goldman Sachs has improved its forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 730m. Its
food retailing analyst Mr Philip Dorgan was equally impressed. 'In this type
of trading environment, who else can match a 20 per cent dividend increase,'
he asked.
Climbing in sympathy were Argyll Group, ahead 5 at 365p, and Tesco, up 6 1/2
at 290 1/2 p.
GRE active
The return of some very whiskery bid talk lifted Guardian Royal Exchange in
early trading. The spark for the talk was speculation that a large line of
stock had been bought at a premium to the market price early in the morning.
The alleged buyer was Axa Midi, the French insurer, which is casting its eye
around at the moment. Apart from a block of 1.4m shares dealt at 163p,
however, there were no significant single trades in GRE and an analyst
commented: 'As Axa is looking for a life business in the US, I do not see
why it should be keen on a UK composite as well.'
Sense prevailed and, in spite of a bullish annual statement, the shares,
which had been 7 ahead at one stage, closed unchanged at 158p.
BAe recommended
British Aerospace was boosted by several broker recommendations. The stock
strengthened 11 to 366p, with turnover reaching 5.3m, as County NatWest,
Smith New Court and long-term bear Strauss Turnbull urged investors to buy
the shares.
The brokers cited the high 9.5 per cent yield of the shares, the company's
improved financial position due to revenue from the Al-Yamamah Saudi defence
contract on which BAe is the lead contractor, and the new management at the
group.
Both Strauss and County advised investors to switch into BAe from
Rolls-Royce, which left the latter 3 1/2 lower at 165p on turnover of 5.7m.
County reduced its 1993 forecast for Rolls-Royce by Pounds 25m to Pounds
175m and blamed the delay in the recovery of the spares business for the
cut.
A cash call from BICC was viewed positively by the market, as the
electricals group said it would use the money to make acquisitions in the
cable industry. BICC intends to raise Pounds 154m by a one-for-five rights
issue at 285p per share.
The group has underperformed the market in recent months, with many analysts
critical of its property development business. Yesterday's response was seen
as one of relief that the group was planning to return to its core business.
The shares gained 9 to 356p in heavy turnover of 10m.
Part of the money - believed to be about Pounds 50m - has been earmarked to
buy a US cable business. The remainder is thought to be allocated between a
further purchase, this time in Europe, and investment in plant in eastern
Europe.
A strong two-way pull in Vodafone kept the stock active, the shares firming
2 1/2 to 373 1/2 p. BT fully-paid gained 6 to 353p, Tuesday's buy note from
SG Warburg raising sentiment.
Hotel group Forte put on 7 to 253p after recent underperformance and also on
reflection that the sector may at last have bottomed out after Vaux's
figures on Tuesday.
In spite of reports of discounting among the holiday groups, Owners Abroad
rose 4 to 108 1/2 p, helped by a buy note from County NatWest. Analyst Ms
Lisa Gordon reported Owners to be slightly ahead of competitors such as
Airtours and Thompson in sales for this year. Airtours shed 5 to 308p.
Composite insurers were strong, helped by comment at the Smith New Court
morning meeting. Smith insurance analyst Mr Steven Bird argued that
companies should only be trading at a discount to net asset value (nav) if
their assets are not working for them.
Smith particularly likes Sun Alliance, which rose 6 to 330p, and Commercial
Union, up 7 before drifting to close just slightly ahead at 501p.
A straightforward annual meeting from SmithKline Beecham was not enough to
put any pep into the shares. They retreated 13 to 883p in spite of approval
for a share split later in the summer.
Fisons, languishing under the uncertainty surrounding reapproval for two of
its products in the US, slipped 11 to 363p.
Amber Day, the discount stores chain, improved 2 to 75p as the company said
it had issued a libel writ against the Sunday Express, and explained points
raised by the article. The shares, which have been vulnerable to bear raids,
had weakened 10 in the first two days of this week.
Three acquisitions financed by a Pounds 23.9m rights issue were announced by
Transfer Technology Group. The shares put on 2 to 485p.
Avon Rubber forged ahead 24 to 459p after reporting interim figures above
expectations and an optimistic trading statement.
Lucas Industries closed 2 lower at 146p. Standard and Poor's, the US credit
rating agency, yesterday lowered the commercial paper rating of Lucas in
both the UK and US from A1 to A2, citing a reduction in profits.

FT  14 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Elections bring changes in fortune -
But the Easter holidays kept turnover low in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Election fever coursed through Europe last month but the results had
contrasting repercussions in the Italian and the UK stock markets. In
general, volume was subdued, with Easter and May Day creating a holiday mood
which extended for nearly two weeks.
The return of the Conservative party to government in the UK was doubly
welcomed by the market, which had been battening down the hatches, either
for the uncertainty of a coalition or the unknown of a Labour
administration. Utilities, which had been depressed by fears of
renationalisation, attracted very heavy buying.
Following an initial boost immediately after the general election result,
investors settled down to wait for some real corporate stimulus. This was
not long in coming as Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation launched a
Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland Bank, soon followed by a counter-offer from
Lloyds Bank. Signs that an end to the recession might be in sight also
lifted sentiment.
Lacking a government of any sort, Italy free-wheeled and the manifest rise
in April was due to an exceptionally weak March, when volume had been
depressed by uncertainty about the outcome of the elections.
According to Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, which supplies the data,
April volume was nearly 9 per cent down on the average of the previous three
months, while trading on Seaq International in London Spain continued to
underperform the rest of Europe, with daily average turnover a very modest
Pta7bn, although activity was restrained by the Semana Santa holiday
preceding Easter. According to James Capel, activity was depressed by high
interest rates, a lack of foreign interest, and the continued growth of
mutual funds which took money out of equities. There is little prospect of
an upturn, it says, until interest rates are reduced.
General expectations are that today's Spanish April inflation data will
reveal only a small increase over March, giving further encouragement for
the cut in interest rates which could get the equity market going again.
However, Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe in London believes Spain is
unlikely to follow the UK and France in easing monetary policy in the short
term. He expects the annual inflation rate to exceed the government's target
and is currently forecasting a 6.6 per cent rate.
The prospect of strikes in the public service sector in Germany, which began
at the end of the month, was taken calmly by the market.
Car manufacturers provided one of the sectors which performed well during
the month, following the announcement by Daimler that it would increase its
1992 dividend by DM1 to DM13 and positive forecasts for increased sales of
new vehicles.
